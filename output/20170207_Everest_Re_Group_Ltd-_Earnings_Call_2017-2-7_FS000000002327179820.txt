MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Call of Everest Re
Group Ltd. Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference
over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Elizabeth B. Farrell

{BIO 1986541 <GO>}

Thank you, Jessica. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's fourth quarter and
full year earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the
company's President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer;
John Doucette, our President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino,
President of North America Insurance Operations.
Before I begin I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive
disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that
statements made during today's call which are forward-looking in nature, such as

Now let me turn the call over to Dom.

Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Thank you, Beth, and good morning to all. We're pleased to provide our final report for
the 2016 year where we closed the year with a record fourth quarter and an industry
leading 13% ROE for the year. There are many moving pieces of those results which my
colleagues will take you through, but let me highlight a few key themes.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the quarter and a year that saw a heightened level of cat activity relative to the prior
year, yet the overall impact of these events was easily absorbed into our results given the
benefits of our diversified global platform that provides for premium across many
geographies and lines. Notably, we reached a new high this year with over $6 billion of
gross premium written. In addition, we realized the benefit of sizeable reserve
redundancies this quarter, a reflection of our conservative reserving practices which we
have been pointing to for some time now.
While we had sizeable reserve releases from our reinsurance portfolio, our insurance
portfolio did experience some unfavorable lost reserve development, but this was largely
isolated to construction defect claims arising out of run-off books of business. The size of
the charge this year reflects our best effort to fully fund these liabilities and put this
behind us.
We also topped up our specialist reserves. This reserve addition is not the result of any
change we have experienced in the underlying claims, but rather reflects a re-allocation of
reserves to a segment that is fraught with uncertainty.
Despite all of these reserve movements, the net result was a positive $209 million to the
full year earnings. As a result of these reserve savings, and frankly many other important
factors, our core operations have done very well as you will note in the numbers. Overall,
Reinsurance generated an underwriting gain of over $900 million, bettering last year's
number by almost $40 million.
While it is a challenged market from a rate perspective, as seen in the top line, we
continue to expand our product set, shifting our risk appetite to achieve better riskadjusted returns. These achievements are not one-off. There is a consistency to our
performance relative to the market where our returns on capital have measurably
outperformed. Albeit, while returns are creeping down as a result of market conditions, I
think it is pretty clear that the overall market will reach it's breaking point before us.
On the insurance front, we remained extremely satisfied with our progress. Premium
growth, excluding our crop business which was sold earlier this year, has been in excess of
Page 2 of 24

FINAL

20% due to new product and business launches. The benefits of these increased writings
have not yet been fully captured due to the lag in earned premium. The
underperformance in 2016 reflects this lag in earned premium, and its impact on the
expense ratio as well as the reserve adjustments I previously mentioned. However, we
remain confident of the new business that will come through earnings and the year to
come to outperform the historical record.
Why this optimism in such a tough market for both reinsurance and insurance? First, the
inevitable law of gravity and the race to the bottom; that is one race we don't intend to
win, and already have shown we are far behind. Based on industry returns relative to cost
of capital, the race is almost over. That race includes third party capital where a future of
higher investment rates will cause those markets to raise their targets.
Second, the scale of our organization and scope of our relationships allows us the
opportunity to selectively grow and introduce our new products and businesses.
Finally, great people and a culture that inspires smart underwriting and risk selection, with
an eye towards being creative and entrepreneurial in everything we do. A lean
organization that allows us to be nimble and quick to the right trade in the most expenseefficient way possible.

Bloomberg Transcript

These are the qualities we continue to emphasize, and that will continue to generate
market-leading returns.
Thank you, and now to Craig for the financial highlights.

Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Thank you, Dom, and good morning, everyone. Everest had an excellent end to 2016 and
a record quarter of earnings with net income of $374 million, helped by reserve releases
that impacted both current and prior years. This compares to net income of $357 million
for the fourth quarter of 2015.
Net income for the year was $996 million compared to $978 million in 2015. After-tax
operating income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $363 million compared to $353
million in 2015. For the year, operating income was $993 million compared to $1.1 billion in
2015. The primary differences were catastrophe losses and foreign exchange, partially
offset by favorable reserve releases.
The overall underwriting gain for the group was $689 million for the year compared to an
underwriting gain of $787 million for 2015. The results reflect a slight increase in the overall
current year attritional combined ratio of 85.5%, up from 84.8% last year. This attritional
measure increase of less than 1 point reflects a higher expense ratio as we anticipated
with the build-out of the insurance platforms and our Lloyd's Syndicate.

FINAL

In the fourth quarter Everest saw $185 million of gross current year catastrophe losses. Of
the total, $150 million related to losses from Hurricane Matthew, $20 million related to
earthquake activity in New Zealand, and $15 million related to the Tennessee wildfires. Net
of reinsurance, the current quarter catastrophe losses amounted to $169 million.
The fourth quarter of 2016 also included favorable development on prior cat losses
largely from the 2015 year. Therefore, net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $150
million. Net catastrophe losses for the year were $301 million in 2016 compared to $54
million in 2015. For 2016, gross catastrophe losses were $420 million but were offset by
reinsurance and $87 million of favorable development on prior year cat losses primarily
from the 2015 Chile earthquake and U.S. storm events, of 2013 U.S. storms and Toronto
flooding, and the 2011 Japan earthquake.
Our reported combined ratio was 87.0% for the year 2016 compared to 85.1% in 2015.
The 2016 commission ratio of 22.3% was essentially flat compared to 2015. Our expense
ratio of 5.7% for the year is up from 4.8% in 2015. The expense ratio for the Reinsurance
segments remained low at 3.1% while the overall expense ratio was influenced by the
build-out of our insurance segment. Everest maintains one of the lowest internal expense
ratios in the industry; this is a strategic competitive advantage for Everest.

Bloomberg Transcript

On reserves, we completed our annual loss reserve studies. The results of the study has
indicated that overall reserves remained adequate. In the fourth quarter we booked $205
million of favorable prior year reserve development; this included prior period
development in the insurance segment and for asbestos, which was more than offset by
favorable reserve development in the Reinsurance segments.
The $160 million of prior year reserve development in the insurance segment during the
quarter, as referenced by Dom, is largely related to construction liability and umbrella
program business. These run-off programs were discontinued by the company several
years ago. The $365 million of favorable prior year development in the Reinsurance
segments reflected $419 million of favorable development, partially offset by a $54 million
increase in asbestos and environmental reserves to replenish our position at the
beginning of the year.
The $419 million of Reinsurance's favorable development during the quarter is mostly
related to property and short-tail business both in the United States and internationally.
These redundancies have developed over time, but we don't react until the position
becomes more mature. We continue to hold our loss reserve estimates for the more
recent years.
For investments, pre-tax investment income was $115 million for the quarter and $473
million for the year on our $17.5 billion investment portfolio. Investment income for the
year remained flat compared to 2015, which was better than expected. We've been able
to maintain investment yield without a dramatic shift in the overall investment portfolio.
The recent rise in interest rates drove bond prices down and had a negative impact to
book value during the quarter related to the unrealized capital losses in our bond

FINAL

portfolio. However, this increase and the expected rise in interest rates during 2017 will
have a positive impact on the net investment income over time. The pre-tax yield on the
overall portfolio was 2.8%, and duration remained at just over three years.
Other income and expense included $21 million of foreign exchange losses for the 2016
year compared to $61 million of foreign exchange gains in 2015. Both of these results are
unusual and represented $82 million of pre-tax swing year-over-year. The 2016 foreign
exchange losses resulted from the relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other
world currencies, primarily the British pound. Overall, we maintain an economic neutral
position with respect to foreign exchange, matching assets and liabilities in most major
world currencies.
Other income also included $11 million of earnings and fees from Mt. Logan Re for the
year 2016 compared to $28 million in 2015. The decline in 2016 essentially represents the
higher level of catastrophe losses in 2016 and the corresponding reduction in incentive or
profit sharing fees.

Bloomberg Transcript

On income taxes, the 2016 operating income effective tax rate was 10.3%. This effective
tax rate for the year was lower than our expectations for the year. The tax rate was lower
due to the amount and geographic region of the income associated with the loss reserve
releases in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we closed a U.S. tax audit during the quarter
that allowed the utilization of foreign tax credits from the years 2009 through 2012. These
credits reduced the effective tax rate by about two points.
Strong cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $1.4 billion for the year up, $276
million compared to 2015. This is primarily due to our continued premium growth.
Shareholder's equity for the group was $8.1 billion at the end of 2016, up $467 million or
6% over year end 2015; this was after taking into account capital return through $386
million of share buybacks and $195 million of dividends paid in 2016.
The company announced a 9% increase to its regular quarterly dividend and paid $1.25
per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Book value per share increased 11% to $197.45
from $178.21 at year end 2015, generating 13% growth in shareholder value, including
dividends.
Our strong capital balance leaves us well-positioned for business opportunities as well as
continuing share repurchases. Thank you.
And now, John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.

John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Thank you. Craig. Good morning. We are pleased to report an outstanding quarter and a
record year with $903 million of reinsurance underwriting profit, despite catastrophe
activity. Our earnings reflect our strengthening position in the global reinsurance market
and are a testament to our continued disciplined efforts to build a diverse and profitable
portfolio.

FINAL

Globally, rates were under pressure except where material catastrophes occurred such as
Canada. Our position as a large global, nimble, highly-rated, and longstanding reinsurer
allows us to successfully underwrite through this tough rating environment to grow
profitable business and once again to achieve market-beating results.
Before discussing renewals, here is some color on the fourth quarter and 2016 results.
Total gross written premium for the fourth quarter was $1.1 billion, a decrease of 1%
compared to last year, but flat on a constant dollar basis. Year-to-date, global reinsurance
premiums of $4.2 billion were down 3%, but flat after eliminating the currency impacts.

Bloomberg Transcript

For the quarter, the loss ratio increased to 36.3% from 33% in prior Q4 and included 12.5
points of cat losses and also about 5 points of asbestos strengthening, both of which
were more than offset by 38 points of favorable prior year reserve releases. The impact
of fourth quarter cats was $139 million, which included $158 million from Hurricane
Matthew, the Q4 New Zealand earthquake, and the Tennessee fires, offset by reductions
of $19 million for prior year cat events. The favorable prior year reserve development
emanated across the portfolio, weighted towards our shorter-tail lines. The level of these
releases demonstrates the strength and diversity of our global portfolio, the foundation
for our strong balance sheet.
For the full year 2016, our reinsurance loss ratio improved from 50.6% a year ago to
50.1%. Excluding cats and prior year development, the current year attritional loss ratio
was down slightly to 53.5%. Each year was impacted by a significant risk loss, with 2016
having $40 million of loss for the Jubilee oil platform, and 2015 having $60 million for the
Tianjin, China explosion. Note, in 2016, our prior year reserve adjustment reflected the
release of $43 million of that $60 million Tianjin loss estimate.
The 2016 reported combined ratio and the 2016 attritional combined ratio, excluding cats
and prior year development, were also lower relative to the prior year, reflecting our
disciplined underwriting approach and rigorous expense management.
Bottom line, our reinsurance profit produced an all-time high underwriting profit of $429
million in the fourth quarter and $903 million for the full year 2016, placing us among the
best performers in the reinsurance industry.
We believe we have one of the very best reinsurance teams in the industry. In addition to
a very strong technical staff, we have talented, experienced, smart underwriters who
know their markets and clients well and with outstanding skills to underwrite risks, build
profitable books, and grow the long-term franchise, collectively enabling Everest to
continue to outperform the market.
In our U.S. Reinsurance segment, 2016 gross written premium was down slightly to $2.1
billion. Changes year-over-year were caused by a decrease in our property writings as we
walked away from a significant volume of underpriced pro-rata business. However, this
was offset by our new strategic property insurance deal and the continued growth in
alternative risk products, including credit-related business such as mortgage reinsurance.

FINAL

Our alternative risk capabilities remain a differentiating bright spot in a difficult market
where more sophisticated clients increasingly seek bespoke products for capital release,
unique risks and, often, multiple lines of business. Everest's lean and agile operations
coupled with our broad experience and expertise quickly provides solutions to both our
long-term trusted partners and new clients seeking a creative solution.
The 2016 combined ratio for the U.S. Reinsurance segment was up 6.6 points, while the
accident year attritional combined ratio of 78.4% was up only 2 points. The attritional
increase, in large part, was caused by the increased crop reinsurance writings, which
generally requires less capital to write, but produces a slightly higher combined ratio.
Our International Reinsurance segment premium was $1.2 billion, down 8% for the year,
but only 5% on a constant dollar basis. Lower premium across many of our regions, Latin
America, Middle East, Africa, and Asia, was due to both rate pressure and termination of
underpriced business. For 2016, this segment produced $314 million of underwriting profit,
up 86% over the prior year, despite increased catastrophes. This was largely due to a
significant level of current and prior year reserve releases, highlighting the conservatism in
our reserving process.

Bloomberg Transcript

Excluding cats and prior year losses, the attritional combined ratio for 2016 was down 4
points to 80.4%, with the improvement due to the impact of Tianjin losses in 2015 and a
lower level of attritional cat losses, catastrophes that do not breach our $10 million
threshold to be classified as a cat in 2016.
Our Bermuda segment premium was $890 million, up 1% for the year, but on a constant
dollar basis actually had growth of 5%, driven primarily by casualty reinsurance. The
combined ratio was up about a 1 point; but excluding cats and prior-year development,
the accident year attritional loss ratio was down 2.4 points to 89%. This was the result of
changes in business mix and the impact of the Tianjin loss in 2015.
Moving on to the 1/1 renewals, Everest was well-positioned to withstand the market
pressures. Globally, our clients are demanding solutions that address their operational
breadth, the increasingly complex capital requirements, and unusual risks. We have the
expertise, responsiveness, and capital to meet these demands quickly, aided by our
unique and client-focused operational structure, geographic and product breadth, and
diverse capital sources including Mt. Logan, Kilimanjaro, catastrophe bonds, and other
hedges.
In the property market, we continue to perform well in the face of heavy competition.
Facilitated by robust relationships, we re-underwrote our property portfolio substantially
at 1/1, re-allocating capacity from underpriced business to more attractive layers and
programs while supporting our core clients and newly marketed programs. We're also
exploring our new structures that will strengthen our core client relationships well into the
future.
Overall, the market property rates were down at 1/1 on average mid-single digits across
most markets, unaffected by material losses. Our portfolio fared better than that, where
Page 7 of 24

Date: 2017-02-07

FINAL

the combined ratio of our 1/1 renewal portfolio had modest slippage of less than 1 point
compared to last year's portfolio. In our casualty markets, the 1/1 pressures were mixed,
with the reinsurance terms easing somewhat, but economics in certain underlying
segments are still tracking in the long direction.
We achieved improvements on classes with material losses, and increasingly focused on
structured and credit-related deals. Our London operations saw excess of loss rates
decline from 2.5% to 5%, although some other international markets are seeing
decreases of 5% to 10%. On the positive side, Solvency II is causing a demand uptick in
London and European markets, specifically the pro-rata structures.
Overall, Everest reinsurance operations remain optimally diversified by product,
distribution, geography, client mix, and capital sources, giving us the ability to quickly
identify and move from market weaknesses to market opportunity. We recognize the
markets may face continued pressure from the supply-demand imbalances; but as
reflected in our results, we are well-equipped to adapt and excel in the new reinsurance
world order.
Thank you, and now I will turn it over to Jon to review our insurance operations.

Jonathan M. Zaffino

{BIO 16652236 <GO>}

Thanks, John, and good morning. 2016 was a transformative year for the Everest global
insurance operations. The year finished on a strong note despite the impact to
profitability from elevated levels of natural catastrophe losses and, as you've heard from
Dom and Craig, prior year reserve development originating from one-off books of
business. Nonetheless, we're pleased with the underlying performance of our portfolio,
particularly so in a difficult trading environment.
Further, we continue to make significant progress on our journey to organically build a
world class, specialty diversified insurance organization. I will provide further commentary
on this progress later in my remarks. Similar to last quarter, due to the divestiture of
Heartland in late third quarter of 2016, I will be discussing our results excluding this
business. The full result of the Insurance segment, inclusive of Heartland, are covered in
our financial supplement released yesterday. Additionally, for reference, we have also
included a supplemental exhibit with the quarterly insurance results excluding Heartland.
For the full year 2016, the global insurance operations achieved record premium levels,
registering nearly $1.6 billion in gross written premium, an increase of $274 million or 21%
over 2015. It should be noted that this result exceeds 2015 gross written premium,
including the results of Heartland. This strong top line performance is an
acknowledgement of the value our clients, brokers, and insurers alike recognize in Everest
Insurance. Further contributing to this strong top line performance were nearly a dozen
new underwriting divisions that steadily contributed throughout the year.
For the full year these new divisions, which have been selectively added to the portfolio,
contributed nearly 7% of total 2016 gross written premiums. This represents over a $100
Page 8 of 24



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td

FINAL

million of new premium within desired segments and classes of business; a result we're
certainly encouraged by as many of these divisions are not yet a year old.
From the quarter, we registered $423 million of gross written premium, an increase of $89
million or 27% over the prior year period. This represents the eighth consecutive quarter
of growth for our operations. Each division within the North American segment
contributed to this growth, with the U.S., Canada, and asset and health teams each
growing in excess of 20%, along with meaningful contribution from our Lloyd's Syndicate.
We remain encouraged by this balanced contribution across the diversity of the
underwriting platform.
Net written premiums for the year were slightly over $1.3 billion, an increase of $180 million
or 16% over 2015. As discussed in prior calls, the net written premium growth slightly lags
gross written premium growth due to a marginally more conservative reinsurance position
we have taken to support our many new underwriting divisions. Over the quarter, net
written premium increased by $50 million or 17% over the prior year quarter, reflecting a
strong end to the year and solid momentum from all of our businesses.

Bloomberg Transcript

I do want make a quick comment as respect to net earned premiums in a quarter. Net
earned was down 14% due to the sale of Heartland and the accompanying of a loss
portfolio transfer of this business from the Insurance segment to the Reinsurance
segment. Again, excluding Heartland, earned premium was up 14%, which is directionally
similar to the trend in net written premium, however, slightly lags due to the significant
growth in the portfolio over the past couple of years.
Turning to the combined ratio, the GAAP combined ratio for the year, again excluding
Heartland, was a 116%. As we look back on 2016, there are two notable impacts to our
performance. First was the prior year development and various one-off books of business
principally related to construction defect exposures that contributed 14 points to our loss
ratio. Second, the Insurance results were impacted by a year of significant cat events
across North America from the Fort Mc Murray wildfire, a number of Texas hail events –
the worst experience over three decades – and finally Hurricane Matthew. These cat
events contributed slightly more than 4 points to our loss ratio in 2016.
Taking a look at the attritional results, the ongoing global insurance operations delivered a
97.9% combined ratio for the year, in line with our expectations, however elevated from
the 93.4% attritional from 2015. Let me break out some of the factors driving this
increase.
First, our expense ratio was 29.9% for the year which, again, is inclusive of the expenses
associated with the build-out of our U.S. and Lloyd's platforms, and is expected to
moderate as we continue our expansion. It should be noted that this expense ratio
remained very competitive within the specialty P&C environment. Second, for the full year,
the loss and loss expense ratio was 68% compared to 67.1% in 2015.
The slight deterioration in the attritional loss ratio for the year is attributable to a number
of factors, predominant among these are the adverse impacts of various non-cat weather
Page 9 of 24

FINAL

events in 2016, a slight deterioration in our U.S. auto book, and also some additional
pressure on the loss ratio due to the growth in our A&H segment, which carries a higher
loss ratio than our P&C products. That stated, we are very pleased with the ultimate result
of this book.
Let me now turn to offer some commentary on the performance of our major insurance
portfolios, again starting with the North America P&C book which is our largest business.
Year-over-year, the core P&C portfolio grew 15% or nearly a $174 million. The momentum
within our P&C operations steadily increased throughout the year, again reflective of our
significantly enhanced underwriting capabilities and increased market profile. In fact, the
fourth quarter represented the strongest performance of the year, registering growth of
21% compared to the comparable quarter in 2015.
We experienced meaningful growth in our short-tail portfolios and our casualty lines while
specialty grew more moderately. Further, our new business lines launched in the U.S.,
again, contributed nearly 11% to gross written premium in the quarter, a similar figure to
last quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our Accident and Health group also delivered another solid quarter of growth with a 44%
increase over the prior year comparable quarter. Our efforts to thoughtfully grow our
Medical Stop Loss segment within key geographies and business segments proved
successful. Our new A&H products also contributed to growth throughout the year, and
we anticipate this to continue. We have recruited very capable distribution partners, and
as a result expect to grow in the senior market segment into 2017.
Our Lloyd's operation also continued its expansion. The Syndicate contributed $10 million
to insurance growth in the quarter, building on the momentum from the third quarter.
While still early in its growth cycle, this platform, despite a difficult trading environment, is
performing as expected. For 2016 the Syndicate has delivered $45 million of premiums to
the Insurance segment, yet only $16 million of earned premium which, again, temporarily
impacts the expense ratio.
Turning to the operating environment, we see a similar picture to what we experienced
throughout much of 2016. With that stated, there is an early emergence of some trends
within various lines of business that we are watching closely. I'll comment on the dominant
lines of business starting with commercial auto which continues to be a challenging line of
business. Building on the prior three quarters of 2016, we again achieved positive rate
across commercial auto lines with a low double-digit mean increase for the quarter. Over
85% of our book is receiving rate increases in an attempt to address the frequency and
severity trends that we have experienced across the line. That stated, our exposure to
commercial auto is somewhat limited as this line of business represents less than 5% of
our overall P&P premium.
The primary general liability and umbrella markets continue to remain in a tight rate range
and are slightly positive for the year. As with the prior quarter and, really, all year, the
professional liability market remains competitive with rate decreases in the mid-singledigit range.

Page 10 of 24



FINAL

Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td

Let me spend a minute on the U.S. property market. This market remains very
competitive, however it is our sense that the market is trying to find the bottom on rates.
The elevated frequency of natural catastrophe losses are acting as a resistance towards
continued large decreases. Further, in many occupancies and geographies we believe the
industry has reached the juncture that there is simply no additional rate reduction to be
had. Perhaps this is driving the exit of some of capacity from the space, but we feel
there's a larger story here and we'll keep an eye on as we move forward. That stated, we
continue to find opportunities to deploy our capacity in a manner that meets our risk and
return objectives.
Finally, worker's compensation, our largest line of business by premium size, experienced
moderate rate pressure throughout the year in the mid-single-digit range, which was
largely expected. The favorable underwriting results in the largest work comp market,
California, were greeted with steady rate pressure throughout the year. Other markets
reacted similarly, although with moderately less rate pressure. So, again, the environment
trended predictably in 2016, and we expect much of the same with the exceptions noted
in 2017.

Bloomberg Transcript

Wrapping up, we're very pleased with the many efforts undertaken in 2016 to position us
for future success. We enter 2017 with our leadership team in place, our market profile
expanding, a portfolio aligned to our business objectives, and a significantly enhanced
operating platform. We're confident we'll carry our strong top line momentum into 2017 as
our many new underwriting initiatives continue to gain scale, both within North America
and at Lloyd's.
Yes, it remains a challenged operating environment, yet the grown diversity of our
platform, again with the top line expanding by over 20%, and a firmer handle on our
existing portfolio positions us well for the future.
With that, let me turn it back over to Beth for Q&A.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. First off, if you could just spend a little bit more time just – I know
throughout you guys have kind of said that you booked on some of these insurance
programs following on the reserve review kind of to give you confidence that you'd fully
address this. What are you booking the construction liability and umbrella programs to and

what really changed this year that gives you confidence that 12 months from today we
won't see another charge stemming from some of these run-off programs again?

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Elyse, this is Dom. Thank you for your question. I think each year when we've examined
these portfolios, we have been booking to what I would call the expected result from our
actuarial review, and I'll ask Craig or someone else to comment on what we're actually
booking it to.
And I didn't know if your question was a loss ratio question which I don't really think is
relevant, but perhaps this answers it. This year, after undertaking that reserve review,
frankly we asked ourselves the same question; we don't want to be sitting here next year
and year after and taking another charge. Of course, what drove the higher estimate this
year was just an increase of frequency and severity – an increase of frequency and
severity. So hopefully to combat this, in this year we selected in the upper range of the
actuarial estimate, so therefore we have some confidence that which is never an
absolute, but of course therefore we have some confidence that this should be behind
us.
And again keep in mind this is in the overall context of our overall reserve position. And I
know I sound like a broken record, but we have over 200 different reserve buckets, and
what we're most concerned about is our overall reserve adequacy at the balance sheet
level because this is clearly a run-off business; this is not a concern over our existing
portfolio. And as evidenced by the reserve release we had this year in addition to other
years, you can see that our overall reserve position is solid and, in fact, was redundant. So
that's what we're most concerned about, but to answer your more specific question, this
year we were a little higher in the range to give a sense of comfort that we can hopefully
put this to bed.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then as we think about the margin kind of outlook for your segments, I know
within the commentary you guys kind of pointed on the property reinsurance side a
slippage probably about 1 point on the combined ratio. How do you see the overall kind of
reinsurance margin just in context of tying it on what you see on the casualty side? And
also do you – I guess we should expect some kind of slippage on the combined ratio as
you bring the crop business to the reinsurance side. I'm just trying to kind of tie all your
commentary together to really how you see on the margin profile of the reinsurance book
in 2017.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, what we've been trying to – the message we've been trying to make sure everyone
understands is that this is a book of business that is not dependent upon property cat
business and, of course, what you've seen in our margins has been some shift in the
attritional and that shift in the attritional (42:22) still we're getting improvement as a result
of new products that we offer.

FINAL

So as John Doucette highlighted in his comments, diversifying it to different product lines
and geographies, more importantly product lines, so for example take credit reinsurance,
and more specifically mortgage reinsurance, those obviously are carrying much lower loss
ratio picks and better combined ratios. So that's helping offset some of the declines and
actually a business that we let go in the more traditional areas. So we're not necessarily
seeing any dramatic change in our attrition going into 2017.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then in terms of just capital return, I know you guys have always said you look
to return less than your earnings. Share repurchase, it seems like you guys do not buy
back any stock since your last call. So how do you kind of think about, I guess, just the level
of potential capital return for 2017, and anything's kind of changed on your capital return
philosophy over the last three months?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, nothing's changed Elyse, and part of the reason that you didn't see us do anything
last quarter, the fourth quarter, was on the fact that we had Hurricane Matthew sitting out
there, and clearly we had information, more precise information, so we've become a little
reluctant to be buying in shares given the fact that there's major events hanging out there
that we're not clear as to what the final outcome will be. So that's what was driving that.
But certainly, there has been no change in the way we manage capital. We have a very
good long-term track record of doing so. That, of course, gets balanced with what we see
as the future business opportunities and the need for capital, and I think we've been –
yes, we buy in less than earnings, growing our capital base, because we continue to see
new opportunities and that's – and we look at this from a very long-term perspective; it's
not just any one year, any one quarter for sure. And we will look out to more than just
what our projections are for book value currently or the current book value; we will look
out six months or so to determine what our threshold might be for buying in stock.
So essentially, it's a long way of saying no change in our philosophy in how we think about
capital management.

Thank you and good morning. First question on reserves. So the 2016 reserve release, it
was actually the largest in your history. And, Dom, you mentioned that since you came on
board you're taking probably more of a conservative reserve stance. So is that – the
question is really why now a suddenly big reserve release? Is it because the basic reserve
cushion build up over time, now you have to release it? And also how sustainable is that
reserve release is going forward?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Okay. Yes, Kai, I mean I have said several years now that we've taken a more conservative
view of picking the current loss year in terms of pick loss ratio, and that's frankly driven out
of some uncertainty as to, in the current market conditions, an increased level of
uncertainty. But that, of course, has resulted in some of those older years coming in
positively, and that we view as a good thing. What we tend to do is we handle the casualty
and the property; we hold a couple of years on casualty studies and we hold less years on
the property side, so this release reflects a release from few years ago, from accident
years of few years ago. And that will – that is kind of the process that we go through and
we'll continue to go down that path.
Our current – we still continue to feel that our current reserve position is very strong and
adequate. And I can't sit here and give a prediction as to what the level of reserve
releases are not might be into the future, but as I said we still remain very confident about
our reserve position.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

So the release mostly related short-tail lines in last few years and had not – sort of some
of the potentially long-tail lines you have booked since like 2010?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

I'm sorry, could you repeat that? You broke up a little bit on that question.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Yeah, I'm sorry. The question was is that reserve release is mostly related to short-tail line
of business rather than some long-tail line?

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Kai, the process has not changed over the years. As Dom mentioned, what we do is we
set a conservative loss pick and then over time we are slow to react to any favorable
development, but we're very quick to react to any unfavorable development. So what
you're seeing right now, most of what was released at this point in time are short-tail
business. So more than two years ago, short-tail lines and property lines of business was
what the majority of what was released.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

But there was some casualty in there.

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

There was.

FINAL

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

And I should also mention, because I know there's been a lot of focus on the insurance
adds we have to make, but it should be noted that we did have some – the current book
of business within insurance actually did produce redundancy coming through the results
in 2016. Net-net, it was a reserve add because of the construction defect and umbrella
that we highlighted earlier, but it should be pointed out that the current book of business
is beginning to produce some releases.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Great. Then second question on the insurance side. The 2016 attritional combined ratio is
97.9%. I just wonder, given your gross like projection, you're still growing the business,
expense ratio probably is still a little bit elevated and then there is a business mix shift,
some potential to your higher combined ratio. So do you see 2017, 2018, these attrition
loss ratio – combined ratio going to improve or going to deteriorate before it become
improving?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Our expectation is that it would improve. Again, just to highlight again the things that –
why I came in at that level, we had – some of it was A&H, the growth rate in A&H relative
to some of the other lines; we had some non-cat – heightened level of non-cat events in
2016 which drove that; and we had a little bit of auto frequency and severity that drove
that, which as Jonathan highlighted we've got lots of rate increase coming on that line of
business; and the earned premium catch-up to the written should begin to benefit the
results.
The expense ratio hasn't improved yet because we've actually accelerated some of our
business development efforts later in 2016, more so that we anticipated that we would
do. All are good things, but I would have expected the expense ratio to improve by now,
but it hasn't because of kind of an up level of investment relative to our initial plans.

Q - Kai Pan

Great. Well thank you so much for all the answers.

Hi. Good morning, and congrats on a good quarter. Just following-up on the insurance
business. What do you view as the underlying run rate combined ratio in the quarter ex
some of these one-time items that you outlined?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

FINAL

For 2016 it would've been in the mid-90s.

And is that in line with your target combined ratios in the segment or do you target
something lower?

A - Dominic James Addesso

We will be continuing to target something lower than that. We would expect improvement
in that over time.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

Everest Re benefit and are there implications from border adjustment for Everest Re?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

I know this is a question that's hot on everybody's mind, but it is a little difficult not
knowing what the final outcome would be to give you any view. But let me just say this: for
the last two years the – they really wouldn't – if you take in the tax, lower tax rate plus of
course border tax adjustment, it would've been very minimal impact, if any, on our overall
effective tax rate in the last two years. The bigger question comes in a year where cat
losses are – we do not expect that they're maybe even higher than expected; that's the
great unknown. But we have got different platforms globally that we could trigger and
different ways in which we could really underwrite business.
So it's not – I can't give you a clear answer on that, other than the fact that we don't think
that would have any meaningful impact at this point.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

And what would be there at all in 2018?

Q - Joshua D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

This – the increased expense spend associated with the build-out?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Are you – is that a Lloyd's question or an overall insurance question?

Q - Joshua D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

It's the 300 basis point gap between the 2016 expense ratio and the 2015 expense ratio,
and I take – I understand your reasons behind that. I'm wondering how long I should model
that to persist?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Okay. I would expect that to drift down slightly in 2017, and then frankly level out maybe
and slightly again in 2018, but then level out from there. I don't believe that we will get
back to our historical expense ratio because you have to remember that we now have a
different distribution model. So previously we were primarily an MGA-focused insurance
operation; today we're more of a direct brokerage operation which, by definition –
forgetting even the commission element of it, just a general expense ratio element of it –
requires different types of resources and different systems. So – and we'll not get back to
maybe what you would have seen historically from us.
Having said that, I think if you could – our expectation would be as we, even today, we
have a much better expense ratio than the industry. We expect that gap to remain.

Q - Joshua D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Okay. And I'm going to go through the 4Q 2015 transfers again, read about the insurance
reserve charge there. I can't remember exactly where the overlap is between where the
charge for this quarter than were charged for one year ago. Is there some whack-a-mole
sort of situation that while you've taken care of you think what's problematic that you saw
in 2016? Can there be other things that come out in 2017? Do we have some limits in
place that give us specific comfort? Or are you surprised one year later from the 2015
charges that you have these charges today?

a higher number back in 2015.

Q - Joshua D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. Of course.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Yeah. So there's a surprise. And, look, with reserves you never know what an increased
level of frequency or severity might, in fact, do to you. But as I mentioned, our other
pieces of our portfolio that are active are, in fact, running at – this past year, produced a
redundancy. So we're confident that those reserves are frankly in good order. But, again,
in the context of our overall balance sheet, our reserve position is quite strong, and I think
that applies to the various segments as well.
Even though I know I keep emphasizing the overall balance sheet, which is important and
worth emphasizing, we do go through each of our segments to make sure that we've got
positive reserve or a strong reserve position in each of those segments.

Q - Joshua D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And then finally I guess in terms of the Heartland premium coming in to the Reinsurance
segment. Given that you sort of explained the economics of Heartland as insurance

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

I'll let John into that. John.

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Good morning. This is John. So a couple of things. The strategic relationship we entered
as a reinsurance opportunity with the buyer of Heartland is – has a couple of advantages
for us. First of all it runs, we believe, to a meaningful improvement in expenses, and
because of just economies at scale that we were unable to achieve on our own book
given the size of the premium.
And then, secondly, we also get struggled in our insurance book to develop a broad,
diversified portfolio, and so individual localized weather events were causing more
problems for us and cause more volatility in the book as an insurance play. What we're
going to get is the benefit of a much, much larger book, a share of that book on a
reinsurance quota share basis.
So we think we're going to run through a better combined ratio meaningfully, and we think
there's going to be less volatility in the results.

And we will take our final question from Quentin McMillan with KBW. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks very much, guys. I just wanted to tie together something that you've historically
said versus what we saw today. So, Dom, you mentioned that 2016 is a heightened year
of cat loss activity. You had a little over $300 million in cat losses on a net basis, and then I
think Craig mentioned $420 million on a gross basis when we net out prior year cat losses.
But that $300 million number, it's about – it's a little under 6 points on the cat loss ratio,
and historically you guys have said that you expect about 10 points of cat losses in a
normal year.
So can you help sort of tie those thoughts together, of this being a heightened loss year
yet you were running much better than what that cat loss would indicate?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

I'm actually going to ask – I'm going to make a few comments and then I'll ask Jon to set a
comment on it as well. But also – but keep in mind that, yes, it was a heightened year.
Many of the losses though were low in the attachment point. A lot of the losses were
assumed by primary. And what is consistent with what you've said is through – over the
last couple of years, given risk-adjusted pricing and we want to maintain our level of riskadjusted pricing, we've moved attachment point, gotten off from certain things that we
didn't like the pricing on, and we believe that that's had an impact on our result relative to
what the overall level of cats were in the industry.
So I think that's just a general comment, and maybe John Doucette may have some –
something to add to that.
Page 19 of 24



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2017-02-07

FINAL

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Yeah. Quentin, I think – a couple of things. The reinsurance strategy, we continue to look to
how we can improve the book and deploy and take cat risk better and deploy and build a
better and better portfolio, and taking into account market conditions but also the buying
habits of local companies, regional companies, and global clients. So to the extent that we
are – the global client – take the global clients, to the extent that they're looking to do
more across the board and across multiple lines of business and multiple territories with
companies like Everest, we're deploying more cat capacity to them and that usually
means, given the retentions that they want to take in order to control the pricing of the
reinsurance program, they typically are protecting against the real major losses: very big
earth quakes, very big hurricanes, et cetera. And so that wouldn't necessarily impact us as
much in a year like this, with the exception of the Canadian wildfires and Hurricane
Matthew.
And then we also, as Dom said, we're trying to shift our book and we have been moving,
not in every case, but generally we've been moving up the tower; that also means it takes
larger losses to affect us. But then I would also highlight the different hedges that we have
in place, including Mt. Logan, and Mt. Logan continues to be a strategic platform for
Everest, and we saw some benefits from that in 2016 with recoveries that we saw from
both Matthew and Fort McMurray wildfire losses in Canada as well as some other smaller
losses around the group.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we think that that helps mitigate some of the cat loss activity that Everest faces on its
inward book of business through the various hedges that we have in place as well.

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

Great. That's very helpful. And just on a capital-related question. You guys paid out about
60% in the form of dividends and share purchases, and I know you don't have a specific
capital plan that you're going to guide us to. But how much of the remaining 40% of the
operating earnings that you produced was used to fund the strong growth in the
Insurance segment this year on Jonathan's side?

A - Jonathan M. Zaffino

{BIO 16652236 <GO>}

I am going to answer that as, really, an overall question as opposed to specifically to
Insurance. Overall, we still have about the same level of what we call excess excess
capital, and so all of the metrics that we use to measure what our economic capital needs
to be remain about the same. So that capital growth basically is supporting all of the lines
of business, both insurance and reinsurance, remembering that we're doing some
different things on the reinsurance side that consume different levels of capital.

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

Okay. Very helpful. And then sorry to sneak a last in, in terms of the investment portfolio.
Obviously there was a big move and you guys did have a mark-to-market loss as
everybody did – unrealized loss as everybody did in the quarter. But the yield in the
portfolio looked like it ticked up a little bit. Did you guys shift anything around and can you

Page 20 of 24



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2017-02-07

just talk about what the new money yield is versus where they – I believe Craig said that
portfolio pre-tax yield currently is 2.8%, so maybe versus that currently?

FINAL

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

This is Craig. Quentin, we did not make much of a shift. What we did do was shift it a little
bit, as I mentioned last quarter, and within the alternative capital, our alternative
investment buckets. But overall, the portfolio remains very stable, very high credit quality,
investment grade bonds makes up the majority of the portfolio, and then we have
alternative investments.
The new money rate that you're suggesting is about the same, about 2.8% compared to
what the current yield is at 2.8% as well.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

And the return, the yield that you're referencing, essentially what happened in the fourth
quarter, it all depends on timing of the limited partnership and alternative investment
income; and that can get a little lumpy. So I'm real pleased that frankly year-over-year
investment income was flat. We think that was a pretty terrific outcome.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, I still think the same factors are at play. Scale, being one of the more relevant
factors, continues to put pressure on many of our competitors to seek partners, and
that's not necessarily a bad thing. And I think that will continue to be the trend going
forward: scale and efficiency.
For us, as you know, our strategy remains the same. We're not a big fan of putting a ton
of goodwill in the books, and frankly acquisitions are difficult to – in our view, others have –

FINAL

certainly could have a different business model, but in our view acquisitions are difficult to
assimilate, and with it comes perhaps elements of the portfolio that you don't wish to be
engaged in. So it requires some remediation, and we think it's a lot cleaner to get the
talent that we think we can secure a good talent and build up a portfolio in the manner
and shape that we feel is most desirable. So that's kind of our continued strategy.
If there are things that we don't think we can build out on our own successfully, meaning
elements of different lines of business, very focused areas, we'd continue to look at
things, but I'm not giving it a high likelihood that you'd see something in that regard. But I
wouldn't rule it out completely.

...you just broke out a little bit. Yeah. So we write business all over the world, we write a

it's not material to us. So the short answer to your question is we watch that. We look at
the rates. We're probably a little less – we're probably a little more pessimistic on that
over the last couple of years, so we have not deployed that much capital in that
respective area. So we do not think it's material to us.

Great. Thanks. And last question. John, I was intrigued by your comment that you said that
you're exploring new structures, it'll strengthen kind of core client relationships well into

the future. Are you referring to kind of multi-year kind of reinsurance agreements? Can
you give us some examples of what you're talking about?

So we have – it really applies to a lot of different things. It applies to strategic relationships
that we're trying to build with some of our core clients. We've added some of those in
2016. We have somewhere between a half a dozen, and a dozen of these kind of core
strategic relationships. We're looking to expand that, and continue to deploy that where
we really become a strategic partner to the clients and not just a large reinsurer to them.
And that's worked out very well for us.
We continue to deploy and really holistically deploy capacity with the global clients, and
we see that as a big opportunity for us in the future as they want to trade more with
companies like Everest and less with others, either because of too much concentration
with some of the big directs or they want to narrow their reinsurance panels.

We're spending more time really strategizing about how we, as one of the very largest
broker market reinsurers how we can grow more with the brokers in the reinsurance area,
and we think that's something that will be to the benefit of both of us, and we expect to
continue to make headway on that in different products that they have, different
initiatives, and different strategies with that going forward.
And then frankly just a lot of these new alternatives really building out what we call the
non-traditional space where there's product, new products, new distribution, new clients,
and we're making some good headway there, both hiring people, developing resources
internally, and have had recently some few nice wins in that space. And we look to
continue to deploy that going forward.

Thank you, Brian, and thank – thanks to all for participating in this morning's call. Apologies
for going a little longer, but we had the questions in queue. We obviously were pleased
with our performance this past year, and we recognize, as do you, that it's a very
challenging market. But we're still quite confident that we can outperform on a relative
basis and an absolute basis.
My colleagues here this morning kind of outlined some of the new things we're doing,
and I've highlighted our balance sheet strength, the reserve position which certainly
bodes well for the future, so we're very confident that we can continue to perform well.
And that's not without taking an increased level of risk; it's continuing to do what we do.
It's underwrite through the different parts of the cycle and diversifying, diversifying into
new products and new areas, and continue to expand our franchise, in particular expand
the insurance franchise which we think is one of the ways forward as well as product
diversification on the reinsurance side.
