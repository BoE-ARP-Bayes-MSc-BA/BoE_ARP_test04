Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Sanlam Limited Four-Month
Operational Update Conference Call. All participants are currently in listen-only mode and
there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions later during the conference. Please
also note that this call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ian Kirk. Please go ahead, sir.

Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for participating on
the conference call. I'm joined in the call by Finance Director, Heinie Werth; Anton
Gildenhuys, Chief Actuary and Risk Officer; Patrick Hartnic, Head of Investor Relations.
Wikus Olivier is also here.
Let me first deal with the overview of the results. We released detailed results for the
four-month period earlier this afternoon. I just like to highlight a few points before we
proceed to the questions.
Despite challenging operating conditions which we set out in some detail across various
areas of the business in the operational update, the group achieved satisfactory overall
results particularly in the South African businesses given the condition.

Good growth in recurring premium risk products and commensurate value of new
business was particularly pleasing. And it was achieved across Sanlam Sky, SPF middle
income market and Sanlam Employee Benefits. And all of those are strategic focus areas
and that gains – that continue to gain good traction.

FINAL

Unfortunately single premium, lump-sum savings new business continued to disappoint in
an uncertain environment where investor and consumer confidence is very low.
Considerable confidence (00:02:02) experience, post the cabinet reshuffle and the
consequent ratings downgrade. But the pressure was already evident at (00:02:14) during
2016. It's now being further solved in the Sanlam Investments Retail business and in
Sanlam Private Wealth.
As I mentioned in the 2016 annual results announcement, the performance outside of
South Africa, the metrics there are negatively impacted in 2017 from a stronger average
rand exchange rate that's cost us about 2% on the bottom line.

Bloomberg Transcript

Though we've seen an improvement from many of the businesses outside South Africa,
there are a few that are still not living up to expectations, our expectations, and that's
something that we will be attending to.
Some of the telling pictures of the performance are as follow. New business volume
declined by 4% overall, and that's primarily attributable to the lump-sum single premium
business as we've indicated. Contributions from Saham Finances and the strong growth in
the recurring premium risk business did assist in limiting the decline during the four-month
period.
Net value of new business increased by 28% on a constant economic and currency basis
driven by a change in mix to the more profitable lines of business. Net fund flows is ZAR
12 billion which is an acceptable performance under current conditions given the
slowdown in the retail flows. We've got some reasonable institutional inflows in South
Africa.
Net operating earnings increased by 5% in constant currency which was a robust
performance given the increase in new business strain this period and we disclosed the
effects of that in the operating metrics, and also given the pressure on results in
Botswana and Namibia which we also when through.
We are pleased to say that Saham Finances is delivering according to expectations which
is important given the significance of the two transactions we've done there
notwithstanding difficult trading conditions in Angola and in Nigeria.
So looking ahead, we don't expect any major improvements in operating conditions in the
short term. One must appreciate that lack of confidence is a big detractor particularly in
the single premium business. We have planned a steady flow, but important recovery in
the economy in South Africa, and that's unlikely to materialize and that will remain

FINAL

negative for single premium volume. So we're going to have to adjust to that. Volatility in
the currency and investment markets is what we expected to pursue, and that impacts on
our performance metrics.
Over the medium to longer term targets, however, we remain intact on this and we're
confident that we'll continue to deliver value to our shareholders and other stakeholders
particularly on a relative basis in the challenging times. As I've indicated, I wanted to
underperform the units in the book value and these have been intended to. At all the
businesses, all of our businesses, will need to adapt to the challenging conditions across
the portfolio.
Thank you. I'll now open the call for questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you very much, sir. Our first question is from Michael Christelis of UBS. Please go
ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for the time. Three questions, if I can. First is
Saham. You mentioned that the acquisition is running in line with your business plan. I
mean, that seems to sound like a bit of a more positive rhetoric than what we heard at
end results.
And given that you're not seeing where the numbers lie for your June reporting, I guess,
given the three months lag there, I mean, can you talk about whether we're – are we at a
higher run rate on a monthly earnings run rate than what we saw last year? So, that's the
first question.
Then the new business strength within SPF. I mean, can you give me a sense of
(00:06:45) about ZAR 120 million? Firstly, is that a reasonable sort of number? And then,
how much of that relates to the large group scheme versus the sort of normal-course
business on the individual part? I mean, just a sense of how much I should expect to your
peak going into the rest of the year?
And then, lastly on SPF. I'm quite surprised at the level of growth you've achieved in the
core earnings given what markets have done, and maybe you can just talk to the sort of
average asset levels in that portfolio if you can for the four-month period versus a year
ago. Just seems a little bit higher than other would have thought. Thanks, guys.

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Michael. Heinie – Maybe Heinie will deal with the Saham, then Wikus and
Patrick will deal with the new business trend, and then maybe, Anton, deal with the

earnings growth. They're all on (00:07:35).

FINAL

A - Heinie Carl Werth

{BIO 7529974 <GO>}

Michael, you're right. We did know that's the benefit of two further (00:07:43) these
results basically when we saw it earlier this year. Obviously, we then (00:07:48) the results
of December, but that was one good quarter after the few not-so-good quarters. And
they trade aside (00:07:57) the first quarter of 2017 also lift up the expectations, and we
were particularly pleased that in Angola, especially in local currency, they're doing recently
better than what we expected.
And that's why the mix in the business (00:08:19) have changed relative to what we
expected remained in the end overall. But I think you must also remember this remain
80%, 85% general insurance business, so volatility can easily come into play again.
But we are – I mean, given the conditions in Angola and then also, let me say, across the
wider Africa we saw a level that have slowed down on the continental risk side
(00:08:48). But overall, the company – we can't say there won't be surprises in the
quarter to come or that, but overall it's good to see that there's good quarters and
sometimes there will be a glitch here and there.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick Hartnic

{BIO 20482012 <GO>}

Michael, on the new business trend, Isn't ZAR 20 million figure that you mentioned, that's
an (00:09:15)? The majority of that is actually from the middle income markets, this
business class. But also it's a good portion from Sanlam Sky but the majority of Sanlam Sky
is actually not related to the large ones (00:09:35) generate as much new business trend
than the individual life cycle (00:09:42) in Sanlam Sky. But then again, the majority is
actually on the individual life business and not the large scheme.

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Core earnings.

A - Patrick Hartnic

{BIO 20482012 <GO>}

I don't think the we're (00:10:00) as you've described it. I mean you've got the (00:10:03)
exposures to bonds as well which performed fairly well compared to last year. I think we
actually (00:10:10) on some goods applied to earnings growth.

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

Is it safe to say then that asset levels are probably around 10%, 11% up on average.

(00:10:38).
Yeah.

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

Perfect. Thanks guys. I appreciate it.

A - Heinie Carl Werth

{BIO 7529974 <GO>}

And I think maybe largely in the base we had (00:10:48-00:10:52).

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thank you.

Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

Does that answer your questions, Michael?

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you.

Operator
Thanks very much. Our next question is from Francois du Toit of Renaissance Capital.
Please go ahead.

Q - Francois du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

Hi, guys. The first question, I try to work out the earnings impact on – the earnings
performance of the non-life business is more importantly given that we use embedded
value for the life valuations. So the 30% corporate plus the growth in earnings that you
mentioned, can you split that between EB and Healthcare for us a little bit? And then
that's the first question.
Second one, the 38% Sanlam UK earnings growth, again, can you split that between
merchant investors or give us an idea of the merchant investors' earnings in there as well
which is obviously part of the life business?
And then, Patrick, (00:12:05) if you can give a little bit of – it sounds from your previous
answer that the growth in SPF, a lot of that would have been in terms of Non-life earnings,
Page 5 of 13



Company N ame: Sanlam L td
Company Ticker: SL M SJ Equity
Date: 2017-06-07

FINAL

right? Given the new business trend and the impact that would have had on the life
earnings in SPF. So, that's the three questions related to life versus Non-life earnings,
(00:12:31).
And then, the fourth question just on your new business value. The increase of 24% is on
constant economic terms, right? The risk discount rate has reduced quite a bit compared
with the base period and compared with year-end. Can we expect that would add further
to your new business value assuming interest rate is there around this level to half yearend? Yeah. That's my four questions. Thank you.

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Okay. I think, Wikus, Patrick, you have a go at the first three maybe. And then, Anton, you
can do with the rest (00:13:12).

A - Patrick Hartnic

{BIO 20482012 <GO>}

Yeah. Patrick. We didn't specifically disclose the details split up anything (00:13:17)
between life and non-life. And I think on the Sanlam corporate side, I think all that we can
say is we've seen good growth in both the RoGEV and EV side.

Q - Francois du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick Hartnic

{BIO 20482012 <GO>}

On the Sanlam UK side, well, just the improvements (00:13:35) on the non-life side
because (00:13:38) the comparative base, we had quite a bit of restructuring cost last
year which wasn't – the majority of which said actually in the non-life side and that didn't
repeat this, so that's where we've seen a lot of the strong growth coming through. And
being liken maybe on the (00:13:58) VNB in escrow with the (00:14:00) also have a
positive impact because of the added 4% impact that we've had on the ground.

A - Wikus Olivier

{BIO 20074722 <GO>}

I think just to add, I mean, given that 28% is something to be proud of, but it is telling that
there's quite a bit of negative impact in 2016 from Sanlam's business set up (00:14:23) to
the market. And during last year, we worked out our office (00:14:26) system. So
(00:14:28).

A - Heinie Carl Werth

{BIO 7529974 <GO>}

So, Francois, we won't the 28% to remain 28%. I think the base that you compare it with
last year is different. I think it was the (00:14:39) last time.
(00:14:40-00:14:44)
Yeah, we don't...

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

No, I think you can (00:14:51) lots of the SPF growth was from the non-life side.

Q - Francois du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

FINAL

And where is the 90% from? The spin-off ?

A - Heinie Carl Werth

{BIO 7529974 <GO>}

The spin-off.

Q - Francois du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

And inflation?

A - Heinie Carl Werth

{BIO 7529974 <GO>}

Yeah. Inflation.

Q - Francois du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

Okay. So personal loans are growing again, good. Okay. Just quickly back to your new
business, that large team that you've won in Sky, did that contribute meaningfully to this
growth? Obviously, that's a one off contribution to new business value growth, right?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Heinie Carl Werth

{BIO 7529974 <GO>}

Yes. It did contribute meaningfully, but let's call it an overall and the total overall
(00:15:35). It's less material in the target...
(00:15:43-00:15:47)

Q - Francois du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

But the performance came from Sanlam Sky, individualize the middle income market
(00:15:57) some Employee Benefits as well, (00:15:58).

A - Heinie Carl Werth

{BIO 7529974 <GO>}

(00:16:02). So the fact that it won't be reoccurring won't be that dramatic on the results
going forward.

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean, that's more looking at (00:16:10). Yeah.

A - Heinie Carl Werth

Thank you very much. Our next question is from Larissa van Deventer of Deutsche Bank.
Please go ahead.

Q - Larissa Van-Deventer

{BIO 16216920 <GO>}

Thank you. A quick question to clarify on Shriram in India, I believe you mentioned ZAR 110
million of additional IFRS write-offs. Can you please confirm (00:16:36) to help us
understand two things. The first one, my understanding is that there were no write-offs in
the base, is that correct? And the second one is you comment that it's under a timing
issue and that will unwind. Can you help us understand the pace of the unwind part
(00:16:49)?

A - Heinie Carl Werth

{BIO 7529974 <GO>}

Sorry, Larissa, just the first part of your question. We have the second one. Why it will
always unwind? The first part of your question?

Q - Larissa Van-Deventer

{BIO 16216920 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I understand that there were no write-offs in the 1H 2016 base for Shriram. Is that correct?

A - Heinie Carl Werth

{BIO 7529974 <GO>}

In the what? In the first half of 2016, you're right.

Q - Larissa Van-Deventer

{BIO 16216920 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Heinie Carl Werth

{BIO 7529974 <GO>}

The first half of 2016 there was nothing abnormal. I mean, the business we had in the
equipment finance was in 2015. So 2016 was more a normal level.
Basically during this period of the demonetization, IFRS is – they tend to catch you, let's
call it, on provisioning and we already, Larissa, I would say, (00:17:42) and released the
earnings results, but we already starting to see an improvement.
So, this unwinding that you call, that you talked about, I think one has to be realistic. It
won't take of few quarters. But it is more likely that we were going to see some
positiveness coming out rather than a tradition will become a reality.

Q - Larissa Van-Deventer

{BIO 16216920 <GO>}

...turnaround in the first quarter in Shriram.

Q - Larissa Van-Deventer

{BIO 16216920 <GO>}

Okay. And those (00:18:13) you mentioned that is specific to SCM, correct? That is SCM
share of it?

A - Heinie Carl Werth

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. The SCM share of it. Yeah.

Q - Larissa Van-Deventer

{BIO 16216920 <GO>}

Thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you. We have a follow-up question from Francois du Toit. Please go ahead.

Q - Francois du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

I might as well try. Can you tell us what the embedded value was at (00:18:55)?

A - Heinie Carl Werth

{BIO 7529974 <GO>}

I don't know. I think I'll answer this (00:19:02), otherwise we would've (00:19:05) it. Anton,
(00:19:06) that?

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

No, I think it's – I mean, on the more regulated measures, we direct and incentivize the
businesses on the drivers (00:19:16) which were previous VNB. I mean, of course, the
experience (00:19:19) finances will be captured in the profit itself as well. So, we don't see

Page 9 of 13



Company N ame: Sanlam L td
Company Ticker: SL M SJ Equity
Date: 2017-06-07

there's really a need to calculate the EV on a monthly or quarterly basis. It's something
that we – I think we do on a six monthly basis.

A - Heinie Carl Werth

{BIO 7529974 <GO>}

FINAL

And I think it's also fair to say, Anton, we're not aware of any big negative impact.

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

Yeah, and that...

A - Heinie Carl Werth

{BIO 7529974 <GO>}

I mean, the rest of the drivers at this point has positive risk, so the unwinding should
prevail the VNB.

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

And if they were...

A - Heinie Carl Werth

{BIO 7529974 <GO>}

Markets are a bit higher. There's more positives other than (00:19:50).

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

Yeah. So if you look at your profits and your VNB, that should get you the stuff that's under
management's control in EBIT single digit (00:19:56). So that's why we don't track that
aggregated number on a daily basis.

Q - Francois du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

And now actuarial assumptions changes necessary and (00:20:11).

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

I mean (00:20:12-00:20:17) we tend to make our more significant changes at the yearend
in any event. So, I mean, that (00:20:23) we actually need to work on that (00:20:34).

A - Heinie Carl Werth

{BIO 7529974 <GO>}

But you do monitor trends...

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

Absolutely.

A - Heinie Carl Werth

{BIO 7529974 <GO>}

I think this was a concern that we would expect to come through in June.

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

Hi guys. Sorry, yeah. Just following on from Francois' question there. Obviously, last year
half one was (00:21:06) you guys are trying for many, many years. I'm just trying to
understand where are we relative to that? I remember correctly a large part of the
negative variances that come in last year came in after the first (00:21:23). Can you give
me any sort of sense of how the year is looking so far relative to either half one last year
or half two just to get an idea of what the variance are doing?

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, as you stated (00:21:37) after April; and if I knew, I wouldn't be sitting here. But...

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

Well, you know there has been an exception for the next three weeks, right?

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

Yeah. But we are not seeing a repeat of the first half of last year in the numbers. I mean,
you can assume that from the operating profit as well.

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

And remind me if half two last year was a normalized period; I think it was a little bit – I
think it was much higher than it's been than normal run rate, right?

A - Heinie Carl Werth

{BIO 7529974 <GO>}

What is that?

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

The second half.

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

The variance in the half year is much higher.

No. And it was also due to other factors, I mean.

A - Anton Gildenhuys

It was due to the (00:22:25) profit which you see in...

Yeah.
