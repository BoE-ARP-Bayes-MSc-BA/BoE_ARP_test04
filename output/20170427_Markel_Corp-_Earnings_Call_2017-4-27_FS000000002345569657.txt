FINAL

Good morning. Thank you for joining us. It's my pleasure to welcome you this morning to
our first quarter 2017 conference call. I think, our first quarter stands as a good example of
the value of our diversified business model. While we encountered an unexpected item in
our insurance business, we enjoyed very good returns from our investments in our Markel
Ventures operations.
In a short time period, such as any single quarter, results have been and will continue to
be volatile. We never know where and when elements of our business will be better or
worse than expected. In long run though, returns normalized and we continue to build on
our long-term record of financial progress.
Our long-term record continues to be based on our dedication of serving our customers,
associates and shareholders, and that never changes. As we wrote in this year's annual
report, same stuff different day.
With that as a preamble, I'll turn the call over to Anne Waleski, our Chief Financial Officer.
She will review the numbers, and Richie Whitt, my Co-CEO will discuss our insurance
operations, and then I'll make a few brief comments about our investments and Markel
Ventures operation. After that, we'll open up the floor for questions. Anne?

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom just mentioned, and as we
previously announced, our first quarter results were negatively impacted by the decrease
in the Ogden rate, but otherwise were in line with our expectations. We continue to see
positive contributions from our Markel Ventures operations, and our growth in book value
was driven by returns on our investment portfolio.
Total operating revenues grew 2.5% to just over $1.4 billion in 2017. This increase was
primarily attributable to higher earned premiums in our U.S. Insurance and Reinsurance
segments and higher net investment income.
Starting with our underwriting results, gross written premiums were $1.5 billion (03:41) for
the first quarter of 2017, compared to $1.4 billion in 2016, an increase of 5%, driven
primarily by an increase within our Reinsurance segment, partially offset by lower gross
premium volume in our International Insurance segment.
Higher gross written premiums in our Reinsurance segment were attributable to two large
specialty quota share treaties that were written during the first quarter of 2017. Partially
offsetting these new contracts was lower premium volume in our general liability, property
and other lines of business. The decrease in gross written premiums in the International
Insurance segment was primarily due to lower premium volume in our professional liability
and property product line, and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange
rate movements.
In the U.S. Insurance segment, premium volume was down due in part to increased
volume in 2016 related to the timing of closing our underwriting systems, which you may

recall from last year. Excluding the impact of this timing difference, we continue to see
growth in our personal lines business and workers' compensation product lines.

FINAL

Market conditions remain very competitive. Consistent with our historical practices, we will
not write business when we believe prevailing market rates will not support our
underwriting profit targets.
Net written premiums for the first quarter of 2017 were $1.3 billion, up 7% from the prior
year for the same reasons I just discussed, as well as a 1 point increase in retention from
85% last year to 86% this year. The increase in retention was attributable to our
International Insurance segment due to higher retentions on our professional liability and
marine and energy product lines. Earned premiums increased 3% to $983 million for the
first quarter of 2017. This growth is attributable to higher premium volume.
Our consolidated combined ratio for the first quarter of 2017 was 100% compared to an
88% last year. The increase in the combined ratio was driven by less favorable
development on prior-year loss reserves and a higher current accident year loss ratio
compared to the same period of 2016.

Bloomberg Transcript

The consolidated combined ratio for the first quarter of 2017 included $85 million, or 9
points of adverse development on prior-year loss reserves, resulting from the decrease
in the Ogden rate, which is used to calculate lump sum awards in UK bodily injury cases.
Effective March 20, 2017, the Ogden rate decreased from a positive 2.5% to a negative
0.75%. This represents the first change in that rate since 2001. The effect of the rate
change is most impactful to our UK auto casualty exposures through reinsurance contracts
in our Reinsurance segment. We ceased writing new UK auto business in late 2014.
The reduction in the Ogden rate increased the expected claims payments on these
exposures, and we increased loss reserves accordingly. The current accident year loss
ratio for the first quarter of 2017 was higher than last year due to higher loss ratios across
all of our Insurance segments.
Next, I'll cover the results of Markel Ventures. Revenues from Markel Ventures for the first
quarter of 2017 were $287 million, which is consistent with 2016. Higher revenues across
our non-manufacturing operations were offset by lower revenues in certain of our nonmanufacturing operations due to lower sales volume. Net income to shareholders from
Markel Ventures for the period was $14 million in 2017 and EBITDA was $42 million, both of
which were also in line with 2016 results.
Moving to our investment results, investment income increased from $91 million for the
first quarter of 2016 to $100 million this year. The increase was driven by short-term
investment income, primarily due to higher short-term interest rates, higher dividend
income due to increased equity holdings, and higher interest income on our fixed maturity
portfolio due to increased holdings of fixed maturity securities compared to the same
period of 2016.

FINAL

Net realized investment gains were $21 million in both periods. Given our long-term focus,
variability in the timing of realized and unrealized gains and losses is to be expected.
Looking at total results for the year, our effective tax rate was 24% in the first quarter of
2017, which is consistent with the first quarter of 2016. We reported net income to
shareholders of $70 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $160 million a year
ago. Comprehensive income to shareholders for the period was $223 million compared
to $397 million a year ago. And as a result, book value per share at the end of March 2017
was $620, an increase of 2% since the end of 2016.
Finally, I'll make a couple of comments on cash flows and the balance sheet. Net cash
provided by operating activities was $12 million for the first three months of 2017,
compared to net cash used by operating activities of $105 million for the same period of
2016. Operating cash flows in 2017 were net of a $46 million cash payment made in
connection with a commutation that was completed during the period.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the first quarter of 2017 reflected lower
claims payments and higher premium collections in our U.S. Insurance segment and lower
payments for employee profit sharing and income taxes compared to the same period of
2016.

Bloomberg Transcript

Historically, first quarter is our lowest cash generating quarter based on the timing
associated with incentive compensation payments to our associates and to our brokers.
Invested assets at the holding company were $2.4 billion at March 31, 2017 compared to
$2.5 billion at the end of the year 2016.
With that, I'll turn it over to Richie to talk more about the underwriting results.

Richard R. Whitt, III

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Thanks, Anne, good morning, everyone. Today, my comments will focus on underwriting
operations in our three continuing segments covering U.S. Insurance, International
Insurance, and Reinsurance. I'll also provide a brief update on our Markel CATCo
operations.
First, I'll start with the U.S. Insurance segment. Gross written premiums for the U.S.
segment were down 1% for the quarter. As Anne stated, the first quarter of 2016 had one
extra week of premium due to differences in the timing of the closing or underwriting
system. Excluding this extra week, premiums would be up 3% in 2017, driven by growth in
personal lines, primarily our classic car program and workers' compensation.
The combined ratio for the first quarter was 93% compared to 89% in the first quarter of
2016. The increase in the combined ratio is driven by a 4-point increase in our current
accident year loss ratio. The increase is due to higher attritional losses across multiple
product lines in this segment.

Page 4 of 13



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2017-04-27

FINAL

Our expectation is that, this increase will not continue through the rest of the year. The
increase in the current accident year loss ratio is partially offset by more favorable
development on prior-year loss reserves in 2017, as compared to 2016, primarily in
professional liability and workers' comp.
Next, I'll discuss International Insurance segment. Gross written premiums for this
segment are down 6% for the quarter, due in part to the strength of the U.S. dollar in 2017.
Additionally, we continue to experience tough market conditions, especially within our
property and professional liability lines of business based in London.
The first quarter combined ratio was 88% compared to 95% in 2016. The decrease in the
segment combined ratio for the quarter was mainly driven by higher prior-year
redundancies in 2017, most notably on our excess liability product lines, which had
favorable development this year compared to reserves strengthening last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

The favorable movement was partially offset by an increase in our current accident year
loss ratio in 2017, primarily in our property and marine and energy product lines. The
expense ratio also increased slightly due to higher net commissions and changes in our
branch office locations, partially offset by lower profit-sharing expense in 2017.
Finally, I'll discuss the results of our Reinsurance segment. We experienced 21% growth in
premium volume this quarter, primarily driven by two new large, specialty quota share
treaties totaling $137 million. Excluding these contracts, premium is down 9% due to
decreases in general liability, audit and property lines. These decreases are due to having
a higher frequency of multi-year deals in the first quarter of 2016, as well as non-renewed
business and renewal decreases in 2017 as a result of our difficult market. Significant
variability in gross premium volume can be expected in our Reinsurance segment due to
individually significant deals and timing of renewals on multi-year contracts.
The combined ratio for the Reinsurance segment was 132% compared to 82% in 2016. As
Anne just discussed, the significant increase in the combined ratio this quarter is due to
adverse development on prior-year loss reserves, driven by the $85 million or 38 points
of reserve strengthening in UK motor reinsurance. It's worth pointing out that this London
written business was discontinued in 2014.
In addition, we experienced slight adverse development on professional liability and
marine and energy product lines this year as compared to favorable movement in 2016.
The 2017 current accident year loss ratio is also up slightly for the quarter, due to the
impact of higher unfavorable premium adjustments across many of our product lines in
2017. Note that the corresponding benefit of these premium adjustments to losses is
included in prior accident years. The increase in our loss ratio is partially offset by a 3-point
decrease in the expense ratio, primarily due to lower profit sharing expenses in 2017 as
compared to 2016.
I'll make a couple of comments on market conditions. As you might expect, all markets we
compete in remain competitive. However, most lines could be best described as 0% to
5% off versus larger reductions last year. There is some discussion in the market that
Page 5 of 13



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2017-04-27

commercial rates are firming and could actually start to edge up. This is much needed and
would be a welcome change.

FINAL

While the market is extremely competitive, that is the natural state of things the majority
of the time in our industry. It is the reality in all businesses today. In other words, the
market is what the market is, and we need to stay focused on running our business and
finding ways to grow profitably.
In this regard, we continue to have solid success. Some noteworthy examples include, in
the U.S. we continue to profitably grow our workers' compensation book, and we've
enhanced coverage and have expanded states for our BOP product.
In the International, we continue to grow our profitable national markets book, and in
Reinsurance, we worked hard and closed two large specialty quota share opportunities in
the first quarter. Finally our pending SureTec acquisition adds surety to our U.S. product
portfolio. The aftermarket's difficult, but that just means we have to work harder and stay
disciplined to grow profitably.
Finally, I'll just make a couple comments about the Markel CATCo operations. Assets
under management increased to $4.1 billion at March 31, 2017 from $3.4 billion at the end
of 2016. We've seen increased demand from both cedents and investors in 2017. Markel
continues to invest approximately $200 million in the Markel CATCo funds.

Bloomberg Transcript

With that, I'd like to turn it over to Tom.

Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Thank you, Richie. I'll pick up here with some comments on our investments and Markel
Ventures operation. During the first quarter, we earned an overall return on a publiclytraded investment portfolio of 2.1%. We earned 5.6% on our equity portfolio, 0.7% on our
fixed income holdings and added 0.1% from FX effects. I'm happy with those results, and
I'd sign up for annualizing that for as long as I could.
I'll also note that on the internal schedules that our investment accountants provide me as
I review the results, our convention is to carry things out to one decimal place in reporting
the percentage results. The schedule I saw showed our investment expenses at 0.0%. I
don't know if they follow the convention of rounding or truncation when they prepare that
schedule, but I like the results either way.
In today's world, with the popularity of passive investing and low expenses, we can
compete toe-to-toe on expenses. We do so without giving up our ability to think about
what we are doing, and why we're doing it. We steer the ship as the captain rather than as
a potentially re-accommodated passenger in the back, and I know which one I'd rather be.
Through the quarter, we continue to put money to work as we steadily and methodically
added to our equity investment portfolio. Our equity investments now comprise 58% of
Page 6 of 13



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2017-04-27

FINAL

shareholders' equity, up from 56% at year end. Our fixed income portfolio remains
pristine in quality, low expense and performing the role that it's meant to do, namely
protecting the interest of our policyholders through thick and thin.
At Markel Ventures, revenues and EBITDA roughly matched last year at $286 million and
$41 million, respectively. Our cyclical-related businesses began to feel a bit of the topping
out we expected to see in their normal cyclical pattern. Our other businesses continue to
make steady progress and perform as expected.
My guess is that this is the pattern we'll probably continue to see for the rest of the year.
We continue to actively search for additional opportunities at Markel Ventures, but we
remain disciplined in doing so; same stuff, different day.
Prices in this world are high, and there's a lot of capital sloshing around, trying to find
deals. We will continue to focus on organic growth opportunities at our existing
businesses, and will opportunistically respond when we see the chance to do so.
As always, we deeply appreciate the long-term support from you as our shareholders and
business partners as we continue to build the long-term financial value of the Markel
Corporation. We would be delighted if you could join us on May 15 here in Richmond for
our Annual Meeting.

And at this time, I'd like to open up the floor for your comments and questions.

Q&A
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Bob
Farnam of Boenning Scattergood (sic) [Boenning & Scattergood]. Please go ahead.

Q - Bob Farnam

{BIO 15005467 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thanks. Good morning. Richie, I have a question on the quota share
agreements, totally understanding the backdrop of having reinsurance premiums be
pretty volatile, I'm just trying to figure out how to model the quota shares going forward?
Can you give us an idea of was there in-force premium that came with this, and what time
in the first quarter did it come about, and maybe some other details like what lines of
business and if it's global or domestic?

A - Richard R. Whitt, III

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Sure. Well, probably the first thing to tell you in terms of just how to think about it going
forward is they are one-year deals. They're very special deals, so there's no guarantee
they would renew in 2018. So that $137 million, it's there for 2017, 2018. We'll have to go
through the negotiations, and everything, but they're big deals and they may or may not
renew, so I'll say that. Both of them tend to be multi-line deals, one of them is domestic,

Page 7 of 13



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2017-04-27

the other is international, but they tend to be multi-line deals, so both property, casualty,
professional things – the various lines.

FINAL

Q - Bob Farnam

{BIO 15005467 <GO>}

All right, and was there – the magnitude of the premium in the first quarter being a quota
share, is there seasonality to this going forward or is it – should we look at the same
amount of premium volume basically for the next few quarters?

A - Richard R. Whitt, III

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Yeah. I think, now we've recognized all the written premium for the year, just to make sure
you understand that. When you book those deals, you recognize all the written premium
upfront, so that's done, and won't impact the next three quarters, but now what we'll see
is, earnings coming through over basically the next eight quarters, because the underlying
policies tend to be annual policies. So earnings will start to tick-up probably peak in the
third and fourth quarter, and then come down throughout 2018 unless of course the deals
are renewed.

Q - Bob Farnam

{BIO 15005467 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Right. Okay, very good. That clears up my question there. And Tom, maybe a question for
you, I know you talk every once in a while about off-balance sheet unrealized gains, is that
something that – how should we think about that? I know, you hold investments for longterm, so you may never actually recognize some of that stuff ?

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Well, exactly. And really what you're talking about is the value, speaking in economic rather
than accounting terms, of what Markel Ventures in worth in aggregate compared to what
we paid for those businesses.
So on day one, they go on the books at what we pay for them. The equity account in the
accounting sense goes up when they make money. So you see that sort of accretion in
balance sheet value, dollar-for-dollar with the earnings of those businesses. What they're
worth in the marketplace, I would assert (23:11) it's more than what we pay for them. And
you can do your own math thinking about what the EBITDA run rates are, what EBITDA
multiples are, and give some rough – just a sense of what they're worth, and do that in an
ongoing basis.
To your point, we don't plan on selling them. This is the future of the Markel Corporation,
along with growth in the Insurance business. And we're running these businesses with a
forever mindset in the exact same way that we run the Insurance businesses, which is
meant to build the long-term financial value, and I use that word exclusively.
And in fact, it was interesting, I was having the conversation with our Chairman, Alan
Kirshner just yesterday. And we were talking about the Markel style, which he deserves
the primary credit for having written prior to us going public in 1986. And we talked about

Page 8 of 13

Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2017-04-27

FINAL

book value a lot around here, and historically, that has been an excellent description of
the economics of the Markel Corporation.
But as Markel Ventures grows, as you point out, there's stuff that's not captured well by
book value calculation. And Alan with his normal Carnac-like prescience foresaw that day
back in 1986 when the Markel Corporation would be broader, and have more stuff going
on as time went by in order to build the financial value of this company. So I talk a lot
about financial value, intrinsic value, things of that nature, of which book value and balance
sheet is a part, and large part, and will continue to be so, but it's not everything.

Q - Bob Farnam

{BIO 15005467 <GO>}

All right. Okay, thanks again for that.

Operator
Our next question comes from Jeff Schmitt of William Blair. Please go ahead.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. Was there any catastrophe losses during the quarter?

A - Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Nothing.

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Good as we say that.

A - Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Well.

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Well – in other word catastrophe losses...

A - Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Yes, but nothing material.

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Yeah, they were really kind of our run rate attritional.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Okay, got you. And then, obviously, the accident year loss ratio has moved up a fair
amount sort of across the board. Could you talk a little more in detail about loss cost
trends, particularly touch on the legal environment and medical cost inflation?
Page 9 of 13

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

FINAL

Sure. I'll take a shot at that. Obviously, we write over 100 lines or 100 products, different
products at Markel. So there's no exact description of each one of those – each one of
them are moving slightly differently.
Probably some portion of what we saw in the first quarter in terms of that uptick, I think is,
just things that are relevant to the quarter. And like I said on the U.S., we don't think, we'll
continue for the rest of the year. Some of it, as you sort of alluded to there, we think is
loss cost trend, and price decreases.
So each year, as we go into the year, as we do our budgeting, we think about what the
loss cost trends are. We think about what the price movements have been, and we adjust
what we think our loss pick is going to be. And there has been some increase to the loss
picks as a result of that. And as you mentioned, I mean, I think, we've had a pretty benign
for the number of years, so very benign sort of loss cost trend environment – we're
starting to see some uptick in that.
And just as people start to talk about rates potentially moving up, and inflation maybe
starting to move a little bit, you're starting to see loss cost trend, which makes sense. So
it's a mixed bag, depending on which line of business of ours you're talking about. But
we're seeing a little bit of trend and that's driven some of those rate increases, and we
also just had some one-off things in the first quarter that drove some of that increase.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Okay. And then, in workers' comp, I believe, you mentioned there was some favorable
development there. Can you talk about that line specifically in terms of pricing in loss cost
trends?

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Well, loss cost trends have been dropping in workers' comp. And so states have been
adjusting their loss cost factors, which works against us in terms of the ability to grow in
that business, because it reduces the base rate. Workers' comp has been – and it feels
strange to say this, because it's been seldom that that's happened in that market, it's
been a real bright spot.
Worker's comp has done extremely well for the last number of years. And those loss cost
trends have come down. And as a result of that, we've had some really nice results. The
thing we've got to all be careful of and be watching for the folks that write workers' comp
is as if inflation gets moving, that drives medical costs. And if medical costs gets moving,
you'll see that, will show up in workers' comp.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Mark Dwelle of RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah, good morning. Just a couple of questions, the first one's kind of a numbers
question. On the Ogden charge, am I right that 100% of that was taken against the
Reinsurance business, there was none in the International?

A - Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

That's correct.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. And then the second question, I noticed in the Q, you booked a $3.9 million (29:01)
deferred gain related to the asbestos contract that you did a year ago. Is there anything
left in terms of deferred gain, or is that now 100% booked through and we've heard the
last of it?

A - Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That gain was specific to closing out the exposures related to the UK business. So there
was what's called a Part 7 closure. So there's no exposure left on that business. We do still
have some part of the U.S. book that we ceded off. We do still have some exposure to
that.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Are there any deferred gains associated with the – I guess, that's what I was asking, not
on the loss exposure, but more on are there any other deferred gains sitting out there
that...?

A - Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Nothing that would be material.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Got it. Okay. And then, Richie, maybe I'll give you the (30:04) opportunity to talk a little bit
about SureTec, and what we know about that business, and timing and so forth?

A - Richard R. Whitt, III

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Sure. We're very hopeful, we'll be closing in the next week or on SureTec. We believe we
have all of our regulatory approvals at this point. So knock on wood, closed by the end of
April, and we're very excited to have SureTec as part of the Markel family, brings obviously
the surety product line to Markel, which we had virtually no surety business at Markel prior
to the addition of SureTec.
One of the things we're very excited about SureTec is, contractors is a large part of what
we do at Markel. We, in some way, shape, or form seem to do business with contractors
Page 11 of 13



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2017-04-27

in almost each of our businesses. And SureTec obviously brings another product that
contractors need. And we're hoping to find ways to sort of cross-sell those products and
meet more the needs of our contractor clients.

FINAL

So obviously, it's very early days. We haven't even closed it yet, but we're very excited
about what SureTec can add to Markel Corporation.

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

I'm going to chime in a little bit, because Richie was kind enough to enlist me at the early
stages of this deal, and we worked together quite cooperatively and well on it. Some of
the additional factors that made this truly a win-win deal for both Markel and SureTec is
that within the Markel Corporation, we'll be able to invest the assets of SureTec differently
than they had been able to invest on a standalone basis, so that that adds value that
otherwise they would not have been able to achieve on their own.

And similarly, this was a deal where in the hyper-competitive world that I spoke of, of
deals, there are amazing and unique special situations that come up. They approached us
directly, principal-to-principal and that the driver was culture. And our reputation in the
marketplace and our long-term history of how the associates and the shareholders and
the customers of Markel have been treated over decades.
So they came to us first, and we were able to put a deal together, and I think, that's winwin for everybody. And those are hard factors to model, but they sure do matter. And
within the context of a very competitive acquisition for M&A, I make no predictions and it's
hard to find deals. But I will tell you that, we work every day, and I think we work
productively as stated.

Okay, I appreciate that. And I guess, last question I had is actually for you, Tom. With
markets making their highs and changes in interest rates and so forth, I think I know the
answer to this, but I just wanted to kind of hear you say it again. How are you thinking
about asset allocation, and adding to the equity portfolio at this bucket stage and so
forth?

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

I'm going to repeat my refrain of, same stuff, different day. I've been in this business 30
years now and I've seen all kinds of cycles, and generally speaking, there is always
something that's appropriate to do, and the great news about running an investment
operation, it's married to a profitable insurance company is that, we get to dial across
average (33:38) so every week the Markel insurance entities have deposited money into
the account of the Markel equity investment arm, and they've never asked for a penny of
it back.
So, we're able to continuously invest, and that has just proven to be a marvelous way to
continue to build the financial value of the company, and there always seems to be
something that's appropriate to add, and of course our turns was extraordinarily low,

because what we're really underwriting is the quality and the economics of the business
we're buying as opposed to trading the securities, and there are good businesses, good
people out there and there's going to be pretty durable decisions.

FINAL

Thank you for that, Tom. I finally have a hunch that was the answer, but good to hear you
say it once again. Thanks very much.
