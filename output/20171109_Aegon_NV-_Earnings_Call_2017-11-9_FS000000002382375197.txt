MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Aegon 3Q 2017 Results
Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn
the conference over to Willem van den Berg, Head of Investor Relations. Please go
ahead, sir.

Willem van den Berg

{BIO 15203834 <GO>}

Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining this conference
call on Aegon's third quarter 2017 results. We will keep today's presentation short, leaving
plenty of time to address all your questions. We would appreciate it if you take a moment
to look and to review our disclaimer on forward-looking statements, which you can find in
the back of our presentation.

Our CEO, Alex Wynaendts, will first provide an overview of our third quarter results and
will then be joined by CFO, Matt Rider, to answer your questions.
I'll now hand it over to Alex.

Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Thank you, Willem, and good morning, everyone, and thank you, all, for your continued
interest in Aegon, and of course also for joining us today for today's earning call. So, let
me begin by providing you with an overview of this quarter's key developments.
I'm pleased with the clear improvement in our operating results, with underlying earnings
increasing 20% to €556 million, driven by improved claims experience, by increased fee
revenue resulting from favorable equity markets and lower expenses in our U.S. business.
As a result of our strong underlying earnings, our group return on equity increased by 120
basis points to 8.9%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net income was also strong this quarter, even though it was impacted by assumption
changes and model updates. Our Solvency II ratio increased to 195%, which is at the
upper-end of our target range of 150% to 200% for the group. This increase was mainly
the result of strong capital generation this quarter, which amounted to €324 million,
excluding €485 million of market impacts and one-time items.
And finally, sales were very strong year-over-year, rising by more than 50% to €4.5 billion.
This increase is mainly a reflection of our continued success of strategic shift to fee-based
businesses, in particular, our UK platform and our asset management business.
Let's now take a closer look at our underlying earnings for the quarter in the next slide. I
am very pleased that our underlying earnings are up for the fifth consecutive quarter. This
reflect growth across our businesses, expense savings and management actions. During
the third quarter, we saw significantly improved claims experience in our life and health
businesses in the U.S. compared with the same quarter last year. This improvement is a
result of the management actions we have taken to improve profitability as part of our
five-part plan.
Another main driver for increased earnings is the continued success or execution of our
expense reduction program and I will elaborate further on this program in a moment on
the following slides. Also earnings from our fee-based business continued to perform well
as higher account balances benefited from new business and higher equity markets. U.S.
interest rates increased, but still remain below our long-term assumption for reinvestment
yields. The improvement in reinvestment yields resulted in a €10 million positive effect
compared with last year.
As I mentioned on the previous slide, we continue to make good progress on our group
expense savings program. So far, we have achieved run rate expense savings of €170
million across the group, of which €130 million are from the U.S., €30 million from the
Netherlands and the remainder from the holding.

FINAL

We continue to work hard on implementing further expense savings in our business units.
The plans we are putting in place gives us the confidence that we are well on track to
reach our target of €350 million by the end of 2018. These savings are resulting in higher
returns, while they're also enabling us to invest in the growth of our business.
I would now like to turn to slide 5, which shows the development of our net income. As
you can see, net income was strong, amounting to €469 million for the quarter, driven by
both solid underlying and non-underlying results. The latter was mainly driven by strong
gains on fair value items and by higher realized gains on investments. Fair value gains of
€159 million were mainly the result of positive real estate's revaluations in both the U.S.
and Netherlands and of hedging gains in the U.S. The hedging gains reflect changes that
we've made to our U.S. macro equity hedge program in the past few quarters.
This program is in place to protect our capital position against falling equity markets, and
given current market conditions, we have switched to a 100% option-based program and,
as a result, significantly lowered the quarterly run rate cost of the program from $60
million to $45 million in the base case scenario, while leaving open the upside in case
equity markets further rise. More details can be found on slide 21 in the back of this
presentation.

Bloomberg Transcript

Realized gains amounted €135 million, and these were primarily related to the share of
equity investments in the U.S. Finally, other charges amounted to a loss of €233 million,
which was mainly resulting from assumption change and model updates, which I would like
to take you through on the following slides.
As you know, we review our assumptions every year in the third quarter, and we run an
ongoing model enhancement and validation program throughout the company. This
quarter, assumption change and model updates result in a one-time charge of €198
million. This charge was mainly driven by the completion of the conversion of our largest
block of universal life business in the U.S. to a new, more dynamic model. This conversion
led to a one-time IFRS charge of €252 million, while it had limited impact on the capital
position and has no impact on earnings going forward. We have transitioned from
modeling policyholder behavior and other assumptions on the cohort basis to a policy-bypolicy basis, thereby significantly improving the granularity of our modeling.
The completion of this model conversion effectively concludes the first phase of our
model enhancement and validation program covering all high-impact models identified
when the program started in 2014. Our assumption changes and model updates in the
U.S. netted to €52 million. These charges are one-time in nature and will have no material
recurring impact to underlying earnings and to capital generation going forward.
In Europe, the combined impact of assumption changes and model updates was positive
totaling €125 million. These were mostly related to the Netherlands where there was a
release of a guaranteed provision as there was excess prudency in our reserves. The
remaining other charges were primarily driven by impairment of intangibles related to the
announced sale of Aegon Ireland. The sale is in line with our strategic objective to

Page 3 of 25

Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2017-11-09

FINAL

optimize our portfolio, and the impairment is part of the book loss we guided for when
we announced the transaction.
Let's now turn to slide 7 where you can see the breakdown of our very strong deposits. In
the third quarter, gross deposits continued to be strong across all our businesses,
increasing significantly to a record €41 billion. Our UK platform performed very well over
the quarter, with institution sales totaling nearly €5 billion. But I want to remind you here
that these institution sales are often large in size and can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.
Higher gross deposits of close to €23 billion in our asset management business were
mainly the result of a large mandate won by a partner, La Banque Postale Asset
Management, by inflows in the Americas and by the inclusion of the first inflows from
Stap, the Dutch general pension fund initiated by Aegon.
You may recall Stap was the first fund of its kind and makes it possible to combine a
financial administration of multiple pension plans for multiple employees. Stap currently
manages over €2 billion. What's more, Stap enables smaller pension schemes to benefit
from the economies of scale and also to comply with complex pension regulations. And
its fiduciary management is carried out by a subsidiary of Aegon Asset Management.

Bloomberg Transcript

We will provide more details on Stap and other opportunities that we see in the Dutch
market on December 1 where we'll be hosting a strategy update for analysts and
investors at our offices in The Hague. The Dutch management team will provide you there
with further insights into the prospects of our business in the Netherlands.
Let me now turn to the next slide where I'll take you through our life and health sales for
the quarter. I'm on slide 8. New life sales declined by 8% to €202 million. The U.S. term
and indexed universal life sales were down compared with the same quarter last year,
and this decline was due to our continued focus on profitability in markets with increased
competition.
Lower sales in Europe were mainly the result of our exit from the UK annuity market, and
reflect a strategic shift to fee-based businesses. New premiums for accident and health
sales decreased by 17% as product exists and lower supplemental health sales in United
States more than offset higher travel sales.
As announced at last year's Analyst & Investor Day in New York, we will exit the Affinity,
Direct TV and Direct Mail distribution channels as these channels and associated products
do not fit strategically within our wealth and health strategy. And for this reason, we
expect travel sales to reduce significantly as of the first quarter of 2018.
Let me now turn to the excess capital position of the holding on the next slide. As
announced during our second quarter results call, we have injected €1 billion of capital into
the Netherlands. This injection temporarily decreased our excess capital position at the
holding to €0.9 billion, which is just below our target range of €1 billion to €1.5 billion.

Page 4 of 25

FINAL

During the third quarter, excess capital at the holding was supported by regular dividends
from our units of close to €400 million from our U.S. and asset management operations.
The redemption of €500 million senior unsecured notes last July was offset by the
issuance of a one-year senior note of the same amount in August. Notes were issued at a
negative yield of 16 basis points, and this enabled us to inject the €1 billion in the
Netherlands already in September.
Last month, the UK upstreamed £131 million as part of the special £150 million dividend
following the sale of the annuity book. The UK dividend and the proceeds from the sale of
the majority of our U.S. run-off business will more than offset expected cash flows –
outflows from holding expenses and the share buyback to neutralize the dilutive effect of
the 2016 final and 2017 interim stock dividends. As a result, we expect our excess capital
position at the end of the year to be in the upper end of our target range as we indicated
at the time of our second quarter results.

Bloomberg Transcript

I would now like to focus on our group capital position on the next slide. Our Solvency II
ratio increased 10 percentage points to 195%. The strong increase is attributable to
capital generation from the operating units. Excluding market impacts and one-time items
of €485 million, capital generation amounted to €324 million. One-time items mainly
related to model change in Netherlands and the UK, with all major changes having been
approved by the College of Supervisors. These model changes have a limited impact on
capital generation going forward.
The completion of the Legal & General Part VII transfer related to the divestment of the
UK annuity book led to an increase of 2% for the group. These positives more than offset
the interim 2017 dividend, which was announced in August.
And lastly, I would like to highlight that, as a result of both the capital injection to the
Netherlands and model enhancements, the Dutch Solvency II ratio improved to around
190%. The UK ratio improved to around 200%, where the U.S. RBC ratio stood with
continued strong level of approximately 445%. And this means that the capital ratios for
all our main operating units are at the upper end of their respective target ranges.
So, let me now conclude. This was clearly a strong quarter from an earnings and a capital
perspective, but it was also one in which we made a series of significant steps forward in
execution of our strategy. In all our markets, we're delivering on our commitments as a
result of the management actions we've taken. We have addressed the
underperformance of our U.S. life and health business and put both our Dutch and UK
businesses back in a position to resume dividend payments to the holding.
We also continued to see business growth in our main markets as the strategic
investments into new platforms are gaining traction. So, overall, I am pleased with how we
are successfully changing the profile of the company to position us strongly for future
growth, and this gives me every confidence that we are taking the right steps to achieve
our ambitions.
Matt and I are now ready to take your questions. Thank you.

FINAL

Okay. Thank you. We will take our first question today from Benoît Pétrarque from Kepler.
Please go ahead.

Q - Benoît Pétrarque
Yes. Good morning. It's Benoît from Kepler Cheuvreux. Three questions on my side. The
first one will be on the Dutch business. I know you have a strategic update on the 1st of
December. But could you kind of update us on your view on the consolidation of the
Dutch live market. There have been some rumors in the market recently. I know you don't
comment on the rumors, but what is your ambition on this market. You have not been very
active until now. So, could you update us briefly on that?
Also second question on the Dutch ratio, which is clearly, well, up 15 percentage point, I
think, Q-on-Q. Could you clarify a bit the move has been over the quarter, break down
between organic capital generation, impact of model updates and also impact of the
market in the quarter?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then just finally, sorry to stay on the Dutch side, but the release of the guarantee
provision in the Netherlands. Could you just clarify what has been the driver of this
change? I think you referred to excess prudency, but just wanted to know a bit more
about the driver of the release? Thank you very much.

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Good morning, Benoît. Let me take the first question and I'll pass it for the second and
third one to Matt.
Benoît, as you know, we've been very consistent saying that, our focus – our strategic
focus in the Netherlands is on organic growth, and we're saying this because we have a
very strong position in the key market in which we want to operate. As a particular, the
markets of pension, work site, helping people securing a financial future. And that strong
position effectively already gives us a very broader market position. I think we've
mentioned that and you'll get much more color when you see the whole management
team later here in The Hague. Out of every two Dutch households, one is a customer, a
pension customer of the Netherlands.
The second thing I want to say on this subject is that the new government that has just
been installed right now is also taking measures that will very much support the business
areas in which we're in, an effective support then by accelerating the shift of responsibility
to individuals. Whereas you know, Netherlands in the past pension provision was very
much something, which was done by employer, by the government. More and more we
see a shift to individual responsibility.

FINAL

Effectively, the government has now also announced measures to facilitate the creation of
individual pension products and is exactly the area where Aegon has been focusing on for
quite some time. So, we feel very comfortable that we have there a strong position. But
again, I'm sure our management team will do a much better job than I do right now,
ensuring how well we are positioned in that area with our defined benefit plans, with our
DC plans, but also would stop where we are – we were the first one to come into market
and we also are now market leading in providing that offer.
Matt, you want to take the two other questions, please?

A - Matthew J. Rider

{BIO 20002664 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. On the group solvency ratio, you did see the strong improvement in the ratio from
185% in the second quarter to 195%. I think the presentation does a pretty good job of
laying it out, but you think of it as 4 percentage points coming from normalized capital
generation. That would be the total capital generation excluding one-time items and
market impacts, and then you have 6 percentage points coming from one-time items and
market impacts including model changes, and this actually bears quite a lot on the
Solvency II ratio for the Dutch business, especially as there were some changes to our
internal model that were recently approved by our College of Supervisors. So, that had a
good impact on the Dutch ratio.
And then importantly, we were able to complete the L&G Part VII transfers that were
related to the previous sale of the UK annuity block. And because we were released from
some contingent capital risk, we were able to add 2 points to our solvency, and add those
numbers up and then take away the interim dividend; the interim dividend was about 3%,
and then you get to about 10.
Now for the Dutch ratio, Alex mentioned that we had improved it to around 190% for the
quarter. This reflects those model changes but also importantly the injection of the €1
billion dividend into the business. I would also mention that the UMG transaction is just
recently completed, so that is not yet been incorporated into that figure.

Q - Benoît Pétrarque
And on the release of the guarantees in the Netherlands?

A - Matthew J. Rider

{BIO 20002664 <GO>}

Yeah. So, that was – the number that we referred to related to – mainly it's an IFRS change
or was in fact a small solvency position change in that one too, but this just relates mainly
to mortality updates.

Q - Benoît Pétrarque
Yeah. Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question today comes from Farquhar Murray from Autonomous.
Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Good morning, gentlemen. Just two questions, if I may. Firstly, going back actually
probably to slide 10. Please, could you just decompose the fall of €0.7 billion in the SCR
ideally obviously between the UK and the Netherlands?
And then secondly, the slide indicates the model changes have a limited impact on capital
generation in the near term, which is obviously helpful. And this is probably nitpicking, but
can you just double-check whether there's anymore material impacts longer term, and in
particular, are there any changes in the decomposition of capital generation between the
geographies? I think you've indicated the U.S. doesn't really change, so I presume nothing
is really changing, okay.

A - Matthew J. Rider

{BIO 20002664 <GO>}

Maybe to talk about the SCR reduction. So, we had about €700 million reduction in SCR in
the quarter. Part of it is related to just revised modeling of currency risk and related
diversification at the group level that has no impact on capital generation. But also, I think,
importantly for our internal model improvements that have been recently improved in the
Netherlands primarily, we revised our method for doing credit risk shock for non-safe
haven sovereigns, and that's basically it.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

And how much was that?

A - Matthew J. Rider

{BIO 20002664 <GO>}

I don't have the breakdown, but I'm sure that we can get it to you. As for the model
changes – I'm sorry, the balance of the question?

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

You just said that that has a limited impact (23:19) The model changes for the quarter
mainly related to – basically the impact comes to reserve increases. So, we would not
expect that this would have any kind of an earnings impact in the short term, and in fact in
the longer term, it actually reduces what would have otherwise been a drag on earnings.
So – but that's in the very long term. These are long duration contracts.
Okay. So that's positive very further out?

A - Matthew J. Rider

{BIO 20002664 <GO>}

Yes.

FINAL

Thank you. Our next question today comes from Farooq Hanif from Credit Suisse.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi there. Thank you very much. Three questions, if I may. First one, do you have any other
sort of modeling improvements that you think you can – that you'd like to put through in
the Netherlands particularly? So I'm thinking sort of further refinement to the internal
model, and that's obviously on top of the disposal gain that you're going to get. That's
question one.
Question two, are you – I get that you don't really want to participate in consolidation in
the Netherlands, but are you seeing any positive impacts from the consolidation that's
happened elsewhere in terms of profitability? So are there any early signs that that could
help you?
And the last question is, you referred to reinvestment yields improving, but could you just
update us on the current U.S. ALM gap. The typical question you get when – if yields
remain where they were – where they are, sorry, what implications that might have on
earnings and capital generation? Thank you very much.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Farooq, let me take your second question, and Matt can take the first one on the impact
of model improvements on our Solvency II position in Netherlands and provide you with
the investment yields. I think we've been clear, and I've just stated in one of the previous
questions that, for the Netherlands, with the position that we have in that segment of the
market, which we believe is a segment of the market where we see really the future
growth very much driven by the shift of responsibility to individuals, the need for people
to save more for the future, people living longer and being less dependent on
governments or employers, then that trend is really the area we want to be. But we have
a market share, as you know, above 30%. I just mentioned that, out of every two Dutch
households, one is a customer of us, so there is no need for us there to be bigger.
In terms of other areas, I want to remind you maybe our Cofunds and Mercer acquisitions
explain here that we were not so much acquiring companies and taking costs out, the
objective really of these transactions was to acquire customers. And let me take you to
Cofunds, for example. We have a state-of-the-art, recognized, as you know, by the place
in the UK market platform capability. That is by the way very scalable. So, for us, it's all
about trying to get as much as customers on that platform as we can with as low as
possible in acquisition cost.
So, the Cofunds acquisition was effectively moving 900,000 customers for which we paid
£150 million, which effectively is – or £140 million to be exact. Effective means that we
acquire the customers for £150 per customer. That's another way of looking at it. If you
Page 9 of 25



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2017-11-09

FINAL

look at acquisition of the Mercer pension plan, it is very much similar. And we will continue
to be looking at where we can leverage very specific technology that we have in place
that is scalable by attracting customers on our technology.
And what we expect going forward is that, since we have invested in specific areas of
technology, the 401(k) business in the U.S. I think you're well aware of that. The UK, I just
mentioned, we will continue to look at ways of bringing customers to our platform, and
this is a more effective and a cheaper way, I can assure you, than go in a market and go
and chase 900,000 customers.
So you see more of that happening because we also see that the skill means that those
players that are smaller or mid-size will just not be able to play the game, so we see more
opportunities in that area going forward. Matt?

A - Matthew J. Rider

{BIO 20002664 <GO>}

Maybe with respect to the modeling improvements, so we've just had what we call IMAB
2 (27:40). So, this is major model improvements that have been submitted to DNB and
have been approved by the College of Supervisors. I would expect that we will continue
to basically improve our modeling. But I would not anticipate any major model submissions
to DNB in the very near future.

Bloomberg Transcript

With respect to your question on U.S. reinvestment yields, currently where new money
yields are at about 4.05% for the quarter. And that is below our long-term expectation.
But we would think that has a quite limited impact on near-term capital generation.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Nadine van der Meulen from Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead.

Q - Nadine van der Meulen

{BIO 15200446 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. The first question is on the
holding excess capital position. You've upswinged quite a significant dividend out of the
U.S. in the third quarter. What should we expect for the full year or in Q4 in this light? Is it
just that you brought that forward?
And then second question is, on the assumption changes and the model updates, a onetime charge as you put it of the €198 million, do you mean to say that we should not
expect any further charges from model updates? Or if there are, what region we could
expect because this is an ongoing thing? And then I suppose, lastly, in the U.S. life sales,
they were down in new business margin, which was also a bit a lower. Could you talk

Page 10 of 25



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2017-11-09

about sort of the main drivers and how would you think about the outlook for the
profitability here on new business? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Let me maybe take you to questions two and three, and then Matt will take your first
question on the movement of excess capital position to the holding. I think it's good to
remind everybody in the context. As you know, we've announced at the end of 2014 that
we were undergoing a very thorough model validation, model review process of all the
high-impact models. And I think, we've been very clear that this model, which is related to
the universal life policies in the U.S., was kind of the last of the large models, and that we
said we would do and make all the efforts to ensure that we could get this model
validation concluded by the third quarter, so we can bring it all together with model
validation in the Netherlands and assumption changes.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, yes, in the U.S., it has led to a charge. I'd like to point out that in the Netherlands,
actually it has led to a gain. So, this model change is for high-impact models not effectively
concluded. It doesn't mean that we will not continue to do model refinements and model
changes for the rest of our business. Actually, in fact, we have done and performed quite
a number of what we call medium impact and low model changes and updates in the
course of all the quarters. But, as these low and medium impact also suggests, the
impacts are very small and have been quite limited, and have actually also offset each
other. So, we do not expect to see significant impacts going forward now that we have
effectively concluded this high-impact model.
Also, I want to make sure that you see that the IFRS loss here of the U.S. model was more
than offset by share value gains in the U.S., was also offset by fair value gains and gains
we've made, real estate and other positions, and has had limited impact on our capital
position and no impact on our ongoing capital generation, no impact on ongoing earnings
impact. So, it really is an IFRS impact here.
In terms of life sales, as you know, the market is competitive in the U.S. Interest rates
clearly coming down have only made that worse. We have a clear strategy and maintain a
discipline in pricing.
So, what we are looking at is where – in which parts of the market can we continue to sell
and grow our business, and particularly indexed universal – indexed-linked universal life is
an area where we have significant market share and where we have been able to kind of
effectively reduce the decline in sales. So I'm positive there because we've also made
changes. With the improvement in interest rates, it will make it easier for us to see our
sales going up there.
But it fits all in the strategic shift that we've mentioned many times is that more and more
of our business is going to fee business; more and more business is going to deposits,
pension business, asset management, mutual funds in particular in line with the shift, as I
said earlier, of responsibility to individuals. So, that's why you see – you will continue to see
more of the growth of our business.

So, Matt, do you want to take the first question?

FINAL

A - Matthew J. Rider

{BIO 20002664 <GO>}

Yeah. On the excess cash on the holding, you've seen that at the end of the third quarter
we're standing at about €900 million, which is slightly below our target area of €1 billion to
€1.5 billion. Now, I'll tell you that that was corrected just a few days after the end of the
quarter when we received the special dividend from the UK in the amount of £131 million.
And then, for the rest of the year, as Alex said in his opening remarks, we would expect to
be at the top end of the range in part from additional dividends from the UK but mainly
from dividends that we would expect from the U.S. following the close of the BOLI/COLI
transaction.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Cathcart from Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Q - Mark David Cathcart

{BIO 19783252 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi. Congratulations, Alex, on what I thought was a really good underlying set of
numbers. And having followed the stock for many years, it's the most cheerful up-sell, I
think, since the 1990s. I think things are really heading in the right direction. So, on that
basis, can you give some sort of indication on how much further you believe you can get
costs down across the group? You must walk around the Aegon offices thinking that
there's more costs that can be cut and more efficiencies. And the second point is,
because you're moving towards the high end of your capital range within holding by the
end of this year and with nice capital generation repaired (34:45) across the group, where
do you think you're going to be most keen to put that capital to work, say, over the next
12 to 24 months?

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Mark, thank you for your very kind words. That is appreciated. You have followed us
indeed for a long time, and I can tell you that I am also – and I had made it hopefully clear
in my introduction speech – pleased to see that we have strong earnings, strong capital
generation, but also strong growth because a strong growth is what is going to define the

FINAL

future of a company, that is going to create the cash flows of the company going forward
and, of course, paying the dividends.
So in terms of expenses, we have in place a plan that we've communicated a number of
times to effectively generate €350 million of expenses between 2016, 2017 and 2018. So
by the end of 2018, we have committed to reduce expenses further from the €170 million
that I announced we have now achieved at the third quarter to €350 million. So there still
is another €180 million to go.
Now, as you will appreciate, I cannot be more precise in saying exactly what plans will be
announced, when and where, but what I have said in my speech and I can reiterate, we
have very clear plans to achieve that additional €180 million of cost reductions, in particular
in our large businesses where the impact will be most, but in all of our businesses, we are
looking at ways to being more efficient. That efficiency is absolutely required not only
because we need to get the returns to the level where we need to get them, but also
because we need to create the room to invest in the future. We need to have a more
lean, efficient, technology-driven organization that not only serves the customers in the
more efficient way, but serves also our customers in a cheaper way and in a way our
customers are demanding for. So the plans are in place. They will be communicated in the
due time. And I can assure you, we are working very hard, and I feel confident that we will
achieve the €350 million upfront cost reductions.
Now, in terms of the capital position, we've given and set ourselves a clear target and a
priority, that is to return €2.1 billion to our shareholders over the three-year period. Still, we
have achieved a significant amount of that, but the capital that has been generated will be
returned to shareholders for us to meet our target of €2.1 billion. Thank you.

Q - Mark David Cathcart

{BIO 19783252 <GO>}

So – Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So you can't say geographic arenas where you may be looking to
make fresh investment. You've mentioned about Asia being a real critical component of
your earnings going forward.

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Well, in all our countries, we continue to grow, and I hope you see, Mark, that with the
sales we're showing is that we're not holding back on growing our business. Obviously,
we want to do that in an efficient way. We want to make sure we make our returns. And
we will continue to commit capital to those businesses that not only generate our returns,
but also fit strategically where we want to grow.
On Asia (38:07), just to take that point, as we shared with you also previously that instead
of having a capital drain of €100 million, which was kind of the old position, we have, as a
result of management actions and decisions we have taken, been more efficient, shutting
down certain businesses, taking expenses down, actually turned it around where Asia is
effectively a small capital generator.

Company N ame: Aegon N V

We also mentioned that in Asia, we're not going to chase growth in the, I would say,
traditional way where you would build up agencies which require very significant amount
of upfront capital. Now, we are looking at modern ways – new ways where we can deploy
the skills we have and technology we have to enter the market digitally which, as you
know, will have much less of capital requirements because upfront expenses and
particular acquisition expenses, like such as commissions, will not be the case here. So
there's no reason to believe that that will require a significant capital investment. It's a
very different business model.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Albert Ploegh from ING. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, all. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is on the illiquid
investment program in Holland. Can you update us what has been done in Q3 and what
are the plans for the remainder of the year, and what type of assets being bought? And
the second question is again coming back to slide 10 with some explanation on the
development of the SCR. I noticed that the own funds went down, I know of the different
impact what has also been (39:51) generate. So, yeah, what happened basically on the
own funds development during the quarter in relation to the potentially model changes
also on the group level there?
And the final questions on the macro sensitivities on the Solvency II ratio. I know it's only
disclosed two times a year, but given the model changes in the changes in the hedging
(40:16) sensitivities in the midyear still felt (40:18) or have you been positioned more to,
let's say, rising interest rates or rising equity markets compared to the first half ? Thank
you.

A - Matthew J. Rider

{BIO 20002664 <GO>}

On the first point, I think the illiquid strategy, I think it's a little bit slower than we had
expected, several hundred million but no more than that. We would expect this to
accelerate during the backend of this year and going into 2018. With respect to the SCR
and the own funds, so you rightfully point out that own funds reduced by about €300
million and that related to the dividend and that balance of it is, yeah, it's market
movements and obviously the normalized capital generation comes through. I think the
big story in the Solvency ratio is the reduction in SCR and the major model improvements
had a major impact there with 6 percentage points. And, yeah, for the rest of it, we just
have to recognize that our position for own funds going forward is we recognize that this

Page 14 of 25

is an important valuation metric, and that we are committed to growing our own funds in

Thank you. Our next question comes from Bart Horsten from Kempen. Please go ahead.

Q - Bart Horsten

{BIO 2390919 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Well, first on the Solvency II position
and at the half year numbers, you gave us more guidance on your group capital zones.
And well, from the positive development we've seen, you're now already close to your
opportunity bucket in this capital zone. And I was wondering could you please remind us
what this would mean if you would go above the 200% level and what we can expect
there.
Secondly, you had very impressive growth – deposit growth. Unfortunately, still the lapses
from the Mercer account made that you come out with a net decline. I was wondering we
know about the decline at the Mercer, but what's the absolute amount you still expect to
lapse at the Mercer so that we can see some net growth going forward?
And my final question relates to your decision to stop publishing quarterly results. I was
wondering what's the reasoning behind that. And well, that's the question. Thank you.

A - Matthew J. Rider

{BIO 20002664 <GO>}

With respect to the Solvency II position, yeah, the top end of the range is 200%. We're
approaching that now. Technically, that puts us – if we get above that level, then it puts us
into what we call the opportunity zone. Opportunity does not mean immediate
deployment. So we will take the opportunities as they come and decide what we want to
do with the excess capital once we get over that level.
With respect to the gross deposits, yes, you're right in saying that it was a fantastic
growth deposit quarter. But obviously on the net side, we lost about $13.6 billion in assets
related to the Mercer outflows. We would expect something on that order to occur again
in the fourth quarter. And then after that, it should be – that should be done.
Now with respect to publishing semiannual results and moving away from quarterly
results, I think basically all European insurers or most of them have recognized that this is
an extremely long-term business, and certainly our investors and other stakeholders are
long term in nature. So we think that we can do a better job in giving you more
Page 15 of 25



Company N ame: Aegon N V

substantive information on a semiannual basis, not have to deal with such quarterly
fluctuations. And in the meantime, we can take the time that we will save to actually
improve running the businesses. And I think that's an important thing going forward.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Arjan van Veen from UBS.

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

Thank you, gentlemen. Most of my questions have been answered. Just two follow-ups,
firstly on cost savings. You highlighted you're halfway into that program, and you're
confident in terms of achieving your target. I just wanted to just follow up in terms of how
it's flowing through the P&L. I assume there's a bit of a lag, so just a bit of color around
how it then flows through and how we should think about the underlying earnings with
those things coming through.
And the second question was on the U.S. tax reform. Given the proposals have now been
put out, can you give us a bit of a color how that impacts your business, i.e., where are

Page 16 of 25



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2017-11-09

your effective tax rates today, whether that improves, and also the impact on any
deferred tax assets you may have on the balance sheet in the U.S. business. Thank you.

FINAL

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Yeah. As I said, we are halfway what I think is a very ambitious cost reduction program,
€170 million out of €350 million. We have also now – and we made good progress in
defining and setting the plans for the remaining €180 million, of which of course a big part
is in the U.S. As you know, we have €300 million of cost reductions for the U.S. What I can
say on how they will flow through earnings is that we expect that the remaining part of the
cost reduction, particularly those in the U.S., will, for a big part, flow back through earnings.
So you'll see them coming through to earnings and that will support obviously not only
earnings, but also our targets in terms of return on equity.
Now, on the...

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

Is it fair to say that the amounts you've achieved today, they are not fully sort of flowing
through? That's one of my questions.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

It's fair to say that the amount – I think it's fair to say that the amount that we have seen
today is probably for flowing through earnings for around half of it. I think that's fair
assessment. And then the remaining, as I said, we expect a bigger part, clearly a bigger
part to flow through earnings. We'll provide you, obviously, with more updates when we
come with plans and when we announce them also to the market, but as you can imagine,
we got to deal with this first internally before we deal with that externally.

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

In terms of taxes, unfortunately – I wish I could say more, and I also wish we would know
more. It is a very fluid situation. Yes, there's been a headline proposal for a tax reduction
in corporate tax rate, which. as I think we will all agree, is a positive. It's a positive for the
economy, therefore it's a positive for our business. It's going to be meaning, less taxes on
our earnings, less taxes on our cash flows. But what we're also seeing is that there's a lot
of discussion back and forth about how these tax cuts are going to be financed, and to
what extent the insurance industry is going to be impacted from that. It's way too early
now to give you any impression. It is a very fluid situation, which we're following very
closely.
I can also say that not only are we following very closely, but the CEO of our U.S. business,
Mark Mullin, is the Chairman of ACLI, so he's directly involved. It is important for us as it is
important for the whole sector, but with the situation right now, there's absolutely nothing
more we can say other than that lower corporate tax is a positive, and we need to make
Page 17 of 25



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2017-11-09

sure that the way that it gets financed is not going to impact our industry. That's really
where we are today.

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

FINAL

Is it possible to give us some indication where the effective tax rate is because just
looking historically it does bounce around a bit from the U.S. business?

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Yeah. I think that's a good point. The effective tax rate effectively is 27%. So, what you see
in many cases when taxes are coming down, and by the way, the same applies to the
Netherlands, they take the headline number down, but they take away deductions. So,
ultimately, it's very important to see what all the rules are and exactly how they get
applied to understand what the impact is because even from 35% to 27%, as you see,
there is already quite a big gap because we are running now at 27% roughly.

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

Yeah. Fair point. Thank you, Alex.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Gordon Aitken from RBC. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks very much. Three questions, please. First, on the UK platform business. I
mean these flows are good and the annuity assets are now in excess of £110 billion. But
pension's earnings were just £8 million in the quarter. Is this the run rate or whether oneoff effect in that number?
And second question on the Dutch market, and obviously you've been looking at
assumptions. But can you talk a bit about mortality assumptions you're using and is there
potential gains to come there still from moving to a new table due to the slowdown in life
expectancy improvements that we've seen in the last few years?
And the final question is on the Dutch and defined benefit pensions book. It's obviously a
spread business and you've been talking about you move away from spread. And what
proportion of the Dutch reserves at the moment are spread or defined benefit? And
could you offload that book and would you want to offload that book? Thank you.

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Yeah. On the platform, Gordon, yes, we are making, I think, really good progress with the
platform in terms of getting close. Equally importantly, we're also making good progress
of moving our Cofunds customers onto our platform. As you can imagine, that is kind of a
big exercise. I think it's important that you look at close into the platform in a positive
sense, but also looking at the fact that we've seen outflows being very limited. Actually,
where – on the Mercer deal, we were expecting outflows and anticipated them. We see in
Page 18 of 25



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2017-11-09

FINAL

the Mercer deal more outflows than we are anticipating. Here, with Cofunds, it's been the
other way around. I think the customers (51:03) the customers are very pleased with what
they're getting from us, from Aegon. We are definitely seeing less outflows.
Yeah, in term of the splits between what is, we call, pension and life, I'll refer you back to
IR (51:17), but I think that you can say that the earnings, which we have shown in the third
quarter, are a pretty good indicator of what we would expect the run rate going forward.
But you should also take into account that we also announced that the integration of
Cofunds on to our platform is going to yield additional cost savings.
So, the run rate will start increasing when these cost savings all are being realized over
the course of 2018. And the amount, which we put in the presentation when we did the
acquisition of Cofunds, shared with you, was around £60 million and we're still committed
to deliver on that £60 million.
On UK, yes, I think you were talking about improvements in mortality, people living this
long. That is in particular a positive impact for annuity business rather than it has an impact
on business we have, because, as you know, we have actually disposed of our annuity
business. By the way...

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

No, the question was about the Dutch market.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Oh, the Dutch market, in the Netherlands?

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

So, in the Netherlands, we've seen improvement. I think what we see is too early now to
say there is a reversal of a trend. Yes, we have seen an improvement. We had apparently
some colder winters. We had more flu than usual. I mean, this is the kind of explanations
I'm getting and these explanations are in my view too early to say there's a reversal of a
trend. But it's clear that we have, indeed, effectively had benefit from, call it, improved
longevity. In other words, people living a little bit less longer than we were anticipated. But
I would caution really on trying to get a sense that this is a longer-term trend. It's too early
to say that. In any case, we have build up the right reserves.
And I think your final question was about where is earnings coming? In the Netherlands,
the biggest part of earnings is, indeed, still coming from our defined benefit books. That
is by far the biggest part. We are seeing there the positive impact of what you just
mentioned, some improvement indeed in the longevity, people living less longer.

We have a significant book that is going to run off over time and actually, we haven't had
many new customers and buyouts on our book, particularly with very low interest rates
makes it very challenging to make that an attractive proposition, but I also like to point
that, for us, it's important to not only have this book that is a very positive book that's
running off, it's that we are building the capabilities for the future and that is our defined
contribution business. You'll hear more about that when you get the presentation.
Hopefully you'll be here in The Hague to hear from my Dutch colleagues. The DC
business, the hybrid Stap, we talked about that earlier where we provide the
administration for smaller pension funds, again, a fee business.
So, we are really moving, trying to not only protect the spread business, which we have
built over the time, but very – also much focus on building the fee business in the pension
business, which we believe is going to be the future, in particular, was mentioned earlier,
with the Dutch government, we have a new Dutch government that has announced a
number of steps in changing the pension world from what we would call average
premiums in the pensions toward individual premiums.
They have also now agreed that individuals can set up an individual pension products,
which will be managed individually, very much in line what you see in the UK. So, this clearly
is a trend of accelerating now and the government has taken steps that will make you
accelerate even further the shift towards DC from DB, but also the individualization,
meaning that people will have themselves take more responsibility. They will have to take,
first of all, make choices. They will have to be educated and they will have to take
decisions as to how they will manage the pension products and in particular how they will
do the drawdowns. That is really the sweet spot of our strategy here in the Netherlands,
but again, as I said earlier, I hope you will be here in The Hague to hear from them.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

I mean just to follow up on that. I mean, you sold your spread business in the UK. I mean,
there was buyers for that business and more than one. I mean, would you sell your spread
business in the Dutch market? Is it because there's no buyers or is there another reason
you like that business?

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Well, I would say that in the UK, we were pleased to sell our annuity business, spread
business. We were pleased also with the price we got for it. I would say there are buyers,
but I think that the universe as buyers is probably smaller than everybody believes it is.
And, therefore, seeing in the Netherlands at this point in time, we have not really seen
buyers in this universe. And again, we're always looking at the best way of allocating our
capital. If there would be options effectively to offload some of it and create capital
synergies, we should reconsider that, but I can tell you at this point in time, I have not
seen anything viable that we should be looking at.
Not surprised, because effectively in our pension business, you get underwriting risk, you
get market risk and we took about quite significant exposures, which we haven't seen in
any other place at this point in time being interested (56:34).

Thank you. Our next question today comes from Andy Hughes, Macquarie. Please go
ahead.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks very much. On the €2.1 billion by the end of 2018, I think that's more than €900
million supposed to return to (56:56) shareholders. I'm just wondering, does that mean
you're expecting €900 million to be upstreamed to the holding company between now
and the end of 2018?

Bloomberg Transcript

And given the way in which the operating earnings appears to be developing, are you sort
of thinking more about increasing the kind of base dividend level as a way of returning
that or is it going to be mainly through some sort of capital return? And then, are you
planning further disposals to get to that or does that come in entirely organic?
And I think the final question is, on the half year, you obviously put in the higher cash flow
target for 2018. Looking at particularly the market movements and increase in fee income,
which should be recurring I guess, depending where some of the (57:45) markets going
forward, is it fair to say that you are ahead of where you thought you would be on that
target so far? Thank you.

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

So, Andy, thanks for your question. The €2.1 billion is a commitment and a target we have
set. We will take our dividend in – I would say, the final dividend in 2017 entering for (58:13)
2018 to the level that is required to bring it to the €2.1 billion. I think it is very easy to
calculate it back. That is very much supported by flows, which we are getting from our
business units. Because you know in the U.S., we have a capital generation of $1 billion, of
which 90% has been upstreamed and with an excellent record for which we are very
pleased.
The Netherlands, we've also guided you on our dividend. We've mentioned there would
be €100 million interim dividend, the first half of 2018. The UK now that we have
addressed, I would say, the sale of the annuity book, and we are integrating Cofunds with
our platform, we expect actually, with the level of solvency, which we are at and I guided
you to the 200% level to effectively upstream most, if not all, of the cash that's being
generated. So, there's around £100 million as you know. And for the rest, we've been
quite consistent of upstreaming dividends from asset management of around £100
million (59:15). The rest of Europe has been around €5 million (59:18).

FINAL

And in Asia, while we used to be consuming capital at the tune of €100 million (59:23) a
year, we actually had a one-off dividend and we are now capital generative. So, if you add
it all up, you, I think, will see very easily that the flows that we are expecting from our units
will more than cover what is needed for the dividend and will also actually increase the
buffer we have at the holding, and therefore, increase the flexibility we have.
Now, we have given you an indication of our cash flow targets for 2018. These are
supported, as you rightly point out, by good market conditions, more fees, but also, are
supported by the management actions we're taking to take our expenses down, because
they will not only flow on earnings, but they will, of course, also flow into the capital
generation. But I think it's now about delivering on 2018. And yes, I hope we can over
deliver. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Robin van den Broek from Mediobanca. Please
go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Robin van den Broek

{BIO 17002948 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. We just like to circle back to the tax reform in the U.S.,
because you've mentioned an effective tax rate of 27%. But I think for your required
capital, you're using a 35% tax rate. And I would say that also assuming the DTA write-offs
that's connected to a potential tax cut, you could see a hit to your RBC ratio between 75
and 100 percentage points, which is also consistent with what two peers in the U.S. have
indicated as a potential hit. So, the number you recognize (01:01:01) first of all.
And secondly, do you think the NAIC will provide any tools to navigate through this
potential hit for the industry?
And thirdly, what could the Dutch Central Bank do? You've just been through a process
where the calibration of the RBC ratio basically has been changed. I was wondering how
did that process exactly look like and how difficult was it to get approval for Dutch Central
Bank to revise that?
And how does all of these feed into your – you're close to your opportunity buckets of
200%, is there any buffer you want to keep with regard to this potential capital distortion
coming from the U.S.? Thank you.

I think maybe the first point is a tax bill does not a law make (01:02:01). So, we are still
early stages here with respect to even looking at what the proposed bill might be, how
that is going to be treated. So, you mentioned quite a number of effective tax rates and

DTA write-offs and implications for the RBC ratio, but I think it's a bit too early to comment
on that kind of thing.

FINAL

One thing I would say, and we've commented on this before, that if there was a change
to the DTAs and in fact, RBC ratios came down, I think the first reaction would be – in the
U.S. life industry would be sort of a rebasing of what is acceptable capital for U.S. life
insurance companies. So, that would be the first point.
The NAIC ultimately may make changes to required capital in response to that, but again
that's sort of a second-order effect and we wouldn't comment on it. At this point, we
don't think that there would be any – we're not holding any extra buffers for tax reform
changes nor would we expect to see any changes in dividend repatriations from the U.S.
or what we give to our shareholders.
In terms of the calibration that we did with DNB, I think that what we had shown at the
time was that we basically looked at European peers and how their conversion was
coming in the Solvency II. And they were quite interested and understanding how other
European regulators were treating it. So, we did a kind of a balanced approach. The idea
was level playing field.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, one thing we did agree with them is to the extent that there are substantial changes
to, let's say, the structure of U.S. risk-based capital, then we would go back and then we
would re-discuss what the appropriate effect on our own conversion would be. And I think
that should be about it. Thanks.

Thank you. Our final question today comes from Ashik Musaddi from JPMorgan.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi. Good morning, Alex. Good morning, Matt. Just couple of questions I have. One
is, I mean, it looks like your solvency ratio is 195% on the top end of the range. So, would
you say that the capital debate is now more or less over and if couple of quarters you can
stay there, this would not become an issue at least in your internal discussions, et cetera,
so we move away from capital debate. Will that be a fair expectation?
Second thing is can you just remind us about capital generation and how much will that
capital generation covert into cash? I mean, the numbers keep on changing, so just a
reminder would be great as to what is the conversion from that.
And thirdly, can you give us some color about what is your hedging policy at the moment
for the Dutch business? I remember you had Solvency II ratio-based hedging rather than

cash flow hedging. So, if you can remind on that, the only thing I'm trying to look for is if
interest rates were to rise here in Europe, will that feed through in your capital benefit or
not, i.e. if your Solvency II based hedge rising interest rate is a very good news? So, any
color on these three questions would be great. Thank you.

Ashik, I think that you say it rightly. The capital debate is over. With 190% in the
Netherlands, the capital debate is certainly over and behind us. This was our objective in
Q2. I think we wanted to make that very clear. Matt and I, to the regulator, to all our
stakeholders internally, externally, including you of course saying that discussion on the
capital is a distraction from where we need to focus our efforts in growing our business
and serving our customers. So, to me, the debate is over and I also expect it to remain
over for the foreseeable future.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, on capital generation, I thought I had just expressed it earlier is you're well aware of
the numbers, I'll repeat it very quickly then if you want. We said $1 billion capital generation
in dollars from the U.S., $900 million upstream. From the Netherlands, we've mentioned
€100 million interim dividend. The UK we said the cash flow of around €100 million should
be entirely (01:06:19) tangible, and therefore, sent to the holding.
And the other asset management and rest of Europe are unchanged at effectively
dividends in holding of respectively €150 million. And the difference being that we are not
anymore expecting to put amounts of capital in our Asian business, where the minus €100
million a year, which as you know, we had kind of indicated a year ago, has turned into a
slight positive actually as a result of the management actions we are taking. So, I think that
picture hopefully is clear.
Now, in terms of hedging, you're right, we do hedge our capital position in the
Netherlands interest rate from a Solvency II point of view, but you never hedge all the
impacts. The secondary order (01:07:06) impacts that you don't hedge, there is the risk
margin that you don't hedge. So, the answer is that when rates, and hopefully rates will
start moving up in Europe, you will see a very clear benefit in both our capital generation
and in the level of capital.
Capital generation becomes a drag in relation to the UFR is going to reduce and the
Solvency II capital, because we are not entirely hedged on the Solvency II base, but we
only hedge our capital. And therefore, big parts are not hedged. It will also mean that
there is a positive sensitivity to interest rates. So, let's hope for these interest rates to
move up.

Thank you. This was the last question. Thank you for, again, your interest in the company. I
really hope to see you next time in our offices here in The Hague when we'll have the

Dutch management, because I can tell you that there's very exciting story to tell about the
opportunities we have here in the Dutch business, the pension business and the steps we
are taking here to really also work on innovation. That's going to be big part of the
presentation.

FINAL

So, I look forward to seeing you there in The Hague and take care for today.
