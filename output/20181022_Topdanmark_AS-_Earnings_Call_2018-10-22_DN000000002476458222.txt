Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everybody, and good morning to the USA. We thank you for joining us
in this conference call. I'm Peter Hermann; and with me is Lars Thykier, CFO; and Steﬀen
Heegaard, Group Communications and HR Director. We are holding this conference
because earlier today, we published our interim report for the quarter one to quarter
three 2018.
And we are now ready to answer your questions, so please ask them one at a time.
Operator, may we have the ﬁrst question? Thank you.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Mads
Thinggaard from ABG. Please go ahead, your line is now open for your question.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Yeah, hi. This is Mads from ABG. Thanks for taking my questions. The ﬁrst one I have is on
the -- I guess, what you call the underlying claims trend. It seems to be much better here
in Q3 than were the case Q2. I don't know, if you could put a bit of ﬂavor on, I mean, the
moving parts, why the kind of underlying claims are so much better here in Q3?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

FINAL

We have couple of diﬀerent -- what -- okay. Yeah, a couple of diﬀerent reasons. One is that
personal costs or cost for personal transportation has performed a little better than
expected and we have seen a better development on theft as well. And then on top of
this, we have the change in risk margin. On the other hand, we have seen piping being a
little more expensive than expected in the prognosis.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Okay. And what about the ﬁnance in this kind of the underlying, not the large claim part
for this part, is there any change here?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

No, the ﬁre level, which are not big declines is more or less in line with what was
expected.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Okay, thanks. Then my second question is on the downgrade you made -- make
fewer life insurance income on page 10 in the report. I can see -- I mean, when you came
with the improved guidance, it was very much related to better proﬁts from sales and
admin. I can see you did actually make a 5 million proﬁt from that area in Q3. Could you
kind of help with -- I mean, why did you downgrade the guidance to the 220 million to
250 million for '18 now? And what should we expect kind of in a normal year normalized
life income pre-tax proﬁt? Thanks.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Yeah. There's a couple of reasons for the downgrade. One is -- one of the thing is actually
a positive thing is that when we do have transfers from customers leaving September, we
get normally a transfer fee. And we've seen this here that we have lower transfers out of
September, meaning that we get lower fees, but that will also, on the ﬁrst year here, will
have a negative impact on the cost result. But that would, of course, be a better thing
going forward. That's one aspect. The other aspect is that we are in the process of
developing and implementing a whole new operational system for our life company and
we can see that we need more resources to be able to do that testing and so on to be
able to introduce at the right time next year. So in quarter four, we will have more
expenses on people side that will deteriorate the sales and the sales results -- sales and
administrative results.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

And we will see these extra expenses continuing to 2019, where we expect to spend more
money on launching the system. But in the '20 or '21 at the latest, we'll see the
administrative easing come through as lower expenses.

thanks.

Operator

FINAL

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please go
ahead, your line is now open for your question.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. Just one actually. So could you please update us
on pricing and claims inﬂation trends across key lines? And where are you pricing versus
claims inﬂation at the moment? Thank you.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

We haven't made any changes in our pricing, so it's very much as it was before. We can
see that physical claims of -- physical damage in motor is going wrong way, so to speak.
And we can see that the savings we have made on handling claims and houses do not
result in the savings we would have expected, and that is probably due to this claims
inﬂation. But it is not a matter that we are very concerned about and we do not intend to
increase prices due to the pretty small changes we've seen.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We could add to that the automatic indexation, which covers up for the claims inﬂation
goes up from 1.6% this year to 2.0% next year.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

And this will hit around 70% of the portfolio.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay. So pricing roughly in line with claims inﬂation then, is that a fair representation?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Yeah. In that -- I mean, in that instance, we've obviously seen quite strong improvement in
the underlying come through, which is obviously driven by self-help improvement in the
claims, handling, et cetera. Do you -- would you expect that to continue going forwards?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

So continued improvement here from self-help measures?

FINAL

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

That was the idea. We launched a project a couple -- in 2016, where we wanted to
rationalize our operations. We are still working on it and we are still spending on it. But
sooner or later, we'll be through, then we -- and we'll do something else, but this project
at least will end in substantial beneﬁts.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

All right. Great, thanks very much.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Youdish Chicooree from
Autonomous Research.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everyone. I have got two questions, please. The ﬁrst one is on claims
inﬂation. You mentioned that the automatic premium indexing for next year will cover
claims inﬂation broadly speaking. Could you split out the level of inﬂation you're seeing in
motor and property, please? And then my second question is just a clariﬁcation on your
combined ratio guidance for next year. I mean, am I right to think that you are assuming 1
percentage point improvement in the underlying loss ratio for next year?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Sorry, I didn't get the last one.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Your combined ratio guidance for next year, does that -- what kind of underlying
improvement do you assume in that forecast?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

That is a combination of the lower claims handlings cost, a little lower expense ratio, but I
remind you that we are still guiding around 16 for 2019 and there's a slight improvement
in risk.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Fine. Okay, understood.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Page 4 of 12



Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity
Date: 2018-10-22

And I'm afraid that I can't give you any precise estimates of the how the claims inﬂation is
in diﬀerent business lines. Of course, we can see that a comprehensive is -- so it's clearly
above general inﬂation, while on the other hand the personal injury is falling.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. All right, understood. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Haywood from HSBC. Please
go ahead, your line is now open.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Excellent. Thanks very much. Can I just conﬁrm a couple of things you've already said. The
2% indexation you said, you say -- will that actually oﬀset the increase you're seeing from
most damage claims?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Yes. Actually I should mention that we have another index and workers compensation and
this will, as a starting point, increase workers compensation premiums to the tune of 9%.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

9.0%, yeah?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

And your 2019 combined ratio guidance of 89% to 90%, excluding one-oﬀ, that's
improved from the 90% to 91% averaging forecast for 2018. I wonder, if you can say how
much of this is driven by the claims initiatives and actions you've done and how much is
driven by interest rates going up slightly?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

I think the impact from the change in interest rates is pretty small actually.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Okay, that's good to know. Do you provide or can you provide any guidance on run-oﬀs
for 2019?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Unfortunately not. We're not supposed to know anything about run-oﬀs in '19.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Okay. And the last question. EIOPA published a technical document for the Danish
risk-free rate and volatility adjustment on the 14th of August. You haven't put any change
through your earnings this quarter. What is Topdanmark waiting for or what is the
regulator waiting for to include the new volatility adjustment?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

I think they probably have done or made some mistakes in the ﬁrst place and then they
have tried to correct these mistakes and we are waiting for EIOPA to be completely sure
about what they should ask us for. And if they -- what I think is likely ends up with the
volatility adjustment of, say, 10 or 15 basis points, we will probably have this hit spread
over a couple of years.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Okay. And then -- sorry, you said 10 to 15 basis points down or to 10 to 15 basis points?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

That is my guess. I don't know. We have not received any information yet.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thank you very much for your help.

Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from the line of Asbjorn
Mork from Danske Bank. Please go ahead, your line is now open.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Yes, good afternoon. A couple of small questions from my side. First of all, on the life
expectancy changes from the Danish FSA, you mentioned in the report that the workers
compensation impact that it has, it sounds like it's rather small. But could you just quantify
this? And then, while we are talking life expectancy, maybe a bit of comments on how this
impacts your life insurance operations.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

It doesn't impact our life insurance operations, it was just a question of us using T-82 in
the workers compensation. We -- and actually, it has a very small impact because we just
move one buﬀer to another place, so to speak. We had a buﬀer for longevity, it was just
not speciﬁc. Now, it is speciﬁed on the cash ﬂows. So really, it is -- it doesn't cost anything.
If it's -- it's combined ratio would be low.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

But very small, I guess?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

It will be around -- impact on combined ratio, it's hard to do calculations, this calculation
on the top of my head. A couple of points actually.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

FINAL

A couple of points, I mean --

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

On combined ratio.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Couple percentage points or a couple of basis points?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Percentage points.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Well, okay. Okay, fair enough. Then on weather claims. So basically no weather
claims in the ﬁrst three quarters. If I remember correct, I think you said at Q2 that we
should expect some weather claims because some of these ﬁre risks, you would also
probably classify as weather claims. Maybe you could just tell me how you actually classify
weather claims? Thanks.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

We haven't had any weather claims in Q3.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Not exactly, yeah. But you -- I remember, you said in Q2 that you could have some of the
ﬁre claims could be booked as weather claims or maybe I misunderstood at Q2.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Yeah. Maybe you did. There are -- sometimes the ﬁre claims will be driven by weather. If
we have a small ﬁre and a storm, then this will be big ﬁre. And in that case, we will still
regard it as a ﬁre claim.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Okay, fair enough. Then on your presentation slide nine, the retention ratio is sort of
indexed at a 101.6. Maybe you could just tell me what is the retention actually in
percentage?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Page 7 of 12



Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity

I don't think we provide that information.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

No.

FINAL

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

But it's well known that this is above 90 in the private lines.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Well above 90.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Okay, excellent. And then a ﬁnal question from my side on the slide 11 on the motor
insurance, the risk premium. Well, it seems as if your risk premium is actually pretty low
that of your peers. Maybe, I'm not reading it correctly, but I would assume, considering
that you have very limited leasing activities that you would actually have higher risk
premium?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

You are reading it correctly. That is -- that we have avoided parts of the market and this is
the part of the market, where the risk premium is too high compared to the actual
premium.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Okay, okay. I understand, okay. It's perfect. Thank you. That was all from my side.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca.
Please go ahead, your line is now open for your question.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yeah. So thanks very much. Good afternoon, everybody. So my question was actually -- I
mean, have been addressed a little bit, but I'll just follow up. So if I were to look at slide 11
of the webcast presentation today or maybe even the roadshow presentation actually,
there was trending risk on motor. Which one of these lines is the one which is causing this
positive eﬀect in 3Q, please if you could comment because I think these starts are only
running up to beginning of '18 from what it looked like? If you could just comment on
where this thing is coming from the positivity in 3Q, please?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

I think -- sorry, but I'll have to ask you to repeat, please.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Repeat the question? Oh, apologies. So I was on slide 11 in the roadshow presentation.
And my question was, so which -- obviously, there's been a pretty reasonably good trend
in motor that you talked about --

FINAL

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

No, no. I think I got your point now. It is not recently, it has been developing since 2013,
which we changed our tariﬀs in 2013. And since then, we have seen this development.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

But in 3Q, there was an oﬀsetting positive motor eﬀect, wasn't there?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Okay. That's what you are talking about, but that's a pretty small amount. And if you're
looking at Q1 to Q3, it is actually negative.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay. Okay. And could you please comment on theft, please? So there was also mention
that theft claims -- are these usually random or is there some phenomenon there that we
should be noting?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

We have seen a very systematic decrease in the risk -- the six claims since 2010. Every year
has been better than the year before during these 10 years or nine years. Sooner or later,
this will end and we will see claims rise again. That's usual pattern that we see this long
waves of increasing theft and decreasing theft, but now we've had this -- the nine very
good years and we see no signs that '19 should be worse than '18.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

So you have a ﬂat assumption for theft next year, generally speaking?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

That is what is -- of course, this is our prognosis.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

All right. Thank you very much.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Welcome.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Wajahat Rizvi from Deutsche Bank.
Please go ahead, your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Just a couple of questions quickly. One is in terms
of your underlying loss ratio improvement, you have talked somewhere about reduced
risk margin contributing to lowest claims trend. Can you just please explain what you
mean by reduced risk margin? Is this some change in your bookings assumptions or is
there something else?
And secondly, just to follow up on Steven's question on EIOPA's change in VA. Can you
quantify based on these new numbers what the impact on solvency will be? And from
what time do you expect this impact to come through? I think you said there will be two
years transitional period through that. So just a bit more certainty on timing and quantum
would be helpful. Thank you.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

If I may ask -- or may answer your last question ﬁrst. I'd like to stress very much that I know
nothing, I'm guessing. I don't know when we'll hear anything, I don't know how long the
transition period would be and I don't know the size of the change, we will see. But if the
volatility adjustment is changed, it will cost around 4.5 million after-tax per basis point. But
on the other hand, this is a one-oﬀ, it will be easier for us to cover the return on the
liabilities in the future with the lower volatility adjustment.

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

And then you asked about the risk margin.

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

The risk margin, that is an amount that we have put aside, which must be suﬃcient to
cover the price of own funds in all-time until our reserves have run completely oﬀ, if
somebody should buy the reserves from us. And the fact of the risk margin depends on
the SCR we have. And we have recalculated some of our business lines among others,
working compensation and the content in the internal model and this has led to lower
SCR. Since SCR is lower, the risk margin is lowered as well. When the risk margin is
lowered, some of it goes into the claims that was -- that is -- the risk marketing is covered
by both premium reserves and the claims reserves. So when it is reduced, this change is
split between the premium reserves and the claims reserves. So this is a part of the

Page 10 of 12



Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity
Date: 2018-10-22

reduction in the risk margin that comes out in the claims reserves that you -- that is in part
of the explanation for the impact on claims trend.

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. So your change in solvency to assumptions is also changing your IFRS claims trend?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Sorry?

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

So the change in SCR assumptions and risks margin in Solvency II is also changing your
claims trend in IFRS reserves?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

And how much is the impact from the change in the current claims trend improvement
just in Q3?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

In Q3, it was 28 million.

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And as there are no further questions at this time, I'll
