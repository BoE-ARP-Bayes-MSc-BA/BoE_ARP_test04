Topdanmark's Q3 Results for 2016 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a
listen-only mode, and there'll be a presentation followed by a question-and-answer
session. I must advise you the conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, the 15th of
November, 2016.
I'd now like to hand over to your speaker today to Christian Sagild. Please go ahead, sir.

Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everybody, and good morning to the USA. And thank you for joining us
in this conference call. Usually, we publish our ﬁnancial report around noon CET.
However, today's board meeting has been scheduled for the afternoon and,
consequently, today's conference call takes place at 6 o'clock CET.
With me, as usual, Lars Thykier, our CFO; and Steﬀen Heegaard, who is Head of Investor

Q&A
Operator

FINAL

We can indeed, sir. I will just announce them for you. Now then, from ABG your ﬁrst
question comes from line of Jakob Brink. And your line is now open.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Thank you very much, and good evening. Just a few questions and I'll take them one at a
time. So the ﬁrst thing is, you state in 2017 outlook that you expect a continued decline in
the average premiums on motor. But at the same time, you're stating quite clearly that
you can't see an up-tick in the claims inﬂation on motor. How should I read those two?
Thank you.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

That was in motor claims?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

We still expect...

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Hello?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Yes. Jakob, sorry. We're still expecting that premiums will continue downwards because of
the tariﬀs, where we see that the inﬂow of new business in motor is more related to small
and safer cars. Thus, the average premium will drop. We are seeing right now some
increased frequencies in motor, or increased risk premium in motors. So we haven't
crunched the data, so we don't know exactly the reason why we see this up-tick. It is not
related to personal injury in motor, it's related to more to comprehensive.
And I think that this is a reﬂection of what other insurance companies have seen as well in
Q3, where sort of unawareness accidents in car and also the fact that we see some
increased average claims due to that. Even smaller accidents like just a bump in the dent,
or a dent in the bumper, would require more expensive claims to ﬁx them. So it's a
combination of those two. But we do expect that premiums will continue to drop
somewhat.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

So you have no ambitions of increasing premiums on sort of the older part to take into
account the higher inﬂation?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

FINAL

We do not have any price initiatives in the draw at this time.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

And my second question also on premiums, please. You state that – I think you stated
something like that you expect the last of the larger industrial customers that have left the
book by end this year, if I don't – yeah. And you have often mentioned the Norwegian
Protector is being very aggressive in the Danish market. As far as I understand, they had a
fairly weak Q3 in Denmark and also I do understand that there could be some premium
hikes underway. Is that something that you're sensing maybe that the market is getting a
bit better again on the industrial side?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The Protector part was relating to the workers' comp, and we do sense that Protector –
well, we have realized, as many others, that Protector did produce some quite nasty
results in their Danish operations. And we think that this might be – that probably will
reﬂect a somewhat less competitive behavior from Protector's side. We'll have to see that.
We've stated that we lost some of the large industrial clients, and this is incorporated in
our guidance for 2017. This is not a reﬂection of the Protector behavior in the market.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

But still, you basically haven't seen any change to the competitive situation yet?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

No.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

No. Okay. And then ﬁnally just a small piece of question. Could you tell me how much
have been the discounting impact on the combined ratio in Q3 2016 compared to Q3
2015, just the quarter? Thank you.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Was that 0.2%? Interest rates were up somewhat. I think it was...

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

It was 0.2% in the year quarter. In the quarter, it's 0.5%.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}
Page 3 of 11



Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity
Date: 2016-11-15

Okay. So basically you had a 0.5 percentage point positive impact on the combined ratio
this quarter compared to Q3 last year.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

FINAL

That's right.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. Thanks a lot. And that was my questions. Many thanks.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Thank you.

Operator
Thank you very much indeed, sir. Now your next question from Danske Bank comes from
the line of Asbjørn Mørk. And your line is now open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Yes. Good evening. A couple of questions from my side as well. I am going to take them
one at a time as well. First, going back to your top line, your assumptions for ﬂat
premiums next year. So you're saying that the motor insurance will be under pressure. I
was just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit where do you see sort of an upwards
trend? Is it going to be the same things that we've seen during 2016 or anything else is
changing there? Thank you.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Well, basically, we see that in the private lines area we have had full market pressure now.
We have been under some strain in the private lines area because of a lot of agents being
involved in education in the new distribution model. So we have full market pressure right
now. But basically, the zero stems from the index. There is an assumed index of 1.8%
coming January, and that indexation of premiums relates to roughly 75% of our book. So
that'll produce a 1.3% growth.
The motor insurance, we assume an eﬀect of a 1 percentage point negative growth due to
the decline in average premium. We see that we have this loss of unproﬁtable industrial
customers, which will aﬀect us negatively 0.7%. And then, we have this general
improvement in personal, agricultural and SME, which produces a 0.4% positive growth.
So it's altogether 1.7% positive, 1.7% negative. So it's around zero.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
But if I can understand you correctly, if you didn't have this sort of spillover eﬀect from
your sales force, then your premiums would be down next year versus 2016. Is that
correctly understood?

Page 4 of 11



Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity
Date: 2016-11-15

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

FINAL

No. I mean, the general improvement in personal, agricultural and SME would be
somewhere in the line of 0.4%. And, of course, with an eﬀect of 0.7% from larger clients
leaving us, you could say that we would be slightly negative. But, as you know, it's not
rocket science at this point in time how premiums will develop in 2017.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

And then, you can actually see that the momentum we have seen improving during 2016
is continuing in the private lines, SME market and agriculture lines.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Okay. Fair enough. And then a question on your cost side and also relating to the
announcement you had in early October. You're saying that there is more to do on the
digital side, could you sort of elaborate a little bit about where do you see this potential if
you look more than just a couple of quarters ahead?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

I think this was – basically, it was just a cautionary remark. We do have a forecast, but we
know that we're going to do diﬀerent things. But we don't know exactly how much it's
going to cost and how big the beneﬁts will be. And we can't (09:37) put them precisely
time wise.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
But would you expect lower reported cost for the coming years?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

I expect the trend in costs to be downwards, but I won't rule out that there are single
quarters where the expense ratio will be higher than it were in 2016.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Okay. Fair enough. And then, a ﬁnal question on your slide 11 on the buyback program.
Just wondering the DKK 200 million that you opted buyback program with you're saying
this will take place in 2017. So do you think that this will take place before your AGM and
how do you see the increased buyback in the context to the big shareholder
announcement that you had a couple of weeks ago?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

We don't have very strong ideas about the share buyback after the general meeting. So,
yes, we do assume that is DKK 200 million will be bought before for the AGM.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Okay. Thank you very much.

Thank you very much indeed, sir. Now from SEB your next question comes from the line of
Per Grønborg. And your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Per Grønborg
Thank you. It's Per from SEB. A couple of questions from my side.

Operator
I beg your pardon, Per. My mistake.

Q - Per Grønborg
That's okay.

Operator
Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per Grønborg
Couple of questions from my side as well. The ﬁrst one probably pretty easy. Thank you
very much for giving us the net eﬀect of large claims. What are your expectations of large
claims and normal run rate per quarter. Just like you're giving for weather-related claims,
can you give any numbers what we should expect the run rate for this to be?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

No. We don't have that ﬁgure.

Q - Per Grønborg
Okay. Then to Asbjørn's question, payout, it sounds like you will not take any actions and
see what happens at the AGM next spring. Is that correctly understood or should we
expect Topdanmark (11:46) take action and maybe adjust the payout strategy towards the
business from your largest shareholder?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Per, the shareholder remuneration policy is of course a shareholder issue. That should be
addressed on the AGM after recommendation from the board. We have read Sampo's
announcement as well, but the board has not at this time received any request to change
anything. If this is going to happen and the board receives such a request, they will act on
that and ﬁnd out what they intend to do on the coming AGM.
But as of now, this has not happened. And the only thing that we can relate to is what is
said in the statement regarding the compulsory oﬀer from Sampo, that is that we will

Page 6 of 11



Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity

continue to have this very disciplined approach to the capital redistribution to the
shareholders from Topdanmark.

FINAL

Q - Per Grønborg
Okay, very clear. Final question. You're hiking your guidance quite nicely for 2016 in this
report. Bit surprised you're doing it now and didn't do it in when the board was out
recommending your shareholders not to take the oﬀer. Maybe that could have changed
the mind amongst some of the shareholders that ended up accepting Sampo's oﬀer. Any
comments on the timing of this?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

So just that when we made the statement, we did not have all new prices of the diﬀerent
assets. So we preferred to use the Q2 ﬁnancial result as starting point. And you know very
well how our mechanism works, that you will have to put the general market development
on top of the results we had after Q2 to get to a reasonable expectation of what it should
be in Q3 – or after Q3.

Q - Per Grønborg
Okay. Thank you. That was my questions.

Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you very much indeed. Thank you, sir. Now your next question from Goldman
Sachs comes from the line of In-Yong Hwang. And your line is open.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Hello. This is In-Yong Hwang from Goldman Sachs. Thank you for taking my question. My
ﬁrst question is on the kind of underlying improvement, some kind of big improvements
that we saw in the illness and accident and personal. Is there any comments you can make
there, do you think these are sustainable improvements, or are they kind of just a run-oﬀ
volatility from quarter-to-quarter?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Actually, I have to say that I don't know. There are some reasons that obviously are –
because this quarter we didn't have any weather – and we did have a nice run-oﬀ, but we
did have a positive development in private lines and agriculture as well. But whether this
is sustainable or not, I won't know now. It's just a single quarter.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. That's ﬁne. And the second question is on your investment strategy. We've
seen it's quite big sort of macro movements since (15:24) last week. Is there anything that
you're thinking (15:29) your investment portfolio, just any changes that we should kind of
expect?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

We are guiding on the fourth, and we don't really speak about what's going on after that.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay, ﬁne. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Very clear.

Operator
Thank you very much. And just before we move on to the last question, just a gentle
reminder. So from Mediobanca you now have a question from the line of Vinit Malhotra.
And your line is now open.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Good evening, everybody. Just one thing on the investment side, are there any
signiﬁcant realizations of gains that you would like to point out. Or are you – for example,
in Danish equities, or maybe have you changed anything in the CDOs? So these are very
good numbers and I just thought I will ask. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

The development in CDOs that is a simple consequence of the very positive development
in bank loans during the quarter. We have seen, well, three quarters in which we have
seen an increase in the price of bank loans of around 4 points; and that adds up to some
substantial gains in the CDO equity portfolio. On top of this we have realized some gains
on the unlisted shares that was sold during the quarter.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay. All right. Thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you much indeed. And we do have some further questions. From UBS you now
have a question from the line of Jonny Urwin. Your line is now open, sir.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi, there. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just one very quick one. I mean,
I'm a bit surprised by the comments on motor pricings, given I thought you'd be pretty
eager to increase prices as soon as there was any return of claims inﬂation after four years
of the risk premium declining. I wonder are you a bit nervous about doing so? And the
elasticity of demand perhaps, given Tryg's got its customer dividend model and perhaps
they've got a bit more pricing power than you guys in the Danish motor market. I'd be
interested to hear your comments there?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

FINAL

We are all the time relating our position to the Danish market. We have seen and
considering what steps to make. At this point in time, we still feel that motor business is a
quite attractive one, but we have seen this trend with Q3 with a somewhat uplift in the risk
premium. We don't feel the need to take any actions based on few numbers. And that is
why we don't have any price initiatives relating to motor at this point in time.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you very much indeed, sir. Now your next question from RBC comes from the line
of Paul De'Ath. And your line is now open, sir.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Yeah. Hi, there. And I think most things has (19:03) probably been covered. And just
quickly on the life business and obviously strong trend in earnings, but the premium trend
is slightly lower in Q3 than – and versus the half year. And just if you can give any
comment on kind of the way you see that moving forward and kind of way you expect I
guess the earnings movement to go because obviously the Q3 was very strong versus last
year? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Well, the earnings in life is less related to the top line growth than it is in non-life; and the
bottom line in life is very much related to the risk charges that we can charge on the
guaranteed environment. And, therefore, when you look at a very positive top line growth
in life, that relates very much to the unit-linked business which is not sort of producing a
lot of yield in the life company, but in the asset management company.
So a nice development in the top line of life will produce some nicer results in the asset
management company, whereas the development in the life company relates to the
guaranteed products, but mainly to the guaranteed products and, of course, the yielding
of the shareholders' capital in the life group.
And this has been more favorable this year than it was last year. And also the fact that we
didn't have to postpone any of the yielding in the life group on to the shadow account,
which we did have to do last year in the same three quarters. So these are the main
reasons for the nice development in life. The assumption to the life earnings is unchanged
for the full year compared to a quarter ago.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Okay. Thanks.

question from Per Grønborg. And your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Per Grønborg
Thank you. Just a quick question from my side also on life. Sales and admin suddenly
turned positive this quarter. It has been quite chronically negative for a while. Is this a
single quarter where this happens or are you through some of your investments in new
admin and should we expect this going forward?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

We expect the admin result to improve, but it is impacted by some speciﬁc payments or
gains this quarter.

Q - Per Grønborg
Okay. Thank you.

Thank you very much indeed, sir. And there appear to be no further requests at the
moment, sir. So I shall pass the ﬂoor back to you.
