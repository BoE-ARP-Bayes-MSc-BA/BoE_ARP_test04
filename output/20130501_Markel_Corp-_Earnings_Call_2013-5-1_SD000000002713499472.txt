Thank you, Tom. Good morning everyone.

Bloomberg Transcript

As I will discuss in more detail in just a minute, we are off to I great start in 2013. We've
had strong underwriting results, robust investment performance, and increased revenue
and profitability from our non-insurance operations, which we refer to as Markel Ventures.
Premium buying has benefited from acquisitions and organic growth.
Our favorable underwriting performance for the quarter was driven by a lower expense
ratio, more favorable development of prior year loss reserves, and lower attritional
losses. Our total operating revenues grew 12% to $820 million in 2013, from
$733,000,000 in 2012. The increase is due to a 6% increase in revenues from our
insurance operations, and a 67% increase in revenues from Markel Ventures.
Moving into our underwriting results, First Quarter 2013 gross written premiums were $743
million, which is an increase of 15% compared to 2012. The increase in 2013 is primarily
due to higher gross premium volumes in the Specialty Admitted segment. As previously
announced, effective January 1st, 2013, we acquired Essentia Insurance Company, which
underwrites insurance, exclusively, for Hagerty Insurance Agency. Hagerty is the leading
insurance provider for classic cars, vintage boats, motorcycles, and automotive
collectibles.
Gross premium volume attributable to the new Hagerty business and Thomco, which was
acquired in January 2012, contributed $63 million to the Specialty Admitted segment for
the First Quarter of 2013. Net written premiums were, approximately, $663 million, up 14%
to the prior year. Net retention was down slightly in 2013, at 89%, compared to 90% in
2012. Earned premiums increased 7%. This increase was driven by a 19% increase in
earned premium from the Specialty Admitted segment.

FINAL

Our combined ratio was 91% for the First Quarter of 2013, compared to 100% in 2012. The
2012 combined ratio included, $20 million for four points of expense related to our
prospective adoption of the new DAC accounting standards.
Excluding the impact of this adoption of the DAC standard in the First Quarter of 2012, the
decrease in the combined ratio in the First Quarter of 2013 is primarily driven by more
favorable development of prior-year loss reserves in the excess and surplus line
segment, and lower attritional losses in each of our three operating segments, compared
to the same period of 2012. Favorable redundancies on prior year's loss reserves
increased to $78 million, or 14 point of favorable development, compared to $64 million,
or 12 points of favorable development in 2012.
Now, we'll talk a little bit about Markel Ventures. In the First Quarter of 2013, revenue from
Markel Ventures were $162 million, as compared to $97 million in 2012. Net income to
shareholders from Markel Ventures was $4 million in 2013, compared to $200,000 in
2012. EBITDA was $19 million in 2013, as compared to $9 million in 2012. Revenues, net
income to shareholders, and EBITDA from Markel Ventures increased in the First Quarter
of 2013, compared to the same period of 2012, primarily due to more favorable results at
AMF Bakery Systems and our acquisition of Havco in 2012.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, taking a look at our investment results. Investment income was down 19% in 2013 to
just under $65 million. Net investment income for 2013 included a favorable change in the
fair value of our credit of $3 million,as compared to $11 million in 2012.
Net realized investment gains for First Quarter of 2013 were $18 million, compared to $12
million in the First Quarter of 2012. There were no write-downs for other than temporary
impairments in either period. Unrealized gains increased $250 million, before taxes in
2013, driven by increases in equity securities. Tom will make further comments and give
further details about investments in his comments.
Looking at our total results for the First Quarter, the effective tax rate was 24% in 2013,
compared to an effective tax rate of 23% in 2012. The increase is primarily due to
anticipating a smaller tax benefit, related to tax-exempt investment income, as a result of
projecting higher pre-tax income for 2013 than in 2012. We reported net income to
shareholders of $89 million, as compared to $57 million in 2012. Book value per share
increased 7% to $431 per share at March 31st, 2013, from $404 per share at year-end.
Finally, I will make a couple of comments about cash flow and the balance sheet. Net cash
provided by operating activities in the First Quarter was $56 million. That compares to net
cash used by operating activities of $64 million for the First Quarter of 2012. The increase
in net cash provided by operating activities during the First Quarter of 2013 was driven by
higher cash flows from underwriting activities, as a result of increased premium volume,
primarily in the Specialty Admitted segment; and decreased claim settlement activity, as
compared to the First Quarter of 2012.
Additionally, the three months ended March 31st, 2013, include higher cash flows from
Markel Ventures, partially offset by higher profit sharing payments, compared to the same

FINAL

period of 2012. Invested assets at the Holding Company were $1.6 billion at March 31st,
2013, compared to $1.4 billion at December 31st, 2012. The increase in invested assets is,
primarily, the result of our March 2013 debt issuance of $500 million, partially offset by the
repayment of $250 million of unsecured senior notes in February 2013.
Finally, as Tom noted, everyone here is very excited about today's closing of the Alterra
acquisition and the future possibilities that this transaction provides for both employees
and shareholders of the combined company.
With that I will turn it over to Mike for further discuss operation.

Mike Crowley

{BIO 6836605 <GO>}

Thanks, Anne. Good morning. The results for the First Quarter of 2013 for North American
operations were very good in a number of areas. The gross written premium for North
American increased 20.6% year-over-year, and the expense ratio improved in both
segments.

Bloomberg Transcript

The E&S segment had an excellent First Quarter. Gross written premium increased 10%
year-over-year; and, once again, all five regions in the E&S segment saw an increase in
the gross written premiums. This increase was driven by the growth in a number of
product lines, including excess and umbrella, medical, casualty, and environmental. The
E&S combined ration for the quarter was 77.5%;the expense ratio improved year-overyear by 5.7%, driven by the accounting change for DAC in 2012 and a reduction
incorporate allocations.
Prior year losses were favorable due to higher takedowns across multiple lines in 2013,
compared to 2012. Keep in mind that these takedowns are consistent with Markel's
historical practices. E&S segment continues to improve efficiency by reducing the number
of agent appointments, limiting access to certain products for prior activity, had been
unproductive, and better educating agents about what to submit and what not to submit,
based on Markel's appetite and success in our target product lines. This improvement
efficiency is supported by the fact that binders increased 29% on almost the same
number of quotes issued. All-in-all, a super quarter for the E&S segment.
The Specialty segment gross written premium increased 37.2%, as a result of booking
more gross written premium for Thomco, compared to the First Quarter of 2012, and the
addition of the Hagerty business. We began booking Hagerty premium on January 1st of
2013.
Excluding Thomco and Hagerty, the Specialty Division premium volume decreased slightly,
as a result of our terminating certain accident and health programs, and the transfer of
the garage business in the E&S segment. The combined ratio for the specialty segment
was 108.5%, which is a 4.9% improvement versus 2012. This decrease was partially due to
a decrease in FirstComp loss ratio, which is a result of the pricing increases and a
geographical shift to more profitable non-California business. The expense ratio includes
the 43.2% from 47.2% in 2012.
Page 4 of 17

FINAL

This improvement is primarily driven by the accounting change for DAC, which added 4%
[ph] to the expense ratio in the First Quarter of 2012. Excluding Hagerty and Thomco, the
Specialty Admitted expense ratio is down 4.6 points, in addition to the impact of DAC
mentioned above. This is driven by lower headcount, lower profit sharing costs, and lower
overhead charges. The expense ratio was negatively impacted by the fact that we front
loaded some expenses for Hagerty.
FirstComp and Thomco businesses are still in transition and we continue to build margin
of safety and loss reserves in these products lines and on the Hagerty business,
consistent with Markel's reserving and pricing philosophy.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are, currently, conducting a detailed review of all specialty product lines; for those
specialty product lines that need improvement, i.e., rates, plans are in place and will be
implemented to improve results. It's important to note that we achieved rate increases of,
approximately, 4% on North America business, with the largest increase coming in
Workers' Compensation and property. These rate increase in the E&S and Specialty
segments, along with some economic growth of our customers, is a key factor in our
premium growth.
Within our product line Leadership, we made several changes. We withdrew from Railroad
third-party and Taxi lines of business earlier this year. These lines have not shown
progress on corrective actions and, therefore, we decided to stop writing this business.
During the Fourth Quarter call, we mentioned including a number of underwriters from
product line group to regional rolls to be closer to our argents and brokers. This has
reduced referrals, added to our front line underwriting expertise, and is producing
additional premium, as well as adding to the efficiency mentioned earlier in the E&S
segment.
All of our product line leaders and managers have been busy with the Alterra transition
and our plans have been announced. Richie will speak more to the Alterra deal in his
comments. Richie?

Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everybody. I will start off with a few about Markel
International's First Quarter and, then, give an update on the Alterra integration.
Markel International had a nice start to 2013, gross written premiums increased 7% to
$296 million. Areas of growth included our Specialty and Professional Liabilities Division, as
well as our Singapore and Netherlands branches. First quarter pricing trends were largely
in line with recent quarter's modest price increase. International achieved an overall
average price increase of almost 3% in the First Quarter. Despite price increases in certain
areas, in many areas of the market, things remain competitive, particularly in the
Professional Liability Retail and Decline divisions.
International's combined ratio for the First Quarter of 2013 was a 92%. This compares to
97% in the First Quarter of 2012, and remember that the First Quarter of 2012 included,

approximately, 3 points for the adoption of the DAC accounting standards. (Technical
difficult). The 2013 results have benefited from a slightly lower current accidents year loss
ratio. Very low catastrophe losses in the quarter. And $22 million in the prior year favorable
(technical difficulty) development across a variety of programs.
Finally, I would like to recognize the Markel International folks for going live with their multiyear initiative to replace their core underwriting systems. They went live on the new
system in April, and while still in the early stages with the system, things are going well.
There's still plenty of work to do to fully embed and take advantage of this system, but
this is an important milestone and accomplishment for the entire International team.
Moving to Alterra. I'll give an update on our acquisition. Since our initial announcement of
the deal on December 19th, this has been a constant area of intense focus for countless
Markel and Alterra associates. I want to welcome the Alterra associates to our Markel
family. We want to thank you, all Alterra and Markel associates, for their tireless work over
the last four months, as we've all prepared for close and made progress on the
integration. It really is a testament to the bench strength at Markel and Alterra that we
could work as hard as we have on the integration of the past four months and still
produce great results in the First Quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

The Integration team has done an excellent job getting us ready for the day one close.
We've necessarily been focused on day one activities. Just some examples would include
large items like defining and communicating new reporting lines, clients communications,
website updates, we've been combining certain reinsurance protections and we've been
working on our combined branding strategy.
We've also been focused on what you might consider more administrative, but, also,
critically important items like email addresses, systems access, bank and trust account
access. We arrived at the close date, having made excellent progress in all areas. We're
now moving our a attention to longer-term initiatives and making sure we have a smooth
transition for our clients and our new associates. Our message, for both clients and our
associates, is tail-enhanced [ph] business as usual.
Over the next several quarters, we'll continue to more tightly integrate the two newly
created divisions of Global Insurance and Global Reinsurance, as well as the business lines
that are going to be merged into our Excess and Surplus and Markel International
Divisions. Similar activities are, obviously, taking place across all support areas. As of
today's close, I would sum up, our progress is very good, but with lots of heavy lifting to
do to achieve our goals for the combined operations of the new Markel. Now, I would like
to turn it over to Tom.

Tom Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Thank you, Richie. Good morning, again. My goal this morning is to cover three items.
Item one, the First Quarter investment results and our public securities portfolio. Item two,
the start of the year for our Markel Ventures operations; and item three, our perspective
Page 6 of 17

FINAL

plans for our newly-expanded investment portfolio we now manage, as a result of the
Alterra acquisition. As to item one, the year is off to a fine start. In our equity and fixed
income portfolios, we are in total return of 13.1% and a half a percent, respectively.
The total return for the portfolio was 3.5%. I am very happy with those results. While any
one quarter is essentially meaningless, the way in which those returns were earned
means a great deal. And our equity portfolio, we continue to own a set of high-quality
global accessible company. In many cases, the dividend yield comfortably exceed what
we can earn on appropriate fixed income alternatives.
We also continue our long-standing process of step-by-step measured and selective
additions to the equity portfolio. In our fixed income operations, which continue to
maintain a portfolio of the highest credit quality that we can find, and we continue to let
the duration roll in. In a repeat statement from previous quarters (inaudible), we believe
that interest rates are too low and the risks of longer-term fixed income commitments
outweigh the rewards. As such, we continue to build a portfolio that increasingly
resembles cash. Stay tuned for our plan on what we will do with the cash.

Bloomberg Transcript

On March 31, equities represented 65% of our shareholders' equity, up from 62% at yearend. It's worth pointing out to our new and longstanding shareholders that our approach
in managing our equity portfolio remains quite tax efficient, with low turnover and stocks
that go up over time, we now sit on and unrealized gain of $1.3 billion. We've provided for
the taxes in our financial statement, but those taxes remain deferred until such time as we
actually sell the securities and realize the gains. It's worth remembering that at a 35% tax
rate, the deferred tax associated with this gain would be, roughly, $450 million.
I know that you all love hearing about accounting just as much as I love talking about it, but
I think it's worth taking a minute to engage in a little thought experiment on this topic.
Imagine if our balance sheet was only comprised of the unrealized gains in the equity
investment portfolio. In that case, we would have and access of $1.3 billion on the lefthand side of the balance sheet, and a liability of $450 million for future taxes, and equity
capital of $850 million on the right-hand side. The net effect of this dynamic is that we've
got the entire $1.3 billion working for us as shareholders on a reported equity capital base
of $850 million. This is incredibly tax efficient and helps our reported return on equity over
time.
Over the decades, this component of our balance sheet and capital has grown larger and
larger. It is a meaningful contributor to total shareholder returns at Markel and not a
common feature in the insurance world. I'm glad to report that those balances continue to
grow during the First Quarter, by following the same disciplines we've used to build it for
decades.
Onto item two. Markel Ventures Operations also performed very well during the First
Quarter of 2013. Our Other revenues of $172 million, that you see in the income
statement, are largely those of the Ventures Company. Those revenues rose 55%,
compared to last year. Other expenses $552 million [ph] up 52% from a year ago.

FINAL

Back to accounting again, those expenses include noncash amortization and purchase
accounting entries that are separate and distinct from the ongoing operational
performance of the Markel Ventures Company. As such, we use EBITDA and our internal
review and management of those operations. As Anne noted earlier, EBITDA more than
doubled to $19.4 million in the First Quarter, compared to $9.4 million in the previous year.
A reconciliation of EBITDA to GAAP net income is available on our website (inaudible).
Item three. The biggest, single challenge, and opportunity, on the access side of the
balance sheet at this time is the future investment and capital allocation decisions that we
will make with our growing cash balances, which are now augmented by the addition of
the investment balances from Alterra. We'll invest the money in the same way we've
invested the access of Markel over the year. Specifically, on the fixed income side, we will
continue to focus on high credit quality and maintaining the duration that is shorter than
our natural position of matching the duration of the insurance liabilities to our bond
portfolio. We will continue to do this until interest rates are higher than they are today and
that we feel we are being paid appropriately to accept the risk of longer-term
commitment. While this penalizes current investment income, it doesn't penalize very
much at today's low rates of interest across the curve.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the equity side, we have a vibrant and profitable insurance business. We have a strong
balance sheet and plenty of cash. Our constraint is finding appropriate ideas and
protecting and preserving the balance sheet. For now, we will continue to methodically
invest in many of the same securities we already own [ph]. Prices are still reasonable, in
many cases, and we will pick up investment yield from the dividends as we go.
Given our new circumstances, we will have a lot of dry powder and we will look to deploy
that more aggressively as opportunities present themselves. I cannot predict when the
general environment will produce an opportunity, but I'm confident that it will. As many
people say about the weather, wherever they live, "If you don't like it, wait five minutes
and it'll change." We're in a unique and, what I think, is a fantastic position in that we have
capital to deploy in what can be a rapidly-changing environment. Rest assured that the
same disciplines and thought processes that were used for decades to make those
decisions remain in place.
I'm optimistic about our opportunities to make positive capital allocation decisions in the
coming years, as well as the ultimate results from our shareholders. As we begin this new
era at Markel, I took a moment this morning to look at our first Annual Report, and to
remind myself of what this Team has accomplished for you in the years since we went
public in 1986. Immediately following the public offering, we had shareholders' equity of
about $16 million, and a total investment portfolio of, approximately, $30 million [ph].
We've scaled back the process of reinvesting our earnings and making sound capital
allocation decisions for a long time, and I think it's fair to say that the results should speak
for themselves.
To add one more note on the sense of perspective, the comprehensive income in the
First Quarter of 2013 of $257 million exceeded our entire cumulative earnings during our
first decade as a public company. I know that analysts' reports on Markel rarely address
comprehensive income in their estimates and their discussions about us, but the
Page 8 of 17



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2013-05-01

comprehensive income is what we, as shareholders, ultimately receive as owners of this
business. As such, it's what we focus on as the stewards of this Company.

FINAL

It's undeniable that we face the challenge as we begin to integrate the Alterra operations
into Markel and reinvest our new, larger base of capital. The good news is that we have
done this sort of thing before, and we are excited and optimistic about doing it again,
now and into the future.
With that, we would like to go ahead and open up the floor for your questions. So, Jeff, if
you would be so kind as to open up the floor.

Morning, John.

Q - John Fox

{BIO 18976738 <GO>}

I have a few questions. First for Tom Gayner. You mentioned the Alterra portfolio. Do you
have a sense of how long it will take to make that look more like a Markel portfolio?

A - Tom Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Yes. A lot of that, really, is going to be opportunistically-driven, John, so in the pricing
environments that we're operating in today, it's going to be pretty methodical and just
step-by-step. It market opportunities presents themselves, we will act expeditiously, but I
don't have a (inaudible) prediction for you.

Right.

A - Tom Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

That, obviously, goes down as you add in a bunch of cash from the Alterra Capital. My
goal would be to get that back to that sort of ratio and, in fact, go beyond that as we see
good opportunities to do so; but, we will let it about down before we start to rebuild it.

Q - John Fox

{BIO 18976738 <GO>}

Okay. And, then, I think these other two questions are for Mike.

A - Tom Gayner

By the way, before you start asking Mike questions, if you have any really good ideas call
me later.

Q - John Fox

{BIO 18976738 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. I will. Mike, a number of insurance companies have kind of talked about organic
price increases in the First Quarter. I wanted a persecutive on your business, do you see
kind of a natural increase in prices, and what that number might be?

A - Mike Crowley

{BIO 6836605 <GO>}

Well, as we said, we're seeing something in the range of 4% in North America now, with a
little more in Workers' Comp and Property, and right now I see that just continuing. I don't
see it going up a lot from here. I don't see it going down, but right now we're just kind of
planning on the same kinds of trends.

Q - John Fox

{BIO 18976738 <GO>}

Okay. Richie, you mentioned three international, so kind of low single-digits?

A - Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Yes. I think it's amazing we talk about the different markets, but there tends to be a lot of
similarity in terms of how they move, so 3% over there, 4% here; pretty consistent.

Q - John Fox

{BIO 18976738 <GO>}

Right. Okay. Then, these are terrific results for the First Quarter, but especially Admitted
Line is not terrific, and I'm just wondering your thoughts on that?Are you looking at taking
different actions or -- it seems to be and outlier of the three segments, at this point.

FINAL

A couple of things are going on there, John. One, in the quarter, about 66% of the
revenue was Specialty, is coming from three new businesses, FirstComp, Thomco, and
the Hagerty business. And all of these businesses are being subjected to our
conservative, reserving practices for a period of time, and, in addition, the expense ratio
for Thomco and for Hagerty, in the First Quarter, is high because of things that are going
on there.
We front loaded a lot of expenses for Hagerty. We wrote $30-something [ph] million of
business, but we only earned about $4 million; and we've got some booking of
contingencies and other things that drive that expense ratio way up in the First Quarter,
and that will trends down during the course of the year. The expense ratio for the
Specialty, excluding that, is 38.6%.
So everybody else is moving in the right direction and FirstComp has made great strides
in their expense ratio and in their launch ratio. They followed the plan that we set in place
for them when we acquired them in late 2010. So, there are a couple of lines of business
in the Specialty segment that are not performing the way we would like them to do and
we're taking action on those.

Yes. Good morning. A couple of numbers' questions to start out with. You had provided
the split of the portion of the Markel Ventures revenues, were in the Other revenues.
Could you give us the portion of the expenses that are in the Other expenses line, that
kinds marries up with that?

A - Tom Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Yes. While Anne looks for those numbers, I will give you the total Other revenues off the
sheet. She has the exact Markel figures.

A - Anne Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Right. So, Markel Ventures related revenues were $162 million, the associated expenses
about $145 million.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

$145 million. Thank you. Same question.

A - Tom Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

By the way, Mark, that includes the non-tax expenses.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Right. Of course.

A - Tom Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

EBITDA on that.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Right. The same question. Did you have any particular amount of catastrophe losses in the
quarter? I didn't see any references, and I couldn't think of any. I thought if there were any,
you could highlight them.

A - Anne Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

No. Nothing. Nothing.

A - Mike Crowley

{BIO 6836605 <GO>}

Nothing of significance, Mark, and also, obviously, and it's in the queue,we had some
takedowns, actually, on Sandy in the quarter. So, in a sense we had a negative.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. I say those, okay. Alright. And, then, you had mentioned -- somebody had mentioned
in their opening remarks, I think it was you, Richie, the integration of the kind of combined
reinsurance platform, to cover the combined entities. Is there anything you can share with
respect to that, in terms of how that's going to affect the ratio of gross-to-net premiums?
Usually, it's my job to figure out how many dollars of premiums you're going to add in, but
I would like to at least take a stab at the ratio, if we could?

A - Mike Crowley

{BIO 6836605 <GO>}

Sure. Mark, what I think I would tell you this year is, we are starting to look to programs
and how we can combine them. I think the first step, quite honestly, is actually to bring
them together, and we're not so much focused on moving retentions as we are just kind
of getting to fewer programs right now.
So, I would tell you that for 2013, if you sort of took the mix of our retention and Alterra's
retention, that's probably where we will end up, whatever that is in the middle. And I don't
have that number to hand.
And after we kind of get through this initial phase during 2013, next year we'll start looking
critically at those retention levels, and my assumption would be we would start bringing
those up some; but, this year is do no harm right now. We just want to start putting things
together.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Adam Culver with William Blair.
Please proceed with your question.

Q - Adam Culver
Thanks. Good morning.

A - Tom Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Good morning, Adam.

Q - Adam Culver
How is the general E&S environment? Are you seeing much flow over from the standard
markets?

A - Tom Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

I think we're seeing some, Adam. It's hard to measure.

FINAL

You know, I think that we like to think that a lot of our growth is coming from the fact that
we have done a much better job articulating to our producers exactly what we want. It's
also a result of the last couple of years of upgrading our coverages and our forms.
We're being a lot more active with our brokers, in terms of being out knocking on doors,
asking for the business, and so I think that's driving a lot of it as well. It's hard to put a
number on what we're seeing rollover from the standard market. I think we're seeing
some of that.

Q - Adam Culver
Okay. And, then, as far as for the overall Company, your accident to your loss ratio
excluding, CAT was down by, roughly, 200 basis points. Howmuch of that is due to white
weather?

A - Anne Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Due to? Sorry. Can you repeat that?

Q - Adam Culver
How much of that is due to just weather being pretty light during the winter?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

It's going to be a little bit of that, there's no question. First quarter was a very light quarter
for weather. But, also, we're seeing the impact of modest price increases that we've
gotten over the last couple of years. That's starting to help the loss ratio as well. It's
probably a mix of the two.

Q - Adam Culver
Okay. And, then, as far as what you are seeing on the loss [ph] trends in Workers' Comp?
And I guess if you can distinguish California versus non-California, would be helpful.

A - Mike Crowley

{BIO 6836605 <GO>}

Well the (inaudible) is obviously included in FirstComp, but, keep in mind, as we have said
on other calls, FirstComp has been restructuring their business and moving a lot more
towards non-California business and more attractive states. I don't have the numbers right
in front of me, but their California comp business is down substantially from a couple ever
years ago. The trends, not only their loss trends, but their expense trends are moving
absolutely in the right direction. They're managing their business just as we asked them
to.

A - Tom Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

The only thing I would add to that, as you can expect, the trends in work comp [ph] sort of
mirror what's going on in medical, so it's higher than the overall economy, and California,
Page 14 of 17

has always been, is higher than the rest of the country. But I don't think we're seeing
anything crazy there.

A - Anne Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

FINAL

No.

A - Tom Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

It's sort of a continuation of what's been the theme.

Q - Adam Culver
Okay. And, then, finally, with the E&S, you had a pretty good size release, and I know
releases are going to jump around, but was there any one or two items driving that
release?

A - Anne Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

The release was predominantly on casualty lines, but was spread across several years.

Q - Adam Culver
Okay. Thank you, very much.

Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Doug
Mewhirter with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.

Q - Doug Mewhirter

{BIO 7026139 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. First, Richie, just a little numbers' question. I noticed the expense ratio
in the London market division had quite an improvement below 40%, first time in a while.
Were there any particular credits or just more (inaudible) better scale?

A - Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Well, obviously, we have the DAC adjustment in the First Quarter of last year, and so it's
probably not as dramatic as maybe it appears on the surface. I think you're right, though,
the underlying trend is down some and I think it's primarily more volume. We are getting
more volume and we're able to spread our fixed costs a little further, so good news.

Q - Doug Mewhirter

{BIO 7026139 <GO>}

Yes. Definitely. And, Tom, you had a pretty comprehensive overview of how you're going
to bring Alterra's portfolio around.
Is there going to be any particular, I guess, for lack ever a better term, liquidation events
in advance of that? Where you definitely overweight Alterra's cash, just because you

Page 15 of 17



Company N ame: M arkel Corp

would rather get something more stable to bring over to Markel? Or would it be more,
you would take their portfolio and move, I guess, as you find opportunities to up your
investments on the Markel side, you will liquidate the Alterra's investments on a case-bycase basis.?

FINAL

A - Tom Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Yes. The good news is that the vast majority of the Alterra investment portfolio is just fine.
It's high-quality, fixed income investments, and those will obviously remain in place, and
that's a pretty smooth integration process. They did pursue things in the realm of
alternative investments. They have been very cooperative and helpful in terms of
liquidating some of that ahead of the closing. That process will continue and it will take
some time. There's a half life associated with that and, frankly, this time next year, there
will still be some of that, but that is largely an independent process compared to where
we're deploying capital and cash.
I'm hard pressed to imagine a scenario where we want to invest more than we can right
now, so we can go about whatever changes we're making in Alterra in a very methodical
and orderly way. We've got plenty of cash to fund investment ideas as they happen and
they're two distinct things.

Q - Doug Mewhirter

{BIO 7026139 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks a lot. That's all my questions.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ray Iradella with Macquarie. Please
proceed with your question.

Q - Ray Iradella
Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a quick question, Tom, you spent a lot of time
on the Alterra portfolio asset side, but, maybe, can you give us an update on how you're
thinking about reserves for Alterra? And now that, I guess, you have a little bit more time
to take a look at them and, maybe, if that's any need to bring them up to the Markel
standards, given sort of the way you guys approach reserving?

A - Tom Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Yes. What I would say there is, when we did our due diligence at Alterra, we felt
comfortable with the reserve levels, that there was a redundancy, probably not at the
same level as our reserving standards, but solid reserving. That was very reassuring when
got through the due diligence.
Obviously,we've been spending a lot of time with the Alterra folks over the last four
months, and we haven't seen anything that would change our opinion of what we saw in
due diligence. Similar to other acquisitions that we've done in the past, it will be a, Tom
talks about a methodical process,it will be a methodical process to bring them into line

with Markel's reserving standards as we go forward. And, probably the best thing would
tell you in terms of purchase adjustments, if you will, is to look at the proformas that were
part of our debt issuance back in March. That would give you an idea of what we're talking
about, or thinking about doing, and I think that's pretty much in line with where our thinking
is today.

Q - Ray Iradella
Okay. Thanks again. I'll take a look at those documents. Thanks.
