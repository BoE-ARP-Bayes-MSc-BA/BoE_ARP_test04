{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

So good evening, everybody, and welcome to AXA's 2015 Investor Day. Welcome to
those on the phone, welcome to those on the webcast, and of course, welcome to those
here in the room. After the presentation, we will have as per usual a session of Q&A and
we'll be happy to take questions from those on the webcast or on the phone. Please
follow the instructions you've been given and we will give preference, as per usual, to
questions from the room.
On the screen you can see the agenda for this evening, but before we start, I would like to
make just one remark. And a number of you have been following the sector and AXA for
some time, and you may remember back to the early 2000s, and AXA at that time started
to build its economic capital model before it was even a well-known concept. It has been
a 15-year journey and our model has evolved quite a lot over that time.
What you will see today is the fruit of that work paying oﬀ. Denis Duverne, and I
remember I was there at the time, Denis Duverne was the brains and the driving force
behind that initiative, and it therefore seems very ﬁtting that he will make the introduction
this evening.

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Thanks, Andrew, and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. I will do just introduction and
the conclusion of this presentation. Andrew is right. We started our internal modeling at
AXA back in 2000. We had organized a competition between consultants at that time,
and we eventually selected Tillinghast to support us, and we went for a long-term internal
capital model.
That was very useful to help us understand the proﬁtability of our long-term business line
like annuities, workers' compensation, the casualty lines, but we realized that we were in
the minority and the majority had gone for a short-term economic capital model over a
one-year horizon.

Bloomberg Transcript

We were fortunate when we bought Winterthur in 2006 that they had built their own
model over one-year horizon. And so we adopted the Winterthur capital model which we
further enriched after that, and our modeling team still resides in Winterthur, and they are
the ones that have built that model for us.
In 2006, two years ahead of the ﬁnancial crisis, we started developing our risk appetite.
Unfortunately we had not fully completed our journey on the risk appetite when the crisis
came in 2008 which led to the surprises that you will remember on our U.S. VA portfolio.
So we were a bit late on that one, but I believe that when we launched Ambition AXA in
2011 we had fully incorporated in our strategy all the elements of the economic capital
and the risk appetite, and that has led us to strengthen our balance sheet, to change our
business mix, I will come back to that later and we have, just a few days ago, received the
approval of our internal model from ACPR.
When we say received the internal model approval from ACPR, it means a lot more than
that because in reality, as you know, we are present in multiple jurisdictions across
Europe, and it's not just the approval of the global model. It's also the approval of the
local models in each of those geographies. And it's also the input and back and forth the
incorporation of the conditions put by each of those local supervisors on the model, both
on the local models and on the global model.
So, our model is approved. It's approved by ACPR, but it's been approved also by the
supervisors in other jurisdictions: the UK, Belgium, Germany, Italy, just to name a few. Our
model is giving us a solvency coverage of 212% at the end of Q3. We had told you that we
were conﬁdent that we would land within 10 points of our previous model. In fact, we are
clearly closer to one point of diﬀerence between the model that we had published in the
last three, four years and the model that is now approved. There are lots of pluses and
minuses but we arrive at a number which is very close.
The most important thing is that our model is at the heart of our decision-making process
and has been so, I would say, since 2007. This explains why, as part of Ambition AXA, we
had put the emphasis on protection & health and Unit-Linked which shows in the
Page 2 of 30

FINAL

numbers that we published in the last four years. The Unit-Linked business has increased
in proportion. The protection business has increased in proportion and the general
account savings business which is a business which is less proﬁtable in the Solvency II
environment has declined substantially to represent so far this year only 12% of the new
business.
Our new business margin has improved substantially which is a function not just of the
changes in business mix, but it's also a function of all the re-pricing that we've done
because our internal model also drives our pricing decisions as Alban will explain to you
later.

Bloomberg Transcript

It has driven our asset liability management. We've always mentioned tight duration gap.
We have, with in-force program that we launched four-and-a-half-years ago, reduced
crediting rates in a very prudent fashion. We have added disciplined asset mix which has
allowed us – and these are ﬁgures that you will recognize to have a resilient investment
margin between 70 and 80 basis points and towards the higher end of that range. It has
also driven our M&A decisions. You will recall that since 2010, we've sold for €9 billion of
businesses and bought €5 billion of businesses, mostly in P&C and protection and in high
growth market. And it has allowed us to have a strong dividend paying capacity with €8
billion of dividends paid between 2011 and 2014, and over €19 billion of adjusted
earnings.
So our capital management is anchored in Solvency II. We have a strong Solvency II ratio
at 212%. This is also what drives our decisions in terms of risk appetite. I will not comment
all the words that are on this slide because that would steal the thunder of Alban, our
Chief Risk Oﬃcer, who is now going to take over before Gérald talks to you about how we
expect to manage our capital going forward.
Thank you very much.

Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

Thank you, Denis. So, good evening ladies and gentlemen. I am happy to be with you
tonight to be able to share our numbers after so many years of hard work. So what I'll do
today, I'll take you through some technical details of our model, well the building blocks
of our model. I'll show you some sensitivities of our capital to some shocks and show you
how resilient our capital is. And then, as Denis mentioned, a few examples of how our
internal model is embedded in our decisions.
I think there are two messages today. The ﬁrst one is that we now have a stable capital
framework with Solvency II entering into force in a few months, and our model having
been validated by the European supervisors. And we have a resilient capital, as I'll show
you in a few slides.
So, if we talk about the number, as Denis mentioned we stand at the end of Q3 at a very
strong 212% ratio and we have plotted on this slide what would have been our ratio over
the last quarters had we used the internal model. And on the top of the slide what you
Page 3 of 30

FINAL

see is the number that we've disclosed to you with our economic ratio. And you see, as
Denis mentioned, that there is extremely little diﬀerence between the two and sometimes
they're even identical. What I want to highlight as well is you know that we don't adjust for
dividend during the year. We do that at Q4. So dividend to paid is not taken into account
in those numbers. So how do we – there's something missing on the screen.
So, how do we determine our AFR and our SCR? So, we start from our IFRS balance sheet,
but we move from that IFRS balance sheet to a Solvency II economic balance sheet and
we determine the market value of our assets, the market value of our liabilities. And the
diﬀerence between the two is our available ﬁnancial resources, our available capital under
Solvency II and that stands at €61 billion at the end of Q3.
Then we determine how much AFR we would lose with a 0.5% probability shock, socalled one in 200 years shock. The amount of AFR that we would lose in such a shock is
our solvency capital requirement, and it stands at the end of Q3 at €29 billion. The ratio
between the two, AFR to SCR, is our solvency ratio of 212%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now moving to some details on how you create a Solvency II or market consistent
economic balance sheet. So you start with the IFRS shareholders' equity which stands at
€71 billion. There are some asset classes for which the unrealized capital gains are not
included in the shareholders' equity, that's real estates and loans, and we include those
unrealized capital gains in our AFR.
You remove all intangibles from the balance sheet, goodwill, DAC and VBI. And then you
move from IFRS reserves to best estimate liabilities. As such, the best estimate liabilities
are €24 billion lower than IFRS reserves, and that increases our capital by the same
amount. But as there is new market price for insurance liabilities and there is uncertainty
on those liabilities, because it's best estimate, we include a risk margin or market value
margin – for us it's the same thing – to recognize that uncertainty and that's €12 billion.
That increases the best estimate reserves and decreases our AFR. And over time, if there
is no deviation from the best estimates, that amount should accrue to shareholders.
Then you include also in your available ﬁnancial resources, the subordinated debt that is
not yet included in your IFRS equity, and that's €7 billion. And overall, that's how you
come to the €61 billion AFR that I mentioned in the previous slide. If we move to the SCR,
that's the total capital requirement that we have. This describes the model that we have
within the group and the model applies to almost all our insurance entities excluding the
U.S. It covers 97% of our insurance entities, and the same model, the same diﬀerent
modules of that model apply to all our insurance entities.
We have four risk modules; underwriting risk, market risk, credit, and operational risk.
And we're probably one of the few to have a validated internal model for operational
risks. Underwriting risk, it's the insurance risk that we have. Market risk, I think, is rather
intuitive. And credit risk is our default risk. We have the numbers for – again, one in 200
year shock for each of those risks. So for instance, €15 billion for underwriting risk and we
gave in the boxes below a number of examples of the risk that we model in each

Page 4 of 30

FINAL

category. So for instance, underwriting risk, we would have lapse risk in life & savings,
reserve risk longevity. Market risk, obviously equity, spread, interest rate.
On default credit risk, it would be obviously on our portfolio of bonds, but also the
reinsurance receivables that we have. And operational risk, it's the risk of fraud of centric
processes that do not work or fraud. So, once you have that you have for each category
the loss of AFR that you would have for a one in 200 year event. But as those events do
not occur at the same time, obviously you're allowed for diversiﬁcation. Diversiﬁcation
between those is €11 billion.

Bloomberg Transcript

The next step is the tax adjustment. The SCR is the net of tax amount. And the tax
adjustment is €2.5 billion. So that's the total amount of capital required for our insurance
operations outside the U.S. We add to that the capital requirement for banking and asset
management operations, €2.5 billion and some countries which are on standard formula.
That's a diﬀerence with our current Solvency I ratio where we do not include bank and
asset management, here under Solvency II we do and that's the €2.5 billion that you see.
And then you add the capital requirement for our U.S. operations and you know that we
use equivalence. And that's – under equivalence, we use three times CAL, 300% of CAL
which is not the most aggressive approach in the market.
When you've done all that, you come to our Solvency Capital Requirement which stands
at €29 billion. We put together then a couple of slides with some technical details. I don't
plan to comment them all now but I'll be happy to take any questions during the Q&A.
Just want to comment three of them. On sovereign risk, we do include sovereign risk both
credit (17:36) risk and default risk in our model, be it for domestic or non-domestic bonds
for OECD or non-OECD bonds, all government bonds are covered.
Second item; transitional rules. We don't use any transitional rules be that for equity or
reserves. And third one is the UFR, the Ultimate Forward Rate that we use for the discount
of our very long-term liabilities. You know that it stands for most countries at 4.2%. If it was
to go down by 100 bps, our solvency ratio would go down by 19 points. So on this slide
again I won't comment any of these. But our information about market value margin, the
volatility adjuster and taxes; and again, I'd be happy to take questions on that during the
Q&A.
Now let's go now to potentially even more interesting part of the presentation which is
the sensitivities of our ratio to a number of shocks and that will demonstrate how resilient
our capital is. So what we put on the slide is the sensitivity of our ratios to ﬁnancial shocks
on corporate bond spreads, on interest rates, and on equity. And you see that for those
shocks, even for large ones, our ratio does not move signiﬁcantly.
Now I will go into the details of that for interest rates and corporate spreads. For interest
rates, you may wonder why the shock in interest rates does not aﬀect our ratio. In fact,
obviously, it does aﬀect our AFR and our SCR. And when you look at an upward shock in
interest rates, you see that our available capital goes up by €900 million, and that's clearly
what you would expect from an insurance company these days. But the fact is that at the
same time, our capital requirement increases by €400 million, and that's between the

Page 5 of 30

FINAL

two, more or less a ratio of 2:1, which is also our Solvency ratio of 200%. So, that's why
when they move up, also then our ratio overall is not aﬀected, but AFR increases and so
does our SCR.
And by the way, it's exactly also what happens with equities, where AFR and SCR
increases in the ratio of 2:1 when equity markets go up. But you'll see also on this slide
that if interest rates go down, AFR is most signiﬁcantly aﬀected, and that's because of the
convexity that we have in our portfolio due to the guarantee that we have in our – in the
options that we have in our products.
Moving to corporate spreads, I know there has been, again, a number of questions on the
sensitivity of our ratio to corporate spread because it's not very sensitive. You will
remember that our AFR are the diﬀerence between the market value of assets and the
market value of our liabilities.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the asset side, our corporate bond portfolio has a limited duration, a low duration of
four years to ﬁve years. And that, as such, means that we are not extremely sensitive to
widening of corporate spreads. If I were to increase the duration of that portfolio by one
year, that sensitivity will move from minus one to minus four. So it's not insensitive, but it
depends on the duration of my assets.
On the liability side, you know that we use the Volatility Adjuster. The purpose of the
volatility adjuster is to recognize that, generally, we hold our corporate bonds to maturity
and, therefore, will be repaid at par. And therefore, our solvency should not be
signiﬁcantly aﬀected by volatility in the corporate spreads. So that's the purpose of the
Volatility Adjuster.
The Volatility Adjuster is not in our hands. It is determined by the EIOPA on the basis of a
reference portfolio, and that's what dictates the adjustment to be made on our liabilities.
And it so happens that in the reference portfolio, you have more corporate bonds than we
do have in our balance sheet, and that also explains why the sensitivity to corporate bond
spread widening is mitigated signiﬁcantly by the Volatility Adjuster.
Conversely, we hold more government bonds than the reference portfolio. And you see
that for shock of 50 bps on sovereign spreads, our sensitivity is a bit more signiﬁcant
because we will lose 9 points of solvency.
So this is probably the most interesting slide of my presentation, and if you had one to
remember I would hope that it'll be the one. Because what we've done here is we've used
real life shocks to determine how resilient our solvency would be with those shocks. And
you see that, clearly, it is resilient. So as a reference, we put the 1 in 20 year shock from the
model, and that cost us 32 points, 1 in 200 years by construction would cost us 100 points.
And then, we computed what would be the change in solvency that we would have if we
had a number of debt crisis as we had in the past. So, obviously, the one that everybody
has in mind is the 2008-2009 ﬁnancial crisis. If such a crisis was to repeat, we would lose
48 points of solvency. Admittedly, this is a signiﬁcant number but that's also a very severe
Page 6 of 30

FINAL

crisis. But more importantly, it will leave us at a very strong 164% ratio. That also tells you
how prudently we have calibrated our model because you see that we would lose 48
points which is very far from the 100 points that we would lose in the 1 in 200 year event.
With the ﬁnancial crisis of 2011, we would lose 22 points.
And then, we also went for very speciﬁc insurance shocks that we had in the past on the
P&C side or on the Life side. On the P&C side, we used the two windstorms that we had at
the end of 1999, Lothar & Martin. If, again, that was to happen again, that would cost us 3
points of solvency.
On the Life side, we looked for a big pandemic. The largest one that we had in the recent
past was the Spanish ﬂu that we had at the end of World War I. That only would be an
impact – because of mortality loses of two points of our solvency. So overall I think it
demonstrates the resilience of our capital.

Bloomberg Transcript

Another way to look at it is to say how much solvency do we create each year and what
are the shocks that, so to speak, we can aﬀord in a given year with that amount? The
operational capital generation that we have year-after-year is more or less 20 points of
solvency. If you deduct the dividend that we pay, here we could – the one that we paid
this year in 2014 earnings, that's 9 points. So you're left with 11 points of net capital
generation in a given year. Only with those 11 points can I withstand a shock of minus
50bps on interest rates or 45% on equity market or a combination of 30bps and 20%,
only with the capital generated in one year.
Then coming back to what Denis said at the beginning, if our ratio and our solvency are
so resilient, it's no miracle, no magic. It's because we have been embedding our internal
model in our business decisions for years now. Just wanted to give four examples about
this.
On products, the example that Denis mentioned was the fact that we moved from capital
heavy products such as General Account to capital light products like Unit-Linked and
Protection. There is also the fact that when we priced our products, the amount of capital
that we use is the SCR for any given product, and that reﬂects the risk that we take. And,
therefore, there's alignment between the risks that we take, the capital that we put at
stake and the earnings that we expect, full alignment.
On investments, we now have, for years, developed a strong and strict budget and
monitoring of ﬁnancial capital requirements. We determine every year the amount of
capital we want to dedicate to ﬁnancial risks, and we follow that on a monthly basis. Still
on the asset side, the asset liability management, we've kept now for a very large number
of years a small duration gap of one year or close to one year.
And ﬁnally, the last example I would give is on the insurance side, there is no diﬀerence
between the internal model that we use for solvency calculation and the model that we
use to determine what would be a loss in a signiﬁcant catastrophic event. And, therefore,
the amount of reinsurance that we need to buy. Again, there's full alignment between the
two. And that also explains why our capital is so resilient.

That being said, I'll now hand over to Gérald.

FINAL

Gérald Harlin
Thank you, Alban. Good evening. So Alban has presented our internal model conﬁrming
that our Solvency II ratio is strong and resilient. Now, my objective is to present the
consequences of Solvency II in our capital framework. With a speciﬁc focus on these four
topics: ﬁrst, the dividend policy; second, the capital management strategy; then, the
capital structure; and, next, the cash ﬂow and remittance ratio.
So let's start ﬁrst with the dividend policy. So I'm proud to announce that we are setting
our payout ratio, our payout range at a higher level. Up to now, our dividend payout ratio
was between 40% and 50% of adjusted earnings. As you can see here, we have been
using the full range of our payout ratio. And from now on, we are increasing our payout
ratio from 40% to 50% of adjusted earnings to 45% to 55% of adjusted earnings which is
a great news for our shareholders.

Bloomberg Transcript

So let's have a look at our capital management policy. Here, we are presenting four
diﬀerent scenarios. The ﬁrst one which is, I could say, a central case scenario, from 170% to
230% of solvency. Next, an upside scenario, above 230%, where we could even do more.
And downside scenario, between 170% and 140%, where we would protect our
shareholders and then an extreme down scenario below 140%.
Let's start ﬁrst with our central scenario, i.e. between 170% and 230%. So our dividend
policy will be based on 45% to 55% payout ratio as I explained before. Then, we will
neutralize the dilution of employee shares and stock option oﬀering. We will invest in
business growth. We will maintain current investment risk appetite.
Above 230% and, as solvency increases, we'll add ﬂexibility on the payout ratio. We will
add some room to invest. We will have additional room to invest in business growth. We
will increase our appetite for investment risk, and we could be in a situation to return
excess capital to shareholders.
Below 170% and we will gradually, I would say, be more conservative. First, with selective
de-risking of investment, increased selectivity in growth initiatives, we would allow for
dilution of employee shares and stock option oﬀering. Then, we would have additional
ﬂexibility on the payout ratio. And in the extreme event where we would be below 140%,
then we would restrict our growth initiatives. We'll further de-risk of investments, and
reduce dividend payout ratio below the range.
Have a look now at the capital structure. So our Tier 1, as you can see here, our Tier 1 is
very comfortable and represents 84% of AFR. As you know, hybrid Tier 1 is limited to 20%
of total Tier 1, meaning that under stress scenarios, our Tier 1 would be limited. That
means that if Tier 1 would drop, then by deﬁnition, our Tier 1 debt would be haircut and
considered as Tier 2 and declassiﬁed in Tier 2. This, combined with our strong solvency
generation of plus 11 points as presented by Alban a few minutes ago, means that as a

Page 8 of 30

Date: 2015-12-03

FINAL

consequence and given our strong ﬁnancial structure, we believe that we have ﬂexibility
not to renew part of our Tier 1 debt by Tier 2 or senior debt.
Let's have a look now at the cash ﬂow management. So before going into more detail on
the cash ﬂow generation and cash ﬂow generation of new business, I would like to remind
you that we are going to maximize cash upstream to the group. That means that
concretely we will maintain limited volatility buﬀer above the 100% Solvency II level. And
meaning that, as a consequence, we will have some local excess capital in some countries
and you have examples here like France Life & Savings, like Germany P&C, like the U.S. So
that means that on the next years, we will strive to maximize upstream to the group.
How could we do it, and you have – it's mentioned here. First, we will reduce local excess
capital. We will maximize ordinary dividends. We will simplify our legal structures and we
could do some risk pooling as well. So as a summary, we have excess capital in some
entities. So let's analyze now how the free cash ﬂow generation of new business works
under Solvency II.

Bloomberg Transcript

So here we are dealing with the cash consumption of Life & Savings new business. So I'm
dealing here with 2014 ﬁgures. And those frameworks, on the left-hand side you have
Solvency I; on the right-hand side, you have Solvency II.
So as you know, the new business cash consumptions has two diﬀerent components, the
ﬁrst one, which is the new business strain. And you can see here on the two – under the
two frameworks, it's exactly the same. It was €1.2 billion, that's the cash corresponding to
the strain, €1.2 billion in 2014. Whereas for the new business required capital, it's not the
same under Solvency I and under Solvency II.
It's the same for non-European countries, it's €0.2 billion, but for the European country,
this cash – this capital needs – this capital requirements can be covered with the new
business future proﬁts, which means that as a whole – the cash consumptions from Life &
Savings new business, which was at €1.9 billion taking the example of 2014, which was at
€1.9 billion under Solvency I, will move to €1.4 billion, i.e., an improvement of €0.5 billion.
You can see here and it's mentioned, that, as a consequence, the new business internal
rate of return is improved as well. And taking the example as well of 2014, we would –
where it was our internal rate of return was 14% last year under Solvency I, it would be 17%
under Solvency II. As far as P&C and Life in-force free cash ﬂow roughly speaking it would
be broadly the same, which means as whole that we can – that we have an annual uplift of
free cash ﬂows of €0.5 billion, and that means that our free cash ﬂow completely will be
higher, and now I propose you to move to the remittance ratio to see how much real cash
will be up-streamed to the holding company.
So our remittance ratio will be maintained between 75% and 85% which means that taking
the example of 2014 on the right-hand side, that means that where in Solvency I, we had a
free cash ﬂow – we posted last year a free cash ﬂow of €5.5 million and we had a
remittance ratio of 86% which was at the – slightly above the 75 points to 85 points range,

Page 9 of 30



Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity
Date: 2015-12-03

which means that we had €4.7 billion of cash that was up-streamed to the holding
company.

FINAL

Under Solvency II, as I explained before, we can expect to have €0.5 billion more free
cash ﬂow and assuming that we would have an 80% remittance ratio on average. That
means that we would have an additional €0.4 billion of cash that would be up-streamed
to the company. Instead of €4.7 billion, we would be at €5.1 billion.
As a conclusion, I could say that we can expect to have much more cash up-streamed to
the holding company, and this is why we are conﬁdent in our ability to increase our
payout ratio from 40% to 50%, to 45% to 55%.
I now hand over to Denis.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Gérald. I would like now to wrap up and summarize the key messages of this
presentation. Strong Solvency II ratio at 212% at the end of Q3 under our approved
internal model. This is no surprise because this framework has driven our strategic and
operational choices in the last several years; product mix, investment mix, risk mitigation
and portfolio diversiﬁcation. Our Solvency II ratio is very resilient to a variety of ﬁnancial
and non-ﬁnancial shocks.
We have now a very clearly deﬁned capital management framework, with a range of 170%
to 230%, within which you shouldn't worry about the volatility of the ratio. We are able to
increase our dividend payout ratio range to 45% to 55%. We'll have a higher free cash
ﬂow on the Life side by roughly €0.5 billion annually. And in spite of that, we can maintain
our remittance ratio between 75% and 85%. I will add one point, which is that the – we will,
within our capital, continue to increase the quality of our Tier 1 by increasing the core Tier
1 part and slightly reducing the Tier 1 debt part.
With that, I'd like to thank you very much for your attention and now hand over the ﬂoor
back to you for questions-and-answers. First one in the back?

Q&A
Q - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

(40:57) consumes 32% in the ratio. But normally, when I think 1 in 200, it's normally 10
times worse than the 1 in 20. And so, it's obviously not in your case in your model. And so
somehow, I guess, as you go from 1 in 20 to 1 in 200, actually becomes more resilient
eﬀectively, either through hedging or management action. So, I guess, what am I looking
at in this 1-in-20 shock? And obviously, if the hedging kicks in at 1 in 200, is the worst point
between one and 20 and one and 200 that I should be thinking about in terms of
pressure? Thank you.

There is no linearity in the shocks between 1 in 20 and 1 in 200. You can't say that 1 in 200
will cost 10 times more, and that's true for us and that's true for all our competitors. There
is a distribution of losses. We look at to 0.5% probability or 5% probability. And you see
that 0.5% probability which cost us 100 points, and the 5% will cost us 32%, but you
cannot infer from the probability that the shock will be proportional.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi there. Thank you. Farooq Hanif from Citigroup. I don't understand your cash ﬂow
because we're getting mixed signals from other companies. So, surely, when you write
new business market consistently, if you're pricing that way, you should be creating value.
So why is there a new business strain?
And then also on your back book, you should be releasing risk margin. It must be a very
big – it's obviously a very big number, it's €12 billion added to liabilities. So just wanted to
understand, I might – are we just thinking about this incorrectly because I think
inconsistency opening up between the way the diﬀerent companies are reporting cash
over Solvency II? It may be that you have to take me oﬄine to answer that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second thing is why 75% to 85% remittance, if you're saying you keep a slight buﬀer
locally, there will come a point at which you can remit all of your cash. So what is still the
constraint in your business – is it the U.S.? And last point is, yeah, why do you move to
300% CAL? I mean, is that equivalent to what you would say as an economic capital
equivalent level, or is it that a regulator told you to move to 300%? Thank you.

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Gérald, do you want to take the questions?

A - Gérald Harlin
Yeah. I'll start with your question about the 75% to 85% remittance ratio. Keep in mind that
what you say would be absolutely true if you would have only European companies. But
it's not the case. You mentioned the U.S., and as you know for the time being, the U.S., as
we said in the past, has the capacity to upstream quite signiﬁcant amount of cash.
Remember that in the previous meeting, we said that we could expect between €600
million and €1 billion, so it's still true. But look at Japan and look at Switzerland, that
means that these countries have a tougher regulatory constraints and framework, which
means that in the end, on average, we are quite comfortable saying that it will be 75% to
85%. That's the main reason.

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Do you want to take the question on new business strain and the Life business?

A - Gérald Harlin
So your question, and I'm not so sure that I understood your question about the new
business strain. That means that the new business strain is anyway something which is
statutory. So that means that it won't change. So that means that what does it correspond

to? It's purely cash. So that means that you have to pay your commissions. And the fact
that you have to pay your commissions makes that you have a cash strain...

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

FINAL

Plus internal acquisition expenses.

A - Gérald Harlin
Plus internal acquisition expenses, agree, which means that you have a cash strain which
is, I would say, the same whatever the framework. So it's purely cash. It's in and out.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

The local GAAP is not changing.

A - Gérald Harlin
No, no, no.

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

It has nothing to do with local GAAP.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gérald Harlin
It has nothing to do with local GAAP. It's local – it's local cash needs. So it's what we call –
it's exactly the same. Just take a look at our EEV framework, it's exactly the same. So that's
what we call generally the strain. So that's why it's a – I hope I answer your question, but
it's really something which is quite the same taking the detail on countries.

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

I would add one point which is that on the new business required capital, it's really a
function of your mix of business. So if your mix of business is quite proﬁtable which is our
case, then you have – you don't have any additional new business need in addition to
what VIF you create. If you have a diﬀerent mix of business which has a lot of guaranteed
general account business, then you could still have a new business required capital on
top of the VIF. Is that clear?

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

The 300%?

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

I see, yes, but – so, the 300%, yes, we have heard diﬀerent ﬁgures coming from diﬀerent
competitors, but what you don't know and what we don't know is what has been required
by the respective supervisors in terms of add-ons. So we can tell you that 300% for us is
what we believe is required by the local regulator and that's why we put the 300% as the
equivalent of 100% in Solvency II. For the companies that have taken a lower ﬁgure, it may

Page 12 of 30

mean that they had a capital add-on separately. And so I don't – I'm sure that there is
fairness across geographies because the same supervisors are supervising diﬀerent
groups. But that may be handled in a diﬀerent way. Nick in the second row? Microphone?

FINAL

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Hi. It's Nick Holmes at SocGén. Sorry. I apologize for my creaky voice. First, two questions.
First is on the dividend, the new payout ratio, 45% to 55%, previously with 40% to 50%,
you started at the bottom and have worked your way up. And the question is, can we
expect a similar sort of progression? I mean, for the dividend this year, presumably well, I
mean, can you give us guidance? Are you expecting it to be 45% basically for this year?
That's the ﬁrst question. Do you want me to give the second question or do you want to -?
Second question is looking more optimistically at the progression of the dividend. And I
wanted to ask, you've always been a leader in prioritizing Unit-Linked and being capital
eﬃcient. We can see the beneﬁts coming through. But because you've always been a
leader, how much more scope do you think there is? And I'm thinking in the context of
Solvency II, which is a regulatory framework that favors the strategy you've had for a long
time. One would imagine that there could be quite a lot more scope to improve your
capital eﬃciency and to sell a lot more Unit-Linked. And I wondered if you could possibly
share your thoughts with us on that? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Nick. On the ﬁrst question, I'm afraid I will not give more guidance. If we
deﬁne a range of 45% to 55%, this is to leave us the ﬂexibility to be any place between
45% and 55%, and I would not give more guidance, and you would be surprised if I were
to. On the second topic of Unit-Linked, I believe it's a very important topic for the whole
industry, especially in the context of low interest rates. And I think it has more to do – our
ability to go beyond the proportion of Unit-Linked that we currently have, has a lot more
to do with how ﬁnancial markets evolve.
In other words, we have had quite favorable markets, equity markets in the recent years,
and that has helped us improve the proportion of Unit-Linked, but it also has a lot to do
with the product design and the sales tools and training that we give to our sales force
because I believe that's – I mean, our customers still want some guarantees, and we need
to do a better job of guiding them through the asset allocation that will make them have
enough money for their retirement.
And so, it's a long process. It's a process that, I mean, where all the industry as a
challenge. If we want to develop Unit-Linked, we have to make sure that we sell products
with the appropriate asset allocation and convince our customers that even if they are 50
years old, they would still normally need to have 50% of equities which are – and
sometimes the regulation goes against that. So there is – this is a big topic for the
European industry with rates at zero. And you heard today that QE would continue until at
least March 2017. Clearly, the savers would need to invest more in equities, and it's not
obvious with the mindset that most people have in Continental Europe, but it's deﬁnitely
a challenge for the industry.

Can I – may I – just a very, very quick follow-up on the subject of Unit-Linked. In France, if
you look back far enough to the early 2000s, I think it was as much – Unit-Linked was as
much as 40% for new business. Do you think Solvency II could drive a return to that?

So this would allow me to make a comment on the Danish compromise. You know that, I
mean, the Danish compromise allows that the banks to double count their insurance
capital, and it is clear that this has – this means that there was less concern on the banks in
terms of their capital consumption. And if the Danish compromise is prolonged, this trend
will continue. So there is clearly a situation where pure insurers are at the disadvantage
against the bancassurers who are less worried about the way their insurance capital is
consumed. But having said that, I believe that there was now a big awareness that this is
not going to last forever, and we see also the banks driving more Unit-Linked. Great.
Back?

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Thanks. It's James Shuck from UBS. I have three questions, please. The ﬁrst one is on the
corporate credit spread sensitivity. On slide 15, you show that for a stable Volatility
Adjuster, there's a 13-point impact on the Solvency II ratio, whereas over the page, it's only
1 point. So am I correct in assuming that you're assuming a dynamic Volatility Adjuster?
And then kind of connected to that, I'm interested in – I mean, obviously, the economics
are such that you clearly are exposed to credit spreads as long as the credit spreads
blowout is driven by illiquidity, then Volatility Adjuster is fully justiﬁed. So I'm kind of keen
to understand what your default assumption is within the corporate credit, I suppose, and
actually what happens if you double the corporate credit default assumption within that
so I can get a feel for what the true economic sensitivity is to corporate credit. So, that's
my ﬁrst question, please.
Secondly, the range of 170% to 230%, that's a 60-point range. You make a big point about
you've got low level of volatility. So why do you need such a big range? At what stage can
you see yourselves narrowing that range? That's my second question.
And the third question is just quite a simple one, really. Could you give me a
reconciliation between the basic own funds and the eligible own funds, please?

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

FINAL

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

Yes. So on credit spread, you're right in assuming that we used a dynamic Volatility
Adjuster. But that's an SCR issue, not an AFR issue. The dynamic Volatility Adjuster is used
in the SCR. And you will have seen in the slides that what really matters in the corporate
spreads sensitivity is the AFR. So what we have shown on the slide that you refer to is if in,
I ﬁnd, the liabilities, the Volatility Adjuster were not to move at all, then the sensitivity on
the asset side would give the number that you have on that additional slide. But it's
irrespective of what happens to the SCR with a dynamic VA. But you're right in saying that
we use a dynamic VA.
On your other question which is the default assumption, so that's usually speaking of
corporate default, right? That's not in the market risk. That's in our default risk. And the
number that we show on slide 13, the €4 billion, mainly relates to corporate default much
more than to receivables and so on. So that's the amount that we would have.

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

And you have a third question?

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Well, the second question was for the ﬁrst part or the second part, was the range of...

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Oh, sorry. On the range, look, we have a ratio which, as we say, is very resilient. But, I
mean, we remember the situation at the end of Q1. You see that we – the ratio dropped by
10 points, and it was a – I mean, it was a big issue for the analysts. And we want to tell you
that we are not worried by movements of 10 points or 20 points. Because markets will
move, our ratio will move, and we are running a very long-term business. And we are not
going to take short-term decisions on the basis of those short-term movements.
So we tell you we feel very comfortable within that range, and you shouldn't worry about
it. Yes, arguably, it's a big range, but we are comfortable with that range. And we don't
see the beneﬁt of moving to a narrower range which would lead to major strategic
decisions. We don't believe it's the right thing. So the reason why we've put a large range
is because we want to manage the business on a long-term basis because this is a longterm business, and not on short-term ﬂuctuations.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

And then just on the basic own funds and the eligible own funds?

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

I think you're referring to the diﬀerence between – well, the diﬀerence would be
operational risk generally on this. That's for the standard formula. Well, I'm mistaken with
something. I'm not sure I understand your question.

No. To the extent that the AFR is the diﬀerence between the market value of the assets
and the market value of the liabilities, you would have the basic owned funds and then
there's restrictions over the amount of the basic own funds to get you to your actual
eligible owned funds under the Solvency II framework. Perhaps you can follow-up later.

Q - Oliver G. Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Okay, sorry. It's Oliver Steel at Deutsche Bank. Two questions. You talked about increasing
your equity Tier 1, at least I think that was the understanding relative to the debt in that
Tier 1. Can you just gives us some sort of guidance as to over what period and how far you
want to move those ratios by. And just so we have a sort of sense of how you might use
free capital generation going forward?
And then, secondly, Alban talked about the regime being stable from here. Is that right or
what changes could you expect from here on?

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Gérald, do you want to take the ﬁrst one?

A - Gérald Harlin
Yeah. Oliver, about your ﬁrst question, going back to the cash generation. So Alban
mentioned that we can expect to have an 11 points cash generation year-after-year. And,
as you know, this is after dividend, but taking – we are used to, taking many times, we
mentioned that we would have external growth and, let's say, €1 billion of M&A. What
does represent, €1 billion of M&A? It would represent, assuming that the goodwill would
be one-third, it would be minus 3%. Assuming that it would be two-thirds of the value, i.e.
€600 million roughly, it could represent minus 6%.
So you can – I believe this gives you a good approximation of the fact that we can expect
on a net-net basis on average, to have an operational cash generation, let's say, between
4% and 6%, roughly speaking, and that gives you – and again, what I said is that Tier 1
Page 16 of 30

under stress scenario is not so resilient. So I believe that it gives you an idea of the speed
and the pace at which we could recover. And presently we have as mentioned in the
appendix, we have €9 billion of Tier 1.

Bloomberg Transcript

So I think there's been a number of back and forth in the construction of the Solvency II
framework. So everybody now wants to use it. When I say everybody, it's both the
insurance industry and the supervisors, before potential changes are implemented.
Obviously, what you may have in mind is the discussion on the UFR. There won't be any
change on this at least until the end of 2016. The EIOPA then during 2016 will launch the
consultation on what should be the level of the UFR. What the industry is saying, the CFO
forum, the CRO forum, Insurance Europe and so on is that we need stability. And so for
the next three years to ﬁve years, we are asking the supervisors – the regulators not to
change the UFR because we need stability in Solvency II. That's, for me, the one thing that
could change, and I will not mention the ICS and insurance capital standards that might
come in so many years.

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

The other topic that could change is the sovereign risk charge in the standard model, but
as you have seen, we are already taking it into account in the internal model.

Q - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Thank you very much. I didn't quite understand, and I'm on slide 27, you talked about the
local excess capital. And I just wondered if you could just say again what you meant
because I didn't understand if it's already excess or it's going to be excess or it's going to
be released, France and the Germany and the U.S.?
And then on slide 24 and 25, so slide 24, it strikes me as the dividend never goes down,
and slide 25 used slightly diﬀerent words for the diﬀerent scenarios according to dividend
ﬂexibility or outside range. And I just wondered whether underlying this, you've got a
kind of commitment to a ratchet dividend, in other words, the payout 45% to 55%, but not
cutting it, that seems to be coming through but maybe I'm wrong here. And then, you
mentioned the balance of deals in the past that was positives, you released more capital
than you reinvested. Is that right now we should expect €1 billion roughly to be reinvested
net every year? Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin

I'll start with the excess capital. It's on page 27. Let's put it this way, as you know, in a
Solvency I world, we were quite highly reliant – we relied on the unrealized capital gains.
And you know that the unrealized...

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

FINAL

On bonds.

A - Gérald Harlin
On bonds. And the unrealized capital gains, by deﬁnition, were extremely volatile. Here, I
would say that it's completely diﬀerent. And obviously, today, yes, we have some capital
excess mostly in the countries that are mentioned here, but it's quite volatile, and
tomorrow it will be diﬀerent. That means that it will be less volatile.

Bloomberg Transcript

What do I mean by a buﬀer? Let's say that the buﬀer, it could be between 130% and 150%,
but what is above these levels can be distributed not in one day, but progressively, and
that's what we meant, which means that we are quite comfortable to say that over time, it
will be possible to distribute now, and that's why we have – we conﬁrmed that the €0.5
billion, the example of €0.5 billion could be distributed because we will have this capacity
to upstream cash through the retained earnings locally in the diﬀerent entities. And it's
mostly the case for the European entities, of course, because it will be – it's much more
complicated, again, relative to countries like Japan or to countries like Switzerland
because the framework is diﬀerent, but it doesn't mean that we won't do eﬀorts in order
to reduce and to optimize capital in these countries.

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

On the dividend payout range, I don't think I can tell you more than what is on slide 25.
Basically, we say that's between 170% and 230%, we are conﬁdent that we can pay our
dividend between 45% and 55% of adjusted earnings. It means that outside this range,
we might have to change the payout ratio either upwards or downwards.

Q - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

And within the 170% to 230%, given the history of maintaining at least the same dividend,
is there kind of implicit commitment maintaining the dividend or is that completely
ﬂexible depending on the earnings?

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

I mean, obviously, all companies tend to have a policy where you try to smooth the pace
of growth of the dividend. I will not tell you anything more. That's a rational thing to do
and that's what all boards will eventually propose to their shareholders.

On deals, yes, we have already indicated in our previous calls or investor meetings that
we would expect that the balance between acquisitions and disposals might be diﬀerent
in the future that would have probably slightly more acquisitions than we would have
disposals. That doesn't mean that we say that we won't continue to make disposals. But
on balance, we would expect the balance to be slightly positive instead of having been
negative or having more acquisitions than disposals going forward.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Thank you. Hi. It's Ralph Hebgen from KBW. Just two things. One, going back to slide 28.
I'm not entirely sure I understand why under the Solvency II framework, the new business
required capital goes down and so I would value perhaps some comments on the
dynamics there. And second, going forward, or let's start with the past. I mean, the past
we had a very stable framework of reporting cash within the MCEV framework. Could you
give us some comments how you plan to perhaps report on cash in the future under the
Solvency II framework?

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Gérald, do you want to take the two questions?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gérald Harlin
Yes. Starting ﬁrst with your ﬁrst question about the page 28. So, as you know, the biggest
diﬀerence between Solvency I and Solvency II is that you can beneﬁt from the future
proﬁt. Let's call it the value of in-force business, the VIF. So what does it mean? That
means that up to now, where are had to post capital, let's say 4%, 1%, et cetera, you had to
post capital which was hard capital in front of – in order to do new business. In the future,
depending on the type of business that you will write, you will have less capital
requirement, hard capital requirement. In other words – and that's our case. The fact that
we are doing, as mentioned before, more Unit-Linked and more Protection means that we
have future proﬁt and we're beneﬁting from this situation. So that's exactly what we want –
that I wanted to mention here and to present here. Your second question was about cash.

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Yes. Cash in the – how we would report cash ﬂows in the future?

A - Gérald Harlin
Yeah. We will report. So, that means that most probably, we will report on a format which
will not be fundamentally diﬀerent from the one of EEV, clearly highlighting the cash
ﬂows. That means that our format which was based on free cash ﬂows, remittance ratio,
how much cash, will be the same, except that on a capital requirement, we will adjust it.
But you will have a strong – we will keep a strong cash ﬂow eﬀort.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. Thank you. It's Blair Stewart from Merrill's. Just following on the cash generation,
you talked about the reduction in your cash consumption and the implication, obviously,
is that your cash generation is the same as it was on the previous disclosures. Is that right,
ﬁrstly?
And following up from that, will you give – clearly the unwind of the discount rate in
Solvency II is the low unwind. And then you have a real-world investment return on top of
that. Coming back to the point about presentation of your cash generation, presumably
you will present on a real-world investment return perspective rather than just simply the
unwind of the Solvency II discount rate (01:10:29).

A - Gérald Harlin
Yeah. Anyway, what I can say about your last question Blair, we will go on, for the sake of
calculation of the IRR, for example, you will need to have the risk free rate plus the
additional – plus the risk margin – plus the spreads. So I think that we will do it also in a
real world. So that means that it won't be very diﬀerent. That means that you will have the
cash ﬂows, and the cash ﬂows under the management case, that will give you the capacity
to calculate, as we do today, IRR. So that's – honestly, I don't believe that it will be – that's
why I said it will be very close from the present framework except that there will be some
small modiﬁcation, and we will have opportunity to discuss it on the right time.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah. I think that's clear. Just two very quick follow-ups and I have very quick additional
questions. You've given some indication in the past of the impact of using U.S. equivalents
in solvency point terms. Is that something that you're prepared to share now or is that
something that's in the past?
And secondly, just a bit (01:11:48) confusion on this with diﬀerent companies you speak to,
but will you publish – will you be required to publish your solvency ratios without or
excluding the impact of the volatility adjuster?

A - Gérald Harlin
About U.S. equivalence, we said that in the past that it would be between 30 and 40
points, so it's still the case. About the volatility adjuster, the answer is no. That means that
it will be required within roughly, if I'm right, it should be in mid-2017. Before, the answer
is not.

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

There was a question in the ﬁrst row (01:12:33)

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Good evening. It's Andrew Crean, Autonomous. Could you – three things. Firstly, what is
the beneﬁt of the internal model relative to the standard formula in terms of your

coverage ratio?
Secondly, when I'm thinking about your remittances, you're basically indicating you're
going to cram down on the local regulators and try and push as much cash up to group as
you can. Does that mean that the 75% to 85% has some element of sort of latent capital
being pushed up or is that sort of ongoing rate? And as regulators settle down on the
Solvency II and begin to understand themselves, do you think that they could open their
shoulders a bit more and allow money to come up?
And then thirdly, on slide 13, where you've given the underwriting risk, market risk, credit
risk, probably not now but would you give us a bit more understanding of the diﬀerent
elements within the market risk and the underwriting risk there? The €15 billion here, it
might be quite useful to understand how much of that is equity risk and all the other
components?

A - Gérald Harlin

Bloomberg Transcript

As far as your ﬁrst question, that means that as far as the internal model is concerned, we
don't – we beneﬁt from this internal model. So we don't give the advantage of the internal
model relative to the standard formula. It's not something which is required at all in a
Solvency II framework and at no time, it will be asked for.
About your question relative to the remittance, I would say that so long as you will use
new business future proﬁt, if you want to take all beneﬁt of this new business proﬁt, for
sure, you will use some retained earnings, local capacity that you would have in the local
entity and that's what we will do. So that means that we will, as much – so long as we have
signiﬁcant excess capacities that over time could be up-streamed, then that's why the 75%
to 85% is something that we can conﬁrm and where we switch we are quite comfortable.

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

And this is – so, you should interpret that as meaning on an ongoing basis and not as
something that would result from, as you say, pushing a lot of money upfront in year one
and two and then not having the ability to push as much in the later years.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

I suggest you could, in the ﬁrst few years, actually push out more than 85% as some of this
one-oﬀ excess capital get moved up.

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Maybe, but on the other hand, we have some internal debt that we would unwind.

A - Gérald Harlin
But nevertheless, as I've said, what is important to keep in mind that even net of these
internal debts that would be unwound, there is capacity. Alban?

FINAL

And on your last question, what I can tell you is on page 13, the examples that we gave in
the boxes are in a decreasing order of importance so in our market risk, equity risk is
more than spread risk which is more than interest rate risk. And for those who wonder
why equity risk comes ﬁrst, though we have limited exposure on our balance sheet, you
should remember that our Unit-Linked business has some equity exposure, and we might
lose future proﬁts from our Unit-Linked business if equities decrease.

Q - William H. Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Thanks. It's William Elderkin from Goldman, two questions. First of all, the guidance
you've given in terms of the Solvency II capital structure on slide 26, does that supersede
or show should we think about that in the context of the IFRS balance sheet target
leverage range of 23% to 25%.
And then secondly, going back to the – I think you made a statement on slide 11 that you
expected the capital generation from the in-force and the life business to be roughly
stable, Solvency I compared to Solvency II. I'm just wondering, is there a simple
explanation of why that's the case given there seems to be so many parts for change
moving to a full market value balance sheet and hence, why net-net, there isn't a sort of
any material change?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gérald Harlin
On your ﬁrst question relative to our Tier 1 debt, I would say that this doesn't change.
Look at what I said, I mentioned that we will still have 23% to 25% target. We will keep it.
It's our interest. And we always said that below, it would be considered as not in the
interest of the shareholders. Nevertheless, you can imagine that over time, we could have
some parts of the Tier 1 debt that could be replaced by other categories and that's mostly
it, no need to pay for a spread which is quite important. We will keep the present range in
term of debt while reinforcing our capital structure.

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

Just the other question on the cash ﬂows in terms of (01:18:43).

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

The cash ﬂow was from the in-force.

A - Gérald Harlin
Yes. The cash ﬂow in the in-force, it's not something which is so easy as you can imagine
and you mentioned it. Thank you. But anyway, you can – we looked at it and it's – I said it's
broadly the same. So, don't – we cannot expect to have big diﬀerences. What I could say
and that what I didn't mention and it goes back to the previous question is that so long as
for the in-force as well, you will beneﬁt from the VIF makes that if you have some capital
available then you could beneﬁt from this, but I didn't take into consideration and that's
why in the presentation, I focused only on the new business. But it's also something which
is possible, but it goes back to the capacity to de-capitalize the company and to make the
Page 22 of 30



Company Name: AXA SA

Date: 2015-12-03

bid, to monetize the VIF. That's another way that I could explain it, but broadly speaking,
everything equal, should be more or less the same.

FINAL

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi there. Farooq Hanif from Citi. So it seems to me from what you're saying that it's more
attractive to buy stuﬀ in Europe because you've got a market value frame, which is looking
similar to what you had before. You have a big diversiﬁcation beneﬁt. I'm just wondering
whether this is informing your M&A.
And secondly, is there any convexity in your 75 bps corporate bond spread sensitivity
because I know you've got credit derivatives on the balance sheet. I know they're not
necessarily that hedged, but can you talk about any convexity that gets more negative
beyond 75 bps if we get a really, really big shock? Thank you.

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

So, on the M&A strategy, we are not going to change our M&A strategy in any signiﬁcant
way. We will continue with the strategy that we have had in the last 4.5 years, focused on
P&C and protection, focused on high growth markets, and you should see a continuation
of the previous strength there.
On the convexity, you want to take that, Gérald?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gérald Harlin
No, apparently I don't see any convexity. That means that there is convexity when there is
a kind of option. So that's the case for interest rates but not for spreads.

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Alban.

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

Yeah. If anything, we do have some protections on corporate spreads widening. So that
would protect us against slightly, but against a signiﬁcant shock. So I don't think there is
convexity in that.

A - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

A question in the back.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Thank you. It's Andy from Macquarie again. A couple of questions. The ﬁrst one is on slide
12. I couldn't ﬁnd any adjustment for fungibility that you talked about. Is it right to assume
there isn't really any deduction to fungible or there no fungibility problems assumed in
the Solvency II framework.

Page 23 of 30



Company Name: AXA SA

FINAL

And the second is if I just might like to kind of touch a bit more on the volatility adjuster
and the comment you made that because you run lots of government bond, it's actually
quite positive when the volatility adjuster increases. So are kind of regulators happy with
you assuming the credit from the volatility adjuster, even though you own a portfolio of
mainly government bonds? Thank you.

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

So on fungibility, there is a haircut of £500 million, and that haircut is the recognition that
the minority shareholders' funds cannot cover other entity's losses, and that mainly comes
from our AXA MPS minority shareholders. And that's all. There's no other haircut in terms
of eligibility. On the VA, the reference portfolio has certain percentage of government
bonds and corporate bonds. And all the industry has to use the VA that comes from that
reference portfolio whatever they have on the asset side. And given that we have a
diﬀerent mix than the...

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Which is more conservative.

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Which is more conservative. As I explained during the presentation, the corporate bonds
spread widening is more mitigated (01:23:23) than the government bonds spread
widening. That's why you have that nine points sensitivity for 50 bps whereas it's closer to
zero for the corporate bonds spread.
Did that answer your question?

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

(01:23:40) there's no question about – everyone's happy with you (01:23:46) using that in
your SCR. How big is the beneﬁt out of interest?

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

Okay. So, on the AFR, we use it like the rest of the industry; on the SCR, the ﬁrst part of the
model that was approved by the supervisors, so everybody – if you refer to the
supervisors that looked at our model, everybody is happy with that. Yes.

A - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Question in the front.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Thanks. James Shuck from UBS again. Just a couple of quick follow-ups, please. You
mentioned the government bonds are risk charged. Could you just outline what your
approach is there, or are you just treating them like normal corporate bonds based on the
credit rating? In particular Italy and Spain I suppose.

FINAL

And then, secondly, just returning to the cash generation; you can see that the strain in
year one is positive on capital generation. Obviously, you mentioned that Solvency I basis
moving to Solvency II, but I'm thinking about capital generation from the back book. So at
the moment when we look at your MCEV disclosure we can see how the required capital
runs oﬀ as we move through one year. So my question is really what happens to that level
of required capital release in the near-term as you transition to a Solvency II environment.

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

So on the ﬁrst one, which is the government bond risk charge. So like for all the other risk,
we look at path volatility, but here we look at path volatility country-by-country. So we
would eﬀectively have diﬀerent capital charge for a Spanish government bond or a
Belgium one or French one, based on the volatility that you've seen over the past years
and notably in 2011-2012.

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Yes. The euro ﬁnancial crisis has had signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the – of the capital charge for
Solvency (01:25:40). Second question, Gérald.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gérald Harlin
About your second question that's not very far from the previous question. And what I
said is that the way we released capital on the Solvency II world will not be exactly the
same, but more or less it will be nice. So that means that we cannot expect with very big
diﬀerences. And keep in mind as well that before in the Solvency II world we were using
150% of Solvency I which means that we had already a certain amount of cushion that was
used in our EV report, but again, wait for the – we will present it with the 2015 accounts
and we will present a new format and we will (01:26:30) to release this at the time, but
don't expect big diﬀerences on that side.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Just to follow-up very quickly on that. So, for Italy, for example, if you took the sov work,
can you actually tell me what your capital charges are for Italian sovereigns?

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

I don't think we want to go into the details of our various capital charges for various risks.

A - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Question in the ﬁrst row?

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

It's Andrew Crean again. One thing I don't understand is when you – the most important
slide according to you is this one about the resilience and the least resilient situation was
2008-2009 ﬁnancial crisis which hit you by 48 points. Now, that essentially was a credit
crisis. Given the fact that you're saying that you're very resilient under a credit situation,
how come that is minus 48 points?

Company Name: AXA SA

Date: 2015-12-03

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

So it was not only credit crisis because at the same time, you had equities going down,
you had interest rates going down, you had credit spreads widening and...

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

FINAL

And volatility.

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

...volatility signiﬁcantly increasing. So you had all those asset classes going the wrong way.
And obviously, when – I showed you the shocks to individual ones, but naturally when
they are severe and they are combined, the total combination of those shocks is more
than a single sum.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Perhaps it might be interesting now for us to have a feel for what's going on there within
the 48 points.

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Michael (01:28:08), in the second row? If you can you pass the mic?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Again, a stupid question because I don't understand what the Tier 1 discussion and I'm a
bit lost. You say you want to reduce it or improve the quality but not change the debt
ratios. Can you just give an example of what you intend to do, just so I understand? That's
all. Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. Let's say that you could imagine that we will have, within the next year, some Tier 1
debt that will mature. And we could decide that part of this maturing debt, instead of
being renewed as Tier 1 debt will be replaced by senior or Tier 2, which will be cheaper.
At the same time, the fact and it goes back to Oliver's question about what you expect,
that means that the fact that we have capital generation of 11 points minus eventual M&A
makes that you have an accretion of your solvency. And I believe that you have the answer
to your question. I'm clear or not?

Q - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Not the last point.

A - Gérald Harlin
No but the last point is a fact that...

Retained earnings. Do you have retained earnings?

FINAL

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. Imagine that you have replaced a Tier 1 debt with a senior. So it may be, at least, the
eﬀect would be to decrease your solvency ratio, okay but progressively, the fact that you
are accretive and that you have, let's say, a few points that increase your solvency ratio
makes – while, over time, while keeping the same solvency ratio, you end up with a
structure which is stronger and cheaper.

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Any further questions? Yes (01:30:07)?

Q - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Just – how have you treated your own pension funds within the – sorry, pension fund
within the solvency, on what basis? Is it the accounting IAS basis or the funded basis or
what? And the second question, I was just going to ask – or just for numbers purposes,
can you provide the breakdown of the €2.5 billion between asset management, banking,
and the others?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

So on the ﬁrst one, we use for owned staﬀ pension funds on the AFR which we have on
IFRS balance sheet, there's no diﬀerence. But in terms of capital required for our pension
funds, we use the same model as for the rest of our activities. So there is a capital
requirement for our pension funds which is the same way.

Q - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

It's in excess of the amount under IAS basis?

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

For the AFR, what Alban just explained, we take the IFRS basis. It's deducted – we don't
change the existing deduction but for the SCR we include a chart which is based on the
structure of the liabilities.

Q - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Are all companies doing that? Do you know if everyone is doing that same basis?

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

No. I'm not sure I know, but it was something shared obviously by our collegiate
supervisors where all almost all European supervisors represented. So, I would think that
our competitors should do the same but I can't assure you that.

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

So, I have to come back to you on that one.

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Okay. Blair?

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Just coming back on the Tier 1 debt instruments that you have. At the moment, my
recollection is ﬁrstly they're very long dated, and secondly they're very cheap, certainly
cheaper than equity. Why would you want to replace this with equity or am I missing
something?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gérald Harlin
The point is that it's very long, yes but they are calls as you know. Second, about the cost
roughly is 4.6%. Okay. And second, we could say that this debt is as I said under stress
scenarios, it wouldn't be extremely resistant. So that's all these reasons combined make
that we decide to do this. Look, today – under today's conditions, replacing, let's say, Tier
2 debt or senior debt is much cheaper.

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Any further question? Michael (01:33:27), again?

Q - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Very slight puzzled. So, you're distinguished between Solvency I strain of new business
and the Solvency II is €0.5 billion beneﬁt which is lovely. And you've been running your
company on this for a while. So presumably, what you're telling us today you've been
actually doing before or I don't quite understand. So if you've been running – if you've
been using this framework until now, this change from Solvency I to Solvency II and the
cash up-streaming, is that a real change or is that just a kind of information change for our
beneﬁt?

A - Gérald Harlin
No, it's a real change. That means that we were not ruled before by Solvency II. We could
not use the future proﬁt of our in-force business just in order to match up capital

requirements. No, it's real. It's real.

FINAL

It's real. So, you're going to pass next (01:34:31). You're going to pay the lucky
shareholders here (01:34:37) for 2015, is that right? Or is it 2016 that it comes into force?

A - Gérald Harlin
It comes into force in 2016.

Q - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

It comes into force in 2016. Sorry. I beg your pardon. Thank you.
(01:34:55) Société Générale Credit Research. Sorry, one more question about your capital
structure. You were talking about replacing Tier 1 hybrid with Tier 2. But do I understand
you correctly that you leave the door open to place some of your outstanding Tier 1
hybrid with new Solvency II compliant Tier 1? And would you consider being the ﬁrst
issuer, issuing Solvency II-compliant Tier 1?
And second question, am I right to assume that all of your outstanding hybrid debt falls
under the grandfathering regime, and it's not Solvency II-compliant in its own right?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. So it's not at all what I said. And I didn't say that we wanted to be the ﬁrst one to
use this Solvency II Tier 1 compliant. We will see in the future. And second, yes, you
remember that we mentioned that we were beneﬁting from the grandfathering and this is
a given. So we will beneﬁt it for 10 years. So we'll keep it. And you remember maybe that
we decided that one year ago, we decided to prolong the sum of this debt in order to
fully beneﬁt from it. So this is something that we will keep.

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Okay. Do we have questions from – on the – no? Okay. So I believe that we have
exhausted your questions. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much
for coming for this investor day and I wish you a very pleasant end of the day. Thank you.
