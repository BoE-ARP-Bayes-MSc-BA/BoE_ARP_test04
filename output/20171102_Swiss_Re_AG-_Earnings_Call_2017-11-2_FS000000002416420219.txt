MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning or good afternoon. Welcome to the Swiss Re's Nine Months 2017 Results
Conference Call. Please note that today's conference call is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to David Cole, Group CFO. Please go
ahead.

David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good morning or good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our
nine months 2017 results conference call. I'm here today with Eddie Schmid, our Group
Chief Underwriting Officer; and Philippe Brahin, our Head of Investor Relations. So, let me
start with just a brief overview of the key figures that we published this morning.
Our nine months results were impacted by the large claims expected following Hurricanes
Harvey, Irma and Maria, as well as the Mexican earthquakes, which in aggregate

amounted to $3.6 billion. As such, Swiss Re reports a net loss for the nine-month period of
$468 million. These severe nat cats are earnings (0:55) events for the Swiss Re Group.
With P&C Re and Corporate Solutions reporting net losses for the first nine months, and
our capital position remains very strong. The market developments we observe in the
aftermath of these events validate the rationale of our capital management priorities and
demonstrate our significant financial flexibility. We're able to absorb the losses, respond
to client demands and strengthen the capital position of Corporate Solutions, so that it is
able to take advantage of opportunities in the commercial insurance market.
Additionally, we're able to repatriate excess capital to our shareholders with the launch of
our share buyback program. Specifically on Corporate Solutions, Swiss Re has established
a leading platform in excess layers, providing nat capacity to underwrite commercial risk.
Both in Corporate Solutions and in P&C Re, we are very well positioned to benefit from
pricing improvements, which we expect to occur across all lines.
The group also benefited from the diversification of its global book as Life & Health
Reinsurance reported a strong ROE of 14.3% on the back of good underwriting and
investment performance. Life Capital also reported strong gross cash generation of $789
million for the first nine months.

Bloomberg Transcript

And finally, Asset Management provided a solid contribution to the group with the strong
ROI of 3.5% and a stable running yield of 2.9%. Our share buyback program, as authorized
by the 2017 AGM, will be launched tomorrow on the 3rd of November, as we have
received all the necessary approvals.
And with that, I'll hand over to our Head of Investor Relations, Philippe Brahin, who will
introduce the Q&A session.

Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Many thanks, David, and good day to all of you also from my side. Just a quick reminder
that we have adjusted the format of our reporting and our comments during the call will
be on our nine-month figures, in line with the scope of our press release. And also, I
would say, as usual, please restrict yourself to two questions and register again for followup questions.
So, with that, operator, could we please have the first question.

Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my questions. You mentioned that you
expect pricing conditions to improve across the board. Could you give a little bit more
flavor there or anecdotal comments, perhaps, on sort of three different buckets; so the
P&C Reinsurance, but also on retrocession and perhaps on the primary commercial P&C
pricing for the CorSo business? So, that's the first question. And the second question, the
SST ratio, the last time you talked about that, it was 262% for 2017. Has this changed
taking into account large losses and maybe you could give an indication to the extent that
it has changed? Thank you very much.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Thank you. Nadine. Eddie will take the first question, and I'll come back to the second.

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. I'm happy to give a bit more flavor around the expected price increases. Maybe as
an introductory comment, it's clear that both the P&C Reinsurance business as well as the
Commercial business globally has been running below cost of capital. If you normalize it
for nat cat would lock (4:23) and reserve releases. So, it's pretty clear that this is now the
time where prices have to return to sustainable levels. Obviously, these expected
increases, they vary, firstly, depending on how loss-affected certain businesses are, but
then also how much the price deficiency was on the expiring accounts. So in broader
terms, I would say, clearly, most significant increases are expected in U.S., as this is the
market most effective, but of course also in the Caribbean and then a bit to further away,
we would expect more moderate price increases, but pretty much a global impact.
In terms of lines of business, it's obviously the property lines that are most affected. But
then also on the specialized side with lines like marine affected, you would expect
something. And even on the casualty lines, we would expect improvements, not
particularly for the cat losses, but some of the casualty lines like motor in the U.S., motor in
Europe, U.S. liability have also not performed well.
And so pretty much, an across-the-board increase, but quite some differentiation. And
you also see that maybe it's about the different segments of the markets; retro,
reinsurance and commercial. I think the positive dynamics is that all these three parts of
the gain are now under pressure to improve. It starts also on the direct side, with the
commercial pressure, business has been under significant pressure for some time.
Actually, a lot of these losses in U.S. state (5:55) was primarily commercial players. So,
they clearly have to take some actions to bring their profitability up. And then also there
will be some pressure from the retro side, quite some reinsurers depend on retrocession
traditional, but also alternative capital. We think quite a bit of these alternative capital is
affected or at least locked in collaterals, so that will put some pressure on retro prices,
which then forces some of the reinsurers that depend on retro to also increase the prices.
And according to historical plateaus (6:28), clearly, you would expect biggest increase on
the retro side and then still significant ones on the reinsurance side. And then on the
commercial side, the direct could also be quite significant. So that's just a bit the picture
how I would differentiate, without being too specific in terms of numbers. It's still early

days, we have some price point, some deals out there, renewing, as we speak, they are
positive. But it's too early to give any, let's say, quantitative assessment.

FINAL

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Thank you, Eddie. And Nadine, coming back to your second question on our SST, you're
right, last time we published it was 62% (7:06). We'll of course update that the beginning
of next year. Just to give you some indication however (7:13) order of magnitude, what I'm
about to say is very much a simplification, but I think it still gives a good sense. A post tax
loss of about $500 million would reduce our SST ratio by something in the range of about
3 percentage points.
Now, there are a lot of moving parts and also, of course, we'll come out with our SST at
the beginning of the year. But as you correctly mentioned, I think we came into the year,
into the third quarter with a very strong capital position. We have seen these losses and
are able to absorb them within our capital position, and at the same time, act in the
marketplace as well as act vis-à-vis our shareholders exactly in keeping with the capital
management philosophy and priorities that we've stated before, and I think this is very
important, because we're able to demonstrate that the capital position of the group is
strong and that there are advantages to that.

Bloomberg Transcript

We obviously expect to be very active in the marketplace right now, but I think it's also
important that given the overall financial situation and flexibility of the group that we're
also comfortable in launching the CHF 1 billion share repurchase program.

{BIO 15200446 <GO>}

Okay. Very clear. Thank you so much.

The next question is from Kamran Hossain from RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi. Question on Corporate Solutions to start with, the $1 billion capital injection, could you
give us an indication of maybe how much business going forward you expect that to
support. Those are, I mean, I think – based on my math, it's kind of $1.3 billion to $1.5
billion, but any kind of color or kind of rule of thumb there.
And secondly, on the share buyback, given the extremely strong capital position, you've
been able to launch the share buyback today. Would you consider launching it earlier in
the year next year, if we get to that point? Just any color or thoughts on that would be
really helpful? Thank you.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Eddie, you're going to answer the first and I'll come back to the second again.

FINAL

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

Yeah. I'll give it a try for the first one. I mean, I would say, CorSo is on a long-term growth
strategy. And now is really the time to restore the profitability. That's the first priority that
will also then support growth in premium volumes, in exposure. But the real game is to
also continue to build the primary lead capabilities to increase the footprint. So, the big
growth is over a number of years. So, I think the first focus is clearly to drive pricing. And
then, depending on how much price we can really gain, we'll also deployable more
capacity into that space. But I would not give a direct number how much more premium
volume this $1 billion of capital injection would be.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Thanks. So let me just add one comment there...

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

(10:05).

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

...before I go on to the share buyback program. If you look at the nine months results,
Corporate Solutions incurred approximately $1 billion of losses through the nine months.
And effectively, what we have done now is strengthened the capital back up to position
the Corporate Solutions, which was at the beginning of the year. Now, they started the
year in a very well capitalized position. I think we're in a very well capitalized position
today. And that's important, because we see the opportunities in the marketplace.
And as Eddie said, we have a long-term strategy, long-term ambition here, and these
types of market events, obviously, will impact our short-term results. But in terms of how
we wish to participate in the market, how we wish to actually grow that business, these
events do not change that.
Let me come back to your second question, Kamran, regarding the share buyback. So
obviously it's a little bit too early for me to talk about potential share buybacks after we've
included this one. We certainly will be thanking about the feedback that we've received
from various stakeholders. We do that every year to make sure that our communications
are well understood. We believe there's a lot of value and consistency. I don't think we
should just be changing things left and right. After this year's program, at the end of the
day, we came to the conclusion that notwithstanding the losses that we incurred, we still
are in a position to launch the program. Things could have been different. Irma could have
hit a little bit differently. There could have been more damage coming off the back of
some of the other events. I think it's always important to realize what it is what we're
saying to the marketplaces. We want to hold the capital available to invest it quickly into
the business, into the market if opportunities arise.
Here, of course, we have very significant losses for the Swiss Re Group, $3.6 billion. So,
there's only one way to describe that, it's significant. I think our capital position remained
strong. So, I have to perhaps disappoint you just a little bit, perhaps not a surprise that I

would do that in terms of the possibility of future share buyback programs, you have to
wait to the beginning of next year. Thank you.

Great. Thanks very much.

Operator
The next question is from Daniel Bischof from Baader Helvea. Please go ahead.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everyone. Two questions, the first one on Corporate Solutions. I think
you made the point that you're deliberately allowing for a higher volatility at CorSo, given
the strong capitalization and flexibility you have. But then, I mean if you look at the years
2012 to 2016, I mean, you reported an average combined ratio of 95% if we exclude 3
points for the ramp-up costs of the business and adjust for PYD.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, I was wondering, we were (12:49) at CorSo should not report a little bit stronger
numbers in years with good luck in order to balance volatility that we're seeing right now?
And then, secondly, on Maria, what was surprising is that Swiss Re's is one of the few in
the industry which has actually quite a high number also from Maria. I mean at $1.25 billion
for CorSo and P&C Re. So, I was wondering whether you have a fundamental difference
on this loss event than your peers or is it simply that you have a higher market share,
specifically in this region?

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Okay, Daniel. I'll take the first question and ask Eddie to come back to the questions
about Maria. So, I guess, in a high level, I would say, yeah, I think your comment is correct.
So the fact of the matter is that we've actually shown some very good results in the
benign loss (13:40) years with Corporate Solutions notwithstanding the investments we're
making in growth. And to the extent that the business mix would remain unchanged, when
the consequence of this exposure to excess layer in the related higher volatility
suggested some years we have larger losses and other years we have higher profits.
Now, our ambition, as you know, is to extend the footprint and extend the risk profile, the
diversification of the risk book of Corporate Solutions. So over time, I would actually
expect relative to some of its peers that exceptional volatility would perhaps reduce
somewhat. But having said that, I think your comment is a fair comment. Let me turn over
to Eddie for Maria.

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

And the first one is fair to say that uncertainty about Maria is still there. We still have issues
on Puerto Rico. The power is still not fully restored. I don't think it will be getting as bad as
some modeling companies hinted earlier on with whatever market losses $40 billion, $50
billion, $60 billion, $70 billion or even $80 billion. The pharmaceutical companies actually
managed to restore power quite quickly, they were flowing in generators. So it's quite
operational already.

Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2017-11-02

Again, just to give you a bit of a context, our estimate actually for Maria, overall, is $1.25
billion and $125 million (15:03) of that comes from the Reinsurance side, and $325 million
(15:08) from the CorSo side. So, you see over there Corporate Solutions will have a
significant share as they are a major player in the commercial game with high excess
layers, and we have quite a few policies also with Caribbean exposure. But also on the
Reinsurance side, we of course on the right business in the Caribbean that explains this
loss level. But Maria is still clearly event with more uncertainty and we feel comfortable
with the estimate we put up there, as I said the $1.25 billion.

Thank you, Eddie.

The next question is from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you very much. So, the first question is on the P&C risk
appetite. So from your commentary, it's a little bit more encouraging than probably it was
in Monte Carlo (16:01), but is there any – should we expect that your appetite for nat cat,
however, you would like to measure it or state it, is likely to go up or how would you like
us to think of that if the market does follow what we expect or what you expect?
Second question is just on Corporate Solutions strategy-wise, I mean, is there any – I
mean you have reiterated the strategy and your confidence in the business. But are there
any discussions that you think that there should be some review of such a large loss? I
mean I know in the gross (16:43) cycle, it probably looks okay, but when you're putting in
$1 billion in now, are you trying to change something or just hope that the bad year never
happen again or just a comment (16:56)? Thank you.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Thank you for both questions. Eddie, if you'll pickup the first, I'll come back to the
Corporate Solutions strategy.

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

Yeah. So the first one is about our nat cat risk appetite basically and we have an approach
to manage our portfolios very actively. So, we did run, let's say, quite always nat cat
positions a number of years ago and the pricing environment was very favorably since a
couple of years, as you also well know, there has been quite some pressure and rates
softened quite a bit. So we also started to take away some of that capacity. And clearly, if
price environments change a lot, we will also deploy again more capacity.

Page 7 of 18



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2017-11-02

FINAL

But it's important that the first thing is really to restore the profitability to bring these price
levels up to sustainable levels. And again, that goes even beyond the nat cat space. I think
it's really for the whole P&C Re sector and the underlying commercial business that needs
to move again up to levels above the cost of capital. So, I would not narrow it down just to
nat cat. But if prices really move, we clearly have the capital and the appetite to deploy
also again a bit more.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Thank you, Eddie. To the Corporate Solutions strategy, more broadly to our willingness
and our desire to learn. After all losses, we really take the time to think about what has
happened, how does it compare with what we had expected or model of previous
experiences and whatnot, and that certainly will be the case here now as well, not only for
Corporate Solutions, but also far P&C Re businesses.
Now, we had a loss now reported in the first nine months for Corporate Solutions a little
bit larger than the market would have initially estimated based on the overall group loss,
reflecting the excess layer concentration of the business, but also the concentration in the
Americas, which America lowered about (18:59) 55%, if you include Latin America, you get
up to about 65%.

Bloomberg Transcript

We certainly will take a look at this and come to a conclusion whether the way in which
we've been handling the aggregation and the balance sheet where we're holding risk
continues to make sense. I have to say the initial – but it really is the initial review, doesn't
lead us to conclude that somehow either we miss something or there were something
that was overly surprising.
The facts are that we had, in this case, in addition to the two quakes (19:28), three rather
significant storms, each of them certainly a material loss, but none of them in the outer
ranges of the level of expectations about potential losses. So, we will look at this. We'll
think about our overall strategy in terms of the level of retention within Corporate
Solutions, but the initial review hasn't led us to conclude that somehow we had missed
something.

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

If I just maybe add, David, regarding this point, I think even if we had more reinsurance in
place, nothing would have changed in the way Corporate Solutions would have
underwritten that business. It was a conscious decision to run it with little reinsurance as
we managed the capital rather than (20:11) group level. It, in the end, would have been
more of a left pocket, right pocket situation that we would then have to (20:17) more
losses on the reinsurance side, what we see as a positive (20:21) actually to see the CorSo
business as it is without the impact of reinsurance.
And particularly, I think the property business in Corporate Solutions, that's a portfolio I
know very well. If you look at that over a longer period of time, we clearly have achieved
very attractive returns on equity on every whatever, four, five, six years, we will have a
year with significant nat cat losses where the end result is impacted. But as David said,

Page 8 of 18



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity

we'll definitely look at it again and maybe then we come up with a slightly different
answer.

The next question is from Gandhi Vikram from Societe Generale. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Firstly, can I just ask what's your
assessment about the losses from wind versus flood on the three hurricanes? Is there a
feeling that the flood losses are perhaps less appreciated today in the market than they
should be? And going forward, do you see stricter sub limits being applied till the industry
gets a better handle on it? Secondly, it appears that CorSo suffered from material
adverse prior (21:38) development during third quarter as well. Can you shed some light
around how we are seeing the underlying book developing? And as a sub question to
that, how should we think about the dividend up-streaming from CorSo over next one or
two years? Thank you.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Thank you. Eddie, maybe the first two questions, then I'll take the second part of question
two.

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

So, the first was about wind/floods split, and I think you really have to differentiate
between the three hurricanes. If you look at Harvey, that's clearly a flood-dominated
event. There was actually not that much wind damage, just where it made landfall, and the
bulk of the losses come from the Houston area, which there was really record rainfalls.
And again there, the bulk actually comes from the commercial business, which also
explains a bit higher share of the CorSo loss. A lot of the personal line, the residential
lines, they don't even have flood coverage. It's mainly with the National Flood Insurance
Program. So, clearly, in Harvey, flood is dominating part. In Irma, it's a bit more balanced.
And then in Maria, there's clearly a lot of wind losses as well. And you made a good point
about sub limits deductibles and kind of thing. And also let's say that part in the last
couple of soft market years, there has been a bit of deterioration of some of these
Page 9 of 18

FINAL

conditions. So it's also important now to not just think about price increases, but also to fix
some of the tightness of the wording (23:10), so that's an important part of the
improvement story as well.
In terms of your second question that was relating to some adverse developments on the
Corporate Solutions business, I think we commented on that at Q2 results. Actually, that is
coming mainly from some larger U.S. liability claims. And again, a bit of that happened in
the third quarter. I would say that with the nature of these liability claims, the way it plays
out with CorSo being in excess position, for some of the losses to really materialize and
become clear, it takes a bit of time and that has actually explained quite adverse
development in CorSo for the last few quarters. What I would say that the U.S. liability
segment has been in focus of the underwriting team in Corporate Solutions for quite a
while now and it has been underwritten. We have also taken away some capacity in that
segment to fix it. And now, a little bit more headwinds from the catastrophe losses, we'll
continue to improve the U.S. liability business, push for full (24:24) rates and also tighten
conditions. And if it doesn't improve enough, we will again take a bit of capacity away
from that business. So, that's I would describe this adverse development in Corporate
Solution.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Eddie. As to future dividends from Corporate Solutions, let me take just a
second to draw the context, which is that just as at a group level we want to be consistent
in our capital management philosophies. We think it's also important to have discipline in
the way we manage capital throughout the group and couple of things that I'll point out
that are I think relative to your question.
The first is that we – it is important of each of our underlying carriers to be properly
capitalized, to capitalize in a fashion that not only meets the regulatory requirements, but
also make them attractive to the clients and gives the units proper capacity to pursue
their growth strategies. And that, of course, will continue to be the same, not only for
Corporate Solutions, but for other carriers as well.
The second thing is we think it is a good discipline across the group to ask each of the
underlying units to basically move up to the group level in excess capital that they develop
during the course of their activities. We do that at least on an annual basis. Just this is little
bit too early for me to talk about dividends for the Swiss Re Group for the full year 2017,
it's a little bit too early for me to talk about future dividends for Corporate Solutions. It will
very much depend upon how they get along in the market in terms of their profit to
generation.
But let me just reiterate that they're well capitalized. They have the ability to write
attractive business. And as a matter of group philosophy and framework, we think it's
appropriate that there is a discipline throughout the group that people are also thinking
about the need to properly push capital back up to the group on a regular basis. And
that's something that we review every year and I anticipate that discussion or review to
take place around Corporate Solutions next year, just like it did earlier this year and last
year and over the last handful of years.

I think if you look at the track record of Corporate Solutions, you'll see they've been a very
attractive dividend payer to us, but notwithstanding they've been on a growth trajectory.
And I would expect – without making a specific comment about beginning of next year, I
would expect that trajectory to continue. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - James R. Oram

{BIO 19736003 <GO>}

Hi, guys. Afternoon. This is James Oram from Citigroup. I have two questions please. The
first question is on Life Capital. We had five quarters or so of gross cash generation of
around $200 million-plus in the unit and you've now reached $1.5 billion of generation
since the beginning of 2016. I just wondering if you think it might be time to raise that
guidance of $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion over 2016 to 2018 or whether that implies that the
recent positive trends might not be sustainable. Thanks very much. That's the first one.
And the second one is back to internal dividends and holding company cash. It's unlikely
you're going to see massive amounts upstream from P&C Re or CorSo next year, I would
imagine, particularly if you want to grow in those units. If you factor in the capital injection
back into CorSo as well, are you worried about what that might mean for your holding
company cash position, particularly when it comes to potential acquisitions or additional
capital returns? Thanks very much.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Thanks, James. Two great questions. So let me pick up both of them. First on the Life
Capital side, so yes, we've been very pleased with the gross cash generation of that
business unit over the last several years. I think the numbers you quoted are just about
right, it sounds very familiar to me. It's a little bit too early for us to be talking about what's
our ambition going forward, but we certainly are thinking about that type of thing.
In terms of the underlying nature of your question, we're now anticipating a significant
negative development in cash coming off (28:24) those businesses. Now, quite the
contrary, I think the underlying performance of the closed life business has been actually
very much in line with our expectations and very much to our satisfaction.
We are continuing to invest in our Life Capital business, including in the open life book
business, which of course is in the initial years, not a generator of cash, it actually is
consuming cash. But on an overall basis, I think we remain very, very pleased with the cash
generation prospects of the Life Capital business unit. And we certainly will come back to
the $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion, I believe, off the top of my head, gross cash generation for
2016 to 2018 at the beginning of the year.

FINAL

As to your second question, exactly this type of thing, of course, the overall financial
position of the group and the flexibility of the group that we are thinking about in terms of
how we wish to position the underlying operating units, but also how much capital and the
nature of the capital available to us, we would like to hold at a group level.
So, it's absolutely true that in situations where losses occur, we may wish to put the capital
back into the business units and we've demonstrated that, I think, very clearly with our
action on the Corporate Solutions side. I think we've discussed in the past that we hold a
buffer at the group level, which recognizes the inherent volatility of our business. So, we
want to be able to maintain the dividend even in a year where we may have losses across
the group, and therefore we hold reserve for that purpose.
We also hold capital that we don't clearly have a clear view on exactly where we may be
able to invest it over the intermediate future recognizing that sometimes opportunities
arise in unexpected times, in unexpected ways. And certainly, these types of market
events would remind us that we need to be very, very alert and looking at the market
opportunities that may come out the back of this.

Bloomberg Transcript

The short answer to your question is, we feel comfortable with the financial condition of
the group, also at the holding company level. We've, I think, for many years, followed the
practice of maximizing the fungibility of our financial resources, maximizing the flexibility of
the group in terms of access to financial resources. And I think when we reviewed the
situation at the end of Q3 of this year, we concluded that we still are very comfortable
with our overall financial strength and our ability to pursue the capital management
philosophies that we've earlier articulated. Thank you.

The next question is from Thomas Seidl from Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. The first question is on pricing, if I may, so BadenBaden was last week, where usually reinsurers give first vote (31:25) and you get a better
sense of where pricing is going. Secondly, I would say (31:29) that a half year still had a
102% (31:31) price adequacy; and third, you might record this year 20%, 22% nat cat losses
in P&C Re, but when you sum it up over the last five, six years, you are still below the
average annual budget of nat cat losses. As I wonder, why you're confident that this calls
for a market-wide price increase rather than you just lost prone accounts. That's first
question.
And the second question regarding capital, again, sorry to come back to this topic, as you
say, you want to have this buffer, $3 billion to $5 billion. Now, you're going to pay $2.7
billion on the buyback dividend, you're allocating $1 billion to CorSo. What is remaining is

maybe $1 billion to $2 billion. Is that basically sufficient to capture the growth opportunities
you expect from those losses?

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

Thank you, Thomas. I'll ask Eddie to pick up first question. I'll come back to the second.

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

Yeah. Historically, we had always the meetings (32:36) in Baden-Baden, and obviously,
there will always be a bit of pushback about the need to increase prices. But I would first
go back to a comment I made earlier. It's really very clear that the P&C Reinsurance
industry has been clearly running below cost of capital and that's not just the nat cat story.
Of course, you need to normalize for that. But also significant impact was actually from
favorable reserve development from much earlier they're using, but (33:02) really
normalize it, it's clear that the P&C Reinsurance business is not meeting the cost of capital
and just a momentum. And from the retro side, and as I mentioned from the commercial
side where clearly also prices have fallen to inadequate levels, I clearly expect this to have
an impact. There's always a bit to debate to what extent then losses, in whatever region,
like the U.S., will impact the pricing in Europe. But it's fair to say that everybody has
benefited over a number of years from a global, very benign loss environment and from
fairly benign inflation levels.
So, everybody was quite okay to benefit in their markets to get some price softening.
(33:44) these events just make it very clear. And at the industry, both on the reinsurance
side, but also on the commercial regional side, is not at sustainable price level. So, there
will be a lot of negotiation and it's not always an easy talk, but clearly I think the industry
has to take some action and we expect this to have very positive momentum.
We will have a bit of time lag as well. I mean as the European renewals, original (34:12)
policies, but also reinsurance renews at different points in time, and then we see this
momentum building up over time.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

And Thomas, as to your second question, well, a couple of the figures you cited, I don't
recognize. So, I won't respond specifically to the numbers. The concept, I'm very happy to
confirm that, yes, we retained sufficient capacity to be able to deploy it into the
marketplace and that's exactly what our colleagues are doing right now. So, you can
imagine that across the globe, both of our P&C segments, but also in our other
segments, our colleagues are out working with clients, thinking about their needs, looking
at the claims they may have incurred, but also the protection needs they see going
forward. So, we remain very comfortable with our ability to fulfill our capital management
philosophy, starting with the superior financial position, but certainly being able to respond
to market opportunities that may arise.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

But you still want to maintain those $3 billion to $5 billion buffer you mentioned in the past,
or is this number not valid anymore?

The next question is from Michael Haid from Commerzbank. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Two questions. First, I tried to – first on P&C
Reinsurance. I tried to reconcile your nine months figures with my estimates and I want to
understand the combined ratio in P&C a little bit better. So, quite frankly, how much prioryear reserve development did you book in the third quarter? And did you use any of your
retro protection? The second question on Life & Health Reinsurance you showed a quite
strong result, in my view. And can you speak a little bit about the drivers of this result? And
in particular, are there any special one-off effects or favorable development in this Life &
Health Reinsurance results?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Thank you, Michael. Eddie, will you pick up the first, and I'll come back to the second.

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

Yeah. On the first one, P&C Re, so for the first nine months there was, indeed, some
positive prior-year developments, as we had in earlier quarters. We do not disclose the
details, but will only happen again in the full year. You also hinted to retrocession, so we
have some protections in place. We have some side covers for our cat portfolio. We'll
have some recovery, but we also don't provide the detailed break downs in terms of the
gross and net losses. So there's some, but we're not relying hugely on retrocession, as
you know.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

And can you say, to what extent, ILS affected your P&L in the third quarter?

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

Nothing significant. It's a drop.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Okay.

Q - Michael Haid

FINAL

Okay. Perfect.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

And to your second question, Life & Health Re had a very strong performance through the
first nine month, and also, as you have seen, if you do the math, in the last three quarters.
I think the most important thing to cite is just the well-performing underlying, welldiversified portfolio and the good (37:54) business that we've been writing. We
experienced, I think, some positive mortality experience over the course of the last
period. We have had some financial gains on the – realized gains mostly coming from
realizations on the equity side.

Bloomberg Transcript

But I think, if you ask me, what's driving the performance, the underlying driver is the highquality well-diversified portfolio, which we manage quite actively. And I think it gives us
also the comfort for that through the cycle target, which is to have an ROE in excess of
10% to 12%. Now, we actually are showing higher numbers of that right now and we're
very, very pleased with that. There's not an exceptional item that I would like to cite,
impacting us for the first nine months. I think the real underlying drivers just a good quality
well-diversified portfolio. Thank you.

The next question is from William Hawkins from KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hello. Thank you very much. I'm following up slightly, but Eddie, you referred a couple of
times to rate increases being needed, because your returns are below cost of capital.
And I guess (39:13), one of the question implied your risk-adjusted price adequacy in P&C
Re is 102%.
So just to clarify those things are not consistent, were you – is your cost of capital
statement about the industry, because when you were saying it initially, it sounded like you
were talking about Swiss Re. I can't reconcile those two statements.
(39:30).

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

Indeed, I was referring to the industry overall, P&C Reinsurance globally, where you can do
this calculation and it clearly tells the story. We have managed our portfolio quite actively,
as I mentioned earlier. So, we also started to take some capacity away. We reduced the
business in some parts of the business, actually, to maintain the price quality as close as

Page 15 of 18

possible to our profitability target. So, the picture I was painting was an industry picture.
Yes, so that's important to clarify. Thanks.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

FINAL

William, I have a suspicion you had a second question.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

No, that's very kind of you. Thank you. With regards to internal dividends, is it a foregone
conclusion that P&C Re pays basically no dividends, because you've made no earnings?
Or given that you still got lots of capital flexibility within the Reinsurance group overall, is
there still the potential to be up-streaming some noticeable amounts of capital at the end
of this year?

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks. I won't talk specifically about upcoming dividends from the different units,
as I mentioned. But I think your comment about, is it a foregone conclusion is incorrect.

Operator
The next question is from Frank Kopfinger from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everybody. I have two questions. My first question, I would like to come
back to Corporate Solutions. So, obviously, for Corporate Solutions, it was not an earnings
event only, it was a capital event. And with this, my question is whether you and also we,
our markets, underestimated the risk profile of this business? it's a – at the end, it was $1
billion loss from these nat cat events, this is 12 (41:23) times your budget. And so, the
question is, did you and we underestimate the risk profile? And going forward, should we
expect that the nat cat budget is going to rise there?
And then secondly, on your Life Capital business, obviously, in Germany, there are some
major life portfolios – run-off portfolios for sale now, potentially, is this something so far
you are not involved in the German run-off market, but is this something you're looking at,
would this fit into your strategy?

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Thank you, Frank. Eddie, you want to talk about Corporate Solutions. I'll come back to the...

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

Yeah. Corporate Solution, and let's say, the nat cat exposure in that business. I mean,
from all we can see so far from these three hurricanes as well as the earthquakes that
there is no, let's say, big surprise factor. So, it all sees (42:21) within the way we assess
these risks going forward. As you know, we have a lot of experience in modeling,
assessing these nat cat risks. So, every policy in Corporate Solutions is runs through the
Page 16 of 18

Date: 2017-11-02

FINAL

group cat assessments tools to price the business, but also then to monitor the
accumulation up to the group level. And we allocate limits at the group level and then to
the business units and then to the various profit centers.
And all these losses, from what we can see now, are well within this framework. Obviously,
we will review once the losses are more mature, whether some of these modeling
assumptions need to be calibrated, particularly on the flood side, which is still a bit a more
tricky peril to (43:08) model. There's factors like how much demand surge will we see
post these large losses, three hurricanes in a short period of time, there's a bit of lack of
loss adjustment resources and labor, materials. So, we'll definitely assess that. But at this
point, from what I see, this is all well within expectation. So, no big surprise elements as
they have been from some cat losses in the past, like the Thai floods or the Katrina.
So I'm still very comfortable that we really know what we do in the Corporate Solutions
business. It's just fair to say that it was in still, let's say, a limited premium portfolio, these
exposure of course creates a lot of local volatility. So, it really only makes sense to then
see it in the bigger context of the group balance sheet, wherein together with
reinsurance it's in proportion to how we run nat cat business as part of our total risk book
(44:08).

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Excellent. Thank you, Eddie. And Frank, to the second question about the rumors, of
course, we get confronted with rumors from time to time, it's our policy not to respond to
specific rumors for all sorts of, I think, very understandable reasons. But what I'm happy to
do is just confirm some of our earlier communication, which is that we are very much
focused on the UK, and I expect we'll continue to be focused on the UK. And there's two
very important reasons for that, the first being (44:36) is that we have an exceptionally
strong and competitive platform in the UK. And the second is that we continue to see a
very attractive pipeline of potential transactions. So, just leave it at that.

The next question is from Thomas Fossard from HSBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, guys. Good afternoon, sorry. One quick question for you is, could you
talk about and comment about the underlying profitability of the PC Re segment and
CorSo stripping out the, I would say, some of (45718) the noise created by the cat in Q3,
though, if you could benchmark or compare the current underlying performance versus
the 100% combined ratio for PC, or 103% (45:33) for CorSo just to have the underlying
picture? Thank you.

Thomas, maybe I give a quick reaction and, Eddie, you can add on to that. We're not
going to go into the detail of the underlying performance. But what I can tell you at this
point in time, Thomas, is based on our results year-to-date, there's no reason for us to
change the estimates that we've provided at the beginning of the year regarding the
underlying performance of P&C Re, but also Corporate Solutions. I think, based on our
view of the business year-to-date, the estimates we provided at the beginning of the
year are not something that we believe we would like to change at this point.

A - Philippe Brahin
