FINAL

Thank you, Mitra. Good morning and welcome, everyone. This has indeed been an
extraordinary year for Gjensidige. The occurrence of extreme weather events continued
into the third quarter, this time with a heat wave we have not seen in Norway in a long
time, and the dry summer since 1947. This took us all by surprise and naturally impacted
our results signiﬁcantly, compared with the extraordinary strong results in Q3 last year.
Our results are summarized on page 2. Proﬁt before tax amounted to NOK 964 million in
the quarter. This result does not include the pre-tax proﬁt of NOK 93 million from
Gjensidige Bank, which is recorded as a discontinued operation from this quarter. We had
a premium growth of 1%, 0.8% in local currency. The underwriting result amounted to
NOK 573 million and the combined ratio was 90.6%.
For the third quarter in a row, extraordinary weather conditions drove frequency claims
high above last year, putting pressure on our underwriting result in Norway. Large losses
were also considerably higher partly due to weather adding to the deterioration of results.

Bloomberg Transcript

Intense heat waves and the drought led to signiﬁcant crop failure in Norway. Having a
signiﬁcant position in the agriculture sector and customers with crop insurance, we do
expect cycle claims currently estimated to NOK 80 million.
Our property insurance line in Norway was hit by ﬁres as well as damages from heavy
rainfalls and storms during the quarter. And in general, nice and warm weather leads to
higher leisure activity and more accidents. We estimate the weather-related deviation in
frequency claims in the third quarter related to property and crops compared with
historical third quarter average to be in the range of NOK 130 million to NOK 160 million.
This means we have had a total of NOK 530 million to NOK 660 million in claims so far
this year related to the extraordinary weather in Norway.
Preparing for unexpected events is part of our business. This is the nature of insurance.
But, of course, when several events occur within a short span of time and with such force,
it temporarily challenges our results. And listening to the experts in this ﬁeld, it is prudent
to expect more volatile weather conditions and a higher frequency of extreme events
going forward. We acknowledge this and will need to reﬂect it in our pricing as well. This
still applies particularly for the property insurance lines which are most exposed to
weather eﬀects, meaning price increases will have to exceed the building index to reﬂect
more frequency going forward.
Large losses, they're signiﬁcantly higher compared with the third quarter last year,
reﬂecting property damages from ﬁres, heavy rains, and storms. Proﬁtability in motor
insurance continued to deteriorate, as expected, driven by the lag eﬀects from pricing
measures relatively to claims inﬂation.
I will comment on status for our ongoing mitigation actions on the next slide. Outside
Norway, we continue to deliver signiﬁcantly improved results. Our results were also

Page 2 of 25



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA

impacted by provisions of NOK 80 million related to restructuring measures. I will come
back also to this on the next slide.

FINAL

Financial results came in at NOK 426 million, corresponding to a 0.8% return. And last,
return on equity, year-to-date was 15%. And Jostein will work with more detailed
comments on the results.
Then, turning to page 3, some comments on the operational highlights year-to-date.
Starting with the recent changes in the group management team, I'm convinced that
given the rapidly changing business environment, we are operating within, internal
rotation improved dynamics in the group, increases engagements, adds new
perspectives, develops management talent, and ultimately leads to a stronger force of
innovation and process eﬃciency.
I'm very pleased with the new team, which is fully dedicated to getting Gjensidige to get
back on track in Norway and continuing of a strong progress outside Norway.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are convinced of the strong rational in selling Gjensidige Bank, allowing us to focus
on our core insurance operations, while growing our reach to banking distribution with
Nordea. Closing is still expected during the ﬁrst quarter of 2019.
In Norway, we had continued to raise our prices for motor insurance and we are very
pleased to see that our eﬀorts are proving eﬀective. We will continue to increase prices
beyond the 6% expected claims inﬂation in order to close the gap. We are fully
committed to stabilize and ultimately also improve proﬁtability for motor insurance in
Norway, meaning that we are willing to sacriﬁce on volume to achieve this, if necessary.
So far, we have been able to put the price increases through without any negative impact
on churn, as proof of our strong brands and position in this important market. We still
expect the motor proﬁtability in Norway to marginally decrease further to 2018 before
seeing a turning point during the ﬁrst half of 2019.
We are very pleased to see that customer retention in Norway continues to be high,
meaning low distribution costs. In the Private segment, we have the retention rate above
92% among our aﬃnity and loyalty customer, which represents around 85% of the
premium volume.
Our position in this segment was further proven by renewal of our partnership agreement
with Tekna recently. We are also very happy with our strong retention rates for the
Commercial segment currently at around 90%.
Our operations outside Norway have gone through nothing less than a transformation,
and there is more to come. Our achievements so far are evident in the numbers we have
presented today. We have put strong eﬀorts in improving our risk selection and risk
pricing, pruning and repricing our portfolios. This has somewhat reduced volumes.

FINAL

However, we have managed to improve our portfolio quality signiﬁcantly. Although our
focus is proﬁtability before growth, we are starting to reach the proﬁtability level where
we, to a larger extent, can participate in the market's overall growth going forward. We
will continue to implement cost eﬃciency measures, gradually bringing proﬁtability closer
to the overall group target.
We have a strong focus on eﬃciency across the whole value chain and continuously seek
value enhancing measures. In the third quarter, we have decided to close further eight
branches in Norway; and in Denmark, we have discontinued the use of external sales
representatives.
Gradually moving distribution from physical to call centers and online is still on our
agenda. Some restructuring is also made in the Swedish distribution, and all in all, we
have made a provision of NOK 80 million related to the restructurings and reduction of
58 FTEs.

Bloomberg Transcript

By constantly bringing down the underlying cost base, we create room for investments in
technology, brand, and skills within our cost ratio target. As communicated earlier, we are
planning to upgrade our core IT system to be head of development, securing improved
internal eﬃciency, and long-term competitiveness.
A new system will provide us with greater agility and enable us to quickly adapt to new
technology and changes in products, markets, and completely new ecosystems. We are
introducing a blueprint version of the new core system as we speak and planning to
launch in Denmark ﬁrst before moving on to Sweden. Investments will be made within the
limits of our cost target.
Then, turning to page 4, I'm very proud to present the results of this year Ipsos Reputation
Survey related to last release last week. Once again, we ranked number 1 in terms of
reputation in the Norwegian ﬁnancial industry, and we also achieved the best scores in
our sector in the category social responsibility and moral.
We have had a steady increase and the highest ranking in our industry since 2009.
Independent of sectors, Gjensidige ranks number eight and among the top 10 companies
in Norway for the third year in a row. And we are very pleased to know that 7 out of 10
Norwegians have a good overall impression of Gjensidige.
And with that, I will leave the word to Jostein to present the Q3 results in more detail, as
well as talk about the update on our capital strategy and ﬁnancial targets.

Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Thank you, Helge, and good morning, everybody. I will start on page 6. We report a proﬁt
before tax of NOK 964 million in the third quarter. Starting from this quarter, Gjensidige
Bank is recognized as a discontinued operation and thus moved to a separate line in the
P&L, after tax. The results are, therefore, not included in this table.

Including Gjensidige Bank, the pre-tax result would have closer to NOK 1.1 billion. The
decline in the pre-tax proﬁt for continuing operations compared with last year was
primarily driven by the underwriting result. The underwriting result was signiﬁcantly
impacted by the extraordinary weather conditions, driving claims in both the Private and
Commercial segments in Norway. The result also includes a provision of NOK 80 million
related to the restructuring measures Helge mentioned. We estimate the weather-related
deviations in frequency claims in the third quarter compared to the historical third quarter
average to be in the range of around NOK 130 million to NOK 160 million.
The results in Norway were also impacted by the continued situation in motor proﬁtability,
as has been the case over the past quarters. Results also in Norway continue to improve.
The increase in Denmark was a result of lower large losses, higher run-oﬀ gains and lower
operating expenses, partly contracted by a weaker underlying frequency claims
development.
Our Swedish operations generated signiﬁcantly improved results for the quarter,
reﬂecting lower underlying frequency claims and a favorable cost development, partly
contracted by higher large losses and lower run-oﬀ gain.

Bloomberg Transcript

The Baltics reported considerably higher underwriting results, driven by an improvement
in underlying claims and cost development, as well as higher run-oﬀ gain. The Pension
business reported record quarterly earnings again. The ﬁnancial results from our
investment portfolio declined, reﬂecting our asset allocation and market development.
Turning to page 7, premiums are also 1% compared to the third quarter of 2017 and 0.8%
adjusted to currency eﬀects. All the main product lines in Norway recorded higher
premiums during the quarter, mainly driven by premium increases. We continue to
increase prices for motor insurance in Norway, in line with what we have communicated,
and this is reﬂected in our numbers for the quarter.
Our common theme outside of Norway is that when measured in local currency, we see
negative top-line growth. This is an eﬀect of various pricing and portfolio pruning
measures, aimed at creating long-term proﬁtability in all segments. In Denmark, the
measures have been most pronounced in the Commercial lines. In Sweden, the eﬀect in
Q3 was most evident in Private lines, whereas in the Baltics, it concerns both Private and
Commercial lines.
Turning over to page 8, we can see that the loss ratio rose from 66.3% to 75.1% year-onyear. To start with, it is important to remind you that Q3 was a very strong quarter, making
comparison challenging. Large losses were signiﬁcantly up, but still not far from the
normal level we normally expect, resulting in a 4 percentage point increase in the loss
ratio.
Run-oﬀ gains normally higher than expected and a positive impact of 1.5 percentage
points in the loss ratio compared with Q3 last year.

FINAL

A more adverse underlying frequency claims development was the main driver for the
increase in the loss ratio, and this was mainly related to Norway. As for our operations in
Sweden and the Baltics reported improved underlying frequency claims development.
Our Danish operations reported a small increase in frequency claims impact compared to
last year.
Higher frequency claims impacted Norway related to the extraordinary weather
conditions and diﬃcult comparables due to particularly favorable underlying frequency
claims situation in Q3 last year. The weather impact was related to our property and
agriculture insurance lines, estimated at NOK 130 million to NOK 160 million, above an
average Q3, corresponding to 2.1 percentage points to 2.6 percentage points on the total
group Gjensidige. Still adjusted for this, the underlying claims ratio deteriorated by
around 4 percentage points. This can partly be explained by the strong results in Q3 2017
and partly by the underlying situation in motor insurance in Norway.
The pressure on our motor insurance line continued as expected in the quarter. As
mentioned earlier, the high claims inﬂation for this product is related to the structural
change in Norwegian vehicle ﬂeet and related dynamics. We have put a number of
measures in place and continue to do so to secure correct risk selection and risk pricing.
And we're happy to see that our pricing power continues to be strong, as Helge touched
upon.

Bloomberg Transcript

In addition to the mentioned price increase in the Private segment, we also operate with
signiﬁcant price increases in the Corporate segment, especially for larger accounts, and
for motor and property.
Let's turn to page 9 for an overview of large losses. Total large losses amounted to NOK
319 million, somewhat above our expected long-term average of NOK 295 million. The
losses translate into 5.2 percentage points on the combined ratio. The large losses are
primarily related to Commercial and Private property in Norway, and that's signiﬁcantly
inﬂuenced by the storms and heavy rainfalls in Norway during the quarter.
Moving on to page 10 to comment the run-oﬀ gains. Run-oﬀ gains for the quarter came to
NOK 341 million, which is higher than our planned reserve leases of NOK 250 million. The
deviation is due to random variation. The run-oﬀ had a positive impact of 5.6 percentage
points on the combined ratio. We maintain our estimates of approximately NOK 250
million in run-oﬀ gains per quarter through 2022.
Let's turn to page 11. The cost ratio for the quarter was 15.6%, an increase over last year
primarily related to the one-oﬀ provision of NOK 80 million in the corporate center
related the restructuring measures already mentioned by Helge.
Cost development, excluding this provision, was favorable, with a cost ratio of 14.3%. This
proves cost discipline, and we're particularly pleased to see continued positive eﬀect from
our restructuring eﬀorts in Sweden and the Baltics. The cost ratio, excluding the one-oﬀs
and the Baltic segment, was 13.5%. Contingent digitalization, automation, and our timed

FINAL

eﬀects of a new core system will enable us to remain cost eﬃcient as (00:19:22) further in
terms of our cost ratio. We'll refer to this shortly.
Page 12 illustrates highlights from the Pension and bank operation. The Pension company
recorded a proﬁt before tax expense of NOK 40 million. Assets under management in the
Pension operations amounted to NOK 32 billion and 68% of the customers in our Pension
business are general insurance customers as well. Annualized return on equity amounted
to 14.3%.
Gross lending in the bank at the end of the quarter was NOK 49 billion. The bank
reported a pre-tax proﬁt of NOK 93 million in the third quarter, the decrease being due to
higher operating expenses following growth, increased acquisition costs, and lower gains
on ﬁnancial instruments, as well as some one-oﬀ charge of NOK 11 million related to the
termination of the agreement for distribution to the ﬁnancial oﬃces in Gjensidige's Private
segment. Annualized return on equity for the bank was 11.4%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving on to the investment portfolio on page 13, the investment portfolio of NOK 52.7
billion yielded a return of 0.8% in the quarter. The match portfolio yielded a return of
0.6% on a portfolio of NOK 34 billion. A large part of the match portfolio consists of
bonds at amortized cost which yielded a return of 1.0%. The running yield in this portfolio
was 3.8% at the end of the quarter and the average reinvestment rate year-to-date was
close to 3.3%.
The unrealized excess value amounted to approximately NOK 0.8 billion. The free
portfolio, which amounted to NOK 18 billion, yielded a return of 1.2% in the quarter. The
positive return was primarily driven by returns on the investments in equities and
property.
Looking at our capital position on page 14, our capital position is still strong. The legal
perspective gives a solvency margin of 181%, while our own calibration of internal model
gives a solvency margin of 197%. Note that from this quarter, our (00:21:35) are treated as
eligible capital when calculated to solvency margin. This gives a better picture of the
solvency margin. The principal change is made after recommendations from the
Norwegian FSA. Solvency margin is somewhat lower compared to last quarter. Available
capital showed a stable development and a positive contribution from retained earnings
oﬀset by among others lower market valuables, due to increased interest rates and credit
spreads.
Capital requirement increased somewhat this quarter, mainly due to underlying growth
within the business. Given the sale of Gjensidige Bank, the performance solvency margin
as of September 30 was 262%. We'll continue to balance our capital structure in a
disciplined way in order to support the targets return on equity, while at the same time
allowing us some leeway for further bolt-on acquisitions and stabilization of dividend.
Turning to page 15, I will comment on our ﬁnancial target. Our ﬁnancial and solvency
targets, as well as the dividend policy, have been subject to a review this quarter. Except
for changing the cost ratio target from around 15% to below 15%, the targets and dividend
Page 7 of 25



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2018-10-25

policy are only adjusted to reﬂect, but Gjensidige Bank will be excluded from the group
from early 2019.

FINAL

The group's annual ﬁnancial and solvency target for the period 2019 to 2022, given
disposal of the bank, are combined ratio between 86% and 89%, if assuming average
annual run-oﬀ gains of around NOK 1 billion through 2022. This corresponds to 90% to
93% given zero run-oﬀ gains.
Our cost ratio below 15%; our solvency margin, based on the partial internal model,
between 135% and 200%; return on equity after-tax, above 20%. This corresponds to
about 16% given zero run-oﬀ gains, which is comparable to the previous 15% target,
including the bank. Bear in mind that these are targets and should not be regarded as
guidance for any speciﬁc quarter or year.
Dividend policy stays the same, but technical adjustments reﬂect the bank sale. It means
the minimum payout ratio moves from 70% to 80%. Our ﬁnancial targets are ambitious,
but achievable. We work to strike a balance between good proﬁtability and increased
investments in order to ensure strong competitiveness going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

Organic growth is expected to be in line in normal GDP growth in the Gjensidige's market
areas in the Nordic countries and the Baltic states over time. In addition, proﬁtable growth
will be achieved by pursuing a disciplined acquisition strategy, as has been done
successfully in the past. The sale of Gjensidige Bank will upon closing have a temporary
negative impact on the group's return on equity and the proceeds have been reinvested
in value-enhancing opportunities or returned to shareholders.
I will then hand the word back to Helge for some concluding remarks.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Jostein. To sum up, on page 16, our Q3 results were signiﬁcantly impacted by
extraordinary weather conditions. We continue to generate improved results outside
Norway, proving successful restructuring measures. Our results so far this year have been
hit by the weather conditions and the pressure on the motor insurance line, challenging
our ability to deliver on all our ﬁnancial targets this year.
However, we have a strong focus on getting our business back on track in Norway, with
price increases across several product lines. We will also continue to have a keen eye on
cost control and implement eﬃciency measures.
We will continue our strong eﬀorts to mitigate the claims inﬂation in Motor Norway and
expect the turning point for proﬁtability in this insurance line during the ﬁrst quarter next
year. Our capital position is strong and supports our vision to seek value-accretive M&A
opportunities. And if such opportunities do not materialize, we will distribute the excess
capital over time, in line with our dividend policy.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. And so, ﬁrstly, just on claims inﬂation,
so in Norway, I guess, motor claims inﬂation is still tracking around 6%. Are you seeing
any upward pressure on this at all? And just to clarify, you're expecting group loss ratio
stabilization in 1Q next year, what's the conﬁdence level in this, please?
And then, secondly, how do you think of the ordinary dividends ex the bank sales, the pro
forma for the bank earnings being removed? Would you be happy running a higher
payout ratio on the ordinary for a temporary period until you can potentially replace the
earnings? Thank you.

Operator
We can, indeed.

A - Mitra Hagen Negård
Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Thanks. This is Jonny Urwin here, UBS. So, I just had two questions. So, ﬁrstly, is the claims
inﬂation environment in Norwegian motors still tracking around 6%? Are you seeing any
upward pressure on this? And just to clarify that you are expecting the loss ratio to
stabilize in the ﬁrst quarter 2019, what's the conﬁdence level in this, please?
And then, secondly, how do you think about the ordinary dividend ex-bank sales, the
performance of the bank earnings? Would you be happy to run a higher payout ratio from
the ordinary dividend for exemplary period until you can potentially return the earnings?
Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yes. It's yes on the ﬁrst question. The motor inﬂation level is expected to be around 6%,
the combination of 5% underlying claims cost inﬂation and a 1% eﬀect from increased
frequency due to the changes in the bonus system. We still think that we'll reach the
turning point in the ﬁrst half of 2019, as we have previously communicated. So, that means
that's unchanged.
The last question on the dividend, we are comfortable running with a high payout ratio in
2018. The dividend policy stays the same. It's high and stable nominal dividends, meaning
that the starting point for looking at the dividend for 2018 is last year's dividend of NOK
0.70 (00:32:12) per share.

If we go above 100% of this year's result, we will need to apply to the Financial Services
Authority if we get approved. But we have a very high solvency margin even before the
sale of the bank. We do expect that to be okay.

We can now take our next question from Sami Taipalus from Goldman Sachs. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Look, my ﬁrst question is just on
the repricing in Norway. You've got the slide there on the high customer retention. I
guess, usually when companies do these sorts of eﬀorts, retention goes down a bit. So,
I'm wondering if there's room for you to push a little bit harder on the rights here
(00:33:18) to make sure that you deﬁnitely get on top of claims inﬂation. So, that's
question number one.
And question number two is, you've got – you've disclosed a pro forma solvency ratio of
the bank or a solvency ratio pro forma of the bank sale. Am I right in thinking that that's
on the legal basis? Could you just tell us what that ratio is also on the (00:33:43) basis,
which is what I think your forward-looking solvency ratio target is based on? Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Eﬀects on the retention, yes, it has been – yes, actually seen Norway increasing in churn
based on the pricing measures we have put through so far. We are, of course, proﬁt
maximizing. We'll try to do what we think is the best at all times in terms of hitting the gas
pedal there, accelerating the pedal.
So, if we take up what we think is doable here and look at the situation weekly really to
what we can take out, still, remember it is dynamic and very diﬀerentiated approach
where the good customers get best increase and the bad or more riskier customers get a
higher increase in the rates. And we'll monitor it. If it's possible to take up more, we will
take up more.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I think it's important also to mention that the frequent development is a Norwegian overall
problem. So, it's not only Gjensidige meeting this. And you have seen communication
and also reports from other competitors. So, the climate is absolutely much better this

Page 11 of 25

year compared to previous years when it comes to price increases. That's actually both for
Private lines and Commercial lines.

FINAL

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Sorry. Can I just interject there? So, if you look at where you are now versus where you
were maybe six months ago, do you feel that there's room for more price increases than
what you've may perhaps initially anticipated?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I think I can start, maybe. And compared to six months ago, we have a more holistic view
looking at products, terms, and, of course, maybe a more oﬀensive view when it comes to
price increases overall. And you also heard what I said regarding freeze (00:35:59)
expected frequency development going forward for property lines due to more volatile
weather. So, instead of meeting the building index which we have done for a period, we
have to increase prices of both the building index to meet more volatile weather also for
the property lines in Norway. So, the climate is better, and we are slightly more oﬀensive
today compared to six months ago, I would say.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

In terms of the solvency margin, our target solvency margins are based on the legally
approved partial internal model to stock debt. These are not that diﬀerent necessarily,
and the change in the eﬀects from the sale of the bank will have a, incentive wise, more or
less the same eﬀect on the legal approved partial internal as our own partial internal
model, yeah.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

That's your question, I guess.

Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I've got three questions. One of them is actually just
a clariﬁcation. Helge, you mentioned in your opening remarks a total of NOK 530 million
to NOK 560 million of additional claims year-to-date. I'm just checking, is that purely
frequency-related or have you also included the deviations in large claims within that as
well? That's just a clariﬁcation.
My second question just relates to the last question that you answered. Could you give us
an indication as to what the excess capital above 200% – above your 200% threshold,
what level of excess capital does that imply that you have at this time?
And my third question is really just on M&A and the potential deployment of that excess
capital. You've sold the banking business which has led to a reduction in proﬁts. And I'm
just interested in what type of M&A you would be considering, what sort of timeframe
we'd be talking about in terms of either potentially replacing those lost earnings with an
acquisition or the decision to give that money back? Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Blair. The spend was NOK 530 million to NOK 660 million actually.

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

And it's purely frequency. So, that's your ﬁrst question. Your last one – and Jostein can
prepare the question regarding the excess capital and solvency ratios. M&A, as we have
commented before, we want to grow outside Norway, preferably Sweden, because we
have the weakest position in Sweden, and it's a more fragmented market in Denmark. It's
dynamic in Denmark also. So, both Sweden and Denmark, if it arise opportunities, we will
look into that.
I think I also commented last quarter that it should be somewhat sizable because it's hard
work every time we take onboard new companies. And then, you're asking me when – if it
doesn't arise, M&A opportunities, when do we want to pay back to shareholders. I can't
be exactly regarding that timing. I guess, we will use next year at least. And then, if
nothing arise, I guess, we have a discussion again when it come into early 2020.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

And on the second question, the excess capital, I mean, I think you referred to 135% to
200% new solvency margin range and then...

more than nominal amount of how much...

Q - Blair Stewart

Yes, please.

A - Jostein Amdal

If possible, just an indication of what it would be above 200%.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yeah. Excluding the bank and very round numbers, NOK 10 billion capital requirements.
It's about NOK 13.8 billion legal capital requirements as of now according to the partial
internal model. And then, the bank consumes approximately NOK 4 billion. Is that okay?

Thank you. We can now take our next question from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca.
Please go ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Thank you very much for the opportunity. So, my question was
around the – this property and frequency claims or the frequency claims in property, have
you conducted some internal studies which would make you change some underwriting
criterion or would you attribute this to purely bad luck? And do you also have plans to put
in place some frequency covers for reinsurance or some such measures do you think are
necessary for this problem? Thank you very much.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

In terms of underwriting criteria or terms and conditions for our products, it's obvious that
after this quarter, we'll look into the terms and conditions of the agricultural product to
see if we have the right price for this type of damages in crops or whether we should do
something about the terms of it.

FINAL

But remember, it's just been really very few claims on this – of this type. And if I'm really, I
mean, it's the ﬁrst time about this type of damage, so it is natural. Sooner or later, we'll
actually get claim on such a cover.
Other criteria, please bear in mind that if you have a natural perils type, a storm or a ﬂood
or something, that is actually covered via the Norwegian Natural Perils Pool, which has its
kind of own criteria and we can't really change those criteria. It's a common criteria for the
whole Norwegian market.
Otherwise, in terms of reinsurance, it is always constantly evaluated, whether it's actually
would pay oﬀ to buy kind of lower level reinsurance to protect this, I guess, this type of
short-term volatility. Usually, it doesn't pay oﬀ and we have a really solid capital position
which makes us conﬁdent (00:43:07) short-term volatility.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

Just to add to the overall comment on the property situation, just to remind you of past,
present, and the future perspective on that. If you look back, we have had very benign
winters and actually very benign situation for many, many years. We could say that the
situation in 2018 is bad luck, but we do not want to take that bet going forward. So, the
weather-related climate changes is a long, long-term trends, but we have to take into
consideration that we may see maybe more volatile weather also for short-, medium-term.
Therefore, I commented that price increases have to be above the building index to take
into – to prepare for more volatile weather going forward. But, of course, we could meet
the 2019 and year 2021 like 2014, 2015, 2016, but we do not want to take that bet.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay. And can I just summarize the motor situation from what I've understood, please,
just to follow-up? That that – from back in August to now, things are going as per your
expectations in the direction of claims or pricing and there's nothing to – there's no
change on that. That's a good summary of the motor situation?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

That's correct.

FINAL

Q - Kevin Ryan

{BIO 1814771 <GO>}

Thank you for taking my question. It's just a point of clariﬁcation. The solvency margin
target you've given is quite a big range. Can I press you to come up with a solvency
margin that you would really like to base yourself around, because it has a huge impact
on your dividend paying capacity? That's the angle I'm looking at here. So, any additional
help you could give us on what the ideal solvency margin for the companies would be
gratefully received. Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I think the only indication I think we've given and I can give you is that we try to be in the
upper half of that range to be consistent with long-term A rating. But this really this – the
rating agencies and the regulators look at capital very diﬀerently and capital requirements
very diﬀerently. So, that's not necessarily a stable relationship over a long time. But given
where we are at the moment, I would say, upper half of that range.

Thank you. We can now take our next question from Youdish Chicooree from
Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. I've got three questions, please. The ﬁrst one is really on your
combined ratio target. You've improved your – you've lowered your expense ratio target,
but kept the combined ratio target unchanged. So, if you could just comment on which
areas you expect the loss ratio to be weaker going forward?
And then, secondly, on your comment around more volatile weather and property claims
going forward, could you just remind us what level of inﬂation you're seeing at the
moment and conﬁrm whether so far you've been – I think you said in the past you've been
pricing around 4% increases. So, if you could just give us an idea of what you're expecting
going forward, that would be very helpful.
And then, ﬁnally, on – again, coming back on the ordinary dividend, I mean, you raised
your payout ratio range, but already with the earnings this year it looks like keeping the
dividend ﬂat will require the challenge. So, how conﬁdent are you that the FSA will give
you the approval to pay in excess of earnings this year? Thank you very much.

A - Jostein Amdal

FINAL

On the ﬁrst question, we have raised our ambition, expressed ambition at least, in terms
of cost ratio. We still have, as you know, an interval (00:47:39) in terms of the combined
ratio. We will be within that interval (00:47:42). It's up several percentage points change in
the cost ratio, so we'll still keep the same ratio in terms of combined ratio. It doesn't
necessarily mean a signiﬁcant decline in the loss ratio.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay. All right.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yeah. Second question is inﬂation in property, as I understood, your question was mainly
related to property?

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think Helge already has commented. Over time, the building index is volatile, but over
time, we expect something like 4%. But then, we also need to price to meet the increased
frequency due from what we think is – might be a change in the pattern of the kind of
weather-related claims and so on. So, we will aim or are aiming higher now in terms of
price increases than the building cost index, and that is the same from if you look one or
two years back.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Third question was on the ordinary dividends. We – when we or if we apply for the – to the
FSA for an ordinary dividend above this year's proﬁts, then they will look at the solvency
situation both at the moment and forward looking. We have a very strong solvency
position both now and after the sale of bank, even stronger last year as you know.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay. And in terms of the sale of the bank, what approval is pending so far?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

The competition authorities have given their approval and we're waiting for the Financial
Services Authority.

Page 17 of 25

Okay. So, they could take a decision while it's in their hands to decide whether the sales
was ahead, and then at the same time, they can make a judgment on whether it will have
the necessary capital after that approval, basically?

FINAL

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I didn't quite catch what you're asking. Are you asking about the timing of the diﬀerent
decisions or...

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Yeah. I'm saying that, well, at the end of the day, it all depends on the FSA then, whether
you can pay in excess of 100% and whether the bank sales goes ahead.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Of course. That is how the legal requirements are. They need to approve both the bank
transaction and any dividend about 100%.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you very much. Just a quick clariﬁcation. You say your solvency
ratio will be reducing by 10 percentage points by the end of this year. Is that both
Solvency II ratios that you provide?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Well, that is the legally approved partial internal model only.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Okay. And so, your own partial internal view won't reduce by 10 percentage points?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

It might change. But then, this is what we are referring to, some speciﬁc requirements
from the FSA to change to legally approve the model. And I think it's the same. We
actually communicated externally and at the same time as we've got the model approved
early this year.

Q - Steven Haywood

There's nothing new, it's been trend all the time.

FINAL

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Okay, okay. So, pro forma for the bank sale and looking at your excess capital position
here, if you were to use the bottom of your new target range, you may have over NOK 12
billion of excess capital, or if you will use the middle of the range, you say you want to be
in the middle or the upper half, you may have NOK 10 billion or more excess capital to
use for M&A opportunities. Is this the right sort of size that you would use or would you
not be willing to go down to the 135%? And then also, can I ask, what's the willingness of
your foundation to partake in a capital raise?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Not commenting on number, but the target is obviously – range is there for a reason.
That's kind of where we are – use that as guiding post to where our capitalization should
be. Our foundation needs to speak for itself, but it has ownership policy that states that
kind of in terms of kind of value-creating transactions, they will be participating if that
means new money or if it means settling done and reducing their ownership stake in
Gjensidige. That is kind of something they are willing to consider if they deem the case to
be right.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. And I think just a ﬁnal question on your claims inﬂation. You say 6% is for
2018. Can you give us a ﬁgure for 2019 expected claims inﬂation on your motor book?
And also, if you're having a buildings index at 4% currently, what is your claims inﬂation
levels that you're expecting here?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

The 6% is the forward-looking estimate on the motor. It is not the last 12 months or 2018.
It's what we expect going forward. And in terms of the building property index, we are not
precise on kind of our expected inﬂation going forward. We are saying that – or posted
earlier, we said it is probably more than the building cost index of 4%.

Thank you. We can now take our next question from Niccolo Dalla Palma from Exane.
Please go ahead.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Good morning. My ﬁrst question is on the frequency-related weather losses. If you – can
you give us some indication of what indication was in Q4 last year so that we can take that
Page 19 of 25



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2018-10-25

into account when we do our estimate for Q4 this year?

FINAL

And the second question is on your hurdle for M&A. How do you think about your own
cost of equity in terms of relative point for value creation? And you just increased your
ROE target, are you then ready to decrease it again in case you have to pay a price for an
asset that requires that? How should we think about again the hurdle rates for M&A given
what your cost of equity and given there are retargets?
And the third question is on the bank disposal, could you just clarify, is there any other
impacts on your shareholders' equity other than the gain of NOK 1.9 billion that you
disclosed? I mean, is there any tax implications there? Thanks.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

We do not have a number, sorry, for that Q4 2017 extraordinary weather eﬀects. I think we
didn't disclose that at that time. Obviously, in the winter in 2017, the last quarter was more
than 2016 and the average of the last years because this year, kind of extraordinary winter
situation in last quarter of 2017. So, there was something there. I'm sorry, we might look at
that before the Q4, but we don't have the number now, and we didn't disclose it at that
time.

Bloomberg Transcript

And in terms of hurdles for M&A, when we look at a target, the ﬁrst and foremost is, of
course, the industrial logic, and as Helge mentioned, it needs to be some size because
there are integration costs and take some focus away from running that business.
Our cost of capital, as we see it, cost of equity capital is 7.5% after-tax. That is what we use
for our calculations. And, of course, there needs to be value creation above that cost of
capital for us to be willing to enter into a transaction. If we did something of a meaningful
size, it will, of course, have a negative eﬀect on the ROE in the short-term that, of course,
really is mathematically.
Please remember that 20% return on equity is based on two assumptions. First, 1
percentage point is just due to the sale of the bank and based on that assumption. And
the other part, the 4 percentage points increase is based on including the expected runoﬀ gains through 2022 and that's consistent with 86% to 89% combined ratio target. Just
to clarify that, it is not directly related to your question, but just to avoid any
misunderstandings. The sale of the bank does not give us any tax implications. It's tax
exempted.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Thanks for clarifying that. So, the ROE targets that you did is actually – that's therefore a
target of average ROE on 2022, and therefore it beneﬁts from 2019 when you have a big
gain. Is that right?

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

Okay. Sorry. That's clear now. And one more question, please. On the large losses, slide
23 speciﬁcally, if you look at the long run, the left-hand side chart, it seems that with a few
exceptions, you typically are at expected level or below with very few exceptions. How
should we think about the large loss budget? Is it still the right number? Should we
assume that it's always a bit less than this? How do you set this large loss budget? Thanks.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

The large losses is based on the partial internal model, and use the same data and the
same type of modeling. And large losses, the typical large loss here will be below the
expected level. But every now and then, we will have average that's much worse. So, the
average will be as we expect, the expected level, but the median for the typical year will
be lower. That makes sense?

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Waj Rizvi from Deutsche Bank. Three questions for me, please. The
ﬁrst one on the weather losses, which you said NOK 530 million to NOK 660 million for
ﬁrst three quarters. Firstly, are you able to break that between your motor book property
agriculture and other books, please? I'm guessing that most of it is in property and
agriculture book. And secondly, given the visibility you have, how are you driving comfort
that all of these extraordinary weather losses are deﬁnitely weather-related and there isn't
any accretional impacted in (00:59:03) behind these losses? That will be the ﬁrst
question.
And second is a bit of a clariﬁcation. So, you alluded to pricing for extra volatility in the
property book. So, the current 6% sort of price increase level you guided for, does that
already include the price increase you need to put for, for this volatility, or is that
something you need to take account into your future pricing and you haven't done that
yet?
And the ﬁnal question would be on IT system update. I think Helge talked about it in his
remarks. So, will that be included within your expense ratio guidance which you have
given, or will you capitalize it on your balance sheet? Thank you very much.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Hi. The ﬁrst one, the split between diﬀerent lines, let's start with the last – the new – this
quarter's claims. That's divided only between property and agriculture, 80 (01:00:02) in
agriculture and the rest in property, more or less. No more during the third quarter
estimate.
The previous quarter estimates, I need some help to remind – remember it. But in Q1,
there was more or less an even split between motor and property. In Q2, it's mainly
related to property. But if you add that up, someone needs to add that up, but (01:00:29)
numbers, that's kind of, ﬁrst quarter, evenly split between motor and property; second
quarter, property; third quarter, agriculture and property.

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

Okay. Yeah.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yeah. Are we sure that this is weather-related and not some other reason? It is based on
looking back at the average of these types of claims. They go down to each type of claims
and you get what this average was of the years before. These are typically types of claims
that are related to weather losses, either that heavy snow which makes roofs falling, and
it's based on the water forcing the rain to houses and so on. So, it's typical weatherrelated losses.
And kind of for indications, you often see these weather statistics that we've given you in
terms of snow depth, the precipitation, and changes of weather during these ﬁrst two

FINAL

quarters, and then the heat and the dryness in the third quarter. So, I think it's – we can't
be 100% sure, and we try to give a range just to indicate that. But it's fairly sure that this is
weather-related.
Big question is, of course, what's going to be going forward, is this a pattern that is going
to repeat itself or was it a one-oﬀ in 2018? And we don't want to take the fact that this is all
returning back to a benign situation in 2019. So, we'll take that into account in pricing. This
applies mostly to property. I think from our motor estimate, we think that currently
weather-related eﬀects will be handled within this 6% expected going forward. But, of
course, these are our estimates based on certainly around those estimates. So, things
might happen.

Thank you. We can now take our next question from Blair Stewart from Bank of America.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Hi. This is Blair again, and apologies, just another clariﬁcation. Just on the question I
asked on excess capital, I think you mentioned the NOK 10 billion number, I just wanted
to check what that was. I think that was – you said the – I think that was an implication that
the capital requirement was NOK 10 billion because you said it was NOK 13.8 billion on a
legal basis today and you take oﬀ around NOK 4 billion from the bank. Is that correct?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yeah. That's on my – that's was my...

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah, yeah. Just – yeah. Just a rough number. So, NOK 10 billion of capital requirements.
So, at 200% at the top-end of your range, that would be NOK 20 billion of capital
requirements. I think we can work out a pro forma end-of-the-year ratio of about 250%,
which is the 262% less 10 points, so 250%. So, it would imply that you've got available
capital of about NOK 25 billion against a capital requirement at 200% of NOK 20 billion.

Page 23 of 25



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
