{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Thank you, Gabi. Good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before
turning to our results this morning, I want to take a moment and comment on the events
of the last week. No doubt, someone will ask about the cost of the events in Boston or in
West, Texas. Well, right now, we don't expect either event will be meaningfully costly to
us. My real answer is that the human cost is stunning, and we are reminded of the fragile
nature of the world in which we live. Our sympathies go out to everyone affected in these
horrific events, and we will do all we can to help them in the recoveries. As we are
reminded of September 11, we wish only the best for the folks in Texas and embrace fully
the sentiment of Boston Strong.
Now turning to our results, we are very pleased to report a strong start to 2013, with
operating income of $2.31 per diluted share, which is the highest quarterly operating
income per share since Travelers' initial public offering in 2002. Both net and operating
income increased 11% from last year's First Quarter results to $896 million and $887
million, respectively, producing a return on equity of 14.1%, and an operating return on
equity of 15.8%. Our margins improved significantly, with a GAAP combined ratio of 88.5%.
Importantly, underlying underwriting margins increased across all our business segments,
in large measure, the result of the pricing and underwriting actions we have taken over
the last few years. Our 90.8% underlying GAAP combined ratio was an improvement of
almost 4 points from the prior year, as earned rate increases outpaced expected loss
trends in each segment.
While we are certainly pleased with these results, we will continue our strategy of taking
the steps necessary to continue improving accident year profitability and returns. Our
focus is evident in the production statistics for each segment this quarter. Renewal rates

were at or above levels achieved in recent quarters, and exceeded expected loss cost
trends in each segment. In addition, retention rates remain at very high levels. We also
saw modest new business growth in Business Insurance. And while new business in
Personal Insurance remains meaningfully down from historical levels, it was consistent with
Fourth Quarter 2012 levels. Brian will take you through the details by segment.
Next I would like to comment briefly about our total return to shareholders, as measured
by the net stock price change plus cumulative amount of dividends over the same time
period, assuming dividend reinvestment. We have shown this information in the past, and
believe it is an important measure of our long-term success. The universe you see on
slides 4 and 5 contain the 20 largest S&P financial companies by market capitalization, as
well as companies in our P&C insurance peer group. As slide four demonstrates, our total
return to shareholders for each of these periods is impressive. Slide five shows the return
on a Treynor risk-adjusted basis. And amongst these companies, we are first on a one
and five-year basis, and sixth on a three-year basis. These results are very gratifying.
It is worth noting that over the last five years, the compound annual growth rate in our
book value per share has been 9.4%. In earnings per share, it has been 8.6%, and in
dividends per share, it has been 9.7%. If we include the dividend increase announced
today, it is 11.5%. Before I turn it over to Jay, I want to take a moment and extend the best
wishes of 30,000 Travelers employees to our friend and colleague, Chuck Clarke. Chuck
is retiring after 55 years, indeed a lifetime of service with Travelers. It is not possible to
overstate the impact that Chuck has had on so many of us at Travelers, and we will all
benefit from his powerful legacy for many years to come. He is the best in our business,
and we all wish him the best in this next chapter in his life. I will miss him more than I can
express. With that, let me turn it over to Jay.

Jay Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Thanks, Jay. As Jay said, we are very pleased with our First Quarter results, as well as our
liquidity and capital positions. Operating cash flows of approximately $530 million was
strong, despite higher than normal claim payments that were related to Storm Sandy. We
repaid $500 million of debt that matured in March and maintained our strong cash
position, ending the quarter with holding company liquidity of just over $1.5 billion. We
continue to generate more capital than what is needed to support our businesses, so we
returned $476 million of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $176
million, and common share repurchases of $300 million, consistent with our ongoing
capital management strategy. And we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend
from $0.46 per share to $0.50 per share, an increase of almost 9%.
We also recorded on a consolidated basis, pretax net favorable prior year reserve
development of $231 million for the quarter, which was lower than the $304 million we
reported in the prior year quarter. And each of our segments once again saw its reserves
develop favorably. I should point out that this quarter's reserve development included an
unusual item of $42 million pretax charge precipitated by legislation in New York related to
the New York Fund for Reopened Cases for workers' compensation. Business Insurance
accounted for a little less than half of this quarter's total reserve development. Favorable
development in BI was driven by better than expected loss experience and general
Page 3 of 23

FINAL

liability for accident years 2003 and prior, as well as accident years 2004 through 2010,
resulting from a more favorable legal and judicial environment than we had expected, and
by property loss development for accident years 2010 through 2012.
I should also note that BI reserve development was reduced by the $42 million pretax
charge precipitated by the New York legislation concerning workers' comp that I
mentioned previously, and excluding the impact of this legislation, our workers' comp
reserves were essentially unchanged for all accident years. The rest of this quarter's
favorable reserve development primarily resulted from better than expected loss
development in bond and financial products contract surety business for accident years
2006, '07, '08, and '10, better than expected loss development in several international
businesses within FPII, and better than expected cat and non-cat loss development in
Personal Insurance homeowners business for accident year 2011. On a combined statutory
basis for all of our US subs, accident years 2003 and prior, as well as accident years 2004
through 2011 all developed favorably in the quarter, while accident year 2012 developed
very slightly unfavorably.

Bloomberg Transcript

And finally to update you on Storm Sandy, our current estimate of total ultimate losses is
now $1.011 billion net of reinsurance and pretax, down $13 million from our Fourth Quarter
2012 estimate. Finally, all of our capital ratios remained at or better than our target levels
at the end of the quarter. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $4.4 billion
pretax or $2.9 billion after-tax, a slight decrease from the beginning of the year due to the
rise in interest rates that took place during the quarter. And book value per share was $68
or 7% higher than at the end of the prior year quarter, and 1% higher than at the beginning
of the year. So with that, let's have Brian talk about the operations.

Brian MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Thanks, Jay. I will go through the segment results in some detail, but the overall headline
from an underwriting perspective is the margin expansion that we saw in all our business
segments. Beginning with Business Insurance, we continue to be extremely pleased with
the fundamentals of the business. The combined ratio for the quarter of 89.4% improved
slightly versus the prior year, while the underlying combined ratio, which excludes the
impact of cats and prior year development, improved by more than 4 points. As always,
there is some non-run rate items in the quarter, but 3 points of the improvement was
driven by earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends. Net written premiums
increased 5%, with the largest increase in workers' compensation, driven by higher rate
and exposure in our guaranteed cost and national account business.
Turning to the production statistics, starting on page 11, overall retention was in line with
recent periods at 80%. Pricing remains strong, with renewal premium change over 10%,
and new business volume was up slightly from recent quarters. Drilling into the pricing
results, the renewal premium change was driven by pure rate increases of 8% and
exposure of over 2%. The rate gains we achieved this quarter were up slightly from both
the previous quarter and the First Quarter of 2012. Rate increases ranged from 6% to 10%
across all lines, and were once again led by workers' compensation and commercial auto.
As we have explained before, when comparing the quarter's data with prior periods,

Page 4 of 23



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2013-04-23

FINAL

keep in mind that the data develops over time and can bounce around a bit, and this is
especially true of exposure.
On slide 15, we show our commercial accounts rate change and retention data for the
First Quarter of 2013, as compared to the First Quarter of 2012. This slide presents a
summarized view of how we analyze the pricing and retention on our renewal book to
ensure we are taking the right actions. The data is segmented by the individual accounts
long-term loss ratio, with the bars on the left representing our best performing business,
accounts with long-term loss ratio of less than 60%, and the bars on the right
representing our worst performing businesses, that is accounts with long-term loss ratios
exceeding 90%.

Bloomberg Transcript

The results show that retention is stronger for the better business, and the rate change is
dramatically higher on the poor performing accounts. I would emphasize that this is
summarized data, so don't over analyze the precision on the page. But what this data
continues to tell us is that our underwriters are making the right targeted rate decisions,
class by class, account by account. So with the continued improvement in pricing and loss
trend holding across Business Insurance at about 4%, we continue to see meaningful
margin expansion.
In our Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment, the combined ratio for the
quarter was 82.3%, an improvement of 5.5 points year-over-year. The underlying
combined ratio improved nearly 4 points, driven by underwriting actions across the
segment, along with increased rate in our management liability business. This marks the
ninth consecutive quarter of improving underlying loss ratios for the segment. Net written
premiums increased by 7% in the quarter, driven primarily by lower reinsurance costs
across the segment. Gross written premiums showed a modest increase of about 1% in
the First Quarter, driven by strong rate gains in our management liability book of business,
partially offset by a slight decline in surety premium. All in, a great quarter for the
segment.
In Personal Insurance, operating income was up significantly versus the First Quarter of
2012 due to higher underlying underwriting margins, lower levels of catastrophe losses,
and higher net favorable prior year reserve development. The combined ratio for the
quarter of 89.4% improved more than 8 points versus the First Quarter of 2012, while the
underlying combined ratio showed more than a 3 point improvement year-over-year.
Looking specifically at auto, we continue to be very pleased with both pricing and
retention, with renewal premium change of nearly 9%, and retention at 81%, both in line
with recent periods, while new business volume was down year-over-year. What these
results demonstrate is that we have been successful in achieving rate increases on the
renewal book, but our pricing actions have meaningfully impacted our new business, and
we are watching this trend carefully.
Turning to auto profitability, the underlying combined ratio of 94.4% was an improvement
of over 1 point versus the prior year quarter, reflecting the earned impact of the written
rate gains we have achieved over the past several quarters. It is important to remember
that there is a significant amount of seasonality in losses for this line, and the First Quarter
loss ratio typically runs a little below the full-year average. I would also note that the
Page 5 of 23

Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2013-04-23

FINAL

unfavorable prior year development in this line is due to a slight increase in our estimate
of Sandy auto claims. Regarding loss cost trends, we have been talking to you about
increasing bodily injury severity for more than a year, and we were encouraged that the
bodily injury severity trend we saw this quarter remained consistent with what we have
seen in the previous two quarters. In addition, earned pricing remains in excess of our
current view of loss trend. And assuming loss trend remains at this level, we will see yearover-year auto margins expand for the remainder of 2013.
Looking at homeowners, pricing was also very strong, with renewal premium change
coming in at 12%, down slightly from the Fourth Quarter of 2012, but up more than 2
points year-over-year. Retention remains strong at 84%, while new business volume was
meaningfully lower than the prior year quarter, due to the execution of our pricing,
underwriting, and deductible strategies. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter of
81.1% improved more than 4 points over the prior year quarter, benefiting from a lower
level of non-cat weather and fire losses, along with earned rate increases that exceeded
loss cost trends.
So a very strong underwriting result, but given the ongoing volatility of weather patterns,
we will continue to implement, improve underwriting pricing and terms and conditions.
Overall in the segment, there was progress on the underlying fundamentals, along with
some benefit from the lower weather-related losses. It is still a work in process, and we
will continue to execute on our strategy in order to further improve our results. With that,
let me turn it back over to Gabi.

Our first question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Please
proceed with your question.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Thanks. And just -- I had one question, Brian, in -- you talked about Personal Lines. You
talked about the rate gains you are getting, both on the homeowners and the auto side.
But I think in the Q, the outlook, you mentioned that you expected profitability to be
roughly in line with what you saw in 2012. Just trying to square those two, those two items
and just one follow-up. Thanks.

So, and specifically, I just want to make sure. That is a homeowners --

FINAL

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

I think you said in the Q, I think it said the outlook for Personal Lines overall was at,
profitability should be in line with 2012, or you would expect it to be in line with 2012. And
just given that you are taking mid to high single-digit, in some cases double-digit rate
gains, I am just trying to understand how -- why that number shouldn't be better next year
than this year?

A - Jay Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

This is Jay Benet. What we tried to say in the Q was, that we had last year were various
quarters that had favorable weather, favorable fire losses, and as you can easily
understand in the homeowners, it is very difficult to predict, what a normal level of these
things are. So thinking about what the outlook for the year was in homeowners, our view
was, well, they were favorable last year. So whatever normal is this year, sounds like it
should be a little higher.
So despite having this underlying concept of rate exceeding some view of loss trend -and that is a pretty difficult concept when you get into a business that has so much of its
losses tied up in weather and fire-type events. We do feel that there is an improvement in
profitability coming about through pricing versus this concept of loss trend. But that
improvement will be offset if the other levels of losses go back to whatever quote,
unquote normal is. It is a very difficult equation if you will, to try to come up with an outlook
for that business, but that was our best shot as it relates to homeowners. And then, on
the auto side the view was a little marginal improvement based upon pricing, where it is
today versus in that business, a much better view as to what loss trend looks like. So on
the other hand --

A - Jay Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Better meaning more, more accurate, more predictable?

A - Jay Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Yes, yes, yes.

A - Jay Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Jay Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

So looking at the two combined, one getting better, one, if things go back to normal in
homeowners, and who knows whether they will, getting a little less margin. The two of
them should kind of offset and the profitability should be roughly the same level.

FINAL

Understood. Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just in Business Insurance, we certainly saw
exposures kind of pick up in some of the, in some of the reporting that you provided us
with. Just trying to understand, so you have got -- so you are taking rate. You are
expecting to continue to do that. Your retention is not falling and you are seeing
exposures lift. Is that exposures on the business that you had, or is that potentially being
impacted by new business, or new, new endorsements on old business? Thanks.

A - Brian MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Michael, this is Brian. So the exposure numbers we show are all on a renewal book for
starters, driven by a whole bunch of things. In property, for example, there has been a lot
of movement to improve insurance to value. So that would -- we could have the exact
same building, but getting a different insurance to value on it and that would be driving
exposure up. It can be more employees in workers' comp. It could be more vehicles,
more receipts on a GL rating. So it can be a whole -- all of those different things. As I
mentioned in my comments too, I would also point out that the granular nature of the
exposure data in particular on commercial accounts moves around a bit, as premium
audits come in, et cetera. So, so there is a lift there, but maybe not as dramatically as
some of that data shows. It moves around.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

And the premium audits have been trending in which direction recently?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Brian MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

For the last several quarters, they have been pretty flat. They rose dramatically as we
came out of the 2008-2009 time period. But for the -- yes, and clearly, it is positive.
Premium audits of returns are the traditional 2 points positive on average.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

Great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein. Please go
ahead.

Q - Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the call. So this is obviously a great quarter. And as
we work through results, we are starting to see some players get more comfortable with
margins, and obviously Travelers has been the leaders thus far in raising pricing and
talking about sort of accident years being not a target. I am curious to get a sense of how
far you think we may have to go in pricing. You are guiding to continued pricing in '13 and
your outlook in the Q and would love to get a sense of how much further accident year
sort of margin expansion you think that the industry needs to get back to target?

Josh, it's Jay Fishman. I can't speak to the industry or any other company. I can tell you
what we are doing. We are going to continue, and it is driven by two factors. First, the
weather remains unpredictable, and just more uncertain than it has in many years. And
that' is been the case for the last several years and these been driving much of our
actions. But the other part is that as our investment portfolio continues to mature, the
effect of reduced interest rates will continue to push the fixed portion of net investment
income down over the next several years.
We have provided those projections to you previously. Well, actually, they are more than
projections -- they are almost the actual number, such as the bonds as they mature will be
reinvested. So we will -- and I would refer you back to that schedule to get some sense of
that impact. So that net investment income will continue to decline for the next several
years, at least unless interest rates change, the weather remains very unpredictable and
uncertain. So we are going to keep going.

Q - Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That's helpful, Jay. The other thing that's surprising about this, just as a follow-up, a couple
of years back, it was clear that, that it was easier to maintain margins and maintain sort of
pricing in the soft market in the sort of smaller areas and Personal Lines. But it sounds like,
if I am interpreting what you are saying correctly, that you think that there is more pricing
momentum to continue in sort of the larger midmarket commercial accounts, national
accounts businesses as opposed to the smaller businesses and Personal Lines. And I am
wondering if you can talk about, one, I guess if that is right, but then also sort of
underlying that, sort of how those two different markets have diverged, and what we all
ought to understand about how they operate differently? Thank you.

A - Jay Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

No worries. We tend to think of those markets really in three segments. And even that is
an understatement of what the real environment is, but we tend to think of small middle
market individually underwritten accounts, and then the national accounts business. And
certainly, over a long period of time, the competitive dynamics in the national accounts
arena, and particularly has been more dramatic than the level of competition in the
smallest accounts. In fact, if I recall correctly, I don't think that renewal price change in our
select business actually ever went negative. We should check that. But that is my
recollection. I don't believe that it ever did.
And obviously, it did in middle markets. And for those who engage in the real national
accounts business, and I would observe that our participation in that segment is actually
relatively modest. That has been the most competitive. So that is an historical framework,
I think around which to think of pricing. For what has happened over the last several years,
we have been successful at passing along price increases, both in our small commercial
business, as well as our middle market individually underwritten businesses. And I am not
sure that the difference is in the ability to pass, or at least as measured by rate gains or
renewal price change in the small business, I don't think that there has been a significant
difference in the ability to be successful in those two segments.

Page 9 of 23

Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity

The dynamics are quite different on the individually underwritten business. It is account by
account. It is in many cases loss-driven. It is the experience of the individual account. In
select, you are dealing with class underwriting. And so you are dealing with -- think of it as
one with Personal Lines, price established for a class of business. So the nature of the
underwriting decisions are different. But the results are -- been interesting in that we have
been successful at getting rate gains in that small end, as well as the individually
underwritten business that are largely in the aggregate the same. But do you want to talk
about national accounts at all, or -- I am looking at Brian.

A - Brian MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Yes, I mean, national accounts is a little bit more of a service model. A lot of what we do
there, the majority of what we do on the casualty side is all loss responsive. And the
market conditions have been such that our service capabilities have been viewed very
favorably, and so the pricing is improved there pretty dramatically. But -- and we have
done really well there. So we feel good about -- we are not a large casualty risk taker in
that space.

A - Jay Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And that is an important distinction. We, our -- in our national accounts business, we will
write national property on a guaranteed cost basis. We will do that. Our casualty business,
both in terms of liability, as well as in particular workers' compensation is largely in one
fashion or another, a fee for service business, where we are managing a claim on behalf
of the client. So we are not, as one would think of it, a guaranteed cost risk taker in the
larger end of --

A - Brian MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

The risk we would take there, would be excess --

Our next question comes from the line of Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets.
Please proceed with your question.

Q - Charles Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. I just had a question about the Personal Lines
business, and the change in PIF this quarter. While the retention seems to be holding
constant on both the agency auto and agency homeowners, there has been a pretty

Page 10 of 23



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2013-04-23

significant decline in PIF year-over-year. Wonder if you could give us some more insight on
it, just a rate change or a competitive dynamic shift?

FINAL

A - Brian MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Yes, so this is Brian. I will start. We are -- we are clearly watching that closely. So obviously,
in our statistics, you can see the renewal book is performing well. We feel great about
that. The actions that we are taking, and we believe it is very directly tied to the actions
we are taking from a pricing, deductible, underwriting perspective, specifically on the last
point there on homeowners is impacting our new business volumes and our competitive
position in the marketplace. And like I said, we are watching it closely and we are going to
continue to manage it. But we are committed to improving the profitability there. Jay?

A - Jay Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No, I think you expressed it right. In the homeowners business, our sense is -- and this is
more anecdotal than we can -- than factual, our sense is that the increase in minimum
deductibles in particular, in not an insignificant number of states, to really try and bring the
policy back towards its historical intent, is having an impact on new business competitively.
It had been our hope I think more than anything else, that the weather changes that are,
that we are confronting, those are systemic. They are not unique to us. They are systemic,
and that any thoughtful underwriting-driven company would in the long run evaluate how
you make a reasonable return in that business. So we have taken the steps that we think
make sense for us.
We are not going to allow our business to continue from a policy in force standpoint to
decline in double digits for long, without beginning to take other steps that we might have
to take. Now one of those steps is not to re-engage in the business and make
substandard returns. So we will have to wrestle with the strategy and how we implement
that in the marketplace, if what we are doing now strategically and tactically doesn't turn
out to be competitively viable. And that is why Brian's comment that we will continue to

either advertising or otherwise accelerate the development of the business?

A - Jay Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Not, not yet. We continue to -- the test that we are actually continuing to do internally, we
refer to as little America. Our little America test is -- I don't know whether it is two or three
states. But we are actually doing pricing testing in those two states, picking states where
our agency business is not nearly as prominent as other states, so we can determine the
pricing elasticity of the product and what actions we take and what drives volumes. We
are -- we also believe in learning about this, that the notion of what I will call traditional
advertising, media-based advertising, that may have run its course. Meaning, we are just
not convinced that taking a substantial amount of resources and applying it in traditional
media channels actually is going to result in a growth strategy for business. So we have

been deeply exploring digital, and the way to drive digital business around it which we
think, at least at this point, has been more viability to it and a greater impact.
So that is at least a learning in the process, that it is possible that American eyeballs are
just exhausted from auto insurance ads, and to become another name in that quest, may
not make a great deal of sense. And lastly, we watch with interest who responds. And we
are always wrestling -- not wrestling, that is actually an incorrect word. We are evaluating,
is perhaps better, the dynamic of who responds in that channel, the nature of the
customer. And always wanting to make sure that when we are ready to launch this more
substantively, that we really understand the customer that is responding and we like that
customer. And so those are still learning points for us. And until we really feel comfortable
that we know what we are doing, and we have a likely successful outcome, we are going
to keep testing and making sure we wire the thing up properly.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning, and congrats on a very strong quarter. I guess, two quick follow-up
questions. First of all, if I look at slide 14 for other Business Insurance, it seems that that
exposure rebounded meaningfully over the past few quarters. Can you just sort of delve
a little bit deeper into the cause for that?

A - Brian MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Yes, so this is Brian. A decent amount of that business is property. So it has got our
national property business there. It has got our marine business there. As I said, insurance
to values improved pretty significantly there. So we have had some movement. And some
of the other activity in oil and gas has moved there. So it is a couple specific things. I
wouldn't read robust economic growth into it.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. I guess the only other question is going back to the charge regarding
to the New York Fund for Reopened Cases. Can you sort of just expand on that? And is
that the fund which will close at 1/1/2014? I guess what I am trying to figure out, is there a
possibility as more new claims come in, could there be further adjustments down the line?
Thanks.

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Sure. You're welcome. This is Jay Fishman. And yes, this is the fund that will close 1/1/14 as
a result of legislation undertaken in New York, and your question actually is quite relevant.
The $42 million pretax that we provided is an actuarial estimate of the amount of
reopened claims that we otherwise would have been -- that would have been cedeable
to the fund. And as a consequence, we did not build into original loss estimates -- loss
picks if you like, in our workers' compensation business. And now that is the best estimate
we have, given all the data that we have, of the amount that will no longer go back to that
fund. So we have to provide for the reserve levels. And if in fact the reserve, the claim
activity is different from that actuarial estimate, yes, we will have a variance to that $42
million prospectively. It can go up or down obviously, and -- but the answer to your
question is, yes, that is correct.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Please go

Q - Michael Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Hi, thanks. I was hoping we could flush out the audit premiums impact during the quarter. I
believe it was a component of healthy growth in at least one line. And I was curious if it
benefits the combined ratio, in a way that we should be cognizant of as well?

A - Brian MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

This is Brian. I am thinking through the question for a second. But I don't think it has any
impact on the combined. As we say on the pages of -- what I am looking at the page
numbers 11, 12, 13, those are illustrative production statistics that we use in managing the
business. And particularly in commercial accounts, how the true-ups of audit premiums
flow through that data develops over time. But from a loss projection, from a loss ratio
perspective, I don't think it has any impact.

A - Jay Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Without getting into the details of accounting, we have this thing called earned but
unbilled amounts on the balance sheet, that is trying to take into account everything we
Page 13 of 23



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2013-04-23

FINAL

know about the particular policy holders that we have. So there is really nothing about the
audit premiums per se, that are going to drive a major change in combined ratio any
given quarter. It is just all part of the entirety of the estimation process. And then as far as
the overall level of audit premiums this year in the First Quarter versus last year, there
really wasn't a significant change in the dollar amount. So as it relates to premium
differentials from one quarter to the next, it is not driving that either.

A - Jay Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

We actually make an estimate and accrue on a regular basis the amount of estimated
audit premiums that we project. And then obviously, as each policy ends and each policy
audit occurs, we will make an adjustment to that accrual either up or down, depending on
it. In the financial crisis, what happened -- the reason that it became a more substantive
issue was that we had never actually seen audit premiums go negative. We were not
accruing on the premise that they would be negative. So we had significant adjustments
then relative to that. But now it is more consistent with historical patterns, and is -- the
answer is no. Multiple Speakers [ph]. I need to correct one thing I said earlier. I am
reminded by Bill Cunningham who is here. I said I couldn't -- I didn't recall that select RPC
had ever been negative. And in fact, it was in the -- Multiple Speakers [ph]. RPC in the
Fourth Quarter of '08, it was the -- the others were Third Quarter of '08 and First Quarter
of '09, it was flat. The Fourth Quarter of '08 it was modestly negative. So apologies for
sort of my memory not being perfect on that.

Q - Michael Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

That is very helpful. And lastly, so I see the Travelers stock valuation has increased fairly
meaningfully. And I noticed that share repurchases plus the dividend lagged net income
by a fair amount this quarter. Is that due to the debt repayment, or should we -- or is there
a change in philosophy on it prospectively?

A - Jay Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Yes, there is no change in philosophy. As we have said before, there is a lot of timing
differential to take place as to when you earn the money, what monies are up at the
holding company versus in the operating company. But there is absolutely no change in
philosophy.

Hi. Thanks. You are actually sitting at your target ROEs at least for one quarter. So I am
wondering, did -- does that -- how does that shift your thinking in terms of managing the
Page 14 of 23



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity

business? You are -- even in a low interest rate world, you are getting where you want to
be, so how do things change?

FINAL

A - Jay Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Greg, we reflect, again, sort of the same comment I made earlier. The fact is, is that on an
accident year basis excluding the favorable reserve development, we are, we are not at
that level. That is going to be compounded by the fact that investment income in the
fixed portfolio will continue to decline. That is a certainty, unless rates change. And then
the third piece is that weather remains very unpredictable, and the fact that we had
favorable non-cat weather in one quarter is certainly not enough for us to conclude that
anything is different. So our analysis is largely the same, and so we are going to continue
to keep pushing.

Q - Gregory Locraf t

{BIO 16836287 <GO>}

Okay. So in a way, you are basically normalizing all that stuff when you talk about that mid
teens over time?

A - Jay Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We -- I am glad you said it. The slide is clear. It says mid teens ROE over time. And I, I said
several quarters ago that that was not achievable in this environment. And on an accident
year basis, I still don't believe that it really is. And as a consequence, and we were going
to leave it in place as an aspirational goal. I think those are the exact words we used. And
that is where we sit today, and as a consequence, we will continue to push.

Q - Gregory Locraf t

{BIO 16836287 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And then perhaps the only negative thing in a very strong quarter was just, or
just some clarification around the workers' comp reserve side. I understand the one-time
charge, but there were no releases anywhere across the book in workers' comp. I m
wondering, is that the first time that you haven't released from workers' comp reserves?
And should we be concerned that the last couple years have developed unfavorably
there?

A - Jay Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

This is Jay Benet. What I did say, was that there was no change really in workers' comp. I
mean, this is the First Quarter of the year, and workers' comp is a long tail line as you
know. So we are not -- while we look at everything on a quarterly basis, we don't
necessarily have adjustments to all of our reserves on a quarterly basis. So I wouldn't read
into that other than, we put up reserves in the Fourth Quarter, and we still feel very good
about where those reserves are. So we will see how they develop going forward.

A - Jay Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

I would make an observation, even though it is not the question that you are necessarily
asking. We were sure that somebody was going to ask us about frequency in workers'
compensation, and the loss trend and kind of where things are in that regard. Harken to,
just reflecting back on our comment a couple of -- I think it was actually two years ago,
Page 15 of 23



FINAL

Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2013-04-23

year and a half, two years ago, which is that the frequency dynamic has indeed returned
back to its long-term trend line, which is really good. It was the blip that we saw -- I think it
was in '10. We attributed it to late filed claims as a result of the financial crisis. But that
frequency line has now returned back to its long-term trend line. That is absolutely no
guarantee that it will stay there. It is -- it may change next quarter. But we were just
prepared for that question. We thought someone would ask. So we feel actually quite
good about the workers' compensation business. We obviously do have a view on what
the accident year returns are in the workers' comp line across all the businesses and we
are very much on track.

Q - Gregory Locraf t

Our next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.
Please proceed with your question.

Q - Lawrence Greenberg

{BIO 17564930 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. Good morning. Brian, I know you said not to microscope slide 15 on the deck,
the pricing changes by band. But I am just curious, the -- for the middle band, retention is
down a decent bit versus a year ago, where the outside bands it has improved a little bit. I
am not sure it matters, but I am just curious, do you have any theory what is going on
there?

A - Brian MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Yes, I think so. So part of it, the honest answer to that is probably the middle bar there in
blue was a little too high a year ago.

Q - Lawrence Greenberg

{BIO 17564930 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Brian MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

And as we looked at marketplace opportunity and the profitability on that business, that
60% to 90% loss ratio business, there is a wide band within that. So, so as I try -- as we try
to emphasize, this is a real simplification of how we look at it. And in every one of our
businesses, it is at least quintiles. And in many, it is deciles and we are looking at all the
stuff in between. So I wouldn't read too much into that dip. A piece of it was I think, as we
looked at the data a year ago, we began to execute more granularly there and push on
the right accounts. So we actually feel good about the progress there.

A - Jay Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Bill Cunningham, actually a year ago said that there was real opportunity or so he thought,
particularly in the right side of this graph, the over 90% segment. And if you take a look at

Page 16 of 23



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2013-04-23

what has happened since, it just -- I mean, the results are just, you couldn't have scripted
them much better. Retention remains at relatively, let's call them low levels, but rate is
even higher. So again, just an analytical validation of the strategic and operational
approach that he described a year ago.

FINAL

Q - Lawrence Greenberg

{BIO 17564930 <GO>}

Right. Very helpful. Thanks. And then, just a quick follow-up on the direct business. I mean,
your statutory underwriting loss there actually declined pretty significantly this quarter.
Clearly, part of it was driven by less expense spend. And I am just wondering relative to
your comments earlier, might we be looking for kind of a new baseline underwriting result
there, thinking about it holistically?

A - Jay Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

The result very specifically is a function of reduced national media spending, advertising,
as we pursued this little America strategy. And Greg shared with me, it is two states that
our media and digital spending has been very targeted. Because we are trying to
generate activity and results in those states so we can learn about pricing elasticity. And
as a consequence, the aggregate amount of spending is down. I wouldn't over react on a
permanent strategic analysis, as to what we have been doing the last few quarters. This is
a very targeted moment for us to determine pricing sensitivity. And as a result, less
advertising spending is needed to generate the results.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Lawrence Greenberg

{BIO 17564930 <GO>}

So it is no top down decision at this point that we want to cut our losses, and not eliminate
them, but we want to bring down our underwriting loss from this initiative?

A - Jay Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

No, no, no, quite the contrary. We remain -- the best way to answer is, we remain
committed to the strategy. And as I have said before, we want to make sure that we know
that we have a financial success. It is -- it is far easier -- I am not saying easy, but it is easier
to have a marketing success and a financial disappointment, and we are guarding carefully
against that. And as a result, we want to make sure that not only do we have a pricing
profile that is competitive for our brand, but that the pricing strategy there can produce a
reasonable return. So that -- it just takes time for sales to occur, losses to emerge, and to
evaluate the performance of the business.
And I -- I am in -- we are in no rush. There is -- we are just not. It is -- there will always be
another 25 year old generation that is coming of age that needs insurance. And I -- it is -granted, there is certainly activity today. But we feel strongly having years and years ago
now had a marketing success and a financial disappointment, but we are not going to go
down that path. And just urgency is not -- to go quickly is not the measure here, it is to go
successfully.

Thank you. Question on reserves and the commentary that the legal environment is
better than expected in the '10 to '12 accident years. I just was wondering, that is still -- we
are seeing that across a bunch of companies. But it is still surprising to me that the legal
environment was so good in that time, given the economy. So I would appreciate any
color on kind of your thoughts on why that has been the case. Why you have had less
exposure legal-wise on casualty lines in that period of time?

A - Doreen Spadorcia

{BIO 4883600 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning. This is Doreen Spadorcia. I will try and answer your question. I will tell you
we had exactly the same assumption when the economy started to turn. We were worried
about, not only that, but political environment. So we watched down to the county what is
happening around jury awards, settlements, et cetera, et cetera. And the best I can give
you, is we think that the financial crisis probably encouraged people to want their dollars
faster. And so there were opportunities for settling some cases, that maybe in the past
they would have waited to see what the amount would have been.
We also took very targeted approaches in certain jurisdictions that we thought we had the
ability to set some good precedent. But we have just found that the willingness for
people settling has been -- they want to do that sooner rather than later. Whether that will
continue, I don't know. We have also seen cases that have gone to verdict. We thought
again, that there might be some view that this is a bad economy, people need the
money, where people on the jury have said, this is a lot of money, given this economy. So
even those things that have gone to verdict on some of the kind of GL and other things,
they have been more reasonable than we anticipated going into this kind of economic
environment. Multiple Speakers [ph]. But again, that is just our view.

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

It is not for lack of effort by the -- on the part of the trial bar though, right? I mean, they

their liquidity, is that -- I guess that is the take-away?

A - Doreen Spadorcia

{BIO 4883600 <GO>}

I can tell you there is a lot of advertising still for the plaintiffs bar looking for different kinds
of cases. There is unique financing tools that people are using around big kinds of
lawsuits. So you are right in that regard. I just can tell you what we are seeing. So I don't
know if that is across the board.

That is very helpful. Just one more on reserves. And that is on -- it was '10 to '12 that
developed most favorably from the commentary, but not kind of '08 and '09 and prior. So
time marches on, and those years are getting seasoned. Is it -- are we getting to the
point now where kind of the '08 and prior accident years kind of stop giving as much,
from a redundancy perspective?

A - Jay Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

This is Jay Benet. We -- I will answer the question by saying every time we provide
information on reserves, it is our best estimate. And we don't have a crystal ball as to how
these things are going to develop. I think, if you think of the arithmetic associated with
reserving, as years mature, more and more claims are paid. More and more claims are
settled. So it is logical to believe that as the accident years mature, there is going to be
less development. But you just have to wait and see how these things actually take place. I
mean, we certainly carry IBNR for all the years you mentioned. And sometimes you have
large cases that you think are going to cost you X, and they will cost you less or a little
more, whatever. So we would just have to see. But I think essentially, the less IBNR you
have, the less uncertainty you have, all things being equal, the less development you'll
have.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jay Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Some of this -- this is Jay Fishman. Some observers of the industry spend a lot of time
commenting about reserve development from hard years, hard cycles, or soft years or
soft cycles. And people who embrace that thinking can come to view that particular years
will be more productive than others. We just -- we don't agree with it, at least for us. I will
speak about Travelers. We just don't believe that. We don't do it. We make our best
estimates all the time. They are estimates for loss. Loss estimates are not driven by the
revenue strength of that business. They are just not. So we don't look at any years
necessarily as being more potentially productive than others. And as an old year rolls off,
a new year comes on, and it just keeps going. So it is -- we just don't spend a lot of time
obsessing about individual accident years and what they are producing.

A - Alan Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Randy, it is Alan Schnitzer. I would also add to Doreen's response, that over that period of
time that you mentioned, we also had other developments like the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act that was really pro-defendant, and made some cases harder to
bring, other developments like the Class Action Fairness Act. There has been some
important cases in the Supreme Court that I think have been some setbacks in some
cases for the trial bar. So I think all those things contribute. We, for example, just had an
important win at the Supreme Court on an interpretation of the Class Action Fairness Act
in Standard Fire versus Knowles. And so, the cases go both ways, of course. But if you
look back over the last five or six years, you would probably on balance and maybe just at
the margin, but on balance see a slightly improving environment from the defense side.

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Back to one of your earlier comments

expect the industry to ramp up on?

A - Jay Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Well, it is Jay Fishman. And then, I am going to turn it over to Brian. But my comment
about loss stabilization was, at least mine was specific to workers' compensation, and it
was a frequency comment where we had seen a tick up in frequency, and it generated a
lot of questions over the last several quarters. So I was just commenting that the
frequency trend was now back in line.

A - Brian MacLean

And maybe you are referring, Vince, back to my comment, where I was talking about auto
severity. And so just to be crystal clear, we had been seeing for -- and this goes back a
little over a year ago now, we started talking about a ramp up in auto severity. The good
news is that that has leveled off Third Quarter, Fourth Quarter, this quarter at about the
same level. But it is still higher than, higher than historical norms. So it is not the -- the rate
of increase isn't increasing anymore, but we have still got the severity trend. Multiple

102% [ph] combined the last six years from, in the -- for the industry, in an environment
with declining interest rates. So from a return perspective, it is not the healthiest line of

the commercial line side, the agents feel terrific. They are just -- they are feeling really
good and really supported and solid. They believe that they can talk to their customers,
explain the rationale. The best remind their customers how long pricing went down, and
actually do a pretty good job comparing where even in a lifted environment, how that
compares to historical premiums. And so, they are feeling pretty good. I don't know if you

more we are having specific conversations about accounts or classes of business, the
more focused that is, the better it will be received. The more it is viewed as just a broad
brush approach to the marketplace, the more challenging it will be.

And on the Personal Lines side, what we are hearing from them is what you see in the
numbers, which is that our minimum, our change in minimum deductibles, our change in
underwriting, our -- to some extent our changes in rate, are making us, causing us to be
less competitive on new business. They share with us that the renewal book is fine. And I
would say -- I don't know that that really reflects a mood, but this is a conversation that we
have with producers and agents all the time. That they are certainly confirming to us, that
for the moment, the strategies that we are taking in home and in auto on the new
business side, I will say only, on the new business side only at least for the moment, is
causing us to be less competitive than historically we have been. And we certainly listen to
that, and we see it in the numbers, and no great surprise to us at the moment.

Just -- and so just to circle back on the previous question, just a couple quick comments
on the big winter storm that we had a couple months ago. We have clearly gotten some
claim volume out of that. It hasn't been outsized. It was obviously contemplated in what
we booked in the quarter. The -- a couple of comments, from an auto perspective, at
least up here in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and the northeast, they really shut down the
roads a lot. So there wasn't a lot of activity. And the type of claims that we get, the really
damaging winter storm claims we get, tend to be when there is either really extended
events, when the snow sits for months on top of roofs and you get damage there, or you
get collapses. And fortunately in this event, although we got lots and lots of snow in a
short period of time, it warmed up, it got cleared. And so it just wasn't a tremendous
event, for at least us. And it doesn't appear to have been in the industry either so.

Great. We will -- it looks -- this concludes our call for -- I don't think we have any more
questions in the queue. So if anybody has further questions, as always, Andrew Hersom
and I are available in Investor Relations. Thank you, and have a good day.
