Thank you for joining us. As we said in our press release, Chubb produced solid financial
results in the First Quarter of 2015. These were achieved even with the adverse impact of
both cat and non-cat weather-related losses, primarily in the Homeowners line, stemming
from the harsh winter in the United States.

Bloomberg Transcript

The market remained relatively stable and we were pleased that we were able to secure
rate increases, while again achieving strong renewal retention in all three of our business
units. Operating income per share was $1.57, a 5% increase over the $1.50 in last year's
First Quarter. The effect of catastrophes were $0.69 per share in this year's First Quarter,
compared to $0.52 per share in last year's.
Annualized operating ROE was 10.2% for the First Quarter of this year. The combined ratio
for the First Quarter was 93.9 this year compared to 93.2 last year. Excluding the impact of
cats, the combined ratio for the First Quarter improved to 85.8, in 2015, from 86.6 a year
ago. Net written premiums, which grew 1%, were negatively effected by currency.
Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, premiums were up 4%. First-quarter
net income per share was $1.60, resulting in an annualized ROE of 9.2%. GAAP book value
per share at March 31 was $70.33, up slightly from year-end 2014. And a 6% increase since
March 31, a year ago.
Our capital position is excellent and we continue to actively repurchase our sharers. In
addition, during the First Quarter, we increased our common stock dividend by 14% to
$2.28 per share on an annualized basis. It was Chubb's 33rd consecutive annual dividend
increase, a continued indication of our consistent performance and financial strength.
Now, I will turn it over to Dino.

Dino Robusto

{BIO 15021398 <GO>}

Thanks, John. In a marketplace that, while competitive, remained relatively stable with
regard to price and terms and conditions, CCI and CSI both had strong performance in
the First Quarter. Each unit produced solid underwriting profitability and continued to
execute our business plan, which emphasizes the retention of our profitable portfolio,
while seeking rate increases on those accounts that still require them. We also leveraged
our distinct underwriting and claims service advantages to write new business in our
targeted niche markets.

Beginning with CCI, the First Quarter combined ratio was 90.8 compared to 88.5 in the
First Quarter of 2014. The First Quarter impact of catastrophe losses accounted for 3.4
points of the combined ratio in 2015 and 6.1 points in 2014. Excluding the impact of
catastrophes, CCI's combined ratio in First Quarter of 2015 was 87.4 compared to 82.4 in
the First Quarter of 2014. This 5-point increase was almost all due to a reduction in the
amount of favorable prior-year reserve development in CCI, which in turn was mainly
driven by a swing from favorable development in the year-ago quarter to modestly
adverse development in this year's First Quarter in the commercial property lines,
including multiple peril property.
CCI's ex-cat accident year combined ratio remained very strong at virtually the same level
as in the First Quarter a year ago. Drilling down into the CCI lines, the all up, multiple peril,
combined ratio was 96.9 compared to 91.8 in the First Quarter of 2014, with a similar
impact of catastrophes in both periods. Property and marine produced a combined ratio
of 89 in the First Quarter of this year and 89.1 in the same period last year, with a lower
impact of cats this year. The casualty combined ratio for the First Quarter of 2015 was
93.7, which was higher than the 89.7 we reported for the First Quarter last year. But was
more in line with our full-year results for casualty last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

And our workers' compensation combined ratio continued to be outstanding at 84.1,
essentially unchanged from the 84 that we posted in the First Quarter of 2014. In recent
conference calls, we reported to you that in light of the rate increases we had secured
over the past several years, we were increasingly focused on retention, while at the same
time taking advantage of better-priced new business in the market segments we target.
This focus is contributing to our positive growth.
In CCI, First Quarter net written premiums grew 2% to $1.4 billion. Growth, excluding the
impact of foreign currency translation, was about 5%. The multiple peril and property and
marine lines grew at 3% and 1%, respectively, despite the drag from currency. In workers'
comp, which is largely a US business, growth was a strong 11%. But as we have pointed out
in the past, this line can fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter, due to the
presence or absence of a few larger premium accounts.
Lastly, in casualty, net written premiums declined 5%, largely due to the adverse impact of
foreign currency translation, which was slightly higher than the impact on overall CCI
business, due to casualty's higher percentage of business outside the United States in the
First Quarter. Overall, renewal retention for CCI in the First Quarter was 87% in the US.
This is in line with our last three quarters and high by historical standards. Even with this
high retention, we were able to achieve an average written renewal rate increase of 1%
for the US booked. This was a 16th consecutive quarter in which CCI secured rate
increases, amounting to three years on rate on rate. Outside the US, CCI's average
renewal rate increases in the First Quarter were flat to slightly positive.
With respect to new business, we continue to take advantage of our unique expertise in
products and services to target the market segments in which we specialize. In the First
Quarter, in the US, our new to lost business ratio was 1.4 to 1, equal to the ratio in the
Fourth Quarter of 2014. This reflects the high retention rate and solid new business
writings that we believe will meet our performance target. Indeed, the vast majority of our
Page 3 of 25

FINAL

new business was written for customers within our proven niche market. Because we
focus almost entirely on those target market segments where we offer value-added
products and services, as well as unique expertise, winning the business is not exclusively
a price-driven transaction, which in turn helps us generate strong profit margins over time.
Turning now to Chubb Specialty Insurance, we experienced another very strong quarter,
with the combined ratio of 81.9. This is a 7-point improvement over the First Quarter of last
year. Professional Liability, which represents the majority of the CSI portfolio, our
combined ratio of 85.2 in the First Quarter was similar to the 84.6% combined ratio in the
First Quarter of last year. The continued strong underwriting profitability of our
Professional Liability business is a product of our disciplined underwriting, skillful
management of the portfolio's business mix. And culling actions informed by our use of
advanced analytics and predictive modeling. Of course, the compound effect of the rate
increases on our US book, which have exceeded 25% since January 2012, also contributed
to our excellent combined ratio.

Bloomberg Transcript

With respect to growth, Chubb Specialty Insurance net written premiums in the First
Quarter were flat at $621 million. Growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation, was about 4%. Net written premiums of the Professional Liability portion of CSI
were down 1% to $545 million, reflecting growth in the United States and the adverse
impact of foreign currency translation on our business outside the US.
In the First Quarter, we secured average renewal rate increases of 4% for Professional
Liability in the US, just as we did in the Fourth Quarter of last year. The First Quarter was
the 14th consecutive quarter that we achieved Professional Liability rate increases in the
US. Despite our pressing for rate increases, we achieved strong renewal retention of 87%
for that book. In markets outside the US, average renewal rates continued to be flat.
In terms of new business, Professional Liability had another good quarter in the US, with a
new to lost ratio of 1.2 to 1. As the case with CCI, our strong underwriting expertise and
value-added services enabled us to find better quality opportunities in our target markets
following several years of rate increases and underwriting action.
Turning now to the Surety portion of the Specialty book, the combined ratio of 54.8 in the
First Quarter represented a significant improvement over the 2014 First Quarter's
combined ratio of 122.9, which was adversely impacted by a single large loss. Net written
premiums of $76 million were up 6%.
Bottom line, for our CSI business overall, we are very pleased with the strategies we have
implemented and we are well-positioned to continue to grow profitably over time. With
that, I will turn it over to Paul, who will review our Personal Insurance operations and
Corporate-wide claim results.

Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

Thanks, Dino. Chubb Personal Insurance net written premiums increased 2% to $1 billion in
the First Quarter of 2015. Growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation was

FINAL

about 5%. CPI produced a combined ratio of 105.1 in the First Quarter of 2015 compared
to 101.8 in the corresponding quarter last year. The impact of catastrophes on CPI's First
Quarter combined ratio was 18.4 points compared to 11.2 points in the First Quarter of
2014. On an ex-cat basis, CPI's combined ratio was 86.7 in the First Quarter of 2015,
nearly a 4-point improvement compared to 90.6 in the First Quarter a year ago.
For our Homeowners line, premiums grew 1% and the combined ratio was 112.7 compared
to 104.9 in the corresponding quarter last year. Cat losses accounted for 30 points of the
Homeowners combined ratio in the First Quarter of 2015 compared to 17.9 points in the
First Quarter of last year. There were nine US winter storm catastrophe events in the First
Quarter, which affected 29 states and the District of Columbia. The majority of our losses
were from burst pipes and ice damming, most of which occurred in February. While the
damage was widespread across much of the eastern section of the United States, our
New York and New England customers were the most affected.

Bloomberg Transcript

Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the 2015 First Quarter Homeowners combined ratio
was 82.7, a 4.3-point improvement compared to 87 in the same period a year ago. Most
of the improvement is attributable to the fact that fire losses this year were in line with our
five; and 10-year averages. Whereas in the First Quarter a year ago, fire losses were
considerably higher than average. Not surprisingly, the impact of non-cat weather-related
losses in the First Quarter of 2015 was elevated compared to a typical First Quarter;
however, it was slightly lower than the First Quarter a year ago.
During the First Quarter of 2015, we achieved an average Homeowners renewal rate and
exposure increase of 5% in the United States compared to 6% in the Fourth Quarter of
last year. For our Personal Auto line, net written premiums grew 2% in the First Quarter of
2015. The combined ratio was 92.9, compared to an unusually high 101.4 in the
corresponding quarter of 2014. US renewal policy retention in the First Quarter of 2015
was a very strong 89% for both Homeowners and Personal Auto, identical to the Fourth
Quarter of 2014. Net written premiums for other personal, which includes our Accident,
Personal Excess Liability. And Yacht lines, grew 5% in the First Quarter. The combined ratio
for other personal was 92.3 in the First Quarter, consistent with the combined ratio of 92.4
in the First Quarter a year ago.
Turning now to First Quarter claims Corporate-wide, as we announced on April 7, we had
catastrophe losses of $250 million before tax, or 8.1 points on the combined ratio,
compared to $199 million or 6.6 points in the First Quarter of 2014. The $250 million in this
year's First Quarter reflected about $264 million from 2015 cat events, almost entirely
from the ones in the United States, slightly offset by a $14 million decrease in our
estimated losses from catastrophes which occurred in prior years. In the First Quarter of
this year, roughly 80% of the total catastrophe losses were attributable to CPI. And 20%
to CCI.
With that, I will turn it over to Ricky who will review our financial results in more detail.

FINAL

Thank you, Paul. As usual, I will discuss our financial results for the quarter. And I will also
provide an update on the April 1 renewal of our major property reinsurance program.
Looking first at our operating results, underwriting income was $205 million in the quarter.
Property and casualty investment income after tax was down 5% to $264 million, due once
again to lower reinvestment rates in our fixed maturity portfolios. And to a lesser extent,
the impact of foreign currency translation.
Net income was slightly higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized
investment gains before tax of $11 million, or $0.03 per share after tax, including $0.03 per
share from alternative investments. For comparison, in the First Quarter of 2014, we had
net realized investment gains before tax of $116 million, or $0.30 per share after tax,
including $0.14 per share from alternative investments. Unrealized depreciation before tax
at March 31, was $2.9 billion compared to $2.7 billion at year-end 2014. The total carrying
value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $43 billion as of March 31, 2015. The
composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The
average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 4.1 years and the average credit rating is
AA3. We continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company.

Bloomberg Transcript

At March 31, our holding company portfolio had $1.8 billion of investment, including
approximately $470 million of short-term investment. Book value per share under GAAP at
March 31 was $70.33 compared to $70.12 at year-end 2014. Adjusted book value per
share, which we calculate with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, was
$64.75 compared to $65.03 at 2014 year-end. The change in book value per share and
the change in adjusted book value per share for the First Quarter of 2015 both reflected
an adverse impact of approximately $0.77 due to foreign currency translation.
As for loss reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the First Quarter
of 2015 on prior-year reserves by SBU as follows. In CPI, we had approximately $5 million,
CCI had $35 million, CSI had $70 million. And reinsurance assumed had none, bringing our
total favorable development to approximately $110 million for the quarter. This represents
a favorable impact on the First Quarter combined ratio of about 3.5 points overall,
including a favorable impact of prior-year catastrophes of $14 million. For comparison, in
the First Quarter of 2014, we had about $160 million of favorable development for the
Company overall, including $5 million in CPI, $90 million in CCI, $65 million in CSI. And
none in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the First
Quarter of 2014 was about 5.5 points, including a favorable impact of prior-year
catastrophes of $7 million.
For the First Quarter of 2015, our ex-cat accident year combined ratio was 88.9%
compared to 91.7% in last year's First Quarter, an improvement of 2.8 points. During the
First Quarter, our loss reserves decreased by $107 million. The impact of foreign currency
translation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in a decrease in reserves of about
$370 million. And the effective cats with the increased reserves, by $184 million.
Turning to capital management, we repurchased 3.2 million shares at an aggregate cost
of $326 million during the quarter. The average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was
$100.77 per share. At the end of the First Quarter, we had $1 billion available for share
repurchases under our current authorization. And as we said on our last earnings call, we

expect to complete this program by the end of January 2016. In addition, as John
mentioned, our Board raised the quarterly common stock dividend in February by 14% to
$0.57 per share, or $2.28 on an annual basis.
I would now like to say a few words about our reinsurance program. On April 1, we
renewed our major property treaties, including our North American cat treaty, our non-US
cat treaty. And our commercial property for risk treaty. We renewed these programs with
a similar limit structure to what we had in 2014. But with expanded coverage and
improved terms and conditions. The reinsurance market was orderly and there was plenty
of capacity to meet our needs in each treaty. As you might expect, we are an attractive
(sedant). We achieved meaningful savings on all three treaties again this year, with
double-digit price decreases on our two major catastrophe treaties, as well as a high
single-digit price decrease on our commercial property for risk treaty.

Bloomberg Transcript

In addition, in March, we successfully completed our seventh catastrophe bond offering to
replace the maturing cat bond. The transaction was very well received by the market. And
this enabled us to replace the existing limit of $250 million. And expand the perils covered
relative to the expiring arrangement at attractive pricing. Under this new arrangement, we
purchased fully collateralized five-year coverage to supplement our reinsurance program
for our commercial and personal property exposures in the northeast United States,
running from Virginia to Maine. In terms of pricing, the coupon of the new cat bond is
approximately 45% lower than the maturing bond.
Similar to our previous cat bonds, we have an indemnity-based trigger, which means that
our right to collect is based on our actual incurred losses, as opposed to the industry or
index-based losses. We like the diversification that these cat bond arrangements bring to
our overall reinsurance program, especially in our peak zones. Importantly, they provide us
with a cost-effective, fully collateralized alternative to traditional reinsurance, with pricing
locked in for several years. And now, I'll turn it back to John.

John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

Thanks, Ricky. As you can see, the story of the quarter was the harsh winter weather in the
United States, which drove catastrophe losses of $250 million. These cat losses reduced
our operating income by $0.69 per share after tax. Nonetheless, we were still able to
achieve operating income of $1.57 in the quarter, reflecting strong ex-cat performance.
Our ex-cat accident year combined ration was an excellent 88.9%, which is 2.8 points of
improvement over the First Quarter of last year. We are pleased with our ex-currency
growth of 4% in the quarter. In the US, retention rates remained at high levels. And we
were able to achieve renewal rate increases generally in line with the prior quarter. We
also continued to focus on capital management in the quarter, raising our dividend by 14%
and repurchasing 3.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $326 million.
With that, I'll open the line to questions.

We will first go to Josh Stirling from Bernstein.

Q - Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I would love to start the big picture
around pricing. Over the last couple of years, John, you talked a lot about how you
generally conservative underwriters look to try to cover their cost with something like a
3% to 4% assumption for long-term loss trends.
It doesn't always work out that you need all that. But with pricing now more like 1% to 2%
in a lot of places, should we be thinking simplistically that, that means that the business's
margins are going to start to decline, or is really the current business really adequately
priced and at 1% to 2%, you're going to be able run in place and maintain the margins
over the next few years?

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Josh, let's level set. 1% to 2% is CCI. That is a big part of our business. But it's not a
majority of the business. Professional Liability was 4% in the US. Personal lines was 5% in
the US. When you look at it. And if you look now for the 2015 accident year, you are
obviously also getting the benefit of the lag impact of earned premium based on written
premium that was higher in 2014.
So if you look at the 2015 accident year. And then you look at loss trends, which if you
properly stay at 3% to 4% -- 4% is long-term, we've made a point of saying. But those are
mostly macroeconomic that would take into account underwriting action, we believe 2 to
3 points, let's say, 3 points is a more reasonable assumption. If you look at that, I would
say all of our businesses, in net, in the US, we're probably on earned premium basis in the
2015 accident year, a little bit -- margin neutral to slightly margin profit positive.
With CCI, the one you alluded, being margin negative to some degree. But even CCI at
current rates would have a 2-point earned premium. So it would only be slightly negative.
Professional Liability being slightly positive in the US and personal lines being (1 or 2
points). And it's a couple of points, probably positive.
Obviously the challenge is in CCI. But right now it's not a terrible place to be. But overall,
from our overall book, 2015 accident year does not necessarily imply margin contraction. It
could be margin neutral to slightly positive at today's rates in the US. You'll obviously have
to make your own assumption as to where rates are going and that could change it,
although again, you basically have five quarters in of the 2015 accident year already.

That's helpful. I'm wondering if we could just shift gears a little bit. You guys are best
known for your high net worth Homeowners and Personal lines. And some day we all
aspire the yachts so that you guys can insure us. But the question I struggle with, just
because we don't always talk so much about strategy is, when you guys look long term,
what is -- you have a great brand today, your agents love you, you have good products.
And you are the one to beat. But there is a lot of energy and interest and focus targeting
the sector. And I'm curious how you're thinking about either strategies or maybe tactics
that actually maintain your position and really continue to grow that business over time?

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

Josh, this is Paul, I will take a stab your question. First off, we are all anxious to make
enough to get that yacht. And I sure certainly hope you get there soon. I would start out
by just level-setting. There is a lot of energy around the high net worth space amongst a
small handful of competitors here, especially in the United States.
What's exciting people about it is there is real opportunity to differentiate and to also take
market share from regional carriers and from the direct writers. I would estimate that
about 80% of the high net worth space is large direct writers and regional carriers,
oftentimes just by default.

Bloomberg Transcript

Somebody comes out of business school and ends up being with a buddy from high
school who is a local agent and they tend to stay there for 10 or 15, 20 years. They really
don't know what an independent agent can bring to the party and what Chubb Personal
Lines can bring to the party.
So one of the tricks and the energy around us is to have certain campaigns that are trying
to peal people out of the direct writer market. Another is to make certain that we are
working very closely with our agents to educate them so that they speak the language of
the high net worth and the ultra high net worth people.
We are obviously adding to our products, as well. So that we can service them. Clearly, our
international network gives us a huge advantage when it comes to the ultra high net
worth, because as we all know they have homes and they park their yachts in all kinds of
exotic places and that type of thing.
Clearly, the fine art market is another thing. The art schedules are absolutely staggering
for a lot of these families and we have the ability to put together hundreds of millions of
dollars in art coverage on a single phone call. So we have deep expertise when it comes
to appraisal, to preservation. Just for example, we have 17 fine art specialists around the
globe that are working on just helping with our customers preserve their fine art and that
type of thing.
A lot of it is around product. A lot of it is around service. But we are working very hard to
make certain our independent agents have the ability to really sell to these families and
they know how to go out and pry them out of the channels that they are currently not
tapping into.

Thank you, Josh. Good luck with that yacht .

And we'll now go to Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Good evening, everyone. I'm not going to try and get a yacht. I'm actually more
interesting in the mass affluent market. Historically, I've always thought Chubb had a
better positioning there than maybe in ultra high net worth. Can you break down -- there
are two different products and where Chubb is both those products a little bit?

Bloomberg Transcript

And when you think about -- one of your competitors mentioned that in getting new
customers for their high net worth business, that the real opportunity is with people who
were poorly insured by well-known carriers who are not really high net worth carriers. But
when about that, that sounds very mass affluent-like to me, not yachts and paintings.
What is the market opportunity for growth in the two different markets, locally in the
United States and internationally?

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

Thanks, Josh. First off, we break it down a lot. But in three broad swipes. The first is our
signature, which is the ultra high net worth. Then we have our VIP clients and then we
have, what you are referring to as mass affluent. We just call them our regular
Masterpiece customers.
I do think that is where a lot of the market resides that we can take away from the other
channels. I'd tell you that is one of the areas where we believe we have a real distinct
advantage against the other high net worth carriers that are obviously trying to build some
scale there.
But we have had our Masterpiece product vehicle and our back office set up for over 30
years now. So quite frankly, when an agent comes to us with a block or a book of mass
affluent customers, frankly, what is so attractive we have the back office to help them and
can handle that volume. So we really have offerings for those three broad swaths of the
market.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Is the ultra high net worth market under-insured currently, would be my first question? And
two, in terms of the market as a whole, what percentage of the mass affluent market do
you think is with the wrong kind of carrier?

FINAL

As I said, just taking the last piece, Josh, we think about 80% of the high net worth space
is with carriers that don't specialize in the high net worth space. I'm not going to say they
are with the wrong carrier because I think everybody that is not with us is with the wrong
carrier. But we can't service everybody, as you well know.
When it comes to the ultra high net worth and are they under-insured, I would tell you, you
would be surprised how many of them don't, for example, carry more than $5 million in
excess liability coverage. They are always shocked when we sit down with them and talk
to them about our ability to handle tens of millions of dollars in excess liability.
Then when we sit with them and we get them to get their artwork, for example,
independently appraised, that market is absolutely on fire. Depending on their collection,
it's not -- I don't see a week that goes by where somebody isn't bumping up their art
scheduled at least by $10 million to $15 million in value and that is just off their current
collection.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Then I will get off. One last question, with all that going on, I just would imagine that you
would have more growth than we are seeing right now against that backdrop. Do you
think there is a temporary lull or do you think that it's highly competitive? Where is the
growth going to come from?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

When it comes from competition, I always have a hard time distinguishing between highly
competitive, competitive, all the rest. I have been doing this for so long, it's always
competitive, just as a basis for that. The trick for Chubb and the others that are in this
space will be around going after those people that are not in the channel.
Clearly, it's not about just trading accounts within a couple of other carriers and taking
margin out of them. That is where the struggle is United States. Clearly, we are growing in
other places. I would say if you are looking at our overall growth, it was down a little bit but
you have to remember that we are also overseas and currency impacts us on the
Homeowners business, in particularly the Canadian dollar, the British pound and the euro.
And as well the Brazilian real came down. So those currencies all impacted our growth.

Our next question will come from Mike Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.

Q - Mike Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

FINAL

Thanks, just a couple of quick ones. In Personalized, anything unusual in the underlying
there, in terms of loss activity other than --or maybe some of the cat items you
mentioned or weather items you mentioned find their way into the underlying?

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

I would tell you, Mike, that our clean trends overall were fine. Obviously, I'm looking at
them on an ex-cat combined basis. But actually our claims (comp around) slightly
compared to our growth in premiums. So it was really, outside of the weather, as John,
outside of the harsh weather in the winter, it really was a benign loss cost environment
and that is really across-the-board.
I'm not just talking about Homeowners, I'm talking about claims in general. Workers'
compensation new arising claims were down 1%, which is terrific when you look at the
growth in workers' compensation. And our new arise count, all up, were down about 3 to
4 points. So very good results.

Q - Mike Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Do you see a lot of reverse inquiries after periods like this from maybe folks that aren't
your customers or neighbors with folks that are? Do you see that sort of activity, especially
given the concentration of losses here being in your footprint?

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

Absolutely. I can't tell you -- we often joke, gee, we are not big on advertising. But quite
frankly, when I look at the loss costs of this business, that is really where the advertising
happens. Whether it is a hailstorm, whether it's a wildfire, whether it's a winter storm, the
way we bring clients back after, say, a first pipe loss and make them whole to the fit and
finish of what they had pre-loss and somebody -- a standard carrier is bringing in -- giving
them $13 for a roll of wallpaper and we are bringing them back with their woven wallpaper
and the rest of it, it is huge difference and that gets talked up throughout the affluent
communities.

Q - Mike Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. Then one question I have, just bigger picture, on volatility of earnings and these
losses recently. Obviously, there is a benefit to them from a marketing perspective, if you
will. But certainly earnings have been more volatile for you guys than for peers and that
volatility has picked up, again, relative to peers over the last five quarters or so.
Do you think about; is that something that you want to try to get back into line with peers
or look more like either you did before or they do now from that perspective? Or do you
just feel -- are you comfortable with the earnings volatility that you have, even given just
the availability of coverage out there and the relatively attractive cost? Thanks.

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

FINAL

We'd obviously prefer less volatility if we could get. But we're going to be subject a little
bit more given our concentration in the northeast and its being prone to weather
disruptions. Having said that, I hear the talk that we have been surprisingly volatile the last
two years, five quarters, two or three quarters. But the fact was that in 2013 we rent a 3.6
cat load.
In 2014, after an initial 6-point First Quarter. And 10-point first half, 5 points on average in
the year, we ran a 3.6, too. So we really didn't have unduly high cats over the last couple
of years. If you go back a couple of years before that, Sandy and Irene, obviously, which
back-to-back storms like that are unprecedented, cause problems. But we've got a
quarterly blip here or there. But cats have not been unduly burdensome in 2013 and 2014.

Q - Mike Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Yes, I mean, if I look 2009 to 2013, you guys were running about 6 points on average for
that period, similar to a large peer of yours. Since that point, your cat load is running about
50% higher. That's what I'm talking about. It's just that, from point to point, maybe it hasn't
been that pronounced. But certainly over the 1.5 years or change, there has been just a
separation was my point? That's what--?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

It's only run 3.5 points over that period. So I don't know what the industry ran. But it can't
be much, much less than that. If you go back to Sandy and Irene, you can't get away from
the fact we are northeast concentrated. The storms have taken place in the last five to six
years in the Northeast.
They haven't taken place in Florida. There haven't been any storms in Florida. So we have
a little more volatility. But again with we focus on the quarter. And forget that the last
couple of years have not been all that volatile in terms of annual cat load.

Q - Mike Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Dino Robusto

{BIO 15021398 <GO>}

One additional thought there, be careful when you're making comparisons of cat loads
across companies because every company may have a slightly different definition of a
catastrophe. We, as we have said on prior calls, we tend to use the PCS definitions in the
US. Other companies may have their own version of what they are putting in cat. So you
need to be just a little careful with that.

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

The only thing I would chime in here Mike is that other think you have got to keep in mind
is what the bottom line is. And Homeowners, where there is volatility on a quarterly basis,
when we compare our combined ratio to that of the industry over the period 2009 and

Page 13 of 25



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2015-04-23

2013, which includes Sandy and Irene, we were a full 8 points better on the combined
ratio than the industry. So it's really that is another data point you have to keep in mind.

We will now go to Cliff Gallant from Nomura.

Q - Cliff Gallant

{BIO 1854853 <GO>}

I want to turn again back to the high net worth business. And was wondering if you could
comment on your strategy in regard to the commissions you pay your agents. It looks to
me that you're paying something along the lines of 17%. And a lot of your peers --even
those that are focused on that area of business, seems like they are at least 1 point or 2
below that level. But given the product's reputation, the Company's reputation, I would
think that you wouldn't need to pay a higher commission. Could you talk a little bit about
what's the thinking behind that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

Sure, Cliff. First off, I don't know where you're coming up with the comparisons with the
others in the high net worth space. When I look at them and try to compare them on a byline basis because by-lined really matters. For example, we have accident and health
embedded in our Personal Line's other. So when I break them out by line, we are actually
very, very close to what everybody else is paying. But for one carrier who specializes in
Florida and when you write standalone Florida only homeowners, you don't have to pay
that much in commission.

Q - Cliff Gallant

{BIO 1854853 <GO>}

Okay. So you're--?

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

We are very much in line, Cliff, is what I'm saying, bottom line. We're not -- again to your
point, we have got the respected brand. We are the pioneers in this high net worth space.
We have the international network. We have the coverages and the expertise, the ability
to customize, et cetera. Gosh, I would be awful upset with our team if they had to pay
extra commission on top of that to get business.

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

Was there any change in strategy or thoughts following this quarter's impact with currency
on how you think about your businesses or think about running the investment portfolio?

FINAL

A - Ricky Spiro

{BIO 15061279 <GO>}

It's Ricky. I would say broadly no. We like the diversification that we get from having our
international businesses. Paul mentioned we think it is a competitive advantage in a
number of our business lines, as well. We are very thoughtful about how we manage
currency risk.
We match assets and liabilities in the local currencies to try to minimize any potential
currency exposures. I would say, from a strategic standpoint, no change is anticipated. We
are very happy with our international operations and their overall performance.

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

But I would say, while we had an impact on book value and decent sized impact on
revenue, the impact on earnings per share was negligible. It was a couple of cents per
share. It's the price of being overseas. I don't know what the alternative would be.
Currencies go up and down and we want to be overseas, we want to be diversified. I think
most people would think that is a good strategy.

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I didn't mean to imply either way.

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

No. I understand. But I'd be interested in hearing what would be an alternative strategy.
We do not keep undue amounts of investments, assets in foreign currencies. In fact, the
impact on our investment income is relatively negligible. It's (1 point) or something of our
overall investment income. But you do have to keep some assets there.

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

The only thing I could imagine is that would maybe increase or decrease your appetite for
capital allocation one way or the other?

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

No, not currency, unless you thought it was permanent. But it's obviously a more -- it is a
more complicated issue. It might decrease your appetite if the economies of the
countries were poor. And of course, Europe has had some issues. You have issues now
with Brazil in terms of their economy. Currency is part and parcel of it. But if economies
remain strong, we can write business, we can profitable business. It won't change our
strategy.

Company N ame: Chubb L td

An unrelated question. You have a successful piece of your business where you have
outsourced the claims. Maybe you could talk about where you think, outside the obvious
maybe in the personalized business. But in your commercial-sized business, where you
think you should have control over those claims versus places where it's not as important?

FINAL

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

Sure, this is Paul. I would tell you that the area where we typically use third-party
administrators is in the accident and health business. The reality is there. It's oftentimes,
let's say, business travel accident policies will have things like a lost luggage rider on them.
It is just not economically feasible to have a Chubb adjuster sitting in the United States
handling a $5,000 piece of lost luggage.
Quite frankly, these programs are often sold through affinity groups, say a bank credit
card outside the United States. So they are not really looking for the Chubb hand-holding,
empathetic claim experience. The only other place where we really use outside third-party
administrators to any degree would be around large risk management accounts in the
commercial space where they actually request that and they are breaking out their cost
structure that way. I don't know, Dino, if you want to add anything to that?

A - Dino Robusto

{BIO 15021398 <GO>}

No. That is a good description.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

Then there is the occasional loss of a secondary home up in Alaska or something and we - it is just easier for us to use a third-party administrator to go up and look at that type of
claim than to fly somebody up from Seattle. That is -- we have great relationships with
those people and obviously have contracts written up with them, as well. And we have
what we call Chubb business consultants that oversee those individual relationships and
make certain that if we use an outside vendor, that they live up to our standards.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Thank you. One of the other major P&C companies this quarter said that they thought that
the amplitude of the commercial insurance cycle could be less severe going forward. And

Page 16 of 25



Company N ame: Chubb L td

as pricing heads towards negative territory in commercial lines, I'm just wondering if you
would agree with that or if you have a different view?

FINAL

A - Dino Robusto

{BIO 15021398 <GO>}

It's Dino. It is difficult to know what is going to happen. Clearly, there's some things in the
industry that would have you suggest that there is potentially some structural changes to
the cycle: obviously, the low investment returns that you make, some of the increased
analytics that are being used, some of the regulatory scrutiny, et cetera. Clearly, in this last
several years, if you call it a hard market, you really didn't see rate increases the way you
saw them in the last hard market cycle. So hopefully that portends that you're not going to
see large rate decreases. But we will see. We will have to see how the cycle plays out.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Okay. Then my follow-up question is on reserve releases. If my data is correct, it looks like
reserve releases of $110 million in the quarter, even including the benefit of favorable
prior-year cat development, is the lowest level of any quarter in three years. A concern
would be that this reserve release tailwind all of a sudden becomes a headwind. How are
you preparing for that and do you think that is a possible outcome?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

Come at it from both sides. I've said often, Jay, in the past, on calls, especially when
asked about our guidance and what favorable development was implied in it, that we had
no specific levels of favorable development implied. But that over the long run, it seems
hard to believe that we could indefinitely sustain 6 points of favorable development. I
proved generally wrong, although we've had some incremental decline in favorable
development, say, 1.5 points from 2010 to 2014. But that's 6.5 to 5. So it's pretty darn
good.
So pretty robust and it's fair to say the most surprising aspect of our recent overall
reserve development has actually how significantly it has been sustained at such strong
levels. You're right, the First Quarter was 3.5 points. But development can move around
quite a bit in individual quarters without signaling a significant trend. I will give you an
example -- two examples.
Development we experienced in both the Fourth Quarter of 2013 and the First Quarter of
2010 were $100 million to $115 million, very similar to the amount we had experienced in
this year's First Quarter. The same concern could have been raised for those periods. As it
turns out, development rebounded sharply in the ensuing quarters.
So in retrospect these less favorable development quarters turned out to be blips rather
a tipping point in the level of development. I can't say whether or not this will also be true
with development for the balance of 2015. In the end, our reserve development over time
is a function of actual loss experience, which is obviously difficult to predict. But I do think it
could be very premature to draw such a conclusion based on one quarter results.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

I understand it. It just seems, in 2014, seasonally, First Quarter was a bit higher, actually it
was pretty even over the year. But it doesn't seem like there is a seasonal factor there, is
there?

FINAL

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

No. This year, if we got hurt in the short tail lines -- there is a little bit of a season factor to
short-term lines, since they don't last long. The Property, Homeowners lines, you see
more development one way or another in the First Quarter than the Fourth Quarter of
that year and this year, it wasn't -- we had a couple of big losses, it wasn't that positive, it
was negative in fact. And last year it was more positive. So that accounted for a good
amount of the (swing).

Our next question comes from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you. And good evening. Want to follow-up on Jay's question. You mentioned you
had some adverse development in the CCI segments in the quarter. Just wondering if
you can provide a little more detail in terms of the lines that the accident year, as well
what loss trend was actually above your original expectation?

A - Dino Robusto

{BIO 15021398 <GO>}

It is Dino. I will give you a little bit of additional color. In the short sale classes John was just
mentioning, obviously the absence or presence of the few large losses, which can be
lumpy from quarter to quarter, can make a difference as to whether we have favorable
development or adverse development in the quarter.
In this year's First Quarter, a couple of large fire losses that occurred late in 2014 did
swing the Commercial Property development adverse compared with the robust level of
favorable development we had in the First Quarter last year for the Commercial Property
lines. As I stated earlier, the 5-point increase in the ex-cat CCI result was mostly due to
the swing in property development. So that gives you a little bit of a feel for what the
amount actually is.

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

That is on the CCI site. In the other areas, in CPI, most of the favorable development
came from our Personal Auto book, again. The Property lines were not as favorable this
time around. Then in CSI, it was driven mainly, as it has been for the last number of

Page 18 of 25



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2015-04-23

quarters, driven mainly by professional liability. But we also were favorable in Surety as
well.

FINAL

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's great. Then on your guidance, it looks like the First Quarter cat (accounted
Property), by my calculation, probably roughly about 50% of your full-year budget in your
original guidance. I just wonder, is that you didn't change the guidance this time, is that
because your confidence in the remainder of the year, you will catch up, or is it just a
timing issue, you typically update your guidance at the Second Quarter earnings?

A - Ricky Spiro

{BIO 15061279 <GO>}

I'm not sure I can ever say confident about what cats are going to look like. I would say
that one quarter, certainly, as you heard John say, does not a year make. He used the
example, I will use it as well. But last year in the First Quarter, we had over 6.5 points of
catastrophe losses and we ended up the year at only 3.6 points of losses, which were
below our expectations coming into the year.
So we are not revisiting guidance at this time. We are not reaffirming guidance at this
time. As you point out, we normally do relook at guidance at mid-year. And we will
potentially address this then. But at this point, it's way too premature.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay, lastly, if I may, on the reissuance program, looks like the pricing has come down
quite a bit. What is your thought about buying more reinsurance that lowers your limits
and could potentially lower your earnings volatility?

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

What I'd say. And I'd said this on a couple of recent calls, we are always looking at ways to
potentially use reinsurance, if we think it makes sense, to either lower volatility or help our
growth or help our bottom-line results. We are quite comfortable with the reinsurance
program we have today.
We are constantly looking at new ideas. We have put a couple of things in place in some
of our businesses. But we have never been heavy users of reinsurance and we are not
going to change our overall strategy, the way we approach the business. We are generally
growth underwriters and will use reinsurance if we think it helps us. But it is never that
simple to just say it is cheaper today and therefore makes sense. We don't like giving
away profitability if we don't need to.

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

I would say from the First Quarter, there would be no reinsurance program that would
have mitigated our costs. The biggest storm was $150 million. No one in the industry is
carrying first-dollar coverage on reinsurance. That would be extremely expensive. So this
isn't the type of storm or type of cat losses that are usually subject to having reinsurance
coverage on. The storms are not that big.

Thanks, one quick numbers question. The other income line, the K disguised that as
miscellaneous, it was really strong the quarter. Can you talk about what is going on there?

A - Dino Robusto

{BIO 15021398 <GO>}

Not a whole lot that I would point out. We carry in that line a couple of small items, one of
which is equity in the net income of some of our subsidiaries. And frankly, that number
went up a little bit in the quarter. We are not talking large amounts of dollars here so it is
not a very big deal and that does swing from quarter to quarter a little bit.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Also, there was a lot of improvement year-over-year in the other Personal line's
expense ratio. I was wondering if you could explain what happened there?

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

This is Paul. As I mentioned before, this line contains our A&H portfolio. And the expense
ratio will move up or down based on how much more or less A&H business we write in
each period. Since A&H typically has a higher expense ratio. But it obviously has a lower
loss ratio profile than the other CPI businesses.
But then even within the accident business, there can be real fluctuations, driven primarily
by the volume of that affinity accident business that I talked about before, where we are
sourcing through, say, a department store or a credit card issuer, that type of a thing.
Because that's where we have the highest expense ratio in all of our accident business.
Really depending upon the affinity volume within the overall mix of the accident. And then
accident within the other Personal, that is where you see the expense ratio move up and
down a little bit. Bottom line, it came down a little bit because of the movement within
accident. But I wouldn't suggest that, that's a bellwether or a new load that we're going to
be running with in the future.

Brian, we are not going to disclose at the line level. In both Paul and Dino's remarks, they

As I mentioned, we are getting probably flat to slightly positive rate activity. And our

85%, 86%, 87%. It's interesting, the rate has been quite stable actually. It had been
traditionally lower than the increases we were getting in the US. But it has essentially

Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Great. Thanks. My first question was also on some of the (PYD), in particular, in
Commercial. I know you guys said that the combined ratio -- I'm sorry, this is in
Commercial Casualty -- the combined ratio there was a little elevated. But it was in line
with last year. Was there any environmental toxic waste or asbestos type stuff that was in
there this quarter?

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

A small amount. We incurred $1 million of asbestos losses and $5 million of environmental
losses in the First Quarter.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Got it, okay. Then it looked like to me, that underwriting results outside the United States
actually looked pretty strong this quarter relative to where they have been running. And
just curious how much of that you would either consider unusually strong versus -- I know
you guys had taken some underwriting actions there? And also, where did you guys tend
to see the help from that? Was that in Personal lines or Commercial or Specialty?

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

It was reasonably across-the-board. But I wouldn't point to it as the beginning of a trend. It
was a good quarter. Quarters fluctuate. Given the fact we are not getting a sizable
amount of rate overseas, it would be hard to say that it is going to be huge
improvements on trend line basis. Obviously, quarters fluctuate by loss (externals). A lot of
it is luck. We think we have good underwriting in place. But I wouldn't read too much into it.
The last few quarters were a little high, this one was pretty good. We'll see.

Got it. Just one more, bigger picture just on capital return philosophy. Last quarter, you
gave us a share repurchase authorization. It was a little less than last year. You also
indicated you felt good about your excess capital position and you said that the reason
was a little less than last year was you like to be able to move it around maybe based on
where the share price is.
Just curious if Chubb would consider deployment of capital in some other form other than
share repo? And longer-term, along those lines, how does Chubb think about the right
amount of capital that's required to support the risk to this business through the cycle and
how does that compare the way the business is currently capitalized? Thanks.

A - Ricky Spiro

{BIO 15061279 <GO>}

It's Ricky, I will take a shot at answering that. First off, what we said last quarter when we
announced the new share purchase program was that it is in line with what our expected
earnings are for the year, less shareholder dividends. And that is the overall philosophy. It
wasn't the stock price that drove the size of the share repurchase.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have philosophy that we have articulated over the last few years that our intent,
obviously, market conditions and other things all being equal, that our share buyback will in
essence be in line with our earnings less shareholder dividend. That is how we came up
with the size of the program.
We do believe that we are in a very strong excess capital position. We do -- we think a lot
about our deployment of capital and what's the right amount. We think about all the
different types of capital deployment strategies. We are very comfortable with our share
repurchase.
In years past, if you looked at what we've done when we have had more opportunity from
a valuation perspective or others, we might do something slightly larger than our earnings
less dividend. So we're very careful in how we manage it and we are very aware of being
good stewards of our capital for our shareholders.
So we do think about all the different options. I'm not going to comment on which ones
we may or may not think about in the future. I'll also point out, as John mentioned, we
have increased our common dividend for the last 33 years, which is another piece of how
we manage our capital position. So again, in sum, we feel very good about where we are
and the way we approach this and nothing really different than what we have been doing
over a number of years.

Okay, our final question will come from Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

FINAL

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Most of my questions have been answered. Just one quick one, the currency impact, as
you think short-term, the next several quarters, would you expect the impact on
premiums from the stronger dollar to be similar to the First Quarter, stronger or weaker?

A - Ricky Spiro

{BIO 15061279 <GO>}

Obviously, it depends on the comparison of the movement of currency, quarter to
quarter. I would think that in the second and Third Quarters -- remember most of the
currency movement that has happened started in the Fourth Quarter of last year and then
continued into the First Quarter of this year. All other things being equal, currency stays
where it was at the end of March, then you will still see an impact on growth in certainly
the second and Third Quarters.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'm not saying whether it would be similar to what we had in the First Quarter. I don't know.
But certainly there will be an impact. We did, in the guidance that we put out in January,
we did say we expect a 2-point impact for the full year. So maybe that can give you some
help there, as well.
As John mentioned, from an earnings perspective, it doesn't have a very large impact on
a quarterly basis, a couple of cents a share in the First Quarter. Bear in mind, when you
think about the investment income piece, a large part of our after-tax investment income
comes from the municipal bond portfolio here in the US. So it is a slightly disproportionate
impact on investment income in the US.
Last point I would make on book value is, again, if currencies don't change from where
they were at the end of March, which is a pretty big assumption, the impact on book value
will probably be meaningfully less in the Second Quarter than was in the First Quarter. It
won't be zero because we have some of our foreign operations that report on a onequarter lag, which we have highlighted in our 10-K. So there will be an impact. But it
shouldn't be nearly as large as it was in the First Quarter. Hopefully that gives you some
help.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

That's great, Ricky. Thank you.

A - John Finnegan
