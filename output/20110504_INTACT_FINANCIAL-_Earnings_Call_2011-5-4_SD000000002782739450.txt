FINAL

All right thanks, Dennis. This morning we reported First Quarter net operating income of
CAD101 million, or CAD0.91 per share, a solid start for the year but down slightly from the
particularly strong CAD0.95 per share a year ago.
Continued positive results from our actions led to a very good performance in the quarter
with an underwriting proﬁt in all lines of business. Overall our combined ratio of 94.6%,
up from last year's exceptional 93.2%, reﬂects more normal weather patterns and higher
catastrophe losses.
Net income for the quarter was CAD157 million, or CAD1.42 per share, up 19% from last
year bolstered by higher investor gains. Mark will expand on these gains in a few
moments.

Bloomberg Transcript

From a top-line perspective, the 3% increase in our premiums is not a pace with which
we're satisﬁed. But it does not indicate an overall slowdown in our growth strategies. The
current pace reﬂects solid growth in our personal property and commercial businesses,
both of which grew at 5% partly oﬀset by our continued disciplined approach to new
business in Ontario auto, our largest market.
We maintain our commitment to organic growth initiatives and intend to leverage the
beneﬁts of improved industry pricing conditions, primarily in personal lines. It is my
expectation that we can return to an overall growth rate in the mid-single digits by the fall
but, as our results continue to illustrate, we're a disciplined shop that emphasizes growth
in the bottom line over growth in the top line.
Overall our underwriting performance and steady investment income resulted in an
operating ROE of 14.8% for the last 12 months and an ROE of close to 18%, even with our
more than CAD780 million in excess capital.
Our book value per share increased 11% from a year earlier to CAD26.91. This is evidence
that our strategies and action plans are working.
Our outlook for the P&C Insurance industry is largely unchanged from what we
communicated last quarter. 2010 very much played out as we had anticipated. The
industry recorded mid-single digit premium growth in auto driven by Ontario, upper
single-digit growth in personal property in reaction to years of heavy water related losses
and more frequent and severe storms and low single-digit growth in commercial lines. We
expect more of the same this year, which should translate into a growth rate for the
industry in the mid single-digit range.
From an underwriting perspective, the industry ended 2010 with a combined ratio close
to 101%. For 2011 we anticipate some improvements in personal lines resulting from auto
reforms in Ontario as well as continued premium increases in personal property. But do
not foresee the industry's earnings improving materially.

FINAL

Looking at the industry's ROE, we do not expect much improvement in the near term from
the 7% level that it recorded in 2010. Although underwriting might improve slightly at the
industry level, we anticipate that this would be oﬀset by the negative impact on
investment income from the low yield environment for industry players.
Looking speciﬁcally at Intact Financial, I'm very conﬁdent that we will out perform the
industry's ROE by more than our stated objective of 500 basis points in 2011. Speciﬁcally
for Ontario, while the true eﬀectiveness of the reforms will not be known for several
months, we remain cautious but increasingly optimistic that the beneﬁts of the reforms
will materialize. It is important to reiterate, however, that the reforms were not intended to
address the degree of fraud that became apparent in the last year. That's why, as a
Company, we're constantly reﬁning our fraud containment measures well beyond what
the reforms were meant to accomplish.
We've stated in the past that a key diﬀerence with the recent reforms was to the
government's commitment to an ongoing review rather than a ﬁve-year increment review.
This is something that is quite positive to us and this was clearly illustrated roughly six
months in the latest reform, as the late March Ontario budget included steps to further
reduce fraud including new rules to insure that treatments are provided as invoiced and
the creation of an industry anti-fraud task force.

Bloomberg Transcript

We estimate that the combined ratio of the industry in that province is still well in excess
of 110% and that premiums remain inadequate. As such, level of approved rate changes
for the industry announced in the past two quarters is a positive sign but does not fully
address the inadequacy in the system. Outside of Ontario conditions remain stable.
Pricing conditions in commercial lines remain soft, although we've beneﬁted from ﬁrmer
prices in the past 12 to 18 months in a number of segments where we operate. Empirical
evidence in the quarter continues to highlight that our focused approach is paying oﬀ in
our commercial P&C business. We're able to grow units 2% in conjunction with putting
through over 2% higher rates while our reported top-line growth was close to 4%.
In conclusion, the strong performance we delivered throughout 2010 prevailed again
during the early months of this year. The strong results of our home and commercial
insurance activities during the quarter conﬁrm the sustainability of our action plans. The
performance of our personal auto insurance portfolio remains robust as we maintain our
disciplined approach to managing growth in Ontario and continue to deploy eﬀective
initiatives to counter the high prevalence of fraud in that province.
Given the quality of our operational platforms and the ﬂexibility provided by our strong
ﬁnancial position, we believe that we will continue to out perform the industry and
strengthen our leadership position.
With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mark Tullis.

FINAL

Thanks, Charles. Today we announced solid First Quarter operating results with a 12month trailing operating ROE of 14.8%. The book value continues to grow, up 11% from a
year ago. Top-line growth of 3% was healthy in most lines of business and earned
premium growth reached 5%.
Underwriting results showed a combined ratio of 94.6%, only 1.4 points above last year's
exceptional results. This year less favorable weather was oﬀset by beneﬁts, both from
Ontario auto reforms and from our aggressive anti-fraud measures. Annualized favorable
prior year development of 7.9% was in line with last year and above our long-term average
of 3% to 4%.
Most of the excess was due to development and short tailed lines of business on the heels
of a mild December. Also, other things being equal, First Quarter should have a
somewhat higher level of prior year development since all of the development from prior
quarters is attributed to the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Slides nine and 10 show results by lines of business. In personal auto, top-line growth
slowed to 1%, as we maintain a prudent approach to new business until we see that
Ontario auto reforms unfold as expected. Our disciplined approach to Ontario auto
market, including our focus on managing fraud, has led to a signiﬁcant loss ratio out
performance versus the industry, which accelerated to more than 15 points in 2010.
Overall the combined ratio remains stable at 97.7%.
In personal property, top-line growth continues to reﬂect low double-digit premium
increases, partly oﬀset by a 1.5 point drop in units. We have increased our segmentation
initiatives in the past 12 months and we are comfortable losing unproﬁtable business. In
fact, the retention is highest for the most proﬁtable customers.
The combined ratio of 92.3% was strong but trailed last year's unusually strong 87.8% due
to more normal weather conditions. Although our action plan has delivered the targeted
results, we will continue eﬀorts to outperform the industry in this line of business including
claims management, product changes and rate actions. In 2010 we outperformed the
industry in personal property by almost two points, the best result since 2004. And we are
hoping to further expand this advantage in the period to come.
Commercial auto business reported solid results in the quarter, both from a top-line and
bottom-line perspective. Premiums and units each increased 7%, while the combined ratio
of 91.7% was strong, improved from last year's 95%.
Commercial P&C premiums increased 4%. While market conditions remain very
competitive for new business, retention rates are solid and rate increases averaged 2%.
Underwriting income of CAD19 million was in line with last year, as the combined ratio
remains strong at 89.9%.

FINAL

On the investment side, we generated about CAD73 million in net interest and dividend
income. We expect this level of investment income to continue in the near term, as
growth in invested assets is likely to continue to be largely oﬀset by the impact of the low
yield environment.
We recorded net investment gains of CAD84 million excluding debt securities carried at
fair value through P&L compared to gains of CAD44 million in Q1 of last year. The bulk of
the gains resulted from our annual First Quarter rebalancing and also the normal quarterly
rolling of our common share portfolio. This was magniﬁed by continuing strong capital
markets and the unrealized gain position of the portfolio.
The adoption of IFRS did not have a meaningful impact on our operating results. Slide 12
illustrates that for the full year 2010, the impact on a per share basis was only CAD0.03.
The larger impact on 2010 EPS and ROE is due to realized gains on assets whose values
were restated upon transition to IFRS.
Slide 13 highlights the impact of IFRS on our ﬁnancial position. As previously
communicated, book value was reduced as IFRS requires accumulated actuarial pension
losses to be charged to retained earnings upon transition. This resulted in a CAD0.90 per
share hit to equity. There was also a reclassiﬁcation of CAD228 million of unrealized losses
from OCI to retain earnings pertaining to retroactive equity impairments, which would
have occurred prior to 2010 under IFRS rules.

Bloomberg Transcript

As previously communicated, this re-class had no impact on book value or excess capital
but does improve our unrealized gain position.
As shown in slide 14, we ended the quarter in a strong ﬁnancial position with
approximately CAD784 million in excess capital after returning CAD122 million in the form
of share buybacks during the quarter. The ratio of debt to total cap at 14.4% remains
below our target ratio of 20%. With over CAD1 billion in excess capital and additional
debt capacity, we have plenty of room to return capital to shareholders while retaining the
ﬁnancial ﬂexibility to pursue strategic growth opportunities.
In summary, we remained well positioned through continued focus on operational
excellence. We intend to leverage our strengths and to take advantage of opportunities in
the market.
With that, I will now turn the call back to Dennis.

Questions And Answers

Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

(Operator Instructions) Your ﬁrst question comes from the line of Tom MacKinnon with
BMO Capital.

FINAL

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Question or two quick questions here. The ﬁrst is on the favorable development in the
quarter and, as I understand at what Mark said, it was largely due to, in short term, due to
some of the mild weather in December and the First Quarter generally being higher than
other quarters really because it all relates to the prior period. Now, ﬁrst of all am I correct
in that? And secondly if -- is there a possibility that the trend could run somewhat above
your long-term average going forward if Ontario auto turns out to be a little bit more
favorable than expected or if actually Ontario auto just turns out to be kind of as expected
and would seem to suggest your somewhat optimism there and I have one follow up.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Okay why don't I start with that one, Tom? First of all, your understanding of what Mark
said is correct. If you looked at the past ﬁve or six years First Quarter favorable
development, it's been slightly above the long-term average. The second thing that is
worth talking about in the First Quarter favorable development is that there's been no
change in actuarial assumption to lead to that favorable development. This is just how
claims have developed.

Bloomberg Transcript

A big chunk of the favorable development was short-term or short-tail driven. Therefore,
these are reserves that we've set up three/four months ago that have been released in the
quarter. So in my view a pretty good quarter from a favorable development point of view.
The second part of your question is Ontario. I think that's a really good question from my
point of view. I mean it's pretty clear with regards to Ontario that we are prudent and you
picked up very clearly that we're increasingly optimistic and I would say that our
optimism, as it is early, is not fully reﬂected or is not fully reﬂected in our position in
reserving. The range is pretty wide. I would say that our actuaries are cautious. So it is not
impossible that the favorable development be slightly above the long-term average in the
near term. I'd go as far as that at this point and I think as the year progresses we'll get
certainly some more clarity on that.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay thanks for that and then the quick follow-up, the tax rate on the operating side,
Mark, may seem to be a little higher than I think than the run rates and is there any kind of
one-time stuﬀ in there and how should we look at that?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Sure so I think other things being equal you would have expected a drop. The statutory
rate dropped about two points from last year to this year and because we could pay zero
on the dividends that would result in about a 1.5 point drop in the blended rate and in fact
the rates went up a bit from about 23% to 24% and that's basically all noise. We had true
ups last year in the First Quarter and true ups this year in the First Quarter that went the

Page 6 of 15



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2011-05-04

opposite direction and you can consider about half, kind of split the diﬀerence and you'd
get the idea sort of what more to expect on an ongoing basis.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

FINAL

I mean I'm looking in the past that rate was probably closer to 20%; is that how we should
be looking at that rate or even just slightly below that?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Yes. So I'm looking at I think in First Quarter the rate last year was around 23% and this
year it was a little more than 24% and again this is blended with dividends. I think if you
take out the noise last year it might have been 24.25/24.5% and this year if you take the
noise out the 24% might go down to 23%.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

All right but, again, the big thing you need to remember is the dividends are going to
have much more eﬀect quarter-to-quarter on the blended rate than this kind of stuﬀ.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

So this -- that rate you're quoting is that include the dividends or is it exclude the
dividends?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Include, yes, yes.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay thanks very much.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Because the statutory rate again is in the 28% range.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Right great.

FINAL

On the automobile direct premium written growth of 1%, presumably when you say you're
cautious about Ontario auto it's really the Greater Toronto Area but perhaps I'm wrong. I
guess my question is what would the direct premium written growth be excluding either
Ontario or GTA, whichever way you want to phrase it?
Related to that, what gives you the conﬁdence now to start writing more business where
you've been more conservative in the last six to nine months? Is it the optimism on the
reforms that you cited earlier?
And lastly, how much visibility do you have that you indeed should be back to mid singledigit premium growth by later this year in that line of business?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

There are many parts to your question. We don't want to quote growth by province here
so I think we'll skip the ﬁrst part of your question. Let me talk about why -- so you're right.
The GTA is where we've been more cautious and if you look at our advertising presence it
all but disappeared in the GTA nine months ago.
And so one has to understand, if you look at the nuts and bolts of marketing and
advertising, there is a time lag between the moment where you decide to crank things up
and the moment where you have ads on TV and billboards established. I mean, there can
be up to six months time lag. So we've made those marketing and advertising calls earlier
last year and therefore, as we see signs now, we are about to ramp up and started to ramp
up in the province in general, more carefully in the GTA but there's a lag there because
before this will have an impact.
The signs that we're seeing and they are on many fronts, we're seeing that what the
reforms were meant to bring is actually happening, whether it's the number of claims and
the minor injury category, the assessment cost and so on, things are panning out as we
anticipated from the reforms' perspective.
We're also seeing signs that are positive as a result of the action plans that we've
established internally to ﬁght fraud and I would say more important from my perspective
than what the reforms have been and will be doing quite frankly and I think that, as the
weeks and months evolve if we see stability in what we've observed today, it will give us a
greater comfort to crank things up even in the GTA later this year. And I would say that we
have started to crank things up a bit outside the GTA where we had slowed down in the
past few months and when I look at what my team is anticipating in the coming months,
that's where I am coming from where I see that I expect we'll have slightly better growth in
the fall.

Q - Andre Hardy
Okay let me rephrase perhaps the ﬁrst part of the question and ask it this way. If the
industry is growing auto premiums in the 5% range, which correct me if I am wrong is a
rough number, the under performance at Intact is it driven basically entirely by the
caution in Ontario or is there more than that?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

It's in large part the caution in Ontario.

Q - Andre Hardy

FINAL

Thank you for all that detail.

Operator
Paul Holden, CIBC.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

First question is related to Alberta, the rate for their recently announced that they intend
to change to ﬁle an approved system, how do you view that potential change? And based
on your discussions with the Rate Board, do you have any sense of the timing of that
change?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

Well the Rate Board there has been promoting this approach for the past two years and
that comes from discussions that we've had with governments over the course of the last
three, four years so, from our perspective this is positive that there would be more
ﬂexibility in the way rates will be adjusted by individual companies in that market. And in
terms of timing, it's diﬃcult at this stage to see if it needs to go through government to be
changed and I think this has been on the table for a few years already so from my
perspective it's not imminent.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay got it. Second question relates to commercial auto saw a nice increase year-overyear in terms of written insured risks, sort of what are you doing in that market to grow
your market share?

A - Byron Hindle

{BIO 16343039 <GO>}

The ﬁrst thing I would like to point out is the commercial auto segment is somewhat
diﬀerent from the private passenger automobile. We have generally much greater
proportion of the risk would have collateral beneﬁt and it has historically performed very
proﬁtably in virtually all of our market segments so it's a very proﬁtable line of business
and we have been reﬁning our pricing and our segmentation right across our portfolio
over the last 18 months to try to position ourselves more competitively to pick up our
growth proﬁle in this very proﬁtable market. And I think what we see is that we are gaining
success from that approach.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Then last question maybe for Charles if you can provide us a little bit of update what
you're seeing on the M&A front. Do you think there's today do you see more potential for
transactions versus say six months ago or 12 months ago?

(Operator Instructions) Doug Young, TD Newcrest.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Just wanted to go back to the reserve development question and I guess maybe bigger
picture, I mean you've been running above your historical average for some time and I am
just curious is there a structural way that you're running your business today that's
diﬀerent than before that would mean that that ratio, that reserve development, would be
above that or would continue to run above the 3% to 4% historical average?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No, Doug, I don't think so. I think that we're doing lots to improve our performance in
general and we're cautious from a reserving point of view to reﬂect the fruits of the action
plans that we're taking until we're comfortable that those actions are sustainable but
beyond that there's nothing that has changed structurally that would lead to a diﬀerent
outcome and, Mark, maybe you want to add.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Let me just -- if you look back over the past few years frequently in Q1 we talk a lot about
prior year development so last year we had a lot. I think the year before it went the other
way. Keep in mind in Q1 we're reporting as prior year development all the development
from the reserves that we set up three months ago, whereas in a typical quarter that
would be ﬂushed out in the current year results. So there tends to be -- it's more reﬂective
if you have a good immediate quarter there tends to better development.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Okay so I guess you wouldn't be surprised as we move two, three, four years down the
road that this does migrate back to the 3% to 4% as you get more comfort with the action
plans that you've taken and the industry environment in general? Is that a way to read it?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes I think that that's a way to read it, Doug, yes.

Okay going to just the commercial insurance side, I guess you're not expecting signiﬁcant
price increases over the near term and correct me if I am wrong. That's the way that I read
your comments. But you are starting to grow in diﬀerent segments and so I am just
wondering what are the segments where you're seeing opportunities to grow and are you
starting to grow -- are you starting to get more comfortable going into that mid market
where there is that huge opportunity to grow but you can wait in until price rationality
gets the -- improves? Are we getting to that point at this stage?

A - Byron Hindle

{BIO 16343039 <GO>}

Doug, I think the -- we do approach this on a very segmented basis so we are, as you say,
picking up some growth in the P&C portfolio but it is very segmented. There are certain
markets in the western part of the country, which are quite attractive, performing very well
and we are growing into those markets. There are other markets and I could cite the farm,
realty, restaurant, which are more challenged and these would be markets where we are
actually shrinking our unit base, even as we grow the portfolio overall. So it's very much a
selected approach to the growth that we are achieving.
We do not see a hardening in rates beyond the 2% to 3% that we're able to with our
pricing techniques implement in the marketplace over the next number of months. But
those increases that we do implement are focused exactly where we think we can beneﬁt
from them most. So they are focused on actually controlling our proﬁtability and our
growth in some the more challenged market segments.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think, Doug, with regards to mid sized business per se, as we've talked about in the
previous quarters, there are a number of things that we've done. We've worked on the
product. We've worked on the expertise. We beefed up our loss control units from coast
to coast. That is the inspection folks that bring a fair bit of value add there. We've aligned
ourselves better with brokers that are very strong in the mid market business and, as such,
we've seen that segment expand faster than the small segment so, while it is a smaller
portion of our portfolio, we've seen an expansion of about 11% while our commercial P&C
book is growing at 5%.
I think Byron approaches it from a pricing point of view because the core of our growth
strategy at this point in time is to be very, very targeted in that segment and to ﬁnd those
pockets of proﬁt where demand is there and pricing is adequate. And I think we'd rather
not necessarily lay out what those speciﬁc segments are during the call, rather keep that
for ourselves and our brokers for now.

A - Byron Hindle

{BIO 16343039 <GO>}

And in the growth that we are achieving in the mid market, the 11% premium growth in Q1
versus the year ago, Doug. This is growth that is achieved with the same disciplined
approach so we are providing our underwriters the tools so that they see the proﬁtability
of the business as they're quoting on it and there are tolerances that -- and guidelines that
they would follow when they are pursuing the winning of the business and we monitor
this very closely to ensure that we are, in fact, adhering to our guidelines.

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And let me add maybe a bit of color so you visualize what we're talking about. We've
seen signs of change in the market. We went from rate decreases to rate increases but we
sit still very competitive. It's still very competitive in the mid-sized market. The demand for
quotes is up north of 50%. Our overall growth in that segment is nowhere near the sort of
level that the demand for quote would generate because our ability to close, our ability to
sell on these quotes is still low and to me that's a sign that the market is still very
competitive. But there certainly is a fair bit of increased interest for what we have to oﬀer,
product, service.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

And maybe just on the commercial side, obviously there's been quite a few disasters of
late. Byron or Charles, when you chat with your industry competitors out there is there a
sense that the pricing rationality or increases could pick up momentum as a result?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well let me ﬁrst say, Doug, that we don't chat with our competitors, period. And let's have
Byron explore the impact that those disasters have had on the reinsurance marketplace,
which could be an additional trigger for a better environment from a pricing point of view.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Byron Hindle

Doug, the Q1, as we have all read I think in the press, has been a very challenging one
from a world perspective in terms of the catastrophes in Australia, in New Zealand and
most recently, in Japan. So these are signiﬁcant. I think there was a survey done just in late
last month of the 35 largest reinsurance companies in Canada by one of the brokers who
has found that these losses are equivalent to about 8% of their insurer shareholder fund
base. So they're signiﬁcant. And but it's at this point it's kind of early for us to say that this
is going to trigger a hardening in rates. Certainly the industry is more vulnerable to
continuing high levels of catastrophes than it was at the beginning of the year. So we're
just going to watch this. It's a little early for us to make a call on that.
But in our case, Intact, we buy catastrophe reinsurance in world markets and it's -- we
want to take a close look at what's happening in those world markets. We buy about
CAD60 million worth of cover each year. That works out to about 1.25% of our premium
base so it's not a huge impact but it's one that we monitor.

This would not move the needle from a reinsurance cost point of view for us. I think that's
point number one. I think point number two, as Byron says, if you look at the big
reinsurers a big chunk of capital was taken out in the quarter. We say 8%. I mean it is quite
meaningful so it would be surprising that there would be no impact in global rates going
forward but it is early to conclude, as Byron is saying.

Okay and just one last one and I'll re-queue. The OSFI obviously put out a discussion
paper, the potential impact 14 points on the MCT. I know it's not signiﬁcant for you guys,
given your capital position but are there any updates on that front? Thanks.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Yes they're due -- they've been continuing negotiations. I was at an industry conference
with a lady from OSFI. I think it was a week and a half ago now. OSFI have been further
considerations after that. I think the ﬁnal numbers that come out will be signiﬁcantly
improved from the 14.0 number and there continue to be discussions on that.
I think the other thing to keep in mind, Doug, those kind of numbers assume no other
adjustment so, to the extent there's -- you can measure what it is assuming no other
adjustments but obviously there will be -- people will react as a result.

Morning, just one question again on Ontario auto, you mentioned that you're increasing
your focus, your initiatives on anti-fraud. I think with your scale and I guess and the size a
lot of other competitors probably don't have the ability to do that kind of focus or put in
initiatives. Do you expect this will give you a competitive advantage over the next two to
four years?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well that's the objective. I think there is obviously improving our bottom line in absolute
terms but clearly maintaining or expanding our advantages is important in that thought
process so I think a focus on program that uses our size in executing quickly and
eﬀectively on that program is I would say a big focus of the organization at the moment
and I am quite optimistic about what I've seen so far. I think when you look at automobile
Ontario our out performance is pretty big right now and partly because we've moved
faster from the pricing point of view so I see this fraud program as a way to maintain or
expand our out performance as our competitors catch up from a pricing point of view
over time. And Martin, anything that you want to add?

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

I think it's complete.

I'm not trying to nitpick too much but when I read your MD&As for the last two or three
quarters you mentioned improvements 18 months, 18 months, 18 months. I am not sure if I
am just -- I mean, is it taking longer for the improvements to roll in or is it it's the timing is
a little bit uncertain?

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Are you talking about home?

Q - Stephen Boland

{BIO 5546446 <GO>}

I believe there's something in the MD&A just about the outlook should see improvement
in 18 months, in Ontario auto I thought it was so is that -- is it still -- is it meeting I guess
your time line in terms of seeing improvements?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I'll let Martin comment on that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Well the reforms are -- have kicked in on September 1st so it will take 12 to 18 months for
these reforms to fully be reﬂected in terms of the procedural changes that were eﬀective
immediately but also the coverage that is being changed and that applies only at renewal
so it will take at least that period for the full policy portfolio to be aﬀected by the reforms
and then the changes that are expected from the claim savings to be -- will then be within
reach for the insurers.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

But I think getting back to the 18 months I was wondering where that was coming from but
indeed you're right. This is the case. The fact that the policy is 12 months, policies need to
renew. It will take 18 months. There is nothing at this point that would lead us to say that
the improvements will not have materialized over that period. I think bottom line is that
the signs we're seeing are positive or prudent about those signs.

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

And it takes a bit of time for the signs to become credible so that's why we're not yet
conﬁrming well, all of this is materializing but that what we see is very positive.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

There is nothing that would lead us to retract from statements we've made in the past, on
the contrary.

Q - Stephen Boland

{BIO 5546446 <GO>}

Okay thanks, guys.
