{BIO 16685171 <GO>}

Okay. I think we can start. So. Good afternoon or good morning to all of you here in the
room. But also on the webcast. Welcome to our full-year 2013 earnings presentation with
the management team of AXA. So here with us today is Henri de Castries, our Chairman
and CEO of the Group; Denis Duverne, our Deputy CEO; and Gerald Harlin, our Group
CFO.
The management team will go through the presentation and then a Q&A will -- a Q&A
session will follow. I think, Henri, I can hand over to now.

Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

Thank you, Mattieu. Good afternoon, everybody. It's good to be here and to see the
ﬂoods receding.

So let's start quickly. And then I hand over to Denis. The 2013 has been a very strong year
for us, as you've seen in the numbers. And as you will see in more details now.

FINAL

Underlying earnings are up 18%, which puts us in a very comfortable situation when we
look at the middle-term goals of Ambition AXA. Adjusted earnings are up 20%. It's
slightly more than underlying earnings because of the realization of capital gains at the
top of the range we had in mind.
Last. But not least, the free cash ﬂows or the operating free cash ﬂows of the Group are up
12%. So a strong performance from an operating standpoint.
This translates into a good growth in the earnings per share, 10%, at the top of the range
we had set for Ambition AXA, which is 5% to 10%. We are at 10%. And if you look at what
has been the average growth rate since the beginning of the plan, it's 6%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Adjusted earnings per share are the base for the dividend, are up 12%. And this puts us in
a situation where the Board is recommending to the shareholders meeting to pay an
EUR0.81 dividend, which means a 40% payout ratio, within our -- I mean, the -- within the
range we have set, which is between 40% and 50%. We think that being there is
reasonable for the middle long term.
Balance sheet -- strong and healthy. The Solvency II ratio is above 200%. You have to
notice that we have slightly changed the way we computed when compared to last year,
because we now take out the dividend we are going to pay in a few months. So all things
equal, it's an increase by 7 points when compared to last year.
There, too, we are very comfortable with the implementation of Solvency II, even if a lot of
details remain to be discussed as far as the implementation measures are concerned on
the regulatory side. The approval of our internal model is on track. And, well, it's going to
go along for most of this year.
The second regulatory front which is important for us is the discussion surrounding the
GC fees. We are one of the nine designated systematic insurers. I'm not sure we fully
understand what it means. But we have been designated. And we are, of course, in
discussions on the basic capital requirements, which are going to be imposed to these
nine insurers. And are very comfortable that our level of capital will enable us to absorb
that. There are uncertainties around the process. But we feel comfortable.
If you look at the gearing -- and this is one of the new elements for this presentation -- you
will remember that the target we had set was a target of 25%. At the end of 2013 we were
at 24%. And we are now changing the target and indicating a range of 23% to 25%.
So the ﬂoor has become a ceiling. Why so? Because we think that in this world it's better
to be slightly cautious and navigating between 23% and 25% seems to us to be the right
thing to-- the right thing to do.

FINAL

A few words on the implementation of Ambition AXA. You remember the three pillars -selectivity, acceleration, eﬃciency. Selectivity was meaning or is still meaning a better use
of the capital we deploy. And more selectivity in the business we are doing, mostly in the
mature countries. And if you look at what we've been doing since 2010 in the mature
countries, we have disposed businesses or extracted capital for EUR8.5 billion, which
have been either redeployed to emerging markets or used to decrease the leverage.
This has not aﬀected the earnings, because in between the earnings in the mature
markets gone from EUR3.7 billion to EUR4.2 billion. This has not aﬀected the growth, since
the growth has been modest but real during years where the markets were poor and the
economy bad.
The business mix has improved in mature markets, along the lines we had set at the
beginning of the exercise. Protection and health has been growing at 7% a year. Unitlinked has been growing at 8% a year. The direct revenues in P&C have been growing at
6% a year. And the combined ratio has been decreasing by 5 points over the period.

Bloomberg Transcript

What has been decreasing is the portion of the general account in the total of the
business, which was what we intended to do, for the reasons you all know, which were
less attractiveness for the customers and lower margins for us. We will see that later.
So high growth markets now, which was the second pillar. Have we accelerated? If you
look at what the top-line growth and the bottom-line growth, they have been pretty
strong. The earnings growth has been approximately 28% on a compounded basis,
whereas the top-line growth has been 17% in life and 15% in P&C, 2 points behind that. It's
a source of acceleration for the growth. And it's not investing in a black hole, since
earnings have progressed faster than revenues.
These are countries where we can extract very decent margins. And even if there is a
relative slowdown from their economies these days, since we are long-term investors, we
remain very conﬁdent that this is going to be very attractive for us for a long time.
We think that we have now mostly bridged the footprint gap we had. We have strongly
reinforced the operations we have in Asia, one of the elements having been the deal we
made with HSBC to buy their P&C activities in the region, another example being the
acquisition in 2013 of 50% of Tian Ping, the Chinese property casualty insurer, who has a
license to operate in automobile insurance in the world of China, China having become
the ﬁrst automobile market in the world.
The Chinese are buying 19 million cars a year, 10 times what is bought in the French
market, more than 10 times what is bought in this market. And most of it being the ﬁrst
equipment of the households buying these cars. So no insurance before. Therefore, it's a
great source of growth.
What else should I say? We have also expanded the footprint in Latin America with the
acquisition of Colpatria, the 51% of Colpatria, a large Colombian insurer. Colombia is a
large market. It's far away from here. But it's nearly 50 million inhabitants with a very fastPage 3 of 30

FINAL

growing middle class and a well-managed country, very attractive for us. We hope this is
going to produce good earnings going forward.
Last point, last pillar of Ambition AXA, eﬃciency. We had set a goal of EUR1.5 million of
eﬃciency savings over the -- EUR1.5 billion, sorry, of eﬃciency savings over the period. We
have already delivered EUR1.1 billion. We have been increasing the target -- sorry, EUR1.2
billion. Yes, rounding up. We have increased the target to EUR1.7 billion and are very
comfortable that we will achieve it.
This doesn't mean that we are not going to invest into our future. Denis will comment with
you slightly later the investments we are doing to face digital and big data, which we think
are going to be great opportunities for us.
What are the levels of this increased eﬃciency? Increasing the eﬃciency of the
distribution. We are proud of the proprietary networks we have. We are proud of the
relationships we have with our distribution, even when it's not proprietary. But we
recognize that it's an expensive one. So increasing the eﬃciency of this distribution is an
important point, has been in the last years, is going to remain an important point going
forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second point -- improving the operational performance. I think everybody does that.
There is nothing speciﬁc there.
Last but not -- sorry, third point, we have to oﬀset the increase in IT investments, which are
coming from the necessity to face digital and big data, by a reduction in the ordinary IT
expenses. So make the diﬀerence between investments and maintenance. And there,
because of all the legacy systems, we have a signiﬁcant burden which we intend to
reduce further.
Last. But not least. And also a very classical point, how to leverage better the procurement
savings. We've been doing signiﬁcant eﬀorts over the last years. No reason to see them
stopping going forward. So signiﬁcant levers.
And now I'm going to hand over to Denis. And to make the exercise easier for him,
everything has disappeared.

Denis Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Thank you, Henri. Good afternoon, everyone. So I'll go into more details of our plan,
Ambition AXA, starting with the ﬁnancial objectives on page A13, underlying earnings per
share, we had set out a target of 5% to 10% compound annual growth. This year, we
achieved 10%. So at the high end of the range. And cumulatively, we are at a growth of
6%.
Group operating free cash ﬂow, Henri mentioned the EUR5.2 billion. We've been able to
increase our free cash ﬂow by EUR500 million a year. And if you do the math, it seems
Page 4 of 30



Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity
Date: 2014-02-21

that the EUR24 billion of cumulative free cash ﬂow for 2015 will be achieved.

FINAL

Adjusted ROE, 13% to 15%, we achieved 14.8% this year, which is close to the high end of
the range. And that gearing, I will not belabor that point, since it was covered by Henri
just a minute ago.
Selectivity -- going into more details on the Life and Savings side, we had indicated that
we would focus a lot more on protection and health and on unit-linked. This is happening.
You see that over the period, we've moved the protection and health business from 31%
of our new business to 39% in three years. The margin has kept going up. It's at 59% NBV
margin.
We continue to invest less, or our customer invest less in general accounts savings. Our
margin has gone up, because interest rates have gone up. It's 11%. But that represents
only 14% of the business.
Unit-linked was a good year in 2013. Unit-linked sales went up by 14%. And this represents
34% of the new business, with a margin of 26%.
And ﬁnally, mutual funds and other, 12% of the total. This is mainly in the US and the UK.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the P&C side, our compound annual growth was 3%. It was a bit less in '13. It was only
2%. But our combined ratio, at the same time, has improved substantially to 96.6, which
means that the 96% that we have targeted for 2015 looks eminently achievable.
Acceleration in emerging markets, in high-growth markets, we had indicated that we
would be able to achieve a 15% compound annual growth of the top line. On the Life and
Savings new business, the growth on the comparable basis was 11%. Cumulatively, over
three years, it's 17%. And the contribution of high-growth markets to the total of the new
business of the Group is now 17% compared to 12% in 2010.
P&C revenues, compound growth of 15%. The growth this year was 14%. In spite of the
slowdown in several emerging markets, we've been able to achieve 14%. And the
contribution of high-growth markets to the total revenues of the Group is now 16%.
Eﬃciency -- we are on track, as Henri indicated. You see that the savings have accelerated
on the life side. Of the total EUR400 million additional savings this year, EUR300 million
come from the life side. And you see that we are also savings, as Henri mentioned just a
minute ago, on BAU IT, EUR0.2 billion.
Our investments in IT have been slightly growing, representing EUR1.2 billion. And our
investments in digital have accelerated. We had thought that we would spend roughly
EUR600 million over '13, '14. And '15. And we have readjusted that target to EUR800
million, having spent more than EUR250 million this year.

FINAL

Now moving to the performance of the Group in more details, you see on slide A19 the
breakdown of the earnings by segment. And you see that we have growth in earnings in
all segments. I will comment this page in more detail. But focus more on slide A20, where
you can see that we had a negative impact of the ForEx on our underlying earnings, which
is mainly yen, Swiss franc. And US dollar of -- for a total of EUR166 million.
Moving to the adjusted earnings, they went up 20% to EUR5 -- a little more than -- close
to EUR5.2 billion thanks to strong underlying earnings and higher capital gains. In this are
EUR434 million of capital gains. Our disposal of a substantial part of our shareholding in
BNP Paribas accounts for EUR195 million, this shareholding having been brought down to
1.4% at year end and having come down further since then.
Moving to the net income on the next slide, the net income was up 14% to EUR4.5 billion. I
will just comment on two items.

Bloomberg Transcript

First one, change in fair value and ForEx. We have, as you know, hedges that work
economically. But do not work from an accounting standpoint. So we have an accounting
mismatch. And this year we had two negative impacts, one coming from the increase in
interest rates for EUR387 million, one coming from ForEx position, EUR440 million,
because we hedged a part of our investments in our operating subsidiaries, the holdings
of the holding company.
The second point I want to highlight is the restructuring costs. They are relatively stable,
around EUR250 million. So you could ask, why aren't you ending -- I mean, stopping
restructuring costs. The reality is, if you want to increase -- I mean, to reduce your
expenses on an ongoing basis, we have to go through various restructurings in the
various parts of the Group. And we have front-loaded costs as we restructure our various
businesses to cut our expenses.
Moving now to the diﬀerent segments of the Group. And starting with the Life and
Savings segment, on slide 24, you see the breakdown of our new business between
mature markets and high-growth markets. You see that this year we resumed growth in
mature markets. And this growth was particularly strong in the UK, in the US. And in
Switzerland, the total being 4%.
High-growth markets were up 11%. And this is a contraction of a continued poor
performance in Central and Eastern Europe on the back of the pension nationalizations
that occurred in Hungary and Poland. In spite of that, we have a growth of 11%, thanks to
Asia, which is up 16%.
Our new business margins improved, both in mature markets and in high-growth markets
thanks to the improved business mix with more protection and health. And more unitlinked, the total being 35% NBV margin.
Let me now look at the new business sales and margins by segment. But sub-segment -protection and health, savings, unit-linked. And mutual funds. And I will not comment the
left part of the side. But concentrate on the right part where we have the net ﬂows.
Page 6 of 30



Company Name: AXA SA

FINAL

Protection and health, we accelerated the net ﬂows to EUR5.2 billion. On savings we had
negative EUR5.2 billion of ﬂows. Of that, EUR900 million were exceptional in Switzerland
due to a change in regulation on an employee pension scheme, which had to move -- to
be moved to -- to leave the Company to go an autonomous pension fund.
Unit-linked, the ﬂows are -- seem to be low at EUR0.9 billion. But you have two
exceptionals. One is something that we announced to you already several months ago,
which is the GMxB buyout campaign in the US, where we had success of the buyout. And,
hence, negative ﬂows for EUR1.7 billion. The second one was Japan, where we essentially
stopped producing variable annuities because of the very low interest rates. To do that,
we reduced commissions to the point where sales were close to zero.
Mutual funds had a slight positive. So in total, we have EUR1.1 billion positive ﬂow in our
life business. But that includes EUR5.2 billion -- sorry, that would have been EUR5.2 billion
excluding the three exceptionals that I have mentioned earlier.

Bloomberg Transcript

Looking now at the pretax earnings by business, they grew by 13%. If we go directly to the
right part of the slide, all the growth and more is coming from the unit-linked side, thanks
to higher earnings on the VA side in the US. You remember that we had a number of
exceptional negatives last year. So we -- I would say we are back to normal on the US VAs.
And thanks, also, to a good performance of equity markets, which leads to higher fees, in
line with higher asset-bases.
We have two negative movements on the other two sub-segments. On protection and
health, we have a decline of 7%, which is largely due to less-favorable mortality in the US,
with a negative adjustment of close to EUR200 million. The other factors are positive,
improved investment margin. And higher margin of revenues, linked to higher sales.
G/A savings was also down 10%, in spite of lower expenses, because we have lower
average reserves following the outﬂows that I have mentioned earlier. And lower sales,
hence, lower marginal revenues. There is also a negative impact of ForEx on this line,
because all the non-euro denominated reserves are contributing to this line. And produce
a smaller contribution.
Moving now to P&C, I mentioned earlier the fact that we had P&C revenues up 2% at
EUR29 billion. This is a contrasted story. Personal lines revenues were up only 1%. And this
is because of the combination of an average price increase of 2.6%, portfolio growth in
direct and high-growth markets.
But more selectivity and pruning in mature markets. In the UK, Belgium. And Germany, we
repriced our portfolios. And had to accept lower volumes. So we had signiﬁcant outﬂows
in those three countries on the personal lines side.
Commercial lines -- we are seeing a growth of revenues of 5%, thanks to an average price
increase of 3.4%. And strong portfolio growth in high-growth markets. But also, on the
SME side in the UK and in France.

FINAL

Looking at the pricing environment, I mentioned the overall price increase for personal
lines and commercial lines. You see that we have been able to increase prices across the
board, with the exception of Switzerland, where you will recall that we have a combined
ratio below 90%.
Going forward in 2014, we believe that we'll be able to continue to increase prices in
France and Germany, while the pricing environment has become less favorable in the
other geographies.
Looking at the P&C revenues and combined ratios between mature markets, high-growth
markets. And direct, you see that all the growth in revenues was in high-growth markets
and direct. In direct, we had the 7% growth in revenues. In all the other markets, all the
markets other than the UK and the decline revenues of 4% in the UK, because of the
pruning I have mentioned earlier.
The combined ratio in all those markets was below 100% and improved across the board.
This is the ﬁrst year we have a combined ratio below 100% in direct, which is something
that we expect to see continuing. But is a good sign for this business, that we believe has
high growth potential. All in all, our current year combined ratio improved by 1.1 points to
97.8%.

Bloomberg Transcript

P&C earnings increased by 13%. And you see the explanation of this decline of 1.1 points
of the current year combined ratio. On one hand, we had higher large losses and double
the amount of catastrophes that we had last year.
We are still in a relatively benign year for catastrophes, because we have-- I mean, in our
plans, we expect natural catastrophes to represent roughly 1 points of combined ratio. The
positives are price increases, expense ratio improvement for 0.4 points and lower, I would
say, attritional frequency.
Why do we have higher large losses? Because of the continued diﬃcult economic
environment in Europe, where we have the bulk of our presence.
The prior year developments were stable at 1.2 points, giving us an all-year combined
ratio of 96.6, again 1.1 points better than last year. Investment income was rather stable,
with an asset yield of 3.9%, the same as last year.
Moving now to Asset Management, our average AUM went up by 4% at AXA Investment
Managers at 5% at AllianceBernstein. The net ﬂows picture is more contrasted with an
increase in net ﬂows to a positive EUR12 billion at AXA Investment Managers, net ﬂows
continuing to be negative at AllianceBernstein at EUR4 billion negative. And this is -- the
net ﬂows, negative ﬂows, are concentrated on the equity franchise.
On the ﬁxed-income franchise we had -- we continue to have positive ﬂows. But they were
much less positive than in prior years. Because of what happened in the -- since the
middle of the year with the announcement of the QE tapering, there were signiﬁcant
Page 8 of 30

FINAL

outﬂows in Asia and AllianceBernstein has a very strong retail presence in Asia -- Japan,
Taiwan, Hong Kong. And Singapore -- and we had signiﬁcant outﬂows in ﬁxed income
there. Revenues were up 10% at AXA IM. And 7% at AB.
All in all, the earnings of the Asset Management business grew by 8%. They were up 20%
at AllianceBernstein, thanks to higher revenues and a very strong cost discipline. They
were slightly down at AXA IM, reﬂecting largely the disposal of AXA Private Equity. They
would have been up 6%, otherwise. Thank you very much for your attention. And I hand
over now to Gerald, our CFO.

Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Thank you, Denis. So moving now to the balance sheet. And to the shareholders' equity.
So the shareholders equity is down EUR0.7 billion. And I would like -- I won't comment all
the variations. But focusing on the three elements.
First, the change in net unrealized capital gains is corresponding to the impact of higher
interest rates on the OCI.
Next is the ForEx movement, net of hedging, minus EUR2.4 billion. That's the impact of
investments denominated in foreign currency. And the most impacted ones are the one in
Japan and Switzerland and the US.

Bloomberg Transcript

Next is the change in pension beneﬁts, plus EUR0.7 billion, correspond to the actuarial
gain coming from the -- from higher interest rates.
Now, the debt gearing, which is at 24%. And you can see that the net debt went down
from EUR13 billion to EUR12.3 billion. At the same time, the interest cover improved from
9.3 times to 10.2 times.
Now, the economic solvency. The economic solvency, as explained by Henri, has been
restated in order to take into account the future dividends. So we restated 2012 in order to
take into account the dividend that's been paid, as I said, at EUR0.72 in 2013. As well, the
solvency for 2013 takes into account the planned dividend of EUR0.81.
As a whole, you can notice that our economic solvency is improving from 199% to 206%.
In the bottom part of your slide, you can notice that we are still sensitive to the -- mostly
sensitive to the rise or drop in interest rates.
Now, the general account invested assets. First, our invested assets moved down from
EUR491 billion to EUR470 billion. This drop is explained mostly by three reasons.
The ﬁrst one is a mark to market in -- with the rise of interest rates. Second is the ForEx on
the Japanese yen, US dollar. And Swiss francs. And last is a scope eﬀect coming from the

Page 9 of 30

MONY disposal.

FINAL

You can notice that we are still -- we slightly increased our ﬁxed-income investment from
82% to 83%. At the same time, listed equities went up from 3% to 4%. But remain modest,
taking into account Solvency II cost, which is pretty high.
On the asset yields, as mentioned by Denis, we are quite stable -- we are stable in P&C at
3.9%. For Life and Savings, we dropped by 10 basis points from 3.8% to 3.7%. We are hurt
by our long duration. And you can see at the bottom right that we have been investing at
2.9%. And in the euro zone at 3.2%.
The investment margins -- investment margin was, in 2013, at 80 basis points, within the
guidance of 70 to 80 basis points. And this included some exceptional dividends from
private equity and equity funds. And I can consider than it's roughly 2 to 3 basis points.
Next is the operating cash ﬂow, the Life operating free cash ﬂow. And you can see that it
increased from EUR2.2 billion to EUR2.3 billion, plus 9 points. Just in the middle, you have
the new business IRR, which -- which went up sharply, in line with our selectivity strategy.
And so explaining that between 2012 we moved up from 12.5% to 14.2%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, the operating free cash ﬂow, the Group operating free cash ﬂow. On top of the Life
and Savings free cash ﬂow at EUR2.3 billion that I just commented, you have the P&C, plus
the Asset Management. P&C corresponds to the adjusted earnings from our P&C
business, plus the international segment.
Remittance ratio now, which is pretty in line with our guideline, we were at 75% last year.
Last, the Group embedded value, which went up from EUR37.3 billion to EUR43 billion, on
top of an operating return of 18%, the non-operating variance corresponding to the
improvement in global economic conditions, I mean, mostly higher equity markets. But
also higher interest rates. Thank you.

Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

Thanks, Gerald. As a conclusion, what can we say? I think it's very simple. Very solid and
strong earnings, very much in line with our middle-term plans. Clearly, a good basis to
prepare the future, because this industry is going to be very deeply aﬀected by what's
going to happen around digital and big data. And you need to prepare yourself. I think
we are for that in a very good position.
So that's where we are. And now let's open the ﬂoor to questions, both in the room and
on the web.

Questions And Answers

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

Yes? If, when you ask your question, you could introduce yourself for the people who are
just listening to the call. There is a mic here. Let's start on the right side.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

FINAL

It's Jon Hocking from Morgan Stanley. I've got two questions, please.
On the dividend, you're at the bottom end of your range. What signpost can we look for
to see whether you're going to move up that range? Is it solvency ratio? Is it earnings? Is it
the fact that you had good year-on-year dividend growth at the bottom of the range? How
should we think about that? That's the ﬁrst question.
And the second question, on free cash ﬂow, the IRRs moved up nicely in the Life business.
Free cash ﬂow growth in the Life unit, going forward, is that going to be a function of new
business coming down. And if it is, which markets do you see that you can re-allocated
cash away from? Thank you.

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thank you. I take the ﬁrst part of the questions. Denis or Gerald, do you want to
take the second part of the question?
I mean, on the dividend, we are at the bottom end of the range. But we are within the
range. The reason for which, we don't want to go up more is very simple. It's a
combination of caution and optimism. It's caution, because the discussions surrounding
the regulatory environment are not over, point one.
It's caution, because even if the economic environment is better, it's still fragile. And you
all know how much we have suﬀered during the crisis from the perception of our
leverage. We've been bringing it down. We want to bring it, as we've said, slightly further
down, even if think now that we are in very comfortable territory.
So that's the caution part. The optimism part is, we have new business to fund. And,
therefore, we think that increasing the payout would not be the best thing to do. So that's
where we are? Denis? Operating cash ﬂows?

A - Denis Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

On the internal rate of return, which was your questions, maybe you can go to page B69,
which is in the appendix. And you will see here that across the board, all countries have
an improvement in their new business internal rate of revenue.
I just -- answering your question about what it will mean for the future, that means that the
cash ﬂows will be impacted, because here we are in the real world. I mean, it's done in the
management case, whereas the NBV is done on the market-consistent basis.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

FINAL

Is it a clear answer?

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

Good. Next question. Let's move side -- Nick or, yes, whoever.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Nick Holmes of Soc Gen. I had a couple of questions on reserves, please.

Bloomberg Transcript

The ﬁrst is on the GMxB reserves, where you have a buyout oﬀer for EUR6 billion. Can you
update us? I know this has been progressing reasonably well. And you gave us some
numbers. Can you update us how far you think this might go?
Then also, looking at the reserve releases, I was interested to see that you strengthened
reserves with the releases. And I just wondered what your view is, going forward, whether
you think there will be more reserve strengthening here, or whether you would release
reserves?
Then the second question is on the P&C reserves. Basically, do you expect releases to
remain at 1% to 2% going forward? And what are the things that would worry you with
your reserve strength in P&C? What might put pressure on that level of release? Thank
you.

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

Okay. Gerald, you want to take this?

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Maybe, Nick, you can go to page B28 of the appendix. And here you have the roll forward
and the impact on reserves, which was your questions.
So the reserve -- the GMxB reserve is going down from $13.1 billion to $8.1 billion. And you
can see that the buyout program represents $0.6 billion. So the most important part on
the decrease in reserves is coming from the market and other. And the ﬁrst element is the
one I mentioned before, equity markets.

Page 12 of 30



Company Name: AXA SA

With equity markets up 30%, of course the options go out of the money, which means
that you have less reserves. Less reserves means also less risk of suﬀering from the
volatility.

FINAL

And to back to your question on the buyout program, we won't make every year such a
buyout program. And you will see that this program is important to the use of reserves.
But markets play a much more important role.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Can I just quickly follow up on that? I mean. So far, you've achieved about 10%.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

What do you sort of think, ballpark, you might achieve?

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

As a whole, we were at 10 -- on top of my head, we are 10.2%. So that's what we were
expecting.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Okay. Okay. So, we have to wait for the next buyout oﬀer. Got it?

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

P&C?

A - Denis Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

So you had two other questions, one was, if I understand, on the Life reserves and the
second one on P&C reserves. Is that right?

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Correct. I mean, it was really the GMxB reserves. It was just -- I noticed that you'd taken -there was a EUR200 million release, I think, which you used to strengthen the lapse
reserves in the GMxB.

A - Denis Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

No, on GMxB, we have not -- on GMxB, we were absolutely in line with our behavior
assumptions. You remember that we took a big reserve last year. We said that we
expected that there would be no further need to strengthen the reserve for customer
behavior. And nothing happened this year. So, I would say, our predictions were
vindicated on the GMxB reserves.

We did have an -- we did have two reserve strengthening, which Gerald may comment,
one in Japan and one in the US. You want to comment on those two, Gerald?

FINAL

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Yes. We had, ﬁrst, in the US, a reserve strengthening. And we can go back to page A26
that Denis just commented. And the ﬁrst one is in the protection and health. That means
that we had unfavorable mortality in the US on both the experience. And the reserves,
which means that we had a EUR0.2 billion hit on that side.
At the same time, in G/A savings, at the reverse, we had some longevity hit in the -- in
Japan. And this represents EUR0.1 billion.
So as a whole -- and these ﬁgures are before tax -- we had, roughly EUR0.3 billion oneoﬀs.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Very clear. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Denis Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

And we don't have any expectation that -- to have this as a recurring phenomenon. So the
mortality one is probably the more interesting to comment, because basically what
happened in the US is that whereas before we had a mortality improvement every year,
basically, in line with the progress of longevity. What we have discovered during 2013 was
that mortality ceased to improve for (inaudible) over 50. Part of it is health --

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
(Inaudible).

A - Denis Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Mortality ceased to improve. So two elements. One was, I would say, health related,
probably obesity and things like that. The other one was suicides. And so, we -- the
question for us is going to be is this something that we'll see in other markets? Is this
something that we will see continuing? But we've made the best adjustment that we
thought was advisable in the circumstances.
Last comment on P&C reserves, reserve releases. So basically, we are very comfortable
with our level of reserves overall. We didn't reduce the strength of our reserves overall in
P&C. We had 1.2 points of positive developments, as I indicated, like last year. I cannot tell
you whether this -- I mean, I am reasonable conﬁdent that this 1.2 is close to the bottom of
what we could expect. But I would not commit that we -- this number would increase.
That's probably where we would say -- stand.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

You have the sequence on page B33.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

FINAL

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

I've been impressed by the ability of Gerald to move from one page to the other in the
appendixes and by the Jesuitic answer of Denis on the prior-year reserves. Next question?
Here. Let's stay on this side.

Q - Michael Klien

{BIO 4262408 <GO>}

Yes. It's Michael Klien from Nomura. I had two questions, if I may. Firstly, on the Japanese
operations, we saw that the new business value increased quite sharply, year over year,
even though actually your sales in terms of APs, was down, which meant, obviously, your
margin has increased materially.
Is this -- can you maybe give us some indications in terms of what the key drivers were?
You mentioned the discontinuation of the VA sales. And also, give us some indication in
terms of how you expect this to progress into 2014?

Bloomberg Transcript

And my second question would be on UK ﬂoods. I guess you can't really say much in
terms of estimates. But maybe about what you're expecting from the market so far? And
also, touch, therefore, more on your reinsurance program. And, therefore, what kind of
hypothetical we can think of?

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

Paul, do you want to answer on the UK ﬂoods? And Gerald or Denis will answer in Japan.

A - Paul Evans

{BIO 7044129 <GO>}

So as far as the reinsurance is concerned, I'll be quite surprised if the ﬂoods was a
reinsurance event for the UK market, unless they had very low deductibles. It won't touch
ours.
Obviously, it fell into diﬀerent years. So we saw around GBP 60 million in 2013 across
ﬂood and storm, because, of course, the uniqueness of the UK event was it was a ﬂood in
parallel with very, very severe storms. In fact, we saw -- for every one ﬂood claim, there's
25 storm claims.
And coming into -- and that carried through until January and February, we think. It's very,
very early for January and February. But I would say it's probably about GBP 16 million of
ﬂood so far. And more wind storm, perhaps another GBP 20 million of wind storm.
But not a reinsurance event. Is it a pricing event? I would say that all the ﬂooding did last
year was return the weather to a normalized year. We saw next to now weather losses in
the ﬁrst, well, 11 months of 2013. We were expecting, therefore, for it to be a softening

Page 15 of 30



Company Name: AXA SA

Date: 2014-02-21

market. And, indeed, rates did start to soften. AXA did not, didn't soften our rates, at all.
And, therefore, we lost some volume.

FINAL

So will competitor need to reprice? That's the question. We haven't seen it so far. But
those who did soften into benign weather may have caught a cold.

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

Japan?

A - Denis Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

So on Japan, basically, the -- I have, in part, already addressed this question. It's almost no
VA sales. And, more generally, very little savings sales. So we have focused on the two
most proﬁtable lines of business, which are pure protection and health. We have
continued to be innovative on the product front.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have expanded our distribution. We have a very strong distribution network. And
multiple distribution networks. But we have a proprietary network with the Japanese
chambers of commerce where we are adding new people on a net basis, which has been
the case for the second-year running. And we expect to continue to do that.
We are strengthening our relationship with the -- with what is called in Japan the agents
that work. But, in fact, it's the brokers. These are brokers. We have expanded our
presence with medium-size brokers. And this is the focus on, again, health and pure
protection that has generated these very high margins. And on those lines of business, we
have not only high margins. But also strong growth in our sales.

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

(Inaudible) we are trying to have, because it's reputed to be a market with no growth. In
reality, if you are selective. And if you target your segments, you can achieve pretty good
growth with very high margins.
Next question? Whoever.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Thank you. Ralph Hebgen from KBW. Just three things.
On the remittance range, I saw that is pretty much stable, 75%. But also, as I remember a
slide from the June 2011 Investor Day, which would indicate an ambition in place, at the
time, at least, that you wanted to grow this to 80%, potentially. So the question is, is that
ambition still there? That will be interesting to hear.
The second one is on the movement of the economic solvency ratio. I saw one point,
which was 7 points down due to model reﬁnements. If you could just make some

Page 16 of 30



Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity
Date: 2014-02-21

explanatory comments around that, what these reﬁnements were. I saw the annotation.
But it would be interesting to hear what's behind the annotation on the slide?

FINAL

And ﬁnally, a point of detail, I'm afraid. I believe there was a reserve increase in France,
which relates to a court judgment on bodily injury. If you could quantify that, it would be
fantastic. If not, some qualitative comment of how that might have impacted the reserve
release which you show would be interesting.

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

Good. You want to keep Gerald on his toes.

A - Denis Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

So I'll take the remittance ratio and let Gerald take the other two, if that's okay with you.
So remittance ratio, I have to disappoint you, Ralph, because, yes, we had the aspiration
to grow to -- to grow from 75 to 80. And we see that we have a very hard time in achieving
that, especially. And this is a comment that would be very topical, because in the move
from Solvency I to Solvency II, we see the various supervisors being quite cautious and
trying to keep as much capital in each locality instead of accepting that the Group should
operate as a Group and upstream a maximum level of dividends.

Bloomberg Transcript

So upstreaming dividends is not an easy undertaking. And I don't expect that we will be
able to move from 75% to 80%.

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

But it's an industry phenomenon. I mean, the risk of seeing fragmentation coming in
ﬁnancial markets throughout Europe is a real one. We are ﬁghting against it. We don't
think there is any good -- I mean, reason, for that. But it's happening. Gerald?

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Yes. On your question relative to the model reﬁnement, in fact, it's coming from -- it's
linked to the absorption of the policyholder. To make it simple, when you have a shock on
equity markets, you can suppose that it's absorbed by the policy -- by policyholders. And
same for, let's say, interest rates. But when you combine both, you have a kind of cliﬀ
eﬀect, because they cannot absorb twice the initial amount, to make it simple. That's
exactly it. That's the type of reﬁnement that we (inaudible).

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

French reserves?

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

On the French reserves, in fact, we increased our reserves of roughly EUR150 million. And
it was mostly oﬀset, indeed, by prior -- positive prior reserve releases.

Next question.

A - Denis Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

FINAL

But the totality of the reserve increase was not (inaudible). It's a mix of diﬀerent --

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

It's a mix of diﬀerent things, yes.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you. Peter Eliot from Berenberg. Thank you. Peter Eliot from Berenberg.
I wanted also, ﬁrst of all, just to touch on the economic solvency. But just looking at it from
your exposure and appetite for exposure to market risk, I was going to say that I thought it
was hurt by about 10percentage points due to that. It may have been slightly less. But it
was certainly -- the economic solvency development was hurt by that.

Bloomberg Transcript

But when I looked at the sensitivities, they didn't really change very much. And then when
I looked at the sensitivity of earnings to market risks, they seem to have come down a lot
recently. So I guess I was just trying to square that circle. Yes. Absolutely. And perhaps if
you could just update us on your thoughts on that, as well?
Then secondly, if I could just, more or less coming back on Jon's question. But I when I
was listening to your answer, Henri, on the dividend, on the payout ratio, I was sort of
thinking I need to pencil in 40% for the next few years.
But when I sort of think, well, you're doing pretty well against your targets and, in
particular, on the cash ﬂow, as you mentioned, your current run rate is well above that.
Your leverage, actually, is within the target range. I started thinking, well, what needs to
happen?
Is that the wrong -- was the wrong assumption. And, if so, what needs to happen for us to
move above the bottom?

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

I think you will need to live with your impatience as long as we will have to live with the
uncertainty surrounding the regulatory framework and the macro environment. Once
more, we've learned our lesson from the 2008-2011 years. We think the operations of the
Group were always tightly managed. But we have disproportionately suﬀered from the
fact that the balance sheet was seen as being slightly more aggressive than others.
We don't want to see that happening again, even if it -- if it is at the risk of seeing you
being slightly impatient.

Page 18 of 30



Company Name: AXA SA

On the solvency ratio and on the ability to reconcile the sensitivities with the moves from
one year to the other, Gerald, you want to try?

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, maybe I'll try. On page B11, you can see here -- your question was on equities and or
interest rates, or both?

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Well it was --

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

Both.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Okay, let's take page B11. So I'll start ﬁrst with -- so, here, we are dealing with the impact
on the earnings. And what you can see with equities, if equities go down by 25%, you can
notice that the P&L would be impacted through net income by minus EUR0.6 billion, of
which EUR0.4 billion due to the impairment rules.

Bloomberg Transcript

So at the time-- and, at the same time, the OCIs, that means that the -- on the balance
sheet, the net unrealized capital gains and losses would be down EUR1.1 billion. It's the
reverse when it's going up.
In interest rates, it's much easier, because in interest rates, it's directly hit. The net income
is only hit by some mutual funds which are mark to market. But there are only a few. That
explains why a plus or minus 100 basis points is only minus EUR0.1 billion to plus EUR0.2
billion.
But on the reverse on the OCI side and on the balance sheet, you have a strong increase
of EUR7.4 billion in case of a drop of 100 basis points and a strong decrease of EUR6.9
billion in case of a rise of 100 basis points. I don't know if it helped.

A - Denis Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

So maybe I will add two points. First, we have reduced the accounting sensitivity, the
earning sensitivity, from a net income standpoint of interest rate moves by a slight change
in the way we account for some hedges in the US. So that earning sensitivity that you see
in 2013 will be lower in '14 on interest rate moves.
Secondly, there is a comment in the press release on the economic solvency, because you
mentioned, also, the economic solvency, where we said that we talk about the model
reﬁnements. And increased market risk exposure, due mainly to higher interest rates and
equity markets.

Page 19 of 30



Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity
Date: 2014-02-21

FINAL

So I'll take those two elements. Higher exposure to equity markets, because equity
markets have gone up, Gerald has mentioned the fact that our allocation had moved from
3% to 4%. This leads to an increased market risk.
The interest rate movement is more -- is more complicated to explain, because, I mean,
the higher interest rates, the ﬁrst order element is positive, because options are less in the
money. So, our solvency coverage should be better. But there are second order eﬀects
linked to what happens on the lapses.
And, therefore, in fact our -- because of the correlation between ﬁnancial markets and
insurance risk in reality, we increase our exposure -- our ﬁnancial risk exposure, because
we have, I would say, lower -- higher lapse risk because of higher interest rates. That's
what happened on the interest rate side.

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

Welcome to the magic of models. Blair, or whoever?

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good afternoon. Francois Boissin from Exane BNP Paribas. Two question, please.
The ﬁrst one on coming back on the optimism side of the dividend policy. So you
mentioned you have growth to fund. So I just wanted to have a bit more clarity on this. I
mean, is this future M&A? And if so, I think you mentioned that the gap had been bridged
in many emerging regions. So basically what regions are you targeting right now. And
which business lines? Or is it that you intend to write products which are more capital
intensive going forward? So that's the ﬁrst question.
The second question is, coming back to the remittance ratio, which is hard to raise, I
appreciate this diﬃcult because of regulators. But you are in many countries. And
basically I was just wondering whether you could provide a bit more clarity on where this
is diﬃcult to upstream capital. And where is this easier?

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

On the ﬁrst point. And Denis or Gerald will take the second one. First, I mean, we intend
to stay pragmatic as we've always been over the last 40 years. So we want to be sure that
if there is an opportunity we can seize it.
Second point, we do not intend to do any major acquisitions. I mean, this is not in the
picture.
Third, we have some existing businesses which are going to require additional funding
because their growth is going to be extremely strong. Take the Chinese example. On both
sides, both on the Life side with ICBC, as well as on the P&C side with Tian Ping, the
growth expectations in terms of premiums are such that additional funding will be

Page 20 of 30



Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity
Date: 2014-02-21

needed, even if the business is very proﬁtable. It cannot be self-funding, given what the
growth rate is.

FINAL

So if you add to that, last but not least, the fact that we want to start a green ﬁeld in Brazil
on commercial risks and a couple of other things, you understand why we want to have,
let's say, some cushion. Remittance ratio?

A - Denis Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Well I will not pinpoint any speciﬁc supervisor. Upstreaming capital is diﬃcult these days,
because post ﬁnancial crisis all supervisors are or tend to be more prudent than they -- or
more cautious than they were in the past.

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Oliver Steel at Deutsche Bank. Two questions. The ﬁrst is on Japan. Bond yields there
remain still very low. I was just wondering if you could remind us of your liabilities there
and how you're feeling about that?

Bloomberg Transcript

The second thing is going back to Ambition AXA, you started oﬀ with a 10% per annum
earnings growth target, which, fair enough, you then cut to 5% to 10% based on the sort
of macro sensitivities that you gave us. But actually, equity markets have lifted back in to
your trend line since then. Bond yields have lifted, although I admit they're still below the
trend line.
So my question is, if we were to try and pinpoint what we should really be looking at in
terms of the sort of macro-adjusted earnings growth rate from here, my gut sense is, it's
higher than 6% per annum.

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

Maybe yours. But we are not going to update that quarter after quarter, because we don't
think it would be the right thing to do. I mean, as you've said, interest rates have risen last
year. But, I mean, not by much. I mean, yes in the US, not that much in many other places.
By the way, in some peripherals, they have gone down in Europe. And signiﬁcantly. Even
if it was good for us, given the fact that we had bought bonds in these countries, it's a
point.
Second, it's not because equity markets have risen for a year that we should
fundamentally change our assumptions. If you look at what the start of the year has been,
I don't think there is much reason for hype there. So 5% to 10% seems to us to be the
reasonable guidance we can give.
On the other point?

A - Denis Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

FINAL

On Japan, I mean, Japan, as you know, we still have a legacy portfolio with high
guarantees. We have been able to manage that portfolio in such a way that our
investment margins -- our investment margin was roughly zero. 2013 has been
exceptionally good thanks to the equity markets in Japan, some private equity gains
realization.
But I would say that the guidance should remain the same, that we expect to have a zero
investment margin oﬀsetting the cost of those guarantees with a relatively investment
strategy with which we are reasonably comfortable, because we have a very competent
investment team there.

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

Blair?

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thanks very much Blair Stewart from BofA Merrill. Just coming back to the comment you
made about you've bridged the footprint gap in emerging markets. I know you too well to
know that's not true. You still harbor ambitions to get bigger there. It's only 12%, 13% of
your earnings.

Bloomberg Transcript

So is that really the case? Have you really bridged the gap that you identiﬁed? And are
you where you want to be in emerging markets? Or, perhaps, are the growth businesses
you have there going to absorb your ability to ﬁnance them organically? Is that the
situation?
Then back to the mundane, in terms of the levers you talked about with IT costs and the
distribution side, I just wonder if you could quantify a little bit about what you can on IT
costs and on the distribution side, making it more eﬃcient. And what impact that might
have on the bottom line? Thank you.

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

You may think you know me well. But you can be wrong, as you were in predicting the
outcome of the last rugby game.
The -- more seriously, Blair, I think we have covered most of what we were willing to cover.
The -- having said that, we remain pragmatic as far as opportunities are concerned. But
where -- I mean, what were the big holes? China -- and it's a big hole or was a big hole for
everybody in the industry, given the -- I would say the ability of the Chinese regulators to
contain the non-Chinese presence in their market.
I think with the two deals we've done, we are now in pretty good shape. And I don't
expect us to do much more there, other than grow and grow fast the operations we now
control.

If you look at the rest of Asia, we may have bolt-on acquisitions here and there. But it's
never going to be a very major thing.

FINAL

In Latin America, where we had Mexico, which is, by the way, performing well, we have
now this Colombian operation, which looks promising. And we are not going to grow it by
acquisitions for a while.
The real hole was Brazil, because we have absolutely no intention to go to Argentina. And
if we had, you should alert us.
The -- in Brazil, we are starting on commercial lines. It's going to be a way for us to test the
market. But at this stage, I think we are ﬁnd. And I think the distribution agreements we
have in many places in Asia, as well as in other places, are allowing us to grow our
business organically at a very signiﬁcant pace. So we are relaxed about that. Denis?

A - Denis Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

On eﬃciency, I don't think I'm going to make any bold new statements. We have this
target of EUR1.7 billion. And we've said we would be conﬁdent to achieve that. And that
contains the totality of our expense saves program until 2015.

Bloomberg Transcript

We know that we will -- having done that by 2015, we will still have expense challenges.
But we will update you in due course. But so far, this is our target. And we've told you the
breakdown between distribution and internal costs. And I'm not going to change the
guidance on this topic at this stage.
Our IT costs overall are stable. Basically, we reduced the BAU costs. We increased the
investments. In total, we spend roughly EUR2.5 billion, EUR2.6 billion in IT. And that will
continue at the same pace.

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

Yes, Andrew.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Andrew Crean with Autonomous. Three questions, if I may. Your protection and health
underlying result, if we adjust for the mortality hit, was still ﬂat, which seems somewhat
surprising, given the fact you've been focusing on that.
Secondly, if restructuring costs are a persistent item, the beneﬁt of which comes in
underlying earnings, should not restructuring costs also come in underlying earnings?
Then thirdly, could you talk a bit more about release of capital from old world businesses?
You sold MONY last year. Are there other disposals which can be done, or even without
disposing is there any actions which you can take to release capital from some of these
old world businesses?

FINAL

Yes, I mean, it's something we've been -- I'll take the last part of the question to let them
prepare the answers to the ﬁrst part. But it's something which has been going on now for
some years. We had a plant to release EUR3 billion from existing operations. We have
now released more than EUR2 billion, which means that we think that there is still more to
come.
I mean, it's going to be a combination of disposals, buy-outs. I mean, there are many
possibilities in many places. We are looking at it on a more and more granular basis.
That's it.
On the other hand, if we want to sell some of these portfolios, we have no -- we are not in
a situation where we need capital. What we want to do is have a pragmatic use of the
capital we deploy. So we are not ready to sell at any price. So we have to ﬁnd buyers on a
pragmatic basis.
So more to come. It's one of the priorities of the Life and Savings business line. So
Jacques de Vaucleroy and his team are working hard at that. We have some large
portfolios in some large places. But it's going to be gradual.
Denis or Gerald, do you want to answer the elements?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

To your question, Andrew, about the protection business, you will see in the appendix the
protection business, if you take the gross revenues, gross revenues grew by 4%. And we
can expect, taking into account the EP growth in this business that normally this revenue
should grow in the future.
At the same time, you know that we present our business just like P&C with the combined
ratio. This year we were at 95.5. And, as explained before, we have some one-oﬀs. So we
can expect to be more in a range, let's say, around 95, maybe between 94.5 and 95.
That's what I can tell you.

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

Denis, on the restructuring, below the line, above the line?

A - Denis Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

So to add to what Gerald was saying, we would like to grow the top line by more than 4%.
And so, if we adjust for the combined ratio evolution, clearly the growth will come from
the top line and we need to move from 4% to a higher number. This is what we are
striving to achieve.
On restructuring costs, I think you are, in part, right. And because we're mixing in
restructuring costs two diﬀerent elements. And this is for simplicity.

FINAL

The -- we are mixing restructuring costs that are arising out of acquisitions or disposals.
Let's take MONY as an example. We sell MONY, we -- I mean, therefore, we shrink the
balance sheet of the Company. And as a result of that shrinkage, which I think really is a
net income event, we do have restructuring costs to reduce the cost base of the US, to
take that example.
There -- so any M&A-type activity restructuring cost, I think is well allocated in net income.
The rest of the restructuring costs, for operations which do not change in scope, we
perhaps could have put that in underlying. We have, for simplicity reasons, put everything
in the net income line.

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

Just one point on protection and health. This is clearly an idea where I think we could do
more in terms of growth. It's an area where we want to beef up the teams we have. So
reinforcing the talent pool is one of the elements we have in mind looking at the next
years there, because we think there is a huge potential in Asia, in particular. And for that,
we will need to have more people on board.
Another question, or do we have --? Yes, please?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Claudia Gaspari

{BIO 15148414 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. Claudia Gaspari from Barclays. I just had a question on, one, the
new ﬁnancial leverage target. I was just wondering whether that could potential -- you
would potentially consider active deleveraging or whether that's just a function of
earnings retention and book value growth. And also on the leverage front, whether you're
happy with the mix as it currently stands or whether ideally you would change something
there.
Then also, going back to balance sheet strength, I appreciate your comments there. But, I
mean, it gets to a point where balance sheet strength is only -- it becomes ineﬃcient. So I
was wondering, are you happy with your balance sheet as it is? How much more do you
feel you need to do? And what, if you could give us some examples? Thanks.

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

Okay. Denis, do you want to take this one?

A - Denis Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

So on your questions, ﬁrst, on the composition of our debt, you have it on page B64. And
basically you can see that we are gradually reducing the amount of senior debt, which is
only now EUR2.4 billion. And the bulk of our debt is undated or dated subordinated debt
for which we have credits from a solvency standpoint.
So I guess that we will keep some debt because we want to maximize the credit that we
get from a solvency standpoint. And so, make our balance sheet as eﬃcient as possible
from an ROE standpoint, while -- and maximize the amount of sub debt that is admissible

FINAL

from a regulatory standpoint. So we will keep some leverage, because that's eﬃcient from
an ROE standpoint.
Up until what point we strengthen the balance sheet, I remind you that we are a ﬁnancial
institution and these days there is -- I mean, there seems to be not a lot of limits to the
point where regulators are happy with the solvency. So we'll remain reasonable. But we
have to take into account the fact that we are a global insurer that is considered systemic.
And it is likely that we'll have to retain more capital than a company that is local, even if I
believe that a company that is monoline and local --

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

Is more dangerous.

A - Denis Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

-- is much more risky. That's the not the feeling that's the fashionable feeling among
regulators these days. So we have to take that into account.

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

Do we have any further questions? Do we have questions -- no questions on the phone.
One question here. And another one from Nick.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - William Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Thank you. It's William Elderkin, Goldman. Just one question. On slide A31, where you
show the diﬀerent contributions of why the combined ratio improved year on year, price
increases, expenses. And so on, can you just give a sense of the proportionate
contribution of each of those elements to that combined ratio improvement?

A - Denis Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

So on the price increases, we've mentioned that they were, on average, 2 point -- I mean,
2.6 on personal and 3 point -- okay, Gerald, you want to comment on slide B34?

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Yes, I believe that you get the answer on page B34 by line, starting ﬁrst with personal
motor, personal non-motor. And you can see here the price eﬀect. So the price eﬀect is
minus 1.5 for personal motor, minus 2.6 for commercial lines. Personal non-motor, minus
2.1. So I believe that you get the answer to your question on this page.

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

Nick?

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Nick Holmes at Soc Gen. Yes, just one question. 2015 is approaching. I just wondered -- I
mean, it's such an obvious question, isn't it, what you are thinking about in terms of
Page 26 of 30

replacing Ambition 2015. And what are the real beneﬁts that you've gained from Ambition
2015? And are there any bad things about it? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

Yes, something will come after 2015. And we are already thinking about it. But it's not the
right time to communicate about it. What we want to show you is that we can deliver up to
the very last day on Ambition AXA.
Were there bad things about it? No. I don't think. Were there good things? Yes, because I
think what we have extracted from that is A) a much more aggressive capital management
in terms of internal redeployment.
The -- I'm happy that we've been able, without raising any capital from our shareholders,
to move the portion of the business coming from emerging markets from, I would say, 5%
at the beginning of the ﬁnancial crisis to probably something which is going to be 20% in
2015. So a very, very signiﬁcant shift, especially when you consider the size of the
Company.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second thing is, I think it has enabled us to focus better on the Life side of the
business, on the business segments which were generating both growth and margins,
deemphasizing general account, because interest rates are low. And because it's not
attractive, neither for policyholders, nor for shareholders. And putting more emphasis on
health and protection and unit-linked.
Last but not least, it has helped us understand better -- and this is going to be, probably, a
very major part of the next strategic plan, what could be the impact of the new
technologies on the business. The -- I'm in the camp of those who think that the
combination of big data and digital is going to aﬀect insurance, probably more than many
other sectors, because data, understanding data manipulation and data pricing, is at the
core of what we do.
So if we have the ability to understand better than others, or slightly faster than others, the
way we can use it is going to be a very signiﬁcant competitive advantage on the
manufacturing side of the business.
On the other side of the business, on the distribution side, customers' expectations are
changing pretty fast. And we have been conﬁrmed in our beliefs that becoming truly
multi-access was the right way to create an environment enabling the business to grow.
And there, too, this is one of the positive outcomes of Ambition AXA. And there will be
more to be done in the years after 2015. So this is a short answer to a very, very interesting
and intriguing question. Very good. Blair, last question?

Thanks. Two, if possible. Not many non-Chinese companies have made money in China.
Why do you think you'll be diﬀerent. And how shall we measure your success in terms of
the return on the capital that you're going to invest there over the next few years?

FINAL

And if we have time, you talked about the fragmentation risk for regulators and the risk of
capital add-ons. I guess the biggest risk for Europe surrounds US equivalents. How do
you see that developing? Thank you.

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

On the ﬁrst question, you know the joke about the joint venture seen by a Chinese? It's a
great deal, because at the very beginning what the foreigner is looking for is an
experience in the Chinese market and what the Chinese is looking for is making money.
And a few years later, it's perfectly ﬁne, because the Chinese have the money. And the
foreigner has the experience.
So I don't think it's going to work like that for us. I think the quality of the partners is
something which is extremely important. And the ability of the partner to move within the
Chinese environment is also something very important.

Bloomberg Transcript

As far as we are concerned, it has taken us time, because we started in China now more
than 15 years ago. But with ICBC on the Life side, I think we have the best possible
partner. They are the largest bank in China. They are professionals. They understand the
way you manage a distribution system. And they have a very large chunk of the Chinese
retail banking market.
So their aspirations are very high ones as far as our joint venture is concern. They want it
to be proﬁtable as quickly as possible. And we have good reasons to think that the
venture is going to be breakeven in around end of this year, which would be pretty fast,
given the time it normally takes for a live business to become proﬁtable when it starts
from nothing.
If I look at the other venture, the one we are starting now with Tian Ping, we think they are
great partners, both because of the quality of their teams and their ability to cooperate
with our direct teams. And because of their ability to understand the Chinese regulatory
environment.
It took us a very -- well, a very long time. It took us twice as long to have the ICBC deal
approved by the Chinese authorities as it took us to have the Tian Ping deal approved.
And this is not just the learning curve of the AXA teams. It's also the maneuverability of
the Chinese teams within their own system. So we are pretty conﬁdent there that we are in
the right hands.
Have said that, it remains China. So the uncertainty and the risk are still there. Not going
to deny that. But I think it's the price to pay for the potential reward. That's for the ﬁrst
point.

FINAL

Just one additional point. So Henri mentioned breakeven on the life said this year. We
expect breakeven on the P&C side in '16, which means that this company was proﬁtable
before we did the JV.
But we jointly have a plan to accelerate our growth and that means that we accept to
make losses, because we'll invest substantially on the marketing side to have a sizable
direct operation. And, I mean, these investments in China are long-term investments. And
we believe that it is the right thing to do to accept to invest for the future.

A - Henri de Castries

{BIO 1439683 <GO>}

Potentially, the reward is huge, because it's the largest automobile market in the world.
The -- it's primary equipment. And the ability to gain sophisticated Chinese clients
through the Web is real. And they are buying -- I mean, they are not buying cheap cars.
They are buying very expensive cars. So in terms of average premium over time, this
should be quite interesting.

Bloomberg Transcript

Of course, other people are going to try to do things. If you look at what Alibaba is trying
to do with Tian Ping, I mean, we will face competition. But I think it's an opportunity we
will be absolutely a fool to miss.
On your second point, regulatory fragmentation, if I look at our worry list, there are two
things which are worrying me and where I think the regulators do not have, at this stage, a
holistic view of what's going on in the ﬁnancial markets. It's ﬁnancing of the economy in
Europe. And it's understanding the beneﬁts of diversiﬁcation.
It's very clear. And Denis has alluded to that, that one of the basic codes of insurance is
that diversifying the risks is reducing the risk proﬁle, not putting all your eggs in the same
basket.
That's the reason for which large groups, diversifying their risks on a geographical basis
and by business line have been successful, not only AXA. But Zurich, Allianz, others. If you
start to fragment the market by building barriers within what is supposed to be single
market, you just make this model less eﬃcient. And I'm not sure that this is the right thing
to do in the long run for the stability of the system.
It's precisely -- I mean, if you look at the AXA experience, it's precisely because there was
a real fungibility of capital that we have been able to do deals which were good for us, for
our shareholders. And good for the markets.
We do not have bought Equitable, we would not have bought Guardian, we would not
have bought Nippon Dantai, we would not have bought National Mutual, which were
companies in a diﬃcult situation, if the ﬁnancial markets had been fragmented, with
regulators trying to keep the capital local.

FINAL

And the instability of the system, therefore, would have been greater, because the
number of bankruptcies would have been higher. So I think they underestimate the
beneﬁt of diversiﬁcation. And this is wrong.
The second point where I think progress needs to be made is they cannot ask us, on one
hand, to increase our ﬁnancing of long-term investments and at the very same time, all
things equal, put capital charges on these long-term investments which have nothing to
do with the reality of the risk, as it is the case today for infrastructure investments and
securitizations.
So these are two elements which are creating uncertainty and some frustration your part,
on our part these days. But we need to have further discussions with them to try to come
to a common understanding of what would be a reasonable framework. I hope it will
come.
If it doesn't come. And, in particular, in Europe, if we see very fragmented markets, with
regulators trying to build buﬀers everywhere, it's going to be a bad story, because it's
going to be lower growth of earnings, lower growth of revenues, lower protection for the
policyholders.

Bloomberg Transcript

Remember the story, I mean, the joke I was telling you ﬁve or six years about the squirrels
in the forest. I mean, if they mutualize the nuts, they survive the winter. If they are selﬁsh
and keep their nuts for themselves, two of them are going to die, one of them is going to
survive. Not an optimal system. So we are for the mutualization of the nuts. On this note, if
we don't have any additional questions, I think we'll stop. Thank you very much.
