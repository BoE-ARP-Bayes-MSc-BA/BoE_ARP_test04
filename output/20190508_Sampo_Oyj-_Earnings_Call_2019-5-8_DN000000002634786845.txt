Presentation
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this conference call on Sampo's First Quarter 2019
Results. My name is Jarmo Salonen, and I'm the Head of Investor Relations at Sampo. And
with me at this call, I have our Group CEO and President, Kari Stadigh; CEO of If P&C, Mr.
Morten Thorsrud; and Group CFO, Knut Arne Alsaker.
As has become tradition, I'll ﬁrst-hand over to Kari with his -- for his highlights on the ﬁrst
quarter developments, but let me remind you before that that you can follow this call at
sampo.com/results, and a recorded version of the call will later be available at the same
address. Kari, please.

Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Thank you, Jamro. Welcome to the conference call on my behalf as well. Well, what do we
have in front of us now after the ﬁrst quarter. First of all, we have a very strong results in
our insurance operations, especially in the P&C insurance. With a combined ratio of 86.5%
in If and 78.2% in Topdanmark. Both either best ever or on par with best ever for the ﬁrst
quarter results. Also Mandatum Life performed well with the result on the same level as

the corresponding quarter of the previous year. However, one has to take into account
that EUR54 million was used to lower the discount rates. All in all, very strong results.
Secondly, the strong rebounds in equity markets impacted our total comprehensive
income signiﬁcantly. We report EUR561 million for the ﬁrst quarter, which actually is more
than half of what we reported for the full year 2018. In If, it is also noteworthy that the
number of retail clients continues to grow in all markets. In general, there is a healthy
premium growth for both If and Topdanmark.
Our P&C operations are performing better than ever on plan or above. Nordea's numbers
have been available already for a while and I see no need to comment on this. From an
owners' perspective, the important thing is the new Board composition and the new
Chairman nominated by the AGM. It is too early to see any results of their work. However,
I'm convinced that their input will be critical when crystallizing the potential for the
improved performance we expect to see going forward.
As we have received several pretty technical questions on capital prior to this call, I would
like to stop here and handover to Knut Arne, who will give a short summary on the
regulatory issues over more technical nature.

Bloomberg Transcript

Knut Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Thank you, Kari. As you have seen in our Q1 report, our solvency ratio deteriorated during
the quarter despite the growth in own funds due to good results on the insurance side of
our business and high investment returns. The deterioration is due to an increase in our
capital requirement related to our 21.25% holding in Nordea. The increased capital
requirement is coming from a signiﬁcant increase in Nordea's REAs risk adjusted assets,
following the bank's redomiciliation to Finland.
To include a bank in the Solvency II capital regime gives unwanted consequences. As part
of the remedy for our reduced solvency ratio, we have this afternoon announced that we
are looking to issue some hybrid capital out of Sampo plc. This will stabilize our solvency
ratio short-term and increase our excess capital long-term. In addition, we are looking to
reduce our holding in Nordea to below 20%, and by doing so, treat Nordea as an equity
investment in our solvency calculations. This will signiﬁcantly reduce the capital. We have
to commit for owning shares in Nordea.
The standard capital requirements for O-SII's stocks in the Solvency II regime is 39% of
market value. The SCR related to Nordea as of end of Q1 for Sampo was equal to 80% of
Nordea's market value. There are some technical discussions related to change in the
treatment of Nordea, which we currently are having with our regulator. These discussions
have progressed during the last few weeks, and we expect to revert to our Board with
conclusions from these discussions at the Board's next meeting in June. We expect that
the solution will be so that our solvency ratio will exceed the level it was set at the end of
2018.

FINAL

I feel that this is really a technical issue and a regulatory issue where our structure is such
that in a way we feel -- we feel that fall between shares and I think that now we have on
the table enough remedies for these issues of a pure technical nature, because of course,
where Nordea move their headquarters to Finland, our risks as an owner didn't increase
at all. So this is -- this whole discussion is more of a technical nature, but now we have the
remedies -- in our toolbox, we can choose how to proceed more of that then in June.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Youdish
Chicooree from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good afternoon everyone. I've got three questions, please. The ﬁrst one is on, since the
trends in P&C, you reported a ﬂat combined ratio, but if you adjust for prior the release in
large claims, it is slightly up year-on-year. So I was wondering, is this due to weather or are
there any underlying trends that got to us relative to last year? So that's my ﬁrst question.
The second one is on solvency. You already give us some indications in your opening
comments. So I was just wondering, I mean, your solvency -- your group solvency ratio is
not a reﬂection of the cash generation or dividend capacity of the underlying business
units. So I was wondering how would the ratio cross that 120% minimum threshold you've
talked in the past your thinking on the Group dividend? So that's my second.
And my last question is, ﬁrst to come back on solvency. I was just wondering, to secure
the deconsolidation of Nordea from a solvency perspective, is it as simple as going below
20% or are there any aspects where the regulator, for example, do they want to see
whether you have control over Nordea or having a signiﬁcant inﬂuence or is it just a
question of being -- of having just a lower shareholding?

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Okay. Morten Thorsrud here. I'll answer the question on the Gjensidige part. We reported
a net combined ratio of 86.5%. For the ﬁrst quarter, this is an excellent combined ratio
bearing in mind that this is the ﬁrst quarter and inter quarter. The large claims outcome
was EUR5 million higher than what we assume to be normal, which is actually in line with
what we also saw last year and the prior year gains was 3.8, down from 3.9 -- 4.8 sorry,
down from 4.9 last year. So it means that if you adjust for that, there is a small
improvement in the combined ratio and then obviously this winter eﬀects are quite
diﬀerent across the Nordic region.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay. So -- because that improvement you're talking is all coming from expenses. So your
cost ratio, your loss ratio would still be slightly up?

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

FINAL

It'll be on last year level.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay. So stable basically versus last year in terms of underlying margins?

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

On your second question, regarding Group dividend. When it comes to internal
dividends in the Group, the subsidiaries are strongly capitalized, and of course, Nordea
also had excess capital on their side. So I do not see a link between the consolidated
solvency capital and the internal dividends within the Group. When it comes -- and of
course, we expect this to be solved by the year end. So also when it comes to the external
dividend, our dividend to our shareholders on Sampo, we do not expect this to play a
role when we decide on the dividend -- when the Board -- AGM decide on that dividend
next year.
When it comes to the technical matters, there's a number of technical matters we currently
are discussing as I'm referring to with the regulator. That is also based on the fact that we
actually have two capital regimes that we are under, both the ﬁnancial conglomerate
directive and Solvency II regulations. And these two are two diﬀerent regulation, meaning
that there are a few things that we just need to have clarity together with our regulator
before we can proceed with the plan, I referred to in my opening comments.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

All right. Congrats. Thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jakob Brink from Nordea. Please go
ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Thank you very much and good afternoon. Two questions from my side. Sorry for one of
them coming back to internal dividends. There has been a lot of talks also recently about
whether Nordea can pay out more than 100% which consensus estimates are now
indicating. One thing is, of course regulation, but secondly, if I'm not remembering

Page 4 of 16



Company Name: Sampo Oyj

Date: 2019-05-08

FINAL

wrong, it seems like historically you Sampo have had an ambition to keep payout ratios
below 100%, does that also go for Nordea this year? That was the ﬁrst question.
Second question is regarding run-oﬀ gains. You're not the only one to have seen
signiﬁcant run oﬀ gains this quarter and I tried to calculate your ratio greater from last year
and it seems like it's dropped a lot indicating may be you're building signiﬁcant reserves.
So is it fair to assume that we should continue to see an elevated level of run-oﬀ gains
going forward? Those are my questions. Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Thank you, Jakob. As you are actually well aware of, I can't answer on Nordea, anything
else than what they have communicated, and Nordea has communicated that their
ambition is to increase the dividend year-after-year.

A - Knut Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

And then on the run-oﬀ gain, yes, we report 4.8 in run-oﬀ gain this quarter, which is in line
with what we reported Q1 2018. But also as you say, somewhat above the more longerterm run-oﬀ gains that we've seen in the past. The run-oﬀ gain is of course driven by the
fact that we're seeing a more positive development on old underwriting years than what
we had assumed in our models. And of course, we're not speculating on future one-oﬀ
gains that depends on the continuing claims development whether that continue to
develop more favorable than what we have assumed in our reserving models.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Is there any speciﬁc sectors driving it?

A - Knut Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Yeah, it's obviously the long tailed exposures that we have. Among those motor insurance
in Sweden, is the most long tailed, and of course, where you will see some volatility on the
run-oﬀ gains if your assumptions on the claims development is diﬀerent than what you
actually experience.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank.
Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes, good afternoon. A question on the dividend as well. As it looks now more likely that
Nordea may have to cut its dividend and assuming that Sampo Group wants to maintain

Page 5 of 16

the increasing dividend policy, would this dividend shortfall be covered by higher internal
dividends from If and Mandatum Life or increasing the net debt in the holding? Thanks.

FINAL

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I don't have an indication that Nordea has changed their guidance for dividend. So I don't
really want to speculate on that. I feel conﬁdent that we can stick to our own ambition to
increase our dividend yearly.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Fair enough. But if, let's say, the Nordea still increases their dividend by EUR0.01 which
would be in line with their policy, still increasing the Sampo dividends, would imply that
you would actually have to get the increase somewhere else. Would this be done mainly
from higher dividends from If or Mandatum Life for increasing the debt? What do you
think is the preferred alternative?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I think that we have room to increase the dividends from our subsidiaries if necessary.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Ryan from Bloomberg
Intelligence. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Kevin Ryan

{BIO 1814771 <GO>}

Thank you, and thank you for being so clear on the capital. I just have one ﬁnal question
on that if I may. Could you share with us what going forward, your ideal Solvency II level
would be? And the second question which is prompted by your reduction in your Nordea
or proposed reduction on Nordea stake, is -- has this prompted you to think about any of
your other investments such as Topdanmark? Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

May be I'll start with other investments. These has nothing to do with our investments. The
reason why we would distribute Nordea shares as dividends is only the regulatory
technicalities, and therefore we don't want to sell any of our holdings, we -- and therefore
we wouldn't like to sell Nordea either, we would like to pass them on to our shareholders.

A - Knut Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

And if I should take the ﬁrst question, we haven't set an exact range of what would be an
ideal solvency ratio. I'm comfortable that the solution we believe we will have from
changing the calculation basis of Nordea will bring us above -- way above a minimum
solvency ratio. It gave us plenty of excess capital, and with the stability of the earnings we

have in the businesses that we own, that would just add to our view of our excess capital
position.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Huttner from JP Morgan.
Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you so much, and really well done on the combined ratio. That's unbelievable,
that's wow anyway. So on the combined ratio, I just like to -- lots of questions. But the ﬁrst
one is, this year even though the number was the same as last, you actually improved
your outlook by a lot to 85% to 88% I think versus last year where the minimum range, I
think it was 86% to 89%. So I just wondered, if you can explain where this conﬁdence
comes from relative to last year? And more color on the combined ratio the lovely to be in
and may be you could explain how come Sweden, which is a big country had a 78%
combined ratio, I cannot believe it. This is -- yeah -- it's -- particularly in winter. So those
are the two questions.
And then on the Nordea. When you start selling, temptation will always be to sell more
and I just wondered once you've done this special dividend through or whatever, what
just stop you the thinking, we sold some and solvency went up and it didn't seem to hurt
any, maybe you can sell some more. You see that here. I've seen it in so many companies,
when you start selling an asset, you -- your mindset changes. I suppose that the technical
question, if I try to put it more formally, would be -- at what level would there be a risk for
you being able to appoint the Chairman of Nordea? Thank you.

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Okay. I'll answer your two ﬁrst questions on the If performance. Yes, we delivered an
excellent combined ratio for the ﬁrst quarter in line with what we see so last year, 86.5%.
That's excellent. We do see also a strong growth of 3.9% if you adjust for currency eﬀects
and part of that growth is driven by price actions and it's fair to say that the price actions
are somewhat above expected inﬂation which means that we have a good outlook for
their P&C insurance business and that's why we are guiding on a combined ratio level of
85% to 88% for the full year, which is somewhat better than what we guided after Q1 last
year.
When it comes to your question on the combined ratio in Sweden, yes, it is indeed very
low and I think it's fair to say it's exceptionally low, because a larger part of the run-oﬀ
gains that we see in ﬁrst quarter stems from Sweden, and in particular, from motor
insurance in Sweden. So that is obviously supporting the Swedish combined ratio,
nevertheless, underlying combined ratio level is at a decent level in Sweden as well.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Morten did -- last year, if I remember, the winter was in a way diﬀerent from this year, it
lasted much longer into the spring into the second quarter. Had that any eﬀect on your
view on guidance or is that just so minor things that it doesn't aﬀect it?

FINAL

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

It has some eﬀect. Of course, it's early to conclude on what will happen in Q2, but of
course, I guess, we can conclude that winter is over. Of course there could be other
events taking place in Q2, but the winter in 2018 is more special in the respect that it
lasted well into Q2. So of course that is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence Q2 this year versus last
year.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

On your second question or third question on how we view the value of our assets, I think
that we have to separate two very diﬀerent things. One is that, we are in a regulatory
hiccup or we are, as I said, between the chairs that the regulatory framework really
doesn't or is not built for a structure that we have. And therefore and as Knut Arne said,
we have two diﬀerent answer regulations that aﬀect our solvency. So the solution we are
now proposing is not to sell Nordea at all. I repeat, we are not selling we are -- because
we don't want to sell. So we are dividending out Nordea shares to our owners if we go
that route. And that is not the stance on the value of Nordea as such. This is a solution for
a regulatory issue.
I think that, then if you -- your second question was that, how much should we own of
Nordea and able to inﬂuence the Board composition and Chairman. It doesn't work that
way that we count percentages. I think that when I'm on the chairing the norm comm [ph]
of Nordea, I feel that I represent all shareholders there, and of course I want the Board
composition to be the best possible and the Chairman to be the best possible person for
that job. And I actually think that after Bjorn had chaired it and the Board had taken all the
big decisions on redomiciling, ramsiﬁcation, derisking Baltics, Russia, it's a long list. Then
it was time to focus more on operations and now we put our best man from the
operations side to chair it, because we feel that's exactly the qualities of the Chairman
Nordea should have. And I don't think that has to do with our percentage of ownership.
You must remember that the norm comm when proposing this Board composition, and
for instance (inaudible) part of it, it was unanimous. And I think someone even expressed
that they were very happy that Torbjorn took the task to be the Chairman of that
Company. We have said earlier that we are not a Group where we are in love with any of
the assets. If the assets are -- if we see a value in the assets that someone is willing to pay
us which is above what we can accomplish with our own work, we are obliged to sell the
assets. But Nordea's case is of course the complete opposite. We see a lot of upside and
we see a lot of upside that can be created through pure operational management work
and that's the task the Board has taken. So it's not a question of how we see the value. It's
clear that we see a signiﬁcant upside in the share.

I'm not sort of the Chair the banking regulators quite as comfortable, anyway, thank you.

FINAL

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blair Stewart from Bank of America.
Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon. I've got a couple of questions. Firstly, just on the fair value
adjustment reserve which has gone up in the quarter. How do you see economic value in
that? How we use those unrealized gains in the coming years?

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, just on the non-life business and looking at the reserve to premium ratio, which
is a very good measure, I accept, but it is signiﬁcantly higher than some of your peers?
And I just wondered if you've done any comparative work to compare the level of
reserves that you have compared to some of the peer group? It does suggest that you're
very heavily reserved against peers, does that business mix impacts or I just wonder if
you've observed that and if you've got an explanation for that?
And ﬁnally just coming on to the Nordea dividend point, and I wouldn't expect you to
comment on Nordea may or may not do with its dividend, but conceptually -- if you look
at the estimates in the market conceptually, how do you feel as owners about Nordea
potentially paying out more than 100% of its earnings to fund the dividend? Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Well, if I start with Nordea, so -- it's as an owner, I think that we have followed the
guidance from the bank, and as an owner we are happy if Nordea delivers on what they
guide. In the end, I don't want to talk about bank regulation, but the fact is that over the
last 10 years Nordea has been able to meet all capital requirements from the regulator
from its own cash ﬂow and that means that there we have accumulated billions of euros
into Nordea as capital from the proﬁts.
And if the bank is not growing and once the bank has met all the regulatory requirements,
it means that the cash ﬂow generates extra capital which the bank really doesn't need. So
that's just a comment I have that. Then it's more a political question of how the surplus
capital is treated in Europe, but the fact is that Nordea's capital generation capacities of
the level that at one moment there will be excess capital, because I don't assume that the
regulator will for an indeﬁnite time increase the capital requirements. That would not -that would also be detrimental for the development in the society.
On the fair value I didn't really understand your question. Fair value is a result of increased
valuations in the stock market and dropping interest rates. It's normal buﬀer in our
accounting.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

It wasn't a great question Kari I said, but it was more a care question of whether you see
that ﬁltering through to the P&L at some point or whether it's just a book value item?

FINAL

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I think that if we sell assets when we think that they are fully valued or over valued, then it
will come into the P&L.

A - Knut Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Then on your P&C Insurance question, the reserve to premium ratio is quite diﬃcult to
compare between companies, because as you were indicating yourself, it is highly
dependent on the business mix. And even on a mix between countries, for instance, the
Swedish motor insurance again is one of the most long-tailed businesses in all of Europe.
So having big exposure towards Swedish motor and Swedish bodily injury claims, it gives
you a high reserve ratio to premiums. So it's quite hard to compare that between
companies.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah. That's ﬁne. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jan Erik from ABG. Please go ahead.
Your line is now open.

Q - Jan Erik

{BIO 16874081 <GO>}

Good afternoon. I have a couple of questions on the If P&C business, if you could shed
some light into that. You answered the Swedish improvement on the combined ratio from
78% -- from 88%. Could you also shed some light into what happened in Norway from
82.5% to 93.7%. While Finland and Denmark looks sort of more fairly and suddenly on the
private versus commercial industrial segments, could you also shed some light into how
and where -- how the combined ratio has changed so much over the year ﬁrst half? Thank
you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yes, I'll start then with Norway. The diﬀerence in outcome for Norway 2018 Q1 versus 2019
Q1 is quite simply explained by the large claims outcome. Last year in ﬁrst quarter we had
a better outcome than what we assume to be normal in Norway. This year, we have a
somewhat worse large claims outcome in Norway compared to what we assume to be
normal. And of course, these impacts combined ratio quite a lot in the ﬁrst quarter, in
particular.

Q - Jan Erik

{BIO 16874081 <GO>}

It could be 3 to 7 percentage points?

Yes, yes.

Q - Jan Erik

{BIO 16874081 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

And then you had a question on combined ratio development on private and --

Q - Jan Erik

{BIO 16874081 <GO>}

Commercial and industrial which looks the same, but of course it could be the same kind
of explanation?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yes, it's -- commercial is somewhat impacted by large claims. This year they have
somewhat more large claims than normal. Industry is actually having somewhat less large
claims than normal, but they have somewhat negative development on some prior year
losses, some development on the single large claims. And of course, again being a ﬁrst
quarter, it's kind of give some volatility in the ﬁgures.

Q - Jan Erik

{BIO 16874081 <GO>}

On the private side, it's mainly the run-oﬀ gains Sweden which is entitled to the progress
on the motor side?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yes, a larger part of the run-oﬀ gains come from motor as I said. And again, a larger part
of that will be in the private business area.

Q - Jan Erik

{BIO 16874081 <GO>}

If you could just elaborate on the trend underlying for private, commercial and industrial?
Could you shed some light into what you have seen in the quarter?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I think no particular trend as such in the quarter. I think we do see good price discipline
across the Nordics and we do see that pricing is somewhat above expected inﬂation at
Page 11 of 16

the current level. And of course this diﬀers a lot from country to country and business area

Q - Phil Ross

{BIO 20618440 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. Just one point of clariﬁcation on me -- from me,
sorry, and it's revisiting solvency. The detail you gave at the start of the call is very helpful.
Just thinking about the regulatory discussions that are obviously ongoing and then the
potential Nordea divestment which you have to decide upon, I wonder if you're thinking
about those two things separately, particularly when you talk about the impact on capital
moving above where it was at the year-end. So for instance, is it with the regulatory
discussions alone, if they were successful, whatever that might look like that they would
move the ratio above 147% at year-end or you thinking about those two things together
are not necessarily projecting exactly where our solvency will end up? Thank you.

A - Knut Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Not sure I exactly understand your question, but I understand it so that whether or not we
sort of combined a reduction in our shareholding of Nordea with the change in solvency
treatment and that is combined. We expect that we will have to reduce our shareholding
in Nordea to below 20% to change the solvency treatment.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Solvency treatment will change as a consequence to the fact that we go below 20%
automatically.

Q - Phil Ross

{BIO 20618440 <GO>}

I just wondered on the regulatory discussions whether that was sort of something material
in that which if you didn't change the Nordea stake, then the regulatory discussions might
be on something diﬀerent and they could move you above say 147% or is that -- might
think about it in too much detail that they all sort of weaved in together?

FINAL

There is a few diﬀerent things, but that is sort of, we still -- there will be -- the change in
the solvency treatment will be as a consequence of going below 20%. So it's not a change
and remain with 21.25% we're talking about. That is a change following reduction of our
shareholding below 20%.

Q - Phil Ross

{BIO 20618440 <GO>}

Yeah, okay ﬁne. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Blair Stewart from Bank of America.
Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you. Just a quick one. I'm just curious as to why you are swapping the senior -- will
stop that if the sell down of Nordea is going to be highly signiﬁcant, I was thinking on
your solvency, I always thought that alone would be enough. So interested in the decision
to raise capital qualifying debt at the same time? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Well, we have a possibility to issue this -- so more hybrid capital just in terms of the room
for utilizing hybrid capital both in our solvency calculation and rating calculation and we
are happy with the current leverage levels we have. And there is a, as you allude to Blair,
there is 500 senior that is maturing now in May. This hybrid will stabilize the solvency
ratio, which will otherwise deteriorate 1st of July when the SRB is introduced, and when we
have changed to solvency treatment, the hybrid capital would further increase our excess
capital position long-term.

Q - Phil Ross

{BIO 20618440 <GO>}

Yeah, presumably the SRB would only matter if you still consolidate it to Nordea.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

That is correct.

Q - Phil Ross

{BIO 20618440 <GO>}

Okay. All right. Thank you.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Thanks. Just one from me, I mean, on the P&C business, things are obviously progressing
very well from a top line perspective. You're adding customer numbers, the greatest level
constant FX is good, it creates 4%, retention is coming up. You also was saying your
pricing had a claims ratio, which is the ﬁrst time we've heard that from you guys for a
while, I mean that -- what do you attribute that -- it's a bit of an improvement, is it
investment in the brand, the distribution, is it just market conditions improving, and more
importantly how sustainable do you think that is? Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yes, I think as you point out, the large part of the growth is actually coming from improved
retention levels across the business areas. But, in particular, in business are private. I think
a large part of that is coming from hundreds of internal improvements, making it easier
and better to be a customer at If. And at the same time, I think the competitive
environment is stable and I must say with somewhat more pricing discipline than what you
perhaps have seen in earlier years. So that of course is also supporting that. And of
course, again since a large part of the growth is driven by high retention, we also expect
to see a fairly positive development also going forward.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Great, thank you.

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is a follow-up from Michael Huttner
from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thank you very much for this opportunity. It's really a second question. I just wondered if
you could give an indication, when you say higher -- solvency would be higher than the
full year, I just wonder if you could give an indication of what you mean, suppose the
more detailed question is not that important as you refer to Solvency II or conglomerate
solvency, but any kind of indication would be precious, but it is a ﬁshing question.

A - Knut Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

We are referring to Solvency II since we expect us not to be a ﬁnancial conglomerate
following that change or a reduction below 20% and the Solvency II ratio was 140% as of
year-end. I wouldn't be too worried of also referring to the ﬁnancial conglomerate ratio,
which was 147%.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

FINAL

Q - Jan Erik

{BIO 16874081 <GO>}

Thank you. Just trying to square the equation on the solvency. If you take the 80% as you
referred to earlier on the (inaudible) which is the requirement and take the 39% which is
the new sort of requirement if you go below 20%, should we go then be above 180%
solvency ratio or is that too high?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

180% sounds a bit too high. There's a couple of things, additional moving parts which you
have to take into consideration. Two of them is actually neutralizing each other, more or
less depending on our issuance of hybrid capital where we will pay a dividend which we
have -- or in a formal Nordea shares which will reduce our capital base by that amount
500, and then we intend to issue hybrid capital whatever exact amount that will be.
And also one adjustment you have to make in your calculation is the fact that the current
own funds base which we use in our solvency calculation, it's somewhat higher than our
share of the market cap of Nordea which will be currently which would -- everything else
equal, be a negative adjustment on the ratio. The increase I was referring to -- or the
decrease, sorry, in the SCR because of a lower capital charge would signiﬁcantly out way
that reduction in own funds and of course could also move the beating other way around
if the Nordea share price and currently market cap would be above our current owned
funds. So with that simple calculation you did, it is somewhat above what I would consider
to be a good pro forma calculation.

Q - Jan Erik
