Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect.
Your host for today's call is Prem Watsa, with opening remarks from Eric Salsberg. Mr.
Salsberg, please begin.

Good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss Fairfax's 2013 Third Quarter results. This call
may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ, perhaps materially from
those contained in such forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of
uncertainties and risk factors, the most foreseeable of which are cited under risk factors in
our Base Shelf Prospectus, which is being filed with the Canadian securities regulators and
is available on SEDAR. I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Prem Watsa.

Thank you, Eric. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Fairfax's Third Quarter
conference call. I plan to give you some of the highlights and then pass it on to Dave
Bonham, our CFO, for additional financial details.
Our insurance companies are doing very well, with a combined ratio of 93.4% in the Third
Quarter, and 93.9% in the first nine months of 2013. We continue to be soundly financed,

with quarter-end cash and marketable securities at the Holding Company of $1.1 billion.
However, we were affected in the quarter with mark-to-market losses on bonds because
of rising interest rates in the quarter and a mismatch in our equity portfolios between our
common stocks and our hedges.
The Russell 2000 Index, used for much of our hedging, was up about 10%, while the S&P
500 index was up about 5%. Our common stock portfolios were up in the 6% range, not
dissimilar to the S&P 500, but significantly less than the Russell 2000. Our long-term
performance, as you know, has been in excess of most indices.
As you know, on a quarterly basis, we get fluctuations in our hedging. But over time, it has
been very effective, and we expect the mark-to-market losses in this quarter to reverse
over time. In the meantime, we continue to be protected from a significant decrease in
the equity markets.

Our insurance and reinsurance businesses continue to expand profitably. Net premiums
written by the Company's insurance and reinsurance operations in the Third Quarter of
2013 increased by 3.9%. As I said, the combined ratio for our insurance and reinsurance
operations in 2013 was 93.4% for the Third Quarter and 93.9% for the first nine months.
At the subsidiary level, the percentage increase in net premiums written in the Third
Quarter, compared to the Third Quarter 2012, and the combined ratios were as follows -OdysseyRe, a 7% increase in net premium, with a combined ratio of 87.6%; Crum &
Forster, 1.8% increase in net premiums, 99.3% combined ratio; Northbridge, 1% increase in
the net premium, 101.5% combined ratio; Zenith, 12.4% increase in premium with a
combined ratio of 96.8%; and Fairfax Asia, a 1.3% increase in net premiums and a
combined ratio of 80.9%.
During 2013, many underwriting initiatives have been implemented, but I wanted to
highlight the progress of a couple of companies. Zenith, which has demonstrated many
times over the years its ability to manage the underwriting cycle has done it again -- cut
premiums during the soft market years, 2008 to 2010; combined ratios for them,
because of the lesser premium, has increased, driven by higher expense ratios; others,
participants, competitors have entered the markets to grow their business significantly.
As the industry's underwriting loss increases, prices begin to increase, reserves develop,
and peer companies exit the industry, which is what is happening today. Rates continue to
increase and Zenith continues to grow its exposure base. Zenith cut its premium base
from $1.1 billion to about $450 million, when we bought it in 2010. It now writes
approximately $700 million, and it's rising. Over time, I have no question it will write more
than $1.1 billion.
Although Crum & Forster's gross premiums written remain flat for the first nine months of
the year, its more profitable specialty business was up almost 11%, while its standard lines
business was down 33%. This has led to a 2.5% improvement in their combined ratio year
over year.

FINAL

Fairfax Brazil, a start-up in 2010 with zero premium, has built a first-class operation over
the last three years, with approximately 60 people. For the nine months of this year, the
company has written $115 million gross, $48 million net at a combined ratio approaching
100%. We expect Brazil to be a contributor to our overall underwriting profitability well into
the future under Jacques Bergman and Bruno Comargo's leadership.
Odyssey and Fairfax Asia, of course, continue to hit the ball out of the park, with excellent
combined ratios. We continue to grow, depending on the company. As we have said
before, very low interest rates and the reduced reserve redundancies mean there's no
place to hide for the industry.
Combined ratios will have to drop well below 100% for the industry to make a single-digit
return on equity with these low interest rates. While the short term is always tough to
predict, fundamentals, we think, will eventually play out.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, in terms of the investment area, net investment losses of $828.6 million in the Third
Quarter of 2013 consisted of the following -- please note table on page two of our press
release. Net losses on equity and equity-related investments of $478 million was after a
$816 million net loss on our equity hedge. Because of the mismatch between the Russell
Index and our portfolios, we expect the trends to reverse over time.
This happened before in the Fourth Quarter of 2011. The realized loss of $577 million on
our equity hedges was due to the sale of common stocks and, consequently, a
permanent reduction in our hedges, and also the reduction of our hedge ratio to our
target 100%. On a year-to-date basis, our net equity losses, after our equity hedge, was
approximately $300 million.
As we have mentioned in our annual meetings, annual reports, and quarterly calls, with
IFRS accounting, where stocks and bonds are at market and subject to mark-to-market
gains or losses, quarterly and annual income will fluctuate significantly and will only make
sense over the long term.
Because of rising interest rates in the quarter, we had $215 million in unrealized mark-tomarket bond losses, a majority of which are in munis in short-buy Berkshire Hathaway. We
consider these unrealized bond losses as fluctuations and expect them to reverse over
time. Our muni bond portfolio was, as you know, was mainly acquired in the last quarter of
2008 at an after-tax yield of 5.79%.
The core inflation continues to be at or below 1% in the United States and Europe, levels
not seen since the 1950s. This is in spite of QE1, QE2, and QE3. Our CPI-linked derivatives,
however, are down 76% from our costs and are carried on our balance sheet at $130.5
million, even though they have almost eight years to run.
Our CDS experience comes to mind. When you review our statements, please remember
that when we own more than 20% of a company, we equity account; and above 50%, we
consolidate, so that mark-to-market gains in these companies are not reflected in our
results.

FINAL

Let me mention some of these gains. As you can see on page 13 of our quarterly report -that's page 13 of our quarterly report -- the fair values of our investment in associates is
$1.752 billion versus a carrying value of $1.409 billion, an unrealized gain of $343 million not
on our balance sheet. Also, we own 75% of Thomas Cook, 74% of Ridley, which are
consolidated in our statements.
Unrealized gains on market values as of October 29, 2013, on both these positions, is
approximately $146 million. That's total unrealized gains, not reflected on our balance
sheet, is $490 million.
Finally, Euro Properties, an investment we made in an exceptional Greek REIT with
outstanding management, where we have increased our investment through their rights
issue, has another unrealized depreciation of $141 million as of October 29, 2013, and that
also is not included in our balance sheet.
So when you add all of that, we have a total of $631 million of unrealized gains that are not
on our balance sheet. Of course, all of this works out in the long term, so take these
mark-to-market fluctuations as just that -- fluctuations that will have no impact in the long
term. The worst mark-to-market loss we've had was in the Fourth Quarter of 2011, of $915
million, again, when the Russell 2000 significantly outperformed the S&P 500.

Bloomberg Transcript

As I've said before, the Company held in excess of $1.1 billion of cash, short-term
investments and marketable securities at the Holding Company level at September 30,
2013. We continue to be approximately 100% hedged in relationship to our equity and
equity-related securities, which include convertible bonds and convertible preferred stock.
We continue to be very concerned about the prospects for the financial markets and the
economies of North America and Western Europe, accentuated, as we have said before,
by potential weakness in China. As we have said now for some time, we believe there
continues to be a big disconnect between the financial markets and the underlying
economic fundamentals.
As of September 30, 2013, we have over 30% or $7.2 billion in cash and short-term
investments in our portfolio to take advantage of opportunities that come our way. As a
result, in the short term, our investment income will be reduced.
Now, I would like to turn it over to Dave Bonham, our CFO, so he can give you some more
information on the underlying financials. Dave?

Dave Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Thank you, Prem. First, I'll focus on Fairfax's consolidated results for the Third Quarter of
2013. Then, I'll move on to the operating company results, and finish with the consolidated
financial position.

FINAL

For the Third Quarter of 2013, Fairfax reported a net loss of $572 million, or a net loss of
$29 per share on a fully diluted basis. That compares to the Third Quarter of 2012 when
we reported a net profit of $33 million, or net earnings of $0.84 per share on a fully
diluted basis.
Year to date, the Company reported a net loss of $568 million. That translated into a loss
of approximately $30 per diluted share in the first nine months. That compares to net
earnings of $125 million in the first nine months of 2012, or approximately $3.80 per fully
diluted share.
Fairfax's underwriting results have shown significant improvement in the Third Quarter and
first nine months with our insurance and reinsurance operations reporting combined ratios
of 93.4% and 93.9%, and underwriting profits of $105 million and $275 million during those
respective periods. That's a year-over-year increase in our underwriting profit of $33
million in the Third Quarter and $154 million in the first nine months of 2013.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the Third Quarter and first nine months of 2012, we reported combined ratios of 95.5%
and 97.2%, and underwriting profits of $72 million and $121 million. So that improvement,
representing about 2percentage points on the quarter-to-date and 3percentage points
on the year-to-date combined ratio, principally reflects increased net favorable
development of prior year's reserves, partially offset by slightly higher catastrophe losses
in 2013.
In terms of reserve development, we experienced $86 million and $228 million of net
favorable development in the Third Quarter and first nine months of 2013. That benefited
our combined ratio by approximately 5 combined ratio points in each of those periods.
That's a little bit more than double the amount of net favorable development we
experienced in the Third Quarter and first nine months of 2012. Excluding the benefit of
net favorable development, our accident year combined ratios were 98.8% and 99% in
the Third Quarter and first nine months of 2013, and that compared to 97.9% and 99.3% in
the Third Quarter and first nine months of 2012.
Current period catastrophe losses increased modestly in 2013 relative to 2012 and, in the
Third Quarter of 2013, amounted to just over $74 million, adding 4.7 points to the Third
Quarter combined ratio. In the first nine months of 2013, catastrophe losses amounted to
$218 million and added just about 5 points to the combined ratio.
Third-quarter catastrophe losses of $74 million were principally comprised of the impacts
of the Toronto floods affecting Northbridge and OdysseyRe, with consolidated losses of
$28 million; the Germany hail storms, primarily affecting OdysseyRe, with consolidated
losses of $17 million; and an additional $15 million of reserves in the Third Quarter that
related to the Second Quarter Alberta flood event.
On a year-to-date basis, that brings our catastrophe losses on the Alberta flood up to $67
million, primarily at Northbridge and OdysseyRe. Our underwriting results in the first nine

FINAL

months also included catastrophe losses of approximately $29 million, stemming from the
central European floods.
As mentioned by Prem already, net premiums written by our insurance and reinsurance
operations increased in the Third Quarter and first nine months of 2013 by 3.9% and 3.7%.
The 3.7% increase is prior to giving effect in the first nine months of 2013 to two unearned
premium portfolio transfers at OdysseyRe related to a specific quota-share reinsurance
contract. I wanted to note for you that page 53 of our Third Quarter interim report
contains a detailed discussion of these transactions, including their impact on OdysseyRe
and Fairfax.
Now, turning to our operating company results, starting with OdysseyRe. In the Third
Quarter and first nine months of 2013, OdysseyRe reported an underwriting profit of $84
million and $258 million, and combined ratios of 87.6% and 85.6%. Underwriting profit in
the Third Quarter of 2013 was slightly lower year over year, reflecting higher catastrophe
losses.

Bloomberg Transcript

Underwriting profit in the first nine months of 2013 increased by about $26 million, and
that reflected increased net favorable development, partially offset by increased
catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses in the Third Quarter and first nine months of 2015
(sic; see previous comment "2013") of $50 million and $138 million were principally
comprised of the Germany hail storms and flooding in Toronto in the Third Quarter, and
the Alberta floods and the central European floods in the first nine months of 2013.
OdysseyRe's combined ratio in the Third Quarter and first nine months included the
benefit of $26 million, or 4 points, and $80 million, or 5 points, of net favorable
development, principally related to favorable emergence on prior year's catastrophe
losses. OdysseyRe wrote $730 million of net premiums in the Third Quarter of 2013, up
from $682 million in the Third Quarter of 2012, an increase of 7%, or $48 million, principally
reflecting increased writings of US crop insurance.
Moving on to Crum & Forster. Crum & Forster's underwriting results improved in the Third
Quarter of 2013, with the improvement even more pronounced in the first nine months of
2013, on lower operating expenses, higher net premiums earned, lower catastrophe
losses, and the absence of net adverse reserve development in 2013.
Crum & Forster reported underwriting profit of about $2 million in the Third Quarter and
an underwriting loss of about $3 million in the first nine months of 2013. That compared to
underwriting losses of $4 million and $26 million in the Third Quarter and first nine months
of 2012. Current period catastrophe losses had a nominal impact on Crum & Forster's
combined ratios, which were 99.3% in the Third Quarter and 104% in the first nine months.
Net premiums written by Crum & Forster increased by 1.8% in the Third Quarter of 2013.
That primarily reflected a shift towards more specialty lines of business and away from
standard lines of business, primarily in the areas of workers' compensation where pricing
was considered inadequate.

FINAL

Turning to Zenith. Zenith reported significant improvements in its combined ratio, which
decreased from 114.7% and 116% in the Third Quarter and first nine months of 2012, to
96.8% and just over 100% in the Third Quarter and first nine months of 2013.
The improvements reflected the following -- year-over-year decreases of 9.4 and 8.7
points in the accident year loss ratios in the Third Quarter and first nine months of 2013,
and that reflected earned premium price increases that were in excess of estimates of
loss trends. Secondly, net favorable development to prior year's reserves of 4.6 and 3.7
points in the Third Quarter and first nine months of 2013. That development primarily
relate to the 2012 accident year.
Finally, decreases in the expense ratio of 3.9 and 3.4 points in the Third Quarter and first
nine months of 2013, and that was as a result of 11% and 13% increases in net premiums
earned year over year. Net premiums written by Zenith of $144 million and $574 million in
the Third Quarter and first nine months of 2013 increased year over year by 12% and 13%
reflecting premium rate increases.

Bloomberg Transcript

Northbridge's combined ratio experienced a slight deterioration from 100.7% in the Third
Quarter of 2012 to 101.5% in the Third Quarter of 2013, but improved from 103.6% in the
first nine months of 2012 to 100.8% in 2013. In both the Third Quarter and first nine
months of 2013, Northbridge's underwriting results reflected increased net favorable
development of prior year's reserves, partially offset by higher year-over-year currentperiod catastrophe losses.
Northbridge's combined ratio included the benefit of net favorable development across
most accident years and lines of business of $45 million, or 18 points, in the Third Quarter
of 2013 and $108 million, or 15 points, on a year-to-date basis. That compared to net
favorable development of $24 million, or 10 points, in the Third Quarter of 2012, and $51
million, or 7 points, in the firsts nine months of 2012.
Catastrophe losses in the Third Quarter and first nine months of $22 million and $56
million related to the flooding in Alberta and Toronto. These two events together added
approximately 7 points to the combined ratios in the Third Quarter and first nine months
of 2013. In contrast, catastrophe losses in the Third Quarter and first nine months of 2012
were significantly lower, approximately $9 million and $15 million, adding 3.3 and 2 points
to the combined ratios during those respective periods.
After adjusting for the impact in the first nine months of 2012 and 2013 of the intercompany unearned premium portfolio transfers between Northbridge and Group Re that
we describe on page 46 of our Third Quarter interim report, net premiums written by
Northbridge increased in the Third Quarter and first nine months of 2013 by 4.4% and
5.9%, when expressed in Canadian dollars, reflecting increased premium retention
following the termination of that quota-share reinsurance contract and modest growth in
writings at Federated Insurance, partially offset by slightly lower writings at Northbridge
insurance.

FINAL

Fairfax Asia's combined ratio improved from 83.2% and 87.9% in the Third Quarter and
first nine months of 2012 to 80.9% and 87.3% in the Third Quarter and first nine months of
2013. On a year-over-year basis, net premiums written by Fairfax Asia increased by 1.3%
and 5.2% in the Third Quarter and first nine months of 2013.
The combined ratios of the insurance and reinsurance other division improved from
102.5% in the Third Quarter of 2012 to 96.4% in the Third Quarter of 2013, and improved
from 102% in the first fine months in of 2012 to 98% in the first nine months of 2013.
Runoff reported pretax losses of $113 million and $256 million in the Third Quarter and first
nine months of 2013, that compared to pretax profits of $13 million and $146 million in the
same periods last year. The year-over-year decrease in profitability primarily related to
net investment losses in 2013.
Our consolidated interest and dividend income decreased from $101 million and $336
million in the Third Quarter and first nine months of 2012, to $61 million and $273 million in
the Third Quarter and first nine months of 2013. This reflected the combination of sales in
2012 of higher-yielding bonds that were replaced with lower-yielding short-term
investments and the impact of sales of dividend-paying common stocks in 2013.

Bloomberg Transcript

The Company recorded a recovery of income taxes of $212 million and $413 million in the
Third Quarter and first nine months of 2013, representing effective income tax
recoverable rates of 27.1% and 42.3%. The higher effective tax rate in the first nine months
of 2013 primarily related to significant pretax losses in the US, where tax may be
recovered at the US tax rate of 35%; and that's a substantially higher rate than the
Canadian statutory income tax rate of 26.5%.
Moving to our financial position. Our total-debt-to-total-capital ratio increased to 28.6%
from 25.5% at December 31, 2012, due primarily to additional debt issued, net of
repurchases, in the First Quarter of 2013 and the decrease in our common shareholders
equity during the first nine months. We have $183 million of OdysseyRe debt maturing in
November 2013, which we funded by the issuance of debt in the First Quarter of 2013.
After repayment of the OdysseyRe debt in November, on a pro forma basis, our debt-tocapital ratio is expected to be approximately 27.5%.
Now, I'll pass it back to you, Prem.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Wanted to ask you about Northbridge. If you look at the accident year combined ratio for
Northbridge, I mean, 2013 has been another tough year. Granted some of that has been
related to cats, but I think even if you factor that in it's still not a great year relative to your
other underwriting businesses.
You mentioned that competitive conditions remain challenging, so that's probably fair. A
three-part question for you on Northbridge. A, do you see any early signs that competitive
conditions in Canadian P&C are easing, i.e. are rates starting to firm following 2013 cat
events? B, are there Company-specific actions that you're taking that could lead to an
improved accident year combined ratio in 2014? C, would you ever consider trading this
asset for a higher margin business in a different market?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Thank you, Paul. First of all, yes, the accident year combined ratios are higher, I think ran at
115%, but you'll notice there was -- we have very significant reserve redundancies. Our
reserve -- our accident year combined ratios are high, but on the other side, our
redundancies are also high. So we're very careful in our reserving and over time that
accident year combined ratio will reflect the underlying conditions. We're very, very careful
in terms of reserving. We want to be sure that the reserves are appropriate.
In terms of your first question, in terms of the industry changing, Canada's always lagged
the United States. The US first moves up and then Canada follows. We have had the
catastrophes, the Calgary floods, the Toronto storms. Rates are not going down. They're
going up some. We think it will improve over time. This applies to the United States, too.

Of course in some areas like, I was talking about Zenith, workers' compensation, many,
many companies in the United States have taken reserve increases. Big reserve charges
have been pretty well in the course of being put into runoff, and so the price increase that
Zenith enjoys is in the 15% area. You had to have not written a lot of business during the
soft markets to be able to take advantage, like Zenith is doing today. We think that will
follow in Canada, too.
In Canada, we have our Northbridge is segmenting the markets and being more focused
on certain target markets, and so we think over time our combined ratios will be well
below 100% under Sylvie Wright's leadership. As far as selling any of our companies,
Northbridge, Fairfax Asia, Odyssey, any of them, Brazil, we've said specifically, Paul, clearly
in writing in our annual report, none of our companies are for sale. Any of our subsidiaries,
insurance subsidiaries are not for sale, we are going to hold them forever. Secondly,
Fairfax itself is not for sale. I've said it very clearly to companies. I have in my voting
interest, I consider it to be a controlling interest, and I said to our shareholders that if
someone comes in with a price twice today's price, I wouldn't sell. That's enough said for - this is our 28th year. I've said that four or five times over that time period.
Paul, yes, none of our companies is for sale. Because of that, we enjoy a huge amount of
loyalty from our people. I've said this also before. The presidents of our companies, who
have run our subsidiaries, we've never lost one president, never lost one president who
has been successful in our operation. We've had retirements, early on in our 28 years,
we've had for competence. We've had people that would leave us, but people who have
been successful have been with us for a long time. Andy Bernard, the better part of 20
years, Brian Young, the better part of 20 years, on and on and on. Sylvia Wright's been
with us the better part of 20, also.
For all those reasons, it's a very big competitive advantage, we think, to have our
subsidiaries owned forever. That it will never be sold, so our presidents can look after the
operations not having to look back and see if the head office will decide to sell them
because of they have a year or two of poor performance. I want to be very specific. Thank
you, forking for asking that question, Paul. I want to be very specific to all our shareholders.
Next question.

Howard Flinter, Flinter and Company.

Q - Howard Flinter
A few years ago we pondered what kinds of underwriting ratios industry-wide would
generate enough returns to attract competition. In the recent week, I've seen three
companies, including Chubb with historically respectable underwriting disciplines,
underwrite in the, say, 85% to 89% rate and their annualized rates of return on
moderately leveraged equity are between 8.5% and 11%, well 8.5% and 12%. So even 85%
to 89% doesn't generate a high enough return to attract a whole lot of competition. 8.5%
or 9% or 10% is not really exciting.

That indicates to me, I'd like you to comment, that indicates to me there's still plenty of
room on the upside in rates. Is that correct?

A - Prem Watsa

That's not a bad comment, Howard. The only problem with our industry, over long periods
of time hasn't made good returns on equity. I think Chubb or other companies that have
been in business for 25 years, if you look at their returns, they've been in that 10% area,
plus, minus, unlike other industries, including the S&P 500, which has had 14% and 15%
return on equity. But your point's well taken. That's why with these low interest rates you
have to have low combined ratios like combined ratios much below 100%, to even have
any chance of making a 10% return. You say 8.5% to 11%, making a 10% return. Every time
a bond, a five-year bond matures, and mostly the investment portfolios of insurance
companies are invested, like a five-year bond.

Yes. They're pretty short.

Every time it matures, Howard, the investment income drops.

Q - Howard Flinter
That's right.

A - Prem Watsa

So this is going to continue, and the pressure to make a return will be very significant. To
get a really hard market, in our experience over the last 30 years, is that you need to
have an event. You need to have something that happens either on the liability side, on
the insurance side, obviously, a big catastrophe or something like that. Or, on the other
side are the investment portfolios, like if you have spreads suddenly widening. Like we
have very few corporate bonds today.
One of the reasons is the spreads are very tight, and so if spreads widen, people are
reaching for yield, not only in the insurance business but all over the United States and
Canada and perhaps the world. As these lower interest rates prevail. Well if spreads
widen significantly, there will be losses in bond portfolios and so -- and I mentioned our
CPI deflation swaps. Inflation is very low today, in spite of QE1, QE2, QE3 and lots of fiscal
stimulus, inflation is in that 1% area. The most recent number in Europe was 0.7%. So if you
-- and it takes some time before deflation sets in.

We continue to, Howard, worry about deflation. Of course, if that happens we don't do
too badly because of these swaps that we have. We've protected ourselves for some
time from all of these events. It doesn't show in our statements, but we're long term in
building value.

Q - Howard Flinter
Monetary velocity in the United States is the lowest on record. The record being roughly
110, 115, 100 years, I forget the exact period.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

I think that's right, Howard, yes.

Q - Howard Flinter
That is deflationary in itself. One other event I was going to add is, if 2014 has a
downward year in the stock market, that could be the event that you're pondering.

That would -- that's the sort of environment we're protecting ourselves against, Howard.
Of course, no one knows what will happen in 2014.

Q - Howard Flinter
Exactly.
