Presentation
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Aviva PLC's Q3 2020
Investor Update. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator
instructions) I must also advise you the conference is being recorded.
So, I would now like to hand you to our speakers today Company CEO, Amanda Blanc;
and Company CFO, Jason Windsor. Please go ahead.

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

Thank you, operator. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our
Q3 trading update. I really hope everyone has been staying safe and well in these difficult
times. I'm here with Jason, our CFO, who will take you through the Q3 trading
performance shortly. But before I hand over to Jason to take you through the nine months
trading update, I'd like to update you on two key areas. First, the progress we are making
on the strategic options and priorities I set out in August. Second, as I promised we would,
I will take you through the decisions we have made around our dividend. So, in August I
outlined three strategic priorities; focus the portfolio, transform performance, and
financial strength. The first priority is to focus the portfolio on our strongest and most
strategically advantaged businesses in the UK, Ireland, and Canada. These are our core

FINAL

markets where we have market leading positions, can generate attractive returns, and
have the right to win.
For our international markets in Continental Europe and Asia, I said we would manage
these for long-term shareholder value and I was clear that ultimately there may be better
owners for these businesses than Aviva. Since August, I'm pleased to report that we have
made good progress and have already announced GBP2 billion worth of disposals, all of
which will be accretive to capital. We are continuing to work with a clear purpose and are
exploring the options available to us elsewhere. I will touch upon this more in detail at the
-- in a moment. Our second priority is to transform performance and we have started to
make progress on this during Q3. I'm pleased to report that we are delivering robust
growth in our core businesses, especially in the key segments where we can achieve
attractive margins and have long-term growth prospects. We have seen strong life
insurance sales of GBP32 billion including GBP5 billion of bulk purchase annuities in the
year-to-date, which is more than double that of last year.
There has been a 20% uplift in net fund flows in UK Savings and Retirement achieving
GBP6 billion and Aviva Investors delivered GBP1.2 billion of third-party net fund flows. Our
commercial lines net written premium is up 9% building on the double-digit growth we
achieved in 2019. And we are being recognized for our success claiming a clean sweep at
the British Insurance Awards last week winning general, personal, and commercial lines
insurer of the year. This is the first time any company has won all three awards together
and we are very proud that our strong product offering and high service standards have
been recognized in this way during a very challenging year for many of our customers. On
costs, we are on track to exceed GBP150 million of savings for the full-year 2020.
Furthermore, I can confirm that we will deliver the GBP300 million cost savings target by
full-year 2022 from our core markets of UK, Ireland, and Canada and we will not rely on
any of the disposals to achieve these savings.
What is abundantly clear to me, however, is that Aviva needs to deliver meaningful
change in order to truly transform our performance. We are already taking actions across
a number of fronts. For example rationalizing the number of products and legacy
platforms, simplifying, automating, and digitizing more of our customer journeys,
removing the layers of bureaucracy, accelerating the reduction in our property costs, and
investing in our underwriting claims and sales capabilities. But we need to continue
identifying the changes that are necessary and we need to execute them efficiently and
effectively. My colleagues will tell you that they are clear on what is required and the
change is underway. However, despite some initial success, transforming the performance
of Aviva will take time and there is a great deal to do, but we're focused on delivery and I
will update you as we make substantive progress.
Our third priority is financial strength. Our Q3 results demonstrate that Aviva's balance
sheet is in robust health. Solvency II capital surplus of GBP11.8 billion. Solvency II cover ratio
of 195%, up 1 percentage point from the half year. Center liquidity of GBP2.8 billion, which
will be further strengthened by the disposal proceeds. I am reiterating my commitment to
reducing Aviva's debt leverage ratio. We are intending to use the aggregate cash
disposal proceeds of GBP1.5 billion from Singapore and Aviva Vita Italy to reduce debt.
And as we continue to work on the portfolio, there will be other opportunities over the

FINAL

next two years to do more of this. Let me now touch upon our portfolio actions in more
detail. We have made good progress since August in our efforts to refocus the portfolio
and have announced GBP2 billion of disposals. In September, we sold a majority of our
Singapore business to a consortium led by Singlife for a total of GBP1.6 billion.
By retaining a 25% shareholding, we hope to benefit from the attractive future potential
of that market and this is consistent with our approach to managing our portfolio for longterm shareholder value. I'm pleased to confirm that we are on track to complete the deal
next week, two months ahead of our original expectation. Earlier this week we announced
the sale of Aviva Vita Italy for approximately GBP400 million with completion expected in
Q2 2021. We have also completed the disposal of our Indonesian business and we expect
to complete the sale of our Hong Kong interest by the end of this year. We are being
decisive, we are focused on delivery, and as you can see one by one we are ticking them
off. Now I think it is worth saying that you shouldn't believe everything you read in the
papers, but I can confirm that we are exploring our options for France, Poland, the
remainder of our Italian businesses, and our joint ventures.
These are complex businesses with multiple stakeholders and I want to be very direct in
saying that it will take time for us to reach a conclusion. We will be disciplined in doing the
right thing for our shareholders and our people. We will continue to manage these
businesses for long-term shareholder value and we will update you as we make progress.
Turning now to dividends. I said in August we would review our longer-term dividend
policy in light of our strategic priorities, the future shape of the Group, and our ongoing
commitment to debt reduction. We are today announcing our new dividend policy, which
we believe will deliver a sustainable and resilient ordinary dividend covered by the capital
generation, cash remittances, and growth from our core businesses in the UK, Ireland,
and Canada. We expect to grow our ordinary dividend per share in the low to mid-single
digits.
Aligned to this new dividend policy, we are announcing an interim dividend for 2020 of 7p
per share, which will be paid on the 21st of January 2021. And subject of course to the
Board's final determination at the time, our current expectation is that the final 2020
dividend would be 14p per share, which will bring the total 2020 dividend to 21p per share.
We will not be distributing a final 2019 dividend. This has been a challenging year with
significant market volatility and we have taken the prudent decision to conserve our
capital and enhance our financial strength to ensure that we are well positioned through
this period of COVID and Brexit uncertainty. We absolutely understand the importance of
dividends to our shareholders, but we believe that now is the appropriate moment to
align our dividend with our new strategy of focusing on the core markets. We have stress
tested our capacity and believe that our go-forward dividend will be sustainable and
resilient.
Future growth in the dividend would be driven by the transformed performance of our
market leading businesses, by lower levels of debt, and from the benefits of focusing the
portfolio. An important component of aligning our new dividend policy to the core
markets is to clearly set out our new capital framework. We have been clear that financial
strength remains a key priority and this is at the heart of our capital framework. Our
Solvency II cover ratio working range will remain at 160% to 180% although we intend that
Page 3 of 17

FINAL

our cover will remain above this range as we go through the process of reshaping the
Group and reducing our debt. We are committed to reducing our Solvency II debt
leverage ratio to below 30% and as we reshape the Group, this will likely result in us
exceeding our GBP1.5 billion debt reduction target. Once we have reached a sub-30%
Solvency II leverage ratio, we expect to return excess capital to shareholders when the
cover ratio is above 180%.
This approach is consistent with maintaining our strong credit rating metrics. in terms of
how we think about deployment of excess capital, we are absolutely committed to
generating strong and sustainable shareholder value. We will look to reduce debt, return
capital to shareholders, and continue to invest in our core businesses where we see
attractive opportunities to do so. We will carefully balance those priorities and I will remind
you that we already have a substantial amount of capital deployed within our core
businesses to support growth.
Now let me hand over to Jason, who is going to take you through the Q3 financial
performance and will provide some more color on the dividend.

Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

Thanks, Amanda. Good morning, everybody. As Amanda just commented, we're making
good progress delivering our priorities. We have strong and resilient businesses in the UK,
Ireland, and Canada and we're confident in our ability to grow in these markets
sustainably and our Q3 results demonstrate just that. Let's look at our core markets first.
In UK and Ireland Life, we grew PVNBP 40% in the first nine months of the year. BPA
volumes were GBP5 billion, an increase of 2.3 times relative to the first nine months of
2019 and 25% higher than our volumes for the whole of 2019. This includes a second deal
with Marks & Spencer for GBP400 million. Bulk annuities is an important franchise for
Aviva. Our brand, strong corporate relationships, and risk management capabilities; all
play an important role in supporting disciplined growth with clear hurdles on IRR and
capital usage.
Health and protection saw a 6% increase in sales primarily driven by price increases in
group protection and health while individual protection trading remained competitive
impacted by COVID-19 disruption. Individual annuities and equity release was down 29% in
the period as the low yield environment continued to impact demand for individual
annuities. Trading and equity release was disrupted by confinement measures. But I would
like to highlight that we won the Personal Finance Award for Best Equity Release Lender
for the seventh year in a row, which is testament to our team and their response during
the pandemic. In Savings and Retirement net flows grew to GBP6 billion, a 20% increase
on the prior year. Our workplace platform continued its strong momentum with flows up
23% to GBP3.8 billion. Net flows were also positive on the retail platform up 5% to GBP2.6
billion. We now have platform assets of GBP31 billion.
Our advisor platform has continued to perform well ranking third with a 10% share of net
flows in the first nine months of the year. Aviva Investors made solid gains with third-party
net flows of GBP1.2 billion and internal net flows of GBP3 billion excluding heritage. In
addition, our liquidity range generated GBP5.5 billion of external net flows over the first

FINAL

nine months compared to less than GBP1 billion in the prior period. Moving on to General
Insurance. Net written premiums were flat at GBP5.8 billion. Commercial lines continued to
perform strongly with growth of 10% and 8% in the UK and Canada, respectively. This is
primarily driven by property and liability rate increases which saw above inflation rate
increases and targeted growth. Personal lines saw a 5% reduction in premiums as we
continued to prioritize margins over volumes together with reduced activity levels from
COVID disruption.
Turning to the next slide and looking at the quarterly trends for our core businesses. Of
course it's been an unusual year as the trends show particularly for individual annuities,
equity release, and protection. In Savings and Retirement, discrete Q3 flows were
resilient, but remained muted compared to Q1 reflecting a cautious sentiment from
ongoing macro and COVID uncertainty. Q3 volumes for BPA were up 43% on Q2 and this
has led to a temporarily lower new business margin due to a timing mismatch with
reinsurance and our target asset mix on those Q3 deals. You might remember we had a
similar mismatch in the first half of 2018 and like we did in 2018, we expect our margins to
have caught up by the end of the year. General Insurance saw lower discrete premiums in
Q3 compared to the prior quarter. This was mainly as a result of seasonality. Margins in GI
were good in Q3 with strong underlying performance in the UK and Canada partly offset
by less benign weather.
Our estimate for the impact of Q3 of COVID-19 net claims on General insurance has
reduced to approximately GBP100 million compared to GBP165 million at the half year.
This mainly reflects further frequency benefits in the third quarter. I would also note that
we haven't had to change our net BI claims estimate on the back of the FCA test case. As
mentioned by Amanda, our international businesses in Continental Europe and Asia are
being managed for long-term shareholder value. This means that we will selectively
participate in these markets and we will withdraw capital where appropriate as seen with
our recent announcements for both Singapore and Aviva Vita in Italy. Life new business
sales in Continental Europe and Asia decreased by 21% overall as a result of COVID-19
disruption and our continued actions to reduce the volume of with-profits business in
France and Italy as part of our manage through value strategy.
As you can see from the chart, there was a marked reduction in life premiums in the
second quarter of 2020 which has recovered somewhat in Q3, but remains below 2019. In
General Insurance, trading has been resilient with net written premiums increasing by 4%
in the first nine months of the year. The higher volume in France in Q1 is a factor of
seasonality. Now moving on to financial strength, which is obviously one of our priorities.
Our Q3 solvency ratio is 195%, well above our target working range. The 1 percentage
point increase in the quarter reflects operating capital generation offset by the payment
of our 6p interim dividend in relation to 2019. We also had to correct the application of a
rule in our French life model, which together with model enhancements to better reflect
negative interest rates had a 2 point impact on the Group solvency ratio and this had an
estimated GBP250 million impact on Group OCG.
It's worth highlighting that our Solvency II position at the end of September does not
reflect the approximately 8 point benefit expected from the announced disposals of
Singapore and Aviva Vita and to be clear nor does it reflect the Tier-2 Canadian debt

issued in October to refinance the Canadian dollar Tier 3 note which matures in May 2021.
Our shareholder corporate bond portfolio has continued to perform well with no defaults
and less than GBP15 million of bonds downgraded below investment grade. This
compares very favorably with the broader market experience. Our commercial mortgage
portfolio is positioned fairly defensively following previous restructurings with solid
collateral and low LTV on new lending. As such it has remained resilient to-date, but we
continue to monitor positions very closely given the uncertain difficult environment.
Performance metrics in commercial mortgages have remained broadly stable since the
half year.
The LTV of the portfolio has not changed significantly while only 2% of the loans are in
arrears at Q3 compared to 1% at the half year. Moving on to center liquidity, which
remained very strong at GBP2.8 billion at the end of October. We will maintain liquidity of
at least GBP1 billion at center. So in normal times this means that ahead of dividend
payments, you should expect Group liquidity to be in the range of GBP1.5 billion to GBP2
billion in line with what we've said previously. It's important to recognize that as we
restructure the Group, Group liquidity is likely to stay elevated not least as it forms part of
our plan to reduce debt in 2021 and 2022. What I want to do with this slide is explain why
we have set the 2020 dividend at 21p per share. To do that, we set out the expected
cash generation from our core business units simply using the same targets from last
year's Investor Day. You can see that the sustainable cash flow from our core businesses
is expected to be in the region of GBP1.6 billion per year.
Once we allow for debt and incentive costs, we have GBP1 billion of excess cash flow.
Please remember this is after growth and investment in the business. This allows for a 21p
dividends with a comfortable GBP200 million headroom. There are additional levers to
drive up headroom including better performance of the core businesses, lower expenses,
the reduction in interest costs from redemptions in 2021 and 2022, and possible options
to reduce our share count. Looking forward, we expect to grow dividend per share at low
to mid-single digits. Crucial to those remittances is the healthy solvency position of our
core subsidiaries on which I will give you some detail on the next slide. On this side, we
set out the Q3 solvency ratios of our three core cash remitting subsidiaries and our
reinsurance mixer. As you can see, all of the solvency positions are strong, all above risk
appetite despite COVID-19 effects and capital markets volatility.
I've also shown the key sensitivities for each of these subs. This shows the resilience to
rates and spreads providing further confidence in the cash outlook and the new dividend
policy. With the backdrop of COVID-19 and wider macro uncertainty, we've delivered
strong growth in premiums and flows in our core markets while maintaining our financial
strength. In the context of the disruption we've seen, these are solid trends. I wanted to
highlight some points as we move toward the end of 2020. We expect the second half
performance trends to be broadly consistent with the first half and management actions
and other to be ahead of previous guidance of GBP0.2 billion mainly owing to UK Life
longevity albeit on its own, the longevity assumption change will be lower than in 2019.
The impact of the Q4 lockdowns across the Group is uncertain, but we are not expecting
any significant increase in BI claims.

FINAL

Savings and Retirement is having a strong year, but growth rates are expected to
moderate due to strong Q4 comparatives. On cash and OCG, we expect the second half
OCG to be broadly in line with the first half after absorbing the France Life modeling
change. While cash remittances in 2020, as I mentioned at the half year meeting, will be
below 2019; but the second half 2020 will be in excess of the second half in 2019, which is
good progress this year.
Thank you. I'll now hand back to Amanda to close the presentation.

Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

Thanks, Jason. So to finish, let me summarize the key points. Firstly, we've made a good
start to simplifying the Group selling Singapore and our major business in Italy. Secondly,
we have a new dividend policy which is sustainable, resilient, and which we intend to grow
by low to mid-single digits based on our core markets of the UK, Ireland, and Canada.
Thirdly, we have solid foundations from which we can transform performance and grow
our business. We have market-leading positions in our core markets and have identified
profitable areas that we can grow, Our robust performance in 2020 demonstrates just
that. There is a great deal to do, but let me reassure you that meaningful change is
underway at Aviva and we are focused on execution and delivery as we seek to unlock
value for our shareholders.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, thank you for listening. Now let me hand back to the operator and we'll open the lines
for Q&A.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator instructions) Your first question comes from Jon Hocking from Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I've got three questions, please. Starting with the
capital return with debt deleveraging target, you talk about potentially returning capital
once the deleveraging target is reached in 2022. Is that the end of 2022? I see you've got
a couple of big bond calls during 2022 so is it possible we start seeing capital flow during
'22 or is it likely to be in '23? That's the first question. Second question in terms of the
proceeds, is the interpretation here that the proceeds minus the debt deleveraging
subject to 180% solvency threshold that everything else will come back to shareholders?
There was an implicit message here there's going to be no materially much in M&A.
That's the second question. And just finally, a little bit more detail. On Slide 7 when you're
talking about the dividend growth, there's a comment that the dividend growth might
benefit from management value portfolio actions. I'm just a little bit confused by all the
dividends being set on these three core businesses. So is there -- am I interpreting that
correctly? Is there any chance that you can see a step-up in the ordinary dividend through
the manage for value? Thanks very much.

FINAL

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Jon. So, firstly I think on the capital returns and the debt deleveraging and
the timeline for that. I mean clearly we're not going to be committed to any timeline
today, but I think what we've said is that we are exploring all the options in terms of how
we manage the manage for value portfolio. We're also being clear that we do intend to
operate within the 160% to 180% solvency ratio and that we will return the excess capital
once we have done our debt reduction, which is a key priority for us. That debt leverage
ratio needs to be below 30% and as Jason outlined in his speech, there are opportunities
that we will have to do that over 2021 and 2022.
But I think in terms of giving specifics on the timeline, I think it's going to be quite difficult
for us to do that. And I think that goes to the heart also of your second question, which is
around the proceeds once we have delevered. So I mean we've said the priority -- it feels
like a broken record I know, the priority is debt reduction so that is what we will do first.
We've said the excess capital will be returned to shareholders, but we've also been clear
about investing in the business. I think that we've already got significant investment within
the business. You talk about M&A, clearly at this point in time we have much on our plate.
We have the priorities as we've set out here, but we will never say never on that. Jason,
did you want to pick up the third question on dividend growth?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

Sure. I think what we've done, Jon, is anchor the core -- the dividend to the core business
and the remittances from those businesses. So, there is nothing baked in for value or
remittances from the manage for value market. So, any remittances or divestment
proceeds or capital withdrawal would be additive to the Group's financial strength so we
could use that to reduce debt or possibly in due course reduce share count, both of which
would be additive to the headroom in terms of cash flow per share.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

Thanks, Jon.

Your next question comes from James Shuck from Citigroup. Please go ahead.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you for taking my questions and good morning, everybody. So, a few things for
me. Firstly, in terms of the debt gearing itself based on a Solvency II basis so actually what
you end up selling anything forward or above own funds will have an impact on that
leverage ratio. So, I'm just confident -- interested to know your confidence in actually
being able to sell things at or above the own funds level? And if you're able to give an
update on the golden ticket situation in France please, that would be very helpful.
Page 8 of 17

FINAL

Secondly, in terms of the investment mix. So your solvency level is well above the target
range, it's more tricky to actually deploy that capital and it depends on cash flow and
overall comments around debt. It's easier to reduce that solvency level by increasing your
investment mix or the risk profile within that investment risk. So, I just want to get an
understanding for how you might deploy that Solvency through the increased capital
funds on the investment side, please. Thank you.

A - Amanda Blanc

Okay. Thank you. So, I'll let Jason pick up your second question. On your first question
around the Solvency II and own funds having an impact, of course that's the case. And I
think what you would have seen there is our disciplined approach to the way that we have
handled the first two deals both in Singapore and in Aviva Vita Italy, which have been
accretive and I think that has been something which we have been very conscious that we
are managing for value and I think that disciplined approach will continue. I think as far as
France is concerned -- as I said for France, for Poland, for the rest of the Italian businesses,
and the joint ventures; we are at the stage of exploring our options, Jason, did you want
to pick up the second point?

A - Jason Windsor

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

Yes. On the golden ticket, I mean there's nothing to say on that. That's actually there's no
new news on. It's behaving very much in line with what we've seen for many, many years
now so there's no new news on that. In terms of capital deployment, we don't have big
plans to re-risk the balance sheet. I think we set out that we've taken that interest rate
exposure wherever we can. We don't think that's rewarded. We reduced exposure at the
margin to equities, we've got property exposures and bond exposures as you would
imagine, which is core and integral to the growth of any insurance company. If there is
reasonable level of risk, then the balance sheet will certainly -- we're not aggressively
positioned as we go into 2021 and deliberately so and I don't see that changing in the
near term.

Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Oliver Steel from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. The first question I guess is really about
timing. It's really hard to understand why you're planning to wait maybe till 2022 before
you actually return some of the excess cash you've got. I mean just if you're going to use
Singapore and Aviva Vita to pay down the maturing debt over the next two years, then
implicitly you've already gotten GBP1 billion above your immediate target for cash flow -for cash. And then I look forward and I can see that you're covering your new dividend
cost out of the UK and Canadian operations by themselves, which means all of the excess
cash flow coming from France, Poland, and the rest of Italy are left alone until you sell
Page 9 of 17

Date: 2020-11-26

them is going to be in excess of that. So, can you explain why you're being so slow in
actually returning any cash rather more quickly? I don't think actually there are any other
questions worth asking because I've asked that.

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

FINAL

Jason, do you want to pick that one up?

A - Jason Windsor

In terms of timing, we're with the first phase. Amanda's been in role four months. We've
managed to announce not complete two divestments, one we expect to complete next
week so it is early days. We are pleased with the progress that we've made so far. As we
go into 2021, that is a very big year in terms of the development of the Company. We
don't want to be drawn today on specifics around capital return. We've got two
redemptions coming up in Q2 where we've got one we've already pre-financed on the
debt side, the Canadian one as I mentioned in the script. We've got two more
redemptions in Q2 about GBP600 million net reduction in Q2. That's sort of step one. As
Amanda mentioned, we've got really big redemptions in 2022. We'll look at all options to
reduce debt, but that is the priority and then depending on how we progress, we'll think
through. But what we wanted to do today is give you a very clear framework for leverage
for cash and for capital so you can take that and make your own assumptions.

Q - Oliver Steel

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

So, if I can just sort of follow up quickly. I mean are you specifically saying there will be no
cash return over and above the normal dividend until 2022 or are you saying that actually
it depends on how things progress?

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

I think what we're saying is that we are at the early stages of exploring the options for the
other markets, in particular France, Poland, Italy, et cetera, And that whilst we do that, we
said that we will keep more capital above our working range and we will focus on the debt
reduction. So, we are just not being specific about the actual timelines today. We're just
giving you the framework, but clearly we will not hold on to excess capital. It is our plan to
return that when we feel that we have completed the work that we need to do.

Q - Oliver Steel

expectation in terms of what happens to the SCR on a Solvency II basis? Should we just
assume that reduces in line with the footprint of the businesses that are being sold or are
there any that are particularly heavy or light from an SCR perspective? Just to try and get
a better handle on the modeling there. Second question is you said low to mid single-digit
growth on dividend. One of your competitors said the same and that translated to
between 3% and 6%, I wonder if you'll be drawn on something a bit more specific. And
finally the UK Life solvency dropped a bit during the year, clearly lots of moving parts, but
I'm just wondering if the increase in bulks had a bearing on that? Thank you.

Okay. Thank you. I'll pick up the second question if Jason picks up the first and the third
question. So as far as the low to mid single-digit growth. No, we're not going to be drawn
on an exact number, it's low to mid-single digits. I think that what we will say is that we are
confident about the ability to be able to do that because if you look at the UK, Ireland,
and Canada businesses; we have seen already from the Q3 performance that there is
this really strong and robust performance there. So, we will continue obviously to do that.
You saw the growth in BPAs, the growth in workplace savings, we see that the commercial
lines market is hardening so we see the opportunity to really capitalize upon that. We also
see the potential to improve the efficiency of the organization so we've already again
made progress there in terms of simplifying, but we also see more opportunity to do that.
Jason outlined that obviously the debt reduction will reduce the interest cost so that gives
us more opportunity to grow it there. And then the real benefit of focus in the portfolio.
So, we have to -- you have to note that we have not assumed any dividends from the
manage for value markets. So we are confident in that but not to be drawn on a specific
number, Blair, but thanks for asking. Jason, do you want to pick one and three?

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

Yes. The SCR intensity of the businesses are very different. So, I think I'll use the example - the two helpful examples, Singapore and Aviva Vita. We sold three quarters of
Singapore for just over GBP1 billion, 1.5 times own funds and got 4 points of capital
benefit. We sold Aviva Vita for GBP350 million approximately and got 4 points of capital
benefit so you can see -- our own funds. So, you can see the difference as it comes
through in the Group that the level of SCR intensity of particularly the Continental
European businesses where the SCR intensity is much, much higher. In terms of UK Life,
yes, obviously it has fallen a little bit, I mean partly that's payment of dividends. We have
got cash in the Group from UK Life, there's a little bit impact from bulks. And the
temporary point that I mentioned has impacted that by give or take GBP100 million of
capital that will unwind relatively quickly in Q4 and the residual, as you might imagine,
there's been a bit of macro uncertainty this year so market levels are still a little bit lower
than at the start of the year.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Good morning all. It's Andrew Crean. Just three questions if I might. When you do decide
to return capital, can you give us some idea as to whether you have a preference for
buybacks or specials? Secondly, could you remind me how you define your 30% leverage?
Is that done on IFRS or own funds and if it's IFRS, is it including goodwill and the surplus in
the pension fund? And then thirdly, this question I'm sure you have every capacity to duck,
but it would be helpful if you could give us some indication. What we're looking -- what I'm
looking at when you talk about France and Poland and the remainder of Italy and JVs, it's
very difficult from the outside for us to assess how much diversification credit will be lost
from the disposal proceeds as you shrink the breadth of the business. If you could give us
some sort of percentage impact of that, it would be really useful. Thanks.

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. I'll pick up the first question and Jason will -- can pick up the second two. In
terms of have we decided about whether or not it's buyback or specials, I think we're not
committing to that or how we will return the capital. But one thing I think we will reassure
you obviously we won't sit on that excess capital. The priority is the debt reduction and
once we feel the Group's in the right place, then we will balance the return to the
shareholders with some investment in our future growth. Jason, did you want to pick up?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

Sure. The leverage ratio is on a own funds basis so that does not include any big
surpluses or any goodwill just to be clear. And then diversification, I mean the proceeds -you said the proceeds would clearly be cash and they wouldn't be affected by
diversification. In terms of the capital benefits, I mean it depends. I think I've said in the
past that on the non-life size that is about 35% reduction in SCR because of the
diversification with the life. I think the life businesses -- the International life businesses
relative to the UK in terms of total SCR reduction is sort of it used to be 10%, it's probably
slightly higher because interest rates have moved around a bit. So, it's somewhere
between 10% and 15% of undiversified SCR is a benefit from diversification from the
international life companies.

Your next question comes from Farooq Hanif from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, everybody. Thank you very much, Hope you're well. Just a couple of questions around
transformation in the UK. So it seems to me that attractive areas on the GI side are to
grow in commercial and particularly around SME and also to look at digitalization and
transformation of UK GI. Can you talk a little bit more about what sort of capital
commitment you would put towards that and what your plans are to accelerate that if

Page 12 of 17

there are any? And then conversely, would you revisit UK sort of legacy back book
disposals in life? What are your thoughts on that? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you for that. So, on the transformation point. So look, I think we do see that
there are a number of opportunities to transform the performance across the UK
business. We already start from a very strong position as the Number 1 commercial lines
insurer and I think we also have some very strong proof points around digitization. So to
just remind you in the plan, we already have over GBP400 million worth of investment in
the core businesses of the UK, Ireland, and Canada. So, there is already investments set
aside to grow these businesses. We've seen good strong growth in commercial lines so
far this year and we see the opportunity to continue to do that as we move forward. Over
50% of our customer journeys have already digitized.

Bloomberg Transcript

We now see the opportunity to take that to the next level and we see the priority as you
know creating the opportunity for our customers to be able to look at all of their products.
So, we've seen the number of logins on MyAviva this year is about 28 million and we've
seen a big increase in terms of the MyAviva app as people are looking at their workplace
pension and then looking at their motor policies or their home policies. So, we see the
opportunity to continue to enhance that customer experience. So, I think it's an important
part of what we do. But we will also allocate capital to the bulk purchase annuity business,
the pensions business. We see that there are strong areas of growth that we are already
strongly positioned in and the market is growing and therefore we have the opportunity
to continue to grow that.
I mean the other area that we will invest in is our brand. We have the Number 1 brand in
UK insurance, which is a great position to be, but we've not invested in that brand over
the last number of years. So, we plan to relaunch the brand next year and we're targeting
the businesses to deliver upper quartile efficiency. So, there's a range of measures
around where we'll allocate our capital and how we'll do it whether it's teams of people,
technology platforms, capital to grow. But I think we feel very confident about the
business and the opportunities that we have there. Your second question around
revisiting the UK legacy business, that is not something that we are looking at at the
moment. We believe that that business has an important role to play in terms of the cash
flow in the UK Life business and I think we discussed that at the half year and that strategy
hasn't changed.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

And just quickly on transformation, I mean basically what you're saying is that sort of major
significant M&A is not on the list.

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

So look, what we're saying is that we've got plenty of other focus areas to focus on at the
moment. And we believe that we already as the Number 1 player in the UK, we are in a
pretty strong position both in GI and in life. But on that, we never say never.

Your next question comes from Greig Paterson from KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Greig Paterson
Good morning, everybody. I hope everyone's safe. Can you hear me?

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

We can. Hi Greig.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Greig Paterson
Yes. I'll do my customary three questions. One is I wonder if you could give us an idea of
what the bulk annuity margin in the third quarter would be if you had normalized for asset
allocation in reinsurance? And the reason I ask this is you said previously that the first half
margin was temporarily boosted by very favorable conditions so I don't know what
normalized margin is for this year. Second question is RSA Intact is a major increase in your
competitive position on a competitor in Canada. I wonder if you could venture some
thoughts on how that would impact you or the competitive landscape in Canada? And the
third thing is just to check. The remittance table that you produced to explain your -- what
your base dividend is, am I correct that the central cost and debt reduction component of
that table is pre-cost cutting and the current debt reduction program?

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

Okay. Jason do you want to pick up the first question on capital (inaudible)?

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

Sure. The first one bounces slightly always the first half or something VNB margin of
around 4% is a pretty decent guide. Clearly Q3 was nothing like that. But as I said, we do
expect it to normalize as we get the assets invested and strike the reinsurance deals.

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

On your second question about RSA Intact, obviously very interesting development over
the last number of weeks. I think in terms of our position in Canada, we already have a
Top 3 position in that market. We see that there is significant headroom for growth
particularly in commercial lines and of course we already have the partnership with RBC,
which is the strongest financial services brand in that market. So, we see really exciting
opportunities to continue to grow there. On your third question, I think it's a relatively
straightforward yes.

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

Company N ame: Aviva PL C

We tried to just give a sense, but it's really anchored on 2020. We have not factored into
that in a significant cost reduction, it's really where we are nor have we factored in
significant debt reduction that will come through as we do it.

FINAL

Q - Greig Paterson
The reason I asked the question is just the new rate or the gross amount includes your
targets for remittances which obviously include the GBP400 million in capital et cetera, et
cetera so I would say adjusted for expectations. But the deduction is not adjusted for the
expectations, which implies that the headroom is actually higher than GBP0.2 million.
That's what I was alluding at. Is that a fair thought process?

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

Well, as I said, we haven't baked in all of the cost saves into the expectation the -particularly in the group figure. That number does bump around a bit due to tax and other
kind of one-off project costs and things. But I think if you sort of annualize '19 and '20 on
average, 0.6 is a good place which is why we use that number. Looking forward we see
that the pressure is down on that for the two reasons I just mentioned, cost reduction
coming through and lower interest costs.

Q - Greig Paterson
Excellent. Thank you very much. Keep well.

And your final question comes from Ming Zhu from Panmure Gordon. Please go ahead.

Q - Ming Zhu

{BIO 17001429 <GO>}

Hi, good morning everyone. Just three questions please. First, your nine months solvency
position cash and central cash all look very strong. What is holding you back from not
paying any more of the full-year '19 final dividend? And my second question is going
forward just on your -- based on you running the business on your core focused market,
what is the minimum and central liquidity you would need at center? And the third
question is in terms of the BI, I think there's a comment you mentioned on the BI as more
cost paying out due to the recent lockdowns. And in terms of the recent policies you've
sold the new business, have you changed all your BI wordings? Thank you.

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. I'll pick up one and three. Jason, you can pick up two. So in terms of fullyear '19 so I think we are keen to say today that we are back in the business of paying
dividends that we have declared the 2020 7p per share interim dividend and given an
expected total 2020 dividend of 21p per share. So, we recognize the environment. It's
been a challenging year. We took a prudent decision earlier this year in discussion with the
regulators and everything else to conserve our capital position and enhance our financial
strength to make sure that we were well positioned through the period of COVID and

Brexit uncertainty. And I think that from today really what we want to do is to look ahead
and we're just reinforcing the financial strength as one of our key priorities.
On your third question around business interruption, there were two parts to that
question. Have we changed the policy wordings? I think our policy wordings on the whole
largely very clear, but changing the policy wordings will require us to go through a renewal
period. So, we will be making sure that all the policy wordings are very clear as we renew
policies and many of the larger policies as you will know renew either the 1st of January or
end of March, beginning of April. As far as the business interruption estimates are
concerned, what you see is that our business interruption estimates have actually not
changed. What you're seeing is the benefit of frequency coming through in the numbers,
which I think Jason outlined. Jason, on the solvency and central liquidity?

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

I think what I said in my script, I'll just go over again. We aim to have a GBP1 billion
minimum in Group treasury before dividend payments and the like. That means for the
reporting dates, which tend to be just before we announced dividends, you'll see a figure
in the sort of 1.5 to 2 range and that's where we're pretty comfortable for liquidity. And as
we look further forward and the Group's a bit smaller, we'll revisit that, but that's sort of
the level you should expect certainly over the next couple of years.

And you have one more question from the line of Steven Haywood from HSBC.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Thanks very much. I just wanted to ask a couple of quick questions please. On the
(inaudible) French solvency rule, could you tell me what the impact was in the actual the
French local solvency ratio, please? And then secondly on the assumptions you have in
your solvency ratio about credit downgrades, defaults, and UK property. Can you provide
an update on the actual experience performance versus your assumptions and whether
or not there's potential for these assumptions to be improved in the future? Thanks very
much.

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

Jason, would you like to take that?

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

I'll take the second first if I may. On the downgrade assumption, we kept that in at Q3 as I
said it was something like 10% of BBBs and 5% of As that were downgraded. That stayed.
And we've seen about 7% in the first nine months of the year. So, I think it's actually
reasonably prudent now. We started to see agencies catch up and I think that will be -Page 16 of 17

that will bring us up with events probably by the year-end and we would need to have
overlays, but clearly we'll take our decisions carefully. On the French side, what we've
disclosed today is the impact on the Group 2 points solvency there and we aren't
providing the disclosure in France. What I can say is it was a specific issue to France and
the French subsidiary does remain well capitalized and we don't expect any capital needs
in the French sub as a consequence of this.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks for the update.

A - Amanda Blanc

hopefully at some point, we'll actually get to physically see you. But thank you very much.
