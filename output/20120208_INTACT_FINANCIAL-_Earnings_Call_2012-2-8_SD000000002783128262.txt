{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Thanks, Dennis. This morning we announced a Fourth Quarter net operating income of
CAD152 million or CAD1.14 per share. That is 61% higher than last year reﬂecting an
excellent underwriting performance. Our combined ratio of 92.7 is a reﬂection of strong
underwriting results across all lines as a result of disciplined deployment of our strategy as
well as relatively mild winter conditions.
From a topline perspective, we reported premium growth of nearly 50%, reﬂecting the
addition of AXA Canada and a rebound in our organic growth. As anticipated, our earlier
decision to restart marketing in the Ontario direct channel proved successful, generating
growth of 4% in the Fourth Quarter versus a decline of 4% last quarter in this channel.
Overall our underwriting performance and steady investment income resulted in an
operating ROE of 15.3%, while book value per share increased 12% from a year earlier.

Bloomberg Transcript

We ended the year in a solid ﬁnancial position which enabled us to increase our quarterly
dividend by 8% to CAD0.40 a share. This marks the seventh consecutive year of dividend
increase for IFC's shareholders.
When it comes to our outlook for the industry, growth for the industry last year appears to
have played out as we had anticipated. After nine months, the industry has recorded 6%
growth in auto, primarily driven by Ontario; 8% in personal property in reaction to years of
heavy weather-related losses; and 3% in commercial lines. As the drivers behind this
growth will likely continue to impact 2012, we expect similar growth in the coming 12
months.
The low interest rate environment and reinsurance market conditions should support our
outlook and will likely lead to ﬁrmer conditions over time.
From an underwriting perspective again after nine months, the industry is tracking to
about a 102% combined ratio. For 2012, we anticipate some improvement in personal
lines, resulting from reforms in Ontario as well as continued premium increases while
commercial lines should remain relatively steady. Overall, we anticipate that the industry
will report a breakeven underwriting result in 2012.
Turning to the industry's ROE, we do not expect material improvement in the near term
from the current 7% level that it stood at through three quarters. Although underwriting
might improved slightly, we anticipate this would be oﬀset by the negative impact on
investment income from the low yield environment.

FINAL

Looking speciﬁcally at Intact Financial, we strongly believe we will continue to outperform
the industry's ROE by at least 500 basis points, our stated objective.
When it comes to auto Ontario, in the reforms as well as our own initiatives to combat
fraud continue to yield the beneﬁts anticipated. Throughout 2011, we have referred to an
expected loss ratio improvement of about 12 points within 18 months of reform. With only
one quarter remaining in this timeline, we maintain our view that these beneﬁts should
materialize as outlined.
However, we remain disciplined in this market and maintain our caution for two reasons.
First, we continue to believe that the degree of uncertainty of the potential outcomes in
the mediation or dispute process warrants continued monitoring. Second, a court
decision in December allowed the stacking of physical and psychological impairments
when determining catastrophic injuries.
Although Ontario auto industry results for the ﬁrst nine months of 2011 show meaningful
improvement, we estimate that the combined ratio for the industry in that province is
likely still ranging between 105% and 110%. As such, the level of approved rate changes
for the industry announced in the past few quarters is a positive sign but further rate
action is likely without further meaningful improvements in results.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our proﬁtability gap with the industry in that province remains strong at about 14 points,
which aﬀords us the ﬂexibility to continue our actions to improve growth. Outside Ontario,
while conditions remain stable, we are monitoring trends of increased pressure on
existing legislation and reforms.
In personal property, losses from catastrophes primarily relating to a severe wind storm in
Calgary during the quarter amounted to CAD24 million. Overall, cat losses totaled CAD32
million, in line with the bottom of our expected range, given the larger size of our
Company post the acquisition of AXA. For the full year, the combined ratio in that line of
business was 103.5% an unacceptable long-term level but one that included about 15
points of cat losses.
We continue to monitor and adapt the increasing level of severe weather occurrences in
order to create a sustainable competitive advantage.
Pricing conditions in commercial lines remained very competitive. We expect modest
improvement over time, likely to be driven by catalysts including continued low interest
rates, ﬁrmer reinsurance conditions. And the fact that the industry's loss ratio deteriorated
by nine points after nine months in 2011 in that line of business. However, we do not
anticipate meaningful improvements in the short term.
Mark will provide an update on some of the metrics related to the integration AXA
business. But let me make a few comments. Overall I would say that our integration is on
track. I am pleased with the response we continued to see from employees, brokers. And
customers. This is important because ensuring that brokers and customers embrace our

Page 3 of 21

Date: 2012-02-08

FINAL

oﬀer and continue to receive top-notch service is really important, particularly during the
integration phase.
Bear in mind that we remain in the early stages of the integration and the Fourth Quarter
did not provide enough information to determine an ongoing success rate. We believe
we will have a good visibility in three to six months as customers receive our product
oﬀering and the associated price changes that come with moving from AXA to the new
oﬀer from Intact Insurance.
I want to take this opportunity to thank our people from coast to coast for the huge eﬀort
going into our continued industry-leading service to both brokers and customers despite
what is an incredibly fast-paced integration.
In conclusion, I believe the importance we place on underwriting results will continue to
serve us well in the current low interest rate environment. Given the quality of our
operational platforms, the ﬂexibility provided by our ﬁnancial position. And the
combination with AXA Canada, we believe that we will continue to outperform the
industry and strengthen our leadership position.
With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Mark Tullis.

Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles. Today we announced strong operating income driven by improved
underwriting results. Earnings per share of CAD0.62 were down from a year ago,
reﬂecting restructuring and integration expenses as well as a contingent consideration
payable to AXA France. On an adjusted basis, excluding acquisition-related items, we
recorded EPS of CAD1.14, up from CAD0.96 a year ago.
As a reminder, our agreement for the acquisition of AXA included a contingent
consideration which requires us to pay up to an additional CAD100 million based upon
the development of AXA's 2010 year-end reserves. After our review of their reserves and
on the heels of a favorable Fourth Quarter, we recorded a payable of CAD89 million.
CAD48 million as an increase in the purchase price and CAD41 million as a nonoperating
expense in the quarter. If the AXA business continues to develop favorably in the future,
we would take additional charges to nonoperating income up to a maximum of CAD11
million.
Topline growth of 49% was excellent. We estimate that the addition of AXA Canada
contributed approximately 45 points of the increase in premiums and the recovery in our
organic growth contributed the rest. As Charles mentioned, AXA retention is holding up
so far but it is early. So we remain cautious. In three to six months, we should have a much
better idea of the true retention.
Slides 8 and 9 show results by line of business. In personal auto, growth in premiums
beneﬁted from the addition of AXA as well as a rebound in our organic growth. Our
93.3% combined ratio was almost 10 points better than a year ago, reﬂecting beneﬁts

FINAL

from Ontario reforms, our antifraud measures. And relatively mild winter conditions. The
improvement came despite less favorable prior-year claims development in part to reﬂect
the recent Ontario court decision that Charles mentioned.
Growth in personal property was helped by what we estimate was a slight upturn in our
underlying unit growth. The 88.6 combined ratio reﬂects our continued focus on
improving the results in this line of business, mild winter weather and a more normal level
of cats versus the elevated level of the past two quarters.
AXA's contribution was most evident in our commercial lines business as premium growth
reached 78%. The commercial auto combined ratio remained strong at 93% and
commercial P&C remained solid at 95.7% despite lower favorable claims development.
On the investment side, net investment income of CAD103 million in the Fourth Quarter
was up 45% from a year ago as a result of the additional investments related to AXA.
However, declining yields continue to oﬀset the underlying asset growth and the marketbased yield of 3.9% was down from 4.1% in Q4 2010. We expect the declining interest
rates to negatively impact our market-based yields in the coming quarters.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our ﬁnancial position remained solid at the end of 2011 with an MCT of 197%, CAD435
million in excess capital and book value per share of CAD29.73, 12% higher than a year
ago. We ended the quarter with a debt to total capital ratio above our target level.
However, we intend to allocate most of the CAD300 million proceeds from the January 1
sale of AXA's life insurance business towards reducing our debt. As a result, our debt to
total capital ratio is expected to be back in line with our target early in 2012.
As Charles mentioned, we have made good progress on the integration of AXA Canada.
Essentially all business is now being issued on Intact systems and we are closely
monitoring the renewal action of AXA customers. We maintain our CAD100 million aftertax synergies target and expect to reach this run rate progressively by the second half of
'13 with an CAD18 million run rate already secured in 2011 and a CAD50 million run rate
expected by the end of 2012.
During the Fourth Quarter, we recorded CAD42 million of restructuring and integration
expenses, bringing the full year 2011 level to CAD71 million. Because of accounting rules,
the amount expensed in Q4 was below our expectations but our overall view of these
expenses has not changed. We expect the majority of the remaining integration expenses
to be charged in 2012.
On the reinsurance front, we increased our cat coverage to bring the combined entity's
coverage back up to our standard and we continue to expect short-term supply chain
beneﬁts to oﬀset the CAD15 million cost of bringing AXA up to our standard.
In summary, our disciplined pricing, underwriting, investment. And capital management
have positioned us well for the future. We continue to expect the acquisition of AXA
Canada to be accretive to net operating income per share in 2012 and by 15% in the

midterm. With the progress made to date on the integration, we are well on the way
toward building a world-class P&C insurer.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Dennis.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Tom MacKinnon, BMO Capital.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple questions. One with
respect to the CAD18 million run rate in the synergies. But at the end of 2011, do you know
what the actual synergies would have been in the quarter? I can't imagine they would
have been CAD18 million because the run rate probably at September 30 was pretty well
zero. Do you know what that was in the quarter? I've got a couple follow-ups.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

A little short of 10.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay, with respect to the CAD15 million in the reinsurance, is that going to be already in
the First Quarter results of 2012?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Were there any supply chain beneﬁts in the Fourth Quarter? How do you expect to get
these supply chain beneﬁts in over -- is it going to be an equal oﬀsetting adjustment that
we should expect over the CAD15 million cost?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes, I think, Tom, if you start with the CAD15 million, it's ceded premium and ceded
premium here kicks in January 1 on a 12-month basis. You will get the full CAD15 million
additional spread over the full year.

Page 6 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2012-02-08

I think it's important to point out that the overall cost of the reinsurance program went up
by about CAD30 million. The other CAD15 million being general price increases on the
ceded premium. So it's important to keep that in mind.

FINAL

The supply chain beneﬁts themselves, there might be a mismatch by quarter but clearly
for the full year, the supply chain beneﬁts will ramp up unlike the ceded premium, which
is even throughout the year.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. So we will just have it -- the net earned all things equal would be down about CAD4
million each -- lower about CAD4 million each quarter and we'll just see how the supply
chain beneﬁts rollout. Is that --?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think that's a good way to look at it.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Then ﬁnally, the diﬀerence in tax rate versus what you guys normally had just on the
operating basis, how should we look at this going forward? It was closer to 28. You have
been 22. I know it's a function of the investment portfolio you would have picked up from
AXA and how much dividend deductibility was in there and also kind of a function a bit of
the underwriting income you would have had. But how should we look at this rate on an
operating basis going forward?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

I know you asked operating. But let me answer nonoperating and then come back and do
operating because the nonoperating, it is even a bigger. Our eﬀective tax rate
nonoperating in total was 34.3 compared with 21.7. There's three items in there relating to
AXA, the 41 million contingent consideration is nondeductible. There's transaction fees of
CAD12 million nondeductible and then we had a tax of CAD3 million that was a one-time
sort of deal.
So if you adjust for those three items, if you look at overall tax rate, you get down to 21.9,
which is fairly similar to last year's run rate. The big change in the operating is due to the
mix between dividends and non-dividend income. So regular income. And there's really
two components of that. One is last year in Q4 the underwriting income was a lot lower.
So the higher underwriting income was fully taxed, sort of dwarfs the beneﬁt we get from
the dividends.
The other thing is the investments that we brought over from AXA had fewer dividend
paying investments. Our plan is over time to migrate those more towards the Intact mix
but you are not going to see an immediate change in that. So that's something you will
see some movement through the year and into the next year. But you're not going to see
a big cliﬀ at some point.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Well the operating tax rate is eﬀectively a reasonable run rate but you probably could
come down as you migrate these investments?

FINAL

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Correct. So if the underwriting income stays at the current level, I would agree with that
statement. There's always some noise from quarter to quarter. But the two big impacts are
if we make more underwriting income, the tax rate will be higher. If we make less
underwriting income, tax rate will be lower. As you pointed out, as we migrate the AXA
investments over to more of an Intact policy, the tax rate should come down.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

No change in that -- even the eﬀective tax rate just with declining statutory tax rates going
forward, is there any movement there?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Yes. So we will beneﬁt from that this year. So on top of the stuﬀ we just talked about, yes.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

What is that impact? About 2%?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

I think it's about 2% down this year, yes.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. So all things being equal, if this was under 2012 tax regime, that 28% tax rate would
have been a 26% on the operating?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

That's correct and the 34.3% would have been 32.3%.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. So maybe somewhere around a 26% is -- okay, thanks very much for that.

Operator
Stephen Boland, GMP Securities.

Q - Stephen Boland

{BIO 5546446 <GO>}

Good morning, just sort of one question relating to I guess mediation and Ontario auto.
You mentioned that you remain conservative with your reserving when it comes to the
outcome of mediation. I guess we have heard recently that there's thousands of
Page 8 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2012-02-08

mediation cases backlogged and some of the measures that FSCO are taking are not
really working very eﬀectively. So is there a point where there is continuing or increasing
pressure on the insurance industry to try and settle these cases and what's your thoughts
on that?

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Let me ﬁrst say that FSCO has put in place in the past three months a number of measures
to improve the mediation process, which are having a favorable impact and I applaud the
work that they have been doing.
But when it comes to mediation, you often settle before mediation. So clearly there's a lot
of activity to try to accelerate settlement before mediation. But beyond that, we will have
to go through it and make sure that at the end of the day the indemnity settlement is what
we think is fair as opposed to focus on speed here.
So we are going with the ﬂow, making sure that we give the best service we can in the
meantime but certainly the amount of the fair indemnity is more important than the speed
for us. And that's why the approach we are taking is one of caution in reserve because it
pushes the ultimate settlement date a bit and as such one needs to take a cautious stance.

Q - Stephen Boland

{BIO 5546446 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Is there any impact with the two-year anniversary coming up with the reforms that
arbitration also becomes a bigger risk or that cases get settled more through arbitration?
What does that pose for with your outlook in terms of reserving as well?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Exactly. I think you are touching on an important point and the point is that when you look
at mediation and arbitration, a big portion of the backlog right now comes from claims
dating back before the reforms. There has been a rush of claims in 2009 and 2010 and
many of these are being mediated.
Then a portion of backlog is related to post reform claims. But it's clear that because you
have about indeed a couple of years to ﬁle up to arbitration, it's clear that there are claims
that are not yet reported that we are not aware of that will end up in mediation. And that's
in part why our stance on this is one of caution. Martin, I don't know if you want to add
anything on that but --

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

No. That's very clear.

Q - Stephen Boland

{BIO 5546446 <GO>}

I guess I just want -- I have heard from some people in the legal department, healthcare
industry as well, that the measures that FSCO are taking, the blitz days, the hiring and

Page 9 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2012-02-08

mediation ﬁrms, they don't expect that to be very eﬀective in terms of sort of getting rid of
claims. I guess that's positive for you because you are holding onto the cash longer.

FINAL

Is that -- you said that some of the things that they have done have been eﬀective but
that's sort of contrary to what a lot of other people are saying.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. But look, I think the bottom line is that you've got at the industry level now probably
close to more than 30,000 ﬁles outstanding and the measures that FSCO has put in place
are providing acceleration. But the sheer size of the backlog is huge. So when you look at
the whole picture, the measures of FSCO are eﬀective to deal with a portion of it. But
you're starting from a very, very large backlog to start with and that might be where your
contacts are coming from.
But FSCO is deﬁnitely focused on it and they are working at it on many fronts, whether it's
system, process, blitz days, as you say. And so on. And so I think we will go with the ﬂow
on this one.

Q - Stephen Boland

{BIO 5546446 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Charles.

Doug Young, TD Securities.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Good morning. Just want to start big picture wise, Charles. And you mentioned in your
opening comments that there's two things that drove your improved results, obviously
strong underwriting but obviously mild winter conditions and mild weather conditions.
I'm just trying to get a sense big picture wise, is this a normal quarter or is there -- can you
give us a sense of what the split between those two items -- I guess what I am trying to get
at is the weather conditions obviously were more adverse earlier on in the year but in Q4
they were quite favorable. What was the impact from that in quarter?
I guess the second part of it is, is there any reason to believe the seasonality that you have
shown us in past -- quarter seasonality will change going forward as a result of the AXA
transaction?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

All right. So to put your ﬁnger exactly on weather and break the change in result is a real
tough one, Doug, even when you have 190 actuaries. But let me just say that the most
tangible sign of milder winter conditions is through what we observe in frequency
changes in the Fourth Quarter. And when you look at our frequencies in the Fourth
Quarter across all lines of business, we are seeing a drop in frequency north of 5%. And I

Page 10 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2012-02-08

would say that a meaningful portion of the current accident year improvement may be a
little bit less than half would be driven by the frequency movement.

FINAL

So if you are brave enough to say that frequency movements are driven by mild weather
conditions, you have your answer, I think. I'm just not prepared to go that far. But clearly
the frequency is correlated with winter conditions here.
Your second question was related to the impact of seasonality on the AXA portfolio and
this is a good one and I will point to two big distributional shifts that might have an
impact. The ﬁrst one is that we have more Quebec business than we used to in relative
terms because half of AXA's business was in Quebec and given the nature of the business
at Quebec, it tends to be more seasonal than for the rest of the country in automobile
insurance.
The second factor is the fact that AXA's business was -- half of the AXA's business was
commercial lines and as you recall at the investor day, we pointed out that our
commercial lines distribution actually increased because of the AXA acquisition.
Commercial lines tend to be less seasonal in nature.

Bloomberg Transcript

We haven't gotten to the extent of assessing what those two trends would have on
seasonality. But one goes one way. The other one goes the other way. So I suspect it
wouldn't make a big diﬀerence. But we will make a note of this one, Doug. And provide
some visibility next quarter once we have a better grasp of what it will pan out.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Okay, just going back to the ﬁrst one, Charles, is there any way -- I mean, you say 5% give
or take lower frequency -- is there any way to kind of give us a number of how that would
go from a combined ratio perspective, what the impact would be? Or is that --?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think that would be too adventurous for me to do that at this stage.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Fair enough. Then the other question I had was around just the integration costs from
AXA and I think -- correct if I'm wrong -- it was indicated that the integration cost would be
roughly 1 times what the potential cost synergies would be. And if I look at what you have
said, the integration costs so far have been CAD71 million and that's roughly half of the
total. I know this is pretax in the CAD100 million is after-tax. But -- so that would indicate
that there's going to be CAD140 million of integration costs.
I guess I'm just trying -- curious, is that correct and why the change? Are you expecting to
get higher synergies as a result of the higher integration costs?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Page 11 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2012-02-08

Right. So I think we have always talked in terms of ranges. And we do expect when the
dust clears we will have integration costs approximately equal to the pretax and the
CAD100 million is an after-tax number. So the CAD71 million we are saying we are
approaching the midpoint.

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Our view has not changed on that, Doug. I think CAD140 million after tax is very close to
CAD100 million and CAD100 million is a fairly ﬁrm number of synergies, I think Mark
could comment. So no change from our point of view there and I think Mark could
comment on the timing diﬀerence here, which is --

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So basically there is -- we know what all the synergy expenses are. To the extent we
haven't expensed them, they are built into our budgets next year. So they are identiﬁed.
We know exactly what they're going to be. So if we could do what we like, we would have
accrued everything at year-end and just gotten it over with and we'd tell you what the
number is.
The problem is in order to reﬂect them in the accounting you have to meet certain
standards. So to reﬂect severance costs, you have to be at a certain stage in the
severance. To reﬂect lease costs, you have to be at a certain stage in terminating the lease
and subletting. So what we had booked is what we are allowed to book from an
accounting point of view. We expect almost everything else will ﬂush out over the next
few quarters. There may be a little bit going into '13 but basically we thought we would be
able to get a little more into Q4 that is going to get pushed into 2012.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Primarily because of how operating leases are treated.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Correct.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Just one last one. You mentioned as a result of your positive reserve developments, they
were a little bit below percentagewise your historical average and I think one of the things
you actually marked out was the whole idea that psychological and physical damages can
be additive to get to your catastrophic claim. And I am just kind of in a sense of how
worried you are about that because there's been a big ﬂip-ﬂop on that front. How
signiﬁcant is that particular item concern wise?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So on the prior-year development, lower the long-term range, I think there is the general
caution in Ontario. There's this item you are referring to and then we've strengthened a
few large claims in commercial lines.

FINAL

On the stacking of psychological and physical impairments to determine a cat, we are not
overly concerned by it. What we have done, Doug, is we went back to all open claims and
assessed where we had -- where we could end up with a diﬀerent settlement based on
this new decision, increase the reserves accordingly case-by-case.
The real question for me is what happens prospectively and our view is that if a new cat
deﬁnition was not introduced and as you know, a new cat deﬁnition is highly likely to be
introduced in 2012 by FSCO. But let's assume this doesn't happen. The cost of that
decision could be between 50 basis points and 100 basis points of loss ratio in Ontario
prospectively. My view is that within one year we will have a new cat deﬁnition and this
additional pressure so to speak will be gone then.
But 50 to 100 basis points of Ontario auto loss ratio, this is a little less than half our
business could be the impact. But as you might've heard in my remarks, my view is still
that within 18 months we will have generated 12 points of loss ratio improvement despite
this decision.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

And the deﬁnition -- the preliminary deﬁnition that had been tabled by the working group
in 2011 was going in the other direction that you could not stack psychological and
physiological. So I think there is a certain level of urgency in putting that in place to bring
back things to normal.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Exactly. That's a very good point, Martin. I think this decision indeed highlights to FSCO
the importance of carrying on their work and putting in place the new deﬁnition of
catastrophic injuries.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Thank you.

Good morning. In Ontario, we saw that the auto rate approvals were about 0.8% but for
Intact Insurance Company, the rate approvals were down 2.3%. Are you able to comment
on this from a strategy perspective?

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Deﬁnitely. Do you want to take this one, Martin?

FINAL

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

Yes, certainly. Well we had started back in 2007 to take rate increases faster than the
market. In fact we were one year ahead of our next competitors at that point and we had
developed over the period a 14-point advantage over the market. And that has given us
the margin to use some of that advantage to become a bit more competitive. So the 2%
we have taken is because we had the margin to take it and still return the proper margin.

Q - Bryan Brown

{BIO 16358540 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. I guess just one broad one. The quarter-over-quarter increase in the
personal auto loss ratio, maybe if you could just speak to that brieﬂy.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. If you look at the personal auto combined ratio in the quarter, it actually dropped by
10 points. This was not an increase, it's a decrease and how do you explain that? Well it
has been largely driven by the current accident year as opposed to prior-year
development and when you look at the current accident year, there's two elements that
have a big impact.
One, the severity or the average cost of claim was down materially, driven by the Ontario
reforms. The second factor that explains the improvement in the combined ratio between
quarter four in 2011 versus quarter four in 2010 is the fact that the frequency was down,
driven by the mild winter conditions as we have talked about before, primarily in the
province of Alberta and in the province of Quebec. It is the sum of these two factors that
explains why the combined ratio in automobile insurance improved so much in the
quarter.

Q - Bryan Brown

{BIO 16358540 <GO>}

Okay, that's it for me.

Operator
Mario Mendonca, Canaccord Genuity.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Good morning, a follow-up question on the stacking. Looking at the reserve development
in personal auto, it was still relatively good. There was still a redundancy. We see that
coming through in the quarter. But it was a little surprising that it would not have been
larger given the comments made about the contingent consideration associated with
AXA.
So if in fact the development from AXA is coming in strong enough to warrant the total,
the CAD89 million or whether you would look at it as a total bases or just the CAD41
million, you would have expected the redundancy to be particularly large and not small.
Page 14 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

So I guess what I'm getting at is how important was this stacking then to your reserve
development in the quarter?

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I would say that this was a meaningful increase, Mario. I think as I said before when you
look at the overall development and the idea is not necessarily to report AXA and Intact
separately going forward. But that being said, being the First Quarter, the stacking
decision would have taken our run rate materially lower than what it has been historically,
3% to 5%.
But as I said, we have done a number of moves from a reserving point of view beyond
and above the stacking, including our general caution in Ontario because as I have said,
the ﬁeld activity is very, very good and very, very strong and therefore caution needs to
take place at the reserving level. Then we have made a few adjustments on large
commercial claims as well.
I think the best reference point I can give you is that -- what I have said earlier that the cost
of that decision in our view in the Ontario auto market is 50 to 100 basis points of Ontario
automobile loss ratio.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That was the impact in the quarter?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

That's the prospective impact on the loss ratio. The amount in the quarter taken was
slightly above 20 for that decision.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

I'm sorry, CAD20 million or 20 basis points?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

CAD20 million, slightly above.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

That answers the question. Where I'm going with this then is if the Company has made
that entire adjustment in the quarter by looking at all the ﬁles and making the changes,
then presumably the adjustment doesn't come through next quarter. So unless there's an
entirely diﬀerent reason to be cautious next quarter, do you naturally assume that the
redundancy, the reserve development could at least be CAD20 million higher?
Or is the premise too restrictive when I say assuming nothing changes, is that the
problem? That too many things change to be conﬁdent?

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. Too many things change because you have to keep in mind that we integrated the
AXA reserves in our system at the same time. So there's a number of change going one
way, other changes going the other way. But one thing that is clear, Mario, is that the
adjustment we have made for the stacking we are not going to do prospectively because
we've done it for all open ﬁles in the past. But I think my view has not changed of the
ongoing run rate of favorable development prospectively.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

But bottom line it was CAD20 million in the quarter. So it was meaningful?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

It was a meaningful adjustment, yes. That's why we highlighted it.

Q - Andre Hardy
Thank you, another question on Ontario auto. In your outlook, Charles, you mentioned
that you expect further increases in price given still high loss ratios with the industry. I
understand that perspective. But do you feel FSCO was on board with this? They just -- or
the government of Ontario introduced very material reform that reduced beneﬁts in late
2010 and what do you feel their appetite is for approving rate increases after doing that?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think that -- they understand that the industry was in a really tough position a year ago.
And because automobile insurance is 5% of disposable income of Ontarians going to 6%,
they knew they had to stop at the inﬂation. They have had a big impact I think on stopping
the inﬂation. But the industry started the reform with a big gap and I think the government
understands that. This translates into a number of actions they have taken beyond and
above the reforms, including the upcoming cat deﬁnition.
It's clear that as reforms become eﬀective, government is probably looking forward to
improvement in rates. But they are rational and they understand that if the industry is not
allowed to operate at a decent rate of return, there will be capacity issues in the market as
there have been ﬁve years ago.
I think that these guys really understand what is important for Ontario drivers and that's
why I am conﬁdent about additional improvements in the Ontario market. In time, rates
will improve. But I still see a need at the industry level for corrective action in pricing.

Q - Andre Hardy

FINAL

Okay. Thank you. The other one is probably for Mark. You are pointing out again that
investment yields are likely to decline given where rates are but you're not pointing out
that growth in the investment portfolio should oﬀset the decline in yields. So have we
reached a point where in your view we are going to see some pressure on investment
income in absolute dollars?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Yes, I think at our Investor Day, we gave a little guidance on this one. I think we would
expect -- we don't see big growth in the assets going forward. You are correct on that and
we do see further decline in yields, whether they exactly oﬀset. But I wouldn't expect to
see lots of growth in that going forward.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think the Investor Day's illustration on investment income for 2012 remains quite valid as
far as we're concerned.

Paul Holden, CIBC.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Thanks, another question on Ontario auto, this one related to the minor injury guideline.
Hearing that some insureds are trying to get out of -- bounce their way out of the MIG
guidelines by ﬁling for mediation and then claiming a failed mediation if it's not resolved
within 60 days, can you provide any color on that, how many such cases you are seeing
through your system?

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

That's not necessarily related to the minor injury guidelines themselves. But there are 20%
of our open cases, which are in mediation. And what we observed there is that there is an
attempt to say, well, if mediations have not happened within 60 days, they are deemed to
have failed. But up until now this has not been successful. So these ﬁles are staying in the
mediation backlog and they are being handled as -- on a one-by-one basis.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

We're not overly concerned by that and I would say FSCO is on it as well. I think they will
try to ﬁnd a solution because this clearly was not the intention that a backlog would drive
a delay that would deem mediation to fail. That was not the intent and I think FSCO I
suspect will try to deal with that in the coming months.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay, my understanding the way I read it was that claims have been ﬁled under MIG that
were not resolved under mediation of 60 days could bounce out of the MIG guidelines.
But you are saying that's not the case?

FINAL

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

I think technically this is how this is supposed to happen, that if within 60 days the
mediation has not been successful but now it has not been heard. So I think the mediators
understand that these are circumstances that are outside of the party's control to make a
mediation successful.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Then ﬁnal question is with respect to capital allocation for the upcoming year. MCT ratio,
while you still have a nice buﬀer versus your target has come down. So is your preference
to build excess capital or buy back -- continue to buy back stock?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think in the near to midterm, our goal is to get back to the 20% debt to total capital ratio
and then we'll go back to the same -- our long-term capital management, which is ensure
we can do the dividends, consider strategic options in the short to midterm and whether
there is actionable uses of the capital either to grow organically or through acquisitions.
Then to the extent we've got excess capital beyond what we need for that, we do have a
preference for share buybacks.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes, I think the other factor, Paul, is the general capital market volatility, as you know,
which is an integral part of our framework that we use to determine whether we will do
buyback or not and in the current environment, this is not our intention in the short term.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. Finally, any comments with respect to the 12% ROE cap that has been
in place in Ontario auto? Are you hearing anything in terms of the possibility of that cap
coming down?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Do you want to talk about that, Martin?

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

Well FSCO has received the Auditors General report and I think they have signiﬁed that
they haven't -- they would have an interest in reviewing the adequacy of the 12%. But I
think that they are educating themselves at the moment and we are participating in that
exercise to put in perspective what that 12% means on the long-term perspective.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

Exactly. I think it's important to bear in mind that this is a non-leveraged ROE target that
FSCO is putting. The other thing that's important to bear in mind for FSCO is that if you
go back in time and look at the industry, it's a highly competitive industry. The ROE in the
past three, ﬁve, or 10 years in Ontario for the industry has been nowhere near 12%.
So for me, this is not talking about the right things in the Auditor General's report and I
think FSCO, as Martin said, is thinking through these things at the moment. But this is
really not a concern of mine at this stage.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. So that cap could be lower but if it does, it's irrelevant anyways?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I would be very surprised if it was.

Q - Shubha Khan

{BIO 16255963 <GO>}

Thanks, just to follow up on Paul's question there on capital allocation speciﬁcally from a
long-term perspective. Now I understand that you are probably fully focused on
integrating AXA. But perhaps I can ask you to look ahead to future acquisition
opportunities particularly given the backdrop of your ﬁnancial ﬂexibility and what looks at
least to me looks like increasingly probable demutualization of the P&C sector.
So given that backdrop, I'm wondering what your thoughts are on acquisitions speciﬁcally
in Ontario auto. Are we likely to see more or increased industry consolidation there since
you mentioned that combined ratio is still ranging between 105% and 110%? And would
Intact be a willing participant or are you sort of satisﬁed with your current exposure to
Ontario auto?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Let me talk about consolidation and then let me talk about the impact of that on Ontario
auto.
So our view has not changed that there should be over the coming ﬁve years probably 20
points of market share that will trade. And given our ﬁnancial condition and given our
experience in integration. And our outperformance of the industry, it is an element, an
important element of our strategy to continue to be a consolidator. And so indeed we are
Page 19 of 21

FINAL

really focused on the integration of AXA. But AXA was not the last acquisition that we will
do. So that's the ﬁrst point.
The second point is that the conditions at the moment I think are good for a consolidation
of the industry and they are likely to be good for a few years. You point to demutualization
but I think for me this is way broader than that. This is just one thing that is changing at the
industry level. There are changes taking place abroad. The industry performance is not
great with the mid single-digit 6% to 7% ROE. And as such, you've got all the conditions in
my view to see continued consolidation in the market.
Your point on Ontario auto, in general many if not most companies tend to be spread in
more than one province and one line of business. But given our approach operationally in
claims, underwriting, pricing, our outperformance of the Ontario market. And the fact that
there is a government that is proactive at trying to keep costs under control for Ontario
drivers, this is certainly a line of business where we would not shy away from getting
additional exposure through consolidation.
In other words, there are very few Ontario auto-only companies but we won't prevent
ourselves from doing an acquisition because there is heavy Ontario auto exposure. We
feel that we've done a very good job on that front over the past three, ﬁve, 10 years and
our outperformance right now is a proof of that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Shubha Khan

{BIO 16255963 <GO>}

So if the right opportunities were to present themselves, you wouldn't be averse to
getting back to the same sort of business mix -- Ontario as a part of your business that you
had prior to the acquisition, then?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No. I think we are not motivated by distribution of the book of business per se. We are
motivated by outperforming in every segment where we operate and once you
outperform in every segment where you operate, how much of the business you write in
that segment in relationship with the size of your business is really quite secondary.

Q - Shubha Khan

{BIO 16255963 <GO>}

Okay, just one follow-up to that, then. Speciﬁcally on Ontario auto, then again if the right
opportunities present themselves, would you be -- would you come up against any
competition Bureau obstacles or any other sort of regulatory hurdles if you were to seek
signiﬁcant or sizable acquisition opportunities here?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I don't think so.
