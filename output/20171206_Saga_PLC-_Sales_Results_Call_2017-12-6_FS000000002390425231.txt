Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. It's Lance Batchelor here, the CEO. My apologies, I gather
there was some kind of a technical glitch with the phone lines. Hopefully, you can all hear
me clearly. I'm joined this morning by Jonathan Hill, our CFO. Jonathan and I are each
going to talk for a few minutes and then we will open up to questions.
I'm going to cover three subjects on this call: ﬁrstly, a quick update on current year
trading and the reasons behind it; second and most important, some actions that we're
taking to accelerate growth; and third, how this plays out for the forecast in 2018 and
beyond.
First brieﬂy then current year trading. Saga has traded well throughout most of 2017, but
in quarter four, we hit some strong headwind. In October, we saw a signiﬁcant step-up in
the competitive environment in motor and home broking, which cost us both policies and
margin; and Monarch Airlines went bust, costing us about £2 million in additional ﬂight
costs and lost proﬁt from cancellation. Hurricane Irma and other weather events in the
Caribbean added more cancellation costs. As a result of these factors, Saga will come in
towards the lower end of our previous guidance at 1% to 2% growth in underlying PBT.
It's worth noting that our in-house underwriter, AICL, has again performed strongly and
will deliver higher reserve releases than expected. Our travel business has also performed
well leaving aside the Monarch impact. We've completed a review of our operating
structure, which will realize approximately £10 million of annualized saving next year. The

more challenging trading in travel and insurance means that our baseline growth is likely
to be slower than we'd anticipated.
Second, we're taking action to accelerate growth. In the 3 1/2 years since IPO, we've
bedded in our motor panel, we have a better understanding of High Aﬃnity Customers,
we've launched our new membership program, Possibilities. It already has 200,000
members or almost 200,000 members and 85% of the customers that we speak to are
choosing to activate their membership.
We're in the ﬁnal testing of our new insurance IT platform, and we've launched our new
claims platform. With greater customer insight and a stronger business platform, now is
the right time for us to make a targeted investment to grow the business. We, therefore,
intend to invest an extra £10 million to drive customer growth next year, and we expect to
maintain this level of investment into the future.

Bloomberg Transcript

This investment and some ﬁnancial headwinds that Jonathan will explain mean that next
year's proﬁt will reduce by about 5% against this year. That is below our previous
guidance for next year. However, it's the right thing to do in order to build value for the
longer term. It means that we can use our home and motor panels to compete eﬀectively.
It will help our holiday and cruise businesses to win volume. Newly acquired customers
normally take a year or two to become proﬁtable, but by 2020, our proﬁt will start to
accelerate oﬀ a larger base.
Before I hand you over to Jonathan to give you more color on this, there is one last
important point. We expect to make no changes to either our current year dividend or our
dividend policy. Now Jonathan.

Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

Thanks, Lance. So ﬁrst looking at 2017-2018, as Lance has said, we expect to deliver
growth in underlying proﬁt from last year of between 1% and 2%. In terms of the trading in
Retail Broking, we have seen a signiﬁcant uplift in competitor activity in both home and
motor in Q4 since our last market update with some players aggressively targeting
volume growth, which has led to lower persistency for a period. We expect this increased
level of competitive activity to continue and, therefore, our proﬁt growth in our retail
broker is expected to be marginally lower during the initial two years of investment than
previously anticipated.
The cost associated with Monarch were caused by a range of factors. Where we had
passengers in resort, we had to pay for the ﬂights to bring those customers home. Where
we had future passengers who were booked on Monarch ﬂights as part of one of our
packages, we had to acquire new ﬂights at higher cost and then, clearly, we also had
some cancellation.
For the full year, we expect our written broking performance to be positive year-on-year
with a strong performance in motor even after the tougher Q4 trading, partially oﬀset by
home and travel broking. On an earned basis, the proﬁtability of our Retail Broking

FINAL

business will reduce year-on-year due to the lower return to earned beneﬁt, which I'll
touch on in a minute. Even after those eﬀects of Monarch, we will deliver another strong
uplift in our Travel proﬁt. And ﬁnally, our claims experience within the underwriter
continues to be very positive for small and large PI, which has enabled us to maintain
reserve releases at roughly the same level year-on-year.
Now turning to next year, we expect to signiﬁcantly improve our quality of earnings with
an increase in proﬁts coming from Retail Broking and Travel. Around half of this increase is
expected to come from the organic growth in this business and the other half from a
lower cost base. We have taken the actions to deliver these cost reductions, the majority
of which is driven by lower head count. And as a result, there will be a one-oﬀ charge in
the current ﬁnancial year of approximately £4 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Oﬀsetting these improvements, we expect to experience reductions in reserve releases
and one-oﬀ earnings of around £20 million. This headwind will be roughly half and half
split between lower reserve releases and a reduction in written to earned beneﬁt. The
written to earned beneﬁts have been a constant proﬁt beneﬁt of between £10 million and
£20 million since the time of IPO. And these result from the standard accounting
treatment which aﬀects the timing of recognition of proﬁt between underwritten and
broke policies.
We have moved more towards a less capital intensive model and taken less underwriting
risk in AICL. Therefore, AICL has written less business sold by our retail broker, both on
ancillary product and with the introduction of the motor panel 2 1/2 years ago. Also, the
introduction of the arrangement fee, which is standard in the insurance industry, had an
eﬀect on this written to earned beneﬁt.
In summary, this is happening because we have increased the number of policies we
broke and reduced the level of underwriting risk in the business. In terms of debt and
leverage, there are no implications for any covenants and we expect our leverage ratio to
remain below 3 times, including the debt associated with both shifts.
So, just to recap on where that leads us, the current year underlying PBT where we expect
to be between 1% and 2% growth year-on-year and there will be a one-oﬀ restructuring
charge of £4 million to deliver that £10 million cost reduction. Next year, proﬁt will reduce
by around 5% year-on-year reﬂecting that up-front investment in customer acquisition and
those ﬁnancial headwinds. And for 2020 and beyond, it's too early to give speciﬁc
guidance, but we will see a better quality of earnings and proﬁt growth. Retail Broking
and Travel will be beneﬁting from the investment in customer acquisition. Cruise will
beneﬁt from the new cruise ship and all this from a lower cost base and a stronger
business platform.
I'll now hand back to Lance.

Thanks, Jonathan. Finally a word on strategy, the core of what Saga is all about remains
the same. We will still focus on being customer-centric using Saga Possibilities. We'll still
target growth in our core insurance and travel divisions. We will remain asset-eﬃcient. We
are investing for the future. It's the same strategy on a stronger business platform with
more investment in growth. In the longer term, we're conﬁdent that we'll see better
quality of earnings and proﬁt growth across the business supporting our progressive
dividend policy.
We will now take some questions.

Thank you very much, Lance. Our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Anna Hui from
RBC. Anna, please go ahead.

Q - Anna Hui

{BIO 19762795 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning all and two questions from me please. First, can you give a bit more color
into the trading environment in home and travel broking in terms of where this
competition is coming from and volume as well? And second on the cost savings, so can
you give us some more information about which segments you see this cost saving
beneﬁts to impact in next year? Actually, and the third one, so on motor broking as well,
can you give a bit color on the volume? Thank you.

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

Yeah. Sure. In terms of home and travel broking, if I take travel insurance ﬁrst, we
obviously updated you at the half year, particularly around the pressures we had had in Q1
around the FX position that we had with our underwriter and that left us competitively
disadvantaged in the ﬁrst half of this year. That, as we said at the interims is unwind, and
our volumes are back to a relatively sensible level.
One of the issues that transpired in H2 is because of the hurricane season in particular, we
had a lower quantity of long-haul bookings not only in the Travel business but also a
lower demand for long-haul travel insurance which tends to command a higher premium.
So, we saw a little bit lower volume than we expected in Q4, really driven by some of
those hurricane impact on travel insurance.
In home, this is a continuation I think of really what we've seen for about the last ﬁve years.
It's been relatively constant. We've had reducing prices to three years then pretty much
ﬂat prices for a couple of years against the backdrop saw a ﬂat gross written premiums
against a backdrop of marginal inﬂation coming through, so that's really just the
continuation of same trading that we've seen in home insurance over the last few years
already.

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Turning to your question around costs, I mean most of the cost structure at Saga is made
up of people, and after 3 1/2 years of investment in systems, more modern marketing
platforms, process improvements, we are in a position to be able to remove a number of
people from the organization in order to right-size us and essentially make us eﬃcient for
the future. That has happened across the business. It's almost complete now. Most of
those cost savings have been driven into the business. And just to reassure, the majority
of the roles that have been removed are at the middle and upper management levels.
We've worked very hard to try and protect the customer experience.

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

And then I think your ﬁnal question, Anna, was in terms of the motor broking volumes.
Clearly, the step-up in Q4 activity has aﬀected the persistency levels. We'll give you a
clear guidance that – we'll give you a clear update at the year-end of the impact on
volumes but, certainly, we saw persistency stepping down a couple of percentage points
in that Q4 period, which impacted volume.

Q - Anna Hui

{BIO 19762795 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Andreas van Embden from Peel Hunt. Andreas,
please go ahead.

Q - Andreas Evert Cornelis van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

Hello, good morning. Two questions for me please. First of all, on the motor panel. Could
you just comment on where you are in building that up? And how many sort of
underwriters are now on the panel? And are you satisﬁed the panel is now sort of eﬃcient
as it were? Are there enough members on the panel for you to be able to compete
eﬀectively in, as you say, a market that has become a bit tougher in the fourth quarter?
And also give a bit of an outlook of where you see the panel or how you see it evolving
next year.
And the second question is on the additional acquisition costs of £10 million. I'm
surprised you're investing more into trying to sort of converge your customer base into
doing more business with Saga. Could you maybe spit out those £10 million? What are
you going to exactly invest in and how do you think that is going to sort of generate a
boost in your policy accounting? Thank you.

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

Thanks, Andreas. So I'll deal with the ﬁrst question. So, where are we on the panel? We
still have the four external underwriters. What we referred to at the half year was some
quite signiﬁcant Ogden impact, which had impacted the net rates that we were eﬀectively

Page 5 of 18



Company Name: Saga PLC
Company Ticker: SAGA LN Equity
Date: 2017-12-06

FINAL

getting from those external underwriters and we talked through the implications of that
on written to earned at that point.
What we've seen is a much more positive performance as Ogden I think has settled down
in the market and people have really got their heads around that. So we've seen an
improvement in the performance of the panel certainly in H2 and we'll give you some
more ﬂavor on that and more speciﬁcs at the year-end but it really has bounced back to
where it was before and is heading absolutely in the right direction. So, we feel pretty
comfortable with that.
If you'd strip out the sort of blip from that Ogden impact and the impact on net rate, we
have seen a steady progression in the panel share over the 2 1/2 years since we've had it.
So we would like to think, everything else being equal – and there's obviously a lot of stuﬀ
going on in the motor market at the minute around whether we're seeing that rate
moving again, what the government's going to do on that. Everything being equal, we'd
like to see the panel taking a greater share as we go into next year.

Q - Andreas Evert Cornelis van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

So where does the disappointment come from in terms of the growth within the motor
panel? What's the disappointing factor here?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

Well, I think one of the disappointing factors for us was in the ﬁrst half of the year that the
external underwriters decided to price Ogden signiﬁcantly more aggressively in terms of
what they put into net rate than our business, AICL, which we think understands its level of
PPOs very clearly, and has been – as we said at last year-end, has a limited impact from
PPOs because we have a very low number of them. So that's one of my disappointments
that we had that situation where the external underwriters became very cautious, I think,
in terms of using broker channels. And then we've seen that coming back in H2.

Q - Andreas Evert Cornelis van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

But do you think you need more members on the panel to be able to make it work or is
the panel maybe too narrow in terms of in membership?

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

I don't think the panel is too narrow and I think Lance will talk in a second about where
we're going to put the investment because at the end of the day, to grow a book you
need to invest, and the ﬁrst year of that costs money. And we're going to put some money
behind both our home and on our motor panels to get some growth.

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Okay. So let me step in and just talk a bit about the marketing investment or the £10
million investment. First of all, I'm just going to say, I can't share all of the detail because I
don't want to ﬂag to all of our competitors exactly what we're proposing to do, but I'll tell
you what I can. The ﬁrst thing is that roughly half of the £10 million investment will go into
Page 6 of 18



Company Name: Saga PLC
Company Ticker: SAGA LN Equity
Date: 2017-12-06

FINAL

driving our insurance business and roughly half will go into travel. Again, I'm not going to
give exact detail, but you're roughly in that order of magnitude. In both cases, the
intention is to attract new customers and also to drive more cross-sell internally within the
database and ﬁnally to ensure that we retain HACs, High Aﬃnity Customers, into the long
term.
A lot of the money is going to go towards price. We want to make sure that we are
competitive in the market in terms of both insurance and travel pricing. This links back
partly to the ﬁrst half of the question around panel eﬃciency. We think that the panels
work very well but they can only gain volume if our front-end pricing is competitive. And
so a good proportion of the £10 million will go into ensuring that our market pricing is
competitive. Some of the money will also go into channel access. So, for example, if you
use a price comparison website, you pay for the privilege. For example, if you want to
send out either digital or analog marketing to your travel and cruise customers and
potential customers, that costs money.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have good elasticity data at Saga going back many years, both in travel and
insurance. We have a very good feel for what you get back when you invest money. Our
challenge for the last few years has been that we've been managing the business for
margin and we're now rebalancing that consciously to also drive volume and we have a
very good sense of what we will get back for the extra money that we're investing.
One other point I want to make is that when you invest in new customers, whether they
are insurance customers or travel customers, you don't get instant payout. Typically, on an
insurance customer, it takes from one to two years for that customer to become proﬁtable,
which creates a dip in proﬁtability during that period as you move from ﬂat volume to
growth in volume.
And the same is true of travel. When you attract a new travel customer and they book with
you, they don't actually travel with you typically for 6 to 12 months and it's not until then
that you realize the full revenue from that customer. So the investment in both cases goes
out up to a year or so before you get the returns. What we want to do is we want to take
the business that it's been running roughly ﬂat in volume terms and we want to get it
growing. And in order to do that, essentially, you have to invest for a year or two in order
to break that and move upwards and that's what we're doing.
The last point I'll make quickly is that we know so much more about what a good
customer looks like based on the learnings of the last year or two. We know what a High
Aﬃnity Customer looks like. We know what a potential High Aﬃnity Customer looks like.
So, in terms of our ability to target the marketing money, we are much smarter than we
were and that's one of the reasons that we've decided to start the investment cycle now
and take some growth on the business. We've also spent four years really rebuilding all of
our tech platforms; ordering new ships; launching Saga membership, the Possibilities
scheme; and so on. So, we really feel that now is the right time for us to get behind that
investment.
Next question please.

Our next question comes from Ravi Tanna of Goldman Sachs. Ravi, please go ahead.

Q - Ravi Tanna

{BIO 16926941 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, everyone. And I have three questions please. The ﬁrst one is on your
choice between underwriting and broking. I guess you've always maintained that you're
somewhat agnostic between the channels and you're happy to push business through
either depending on where the customer wants to go and what's the most kind of
appropriate. But, clearly, there's extremely diﬀerent proﬁtability proﬁles earned versus
written patterns, et cetera. So I was wondering how you're thinking about that given
what's happened.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second question is also kind of back on the broking panel, I'm sorry to belabor the issue,
but I wasn't quite clear on the actual trend in terms of customer volumes of policies sold
via the panel over the course of the year. So perhaps you could break down for us ﬁrst
half versus more recent quarters. What's happened over the course of the year? What the
trend has been on the motor broking panel?
And then the third question please, on the dividend and the decision to maintain that,
could you just clarify in respect of your kind of operating cash, it seems to me that that
would take you close to 100% of operating cash to maintain the kind of dividends, the
expectations that are in the market. Is that how you see it or is there an intention to pay
dividend out of your solvency? Can you just clarify your thoughts on that, please? Thank
you.

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

Maybe I can deal with those questions. I think the answer to the ﬁrst question is, do we let
written to earned dictate how we try and run the business. We don't. What we want to do
is, get the best economic outcome and get the best proﬁt into our retail broker. We
should never be inﬂuenced by the accounting treatment of how we deal with the proﬁt
ﬂows. That does give us issues in terms of how easy it is to forecast when we see
movements in things like the panel share. So, we will continue to have a level playing
ﬁeld. We do continue to be agnostic between our in-house underwriter and the external
underwriters, but we very much want to make sure, we've got a level playing ﬁeld and do
the best in terms of net rate. So hopefully, that deals with the ﬁrst question.
On the second, we obviously saw if we go back and think of our statements in the last two
half years, we said at the year-end that we were up to approaching a third of net revenue

Page 8 of 18

FINAL

on renewals coming from the panel. So that was the back end of last ﬁnancial year. Then
clearly with Ogden, we saw that signiﬁcantly step down and we had some of the issues
around the implications of that on written earned at the half year.
But then we'd certainly see the panel stepping up in H2 again, as I said, as everything's
calmed down within the Ogden and people have really got a good grip on it and see
what's happening going forward. And we're certainly back towards the level we were in
H2 last year and we'll give you further color on that at the prelims next year.
In terms of the divis, we have de-levered. We're getting into – we'll update at the year-end
where we are in leverage ratio. As we get towards the bottom end of that range, we're
quite comfortable paying out a high level of our free cash ﬂow and our operating cash.
Then we'll take one of the ships on, and we'll generate a signiﬁcant uplift in cash ﬂow.
That'll help us de-lever because, at that point, we'll have quite a lot of cash ﬂow paying
down debt on the ship in particular.
And then we'll take on the second ship and, at that point, we'll generate signiﬁcant cash.
So in the short run, to the extent that we're getting towards the bottom end of that 1.5 to 2
times band pre the delivery of the ﬁrst ship, we feel quite comfortable paying out a
slightly higher percentage of our operating free cash ﬂow.

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Rampton from UBS. Robert, please go
ahead.

Q - Robert Rampton

{BIO 20079733 <GO>}

Hi. So going to that PBT headwind from the written to earned, it seems like until Q4, you
are pretty conﬁdent you could oﬀset the £10 million a year headwind. Is the implication
the home proﬁtability in Q4 is signiﬁcantly lower? And if so, would you expect that to
change if persistency rates don't change? That's it. Thanks.

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

The answer to that question is, yes, we did expect to be able to – we had an expectation
of trading and delivering enough growth within our Broking business to oﬀset the
headwind this year and then into next year. Now, clearly, some of the more challenging
trading both on home and motor in terms of persistency in Q4 has naturally made that
more diﬃcult. And yeah, that competitive activity, we are assuming, continues into next
year at that level, and we've taken that into consideration as we've given the guidance
into next year.

Page 9 of 18

FINAL

And I guess as you try and bridge from your previous forecast where previous estimates
through this estimate, one of the key elements that has changed in that is the level of
competitive activity within the market, and the assumption that the rate of growth that we
had anticipated in our Retail Broking is going to be slightly lower than we had previously
anticipated.

Q - Robert Rampton

{BIO 20079733 <GO>}

So one follow-up on that, if that's okay. Could you please – so you've mentioned that
motor was doing well in 2H. However, you've just commented that motor has been
disappointing in 4Q. Do you mean that – or could you clarify whether you mean motor
policy count has been good in 2H and its proﬁtability that has been aﬀected by the
persistency or – yeah, just some clariﬁcation (27:22).

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

Yeah, sure. Sure, Robert. So, up to the end of Q3, the proﬁtability on a written basis of our
motor book is very positive and, hopefully, that comes out of the statement. It just then
got pulled back a bit from where we were heading towards at that point by the downturn
in persistency both on the motor side and also coming across to the home side as well. So
we were doing well in terms of our proﬁt. For the year, we're still going to be up year-onyear in our written motor performance, just not as quite as much as we had thought at the
time that we were last commenting to the market.

Q - Ben Cohen

{BIO 1541726 <GO>}

Good morning. Thanks very much. I had two questions, please. The ﬁrst was of the
investment that you're going to make in the customer acquisition and maybe I just missed
it in the detail but could you sort of talk through the timeline and as to how much of that
do you think we will then see in the proﬁts in the following year and then in the out-years?
And I suppose part of that, what is the risk that that will get competed away?
And the second question in terms of the underwriting reserve release, I think you've given
an outlook for the decline in the coming year. Can you say anything about the outlook in
the further out-years given that that is quite a big swing factor when it comes to the
development of group proﬁtability for, I suppose, years kind of two and three? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

Yeah, sure. Do you want me to deal with these? In terms of your question on being
competed away, I think we take the simpler one is obviously our Travel Business. Once
we've spent the money next year and got a booking, that customer is coming with us the
year after. So it's just the fact that we spend money to acquire a customer and the
booking timeline as such, they generally book up to 12 months in advance, and therefore,
the revenue and proﬁt recognition come on departure of the customer. So, that's
relatively straightforward.
Then in terms of the insurance business, as Lance said, we're very clear on our pricing and
elasticity curves within our insurance businesses. So, we know that when we acquire a
policy that we will lose money on that policy in the ﬁrst year. And then in that second year,
you get a positive contribution that gets you back towards or into a positive position. And
then you start making money in the third year generally on these policies, and that takes
into consideration the persistency rate that you see on those policies over that period. So,
we've got a pretty tried and tested understanding of that elasticity across the insurance
business.
The second on the reserve releases, we've obviously guided into next year that £10 million
to £15 million level. It obviously is heavily dependent on our experience during the year,
but it's not an unreasonable expectation that it should continue on down at that sort of
rate. But obviously, the year after, there's no written earned headwind. We will just have
the reserve release headwind.

Q - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Hi, three questions. First of all, you guided earlier on what you thought was happening to
proﬁt this and next year and the year after. Can you just tell me what you think your
underlying proﬁt number is, on which we should base that guidance? Secondly, I'm a bit
confused about the pressure you're seeing in the insurance side. If this is a branded
business with lots of brand recognition, then why are you struggling so much in a diﬃcult
market? And thirdly, I'm a bit confused when I look out to 2018, I can't quite reconcile the
change in proﬁt number. It looks like about £40 million to me and I think you've explained
about £30 million of it. So, could you just help me on that? Thank you.

Yeah, I mean quickly on the pressure that we've been under in quarter four in the
insurance market almost immediately as we went into that quarter, we saw a signiﬁcant
dial-up of the competitive pressure across the market from multiple competitors. It looked
to us like several competitors decided to go after volume and that's both new customers
in the market but also requires us to respond in order to retain the current customer base
because these days more and more customers will review their pricing on an annual
basis. We have to remain competitive in order to protect persistency of our current
customer base. And that meant some margin erosion and that's the right thing for us to
do to protect those customers.
Yes, we do have a strong brand and we know that about roughly two-thirds at the time
that we attract a new customer on a price comparison website. We were not the cheapest
on the list. They are willing to invest in order to go with Saga. But, ultimately, we have to
remain competitive in order to attract new customers and retain previous customers and
the strength of our brand has real value to it. But that doesn't make you immune from
competitive forces.

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

So, Matthew, (33:45) I'm just trying to understand if you're reconciling the market
guidance back to next year's number or whether you're trying to reconcile this year
through the next year model?

Q - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

No, I'm looking at 2018, looking at 2018...

So relative to consensus before, we clearly have a – so we had a consensus, I believe, just
over the mid to £200 million to £210 million level and we're talking about being £180
million. Now clearly, £10 million of that is the investment that is new. So that gets you to
£190 million and then eﬀectively what you have is the carryforward of the shortfall on this
year's trading and on the Retail Broking side. And then we've said we expect that growth
to be – given the competitive environment, to be slightly lower year-on-year. So what
we've talked about today is organic growth of 10% into next year in those businesses
without it starting oﬀ a lower base.

Q - Nick Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

Good morning, all. Just one question, ﬁrst of all, on travel insurance. Just wondered how
much of the (35:17) purely from the long-haul bookings? Are you comfortable with the
underlying business of volumes robust, (35:24) excluding the impact of long-haul
booking, or has there been a shift in buying habits of customers and new competitive
pressure in the travel insurance market generally? That's the ﬁrst question. And secondly,
just on cost savings, this one is if you could say whether there are any – is there scope for
any further cost savings in the future or are you now all done on that front? Thank you.

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

Yeah, sure. In travel insurance, we see, when we look at some of the short-haul demand,
the short haul volumes relative to same time last year, it's as robust and as solid as it was
at that point. Obviously, the big point for us comes in Q1 when we get a lot of travel
insurance bookings in because that's, obviously, the time when the travel industry itself
has the greatest level of bookings. And that's obviously when our travel insurance
volumes really come in. Clearly, we've seen an impact in the back end of the year from
those hurricanes on the long-haul stuﬀ. But now we're not seeing anything that suggests a
fundamental shift away from where we were before.

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Nick, on your cost question, look, we've taken out a meaningful slice of cost. We're going
to, on an ongoing basis, review our cost structure to ensure that we remain very lean and
we're not anticipating signiﬁcant extra reductions in cost, but we are anticipating retaining
very tight control over our cost structure.
In the three years or so since IPO, we did need to go through an investment phase where
we brought in new people with new skills, where we updated our marketing platforms,
where we invested in some of the IT and so on, and that did require a buildup of new
skills on top of old skills, if you like. And we're now starting to see the returns come
Page 13 of 18

through as some of those platforms come to life and enable us to be more eﬃcient and,
on the back of that, we've taken the recent steps to reduce cost base by £10 million. But
you shouldn't expect to see further cuts of that sort of magnitude.

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

And we will be on top of the cost base. Don't worry.

Our next question comes from the line of Anna Hui with a follow-up question. Anna,
please go ahead.

Q - Anna Hui

{BIO 19762795 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Two follow-up questions from me. First on the home/motor broking, some of the
motor insurers have been talking about increasing prices due to escape of water claims. Is
that something you've also been seeing in the competitive pricing environment? And
secondly, just on the £10 million marketing acquisition, you said that you would expect
this to continue into the future and it sounds like part of that is probably you lowering the
margin you're getting on this business. Am I reading this right?

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

We haven't speciﬁcally commented on home and I don't think around the escape of
water, but it's an industry-wide phenomenon that everybody is seeing within that part of
the market. That obviously has an impact on the net rates. Clearly, we take no risk
ourselves on home. So therefore, that itself has no impact directly on any underwriting
results, clearly, because we aren't exposed to that risk. But clearly, it has an impact on the
net rates that come through from our panel. So, yeah, you have claims inﬂation coming
through at a time of relatively stable gross written premium, so it creates margin pressure
certainly.

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

And then on the second question around the marketing acquisition, I mean clearly if you
take 2 million, 2.5 million policies and you start to grow oﬀ that base and you're spending
£10 million more then if you divide one by the other, there is a cost to doing that. And in
that sense, you could say the margin on each policy will be slightly lower during the
investment phase. Remember that in year two, as Jonathan described earlier, you'd
expect to see the customers that you invested in back in year one hit breakeven, and then
as you move into year three, they become proﬁtable, and therefore, the extra roughly £10
million a year that we're expecting to invest starts to pay for itself within years two and
three. It starts to cover itself with extra volume.

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Rampton of UBS. Robert, please go
ahead.

Q - Robert Rampton

{BIO 20079733 <GO>}

Hi, two follow-up questions for me. You've previously commented that (40:10) market is
good, but what made you (40:15) the magnitude of the change in persistency or was it –
you didn't expect (40:20)? And then the second question in terms of EBITDA to cash
conversion, given that you won't be oﬀsetting the written impact. Does that imply a higher
level going forward? Thanks.

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

Sorry, could you just repeat that second part, Robert? I didn't quite catch it all.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Robert Rampton

{BIO 20079733 <GO>}

Sure. So given you haven't been able to oﬀset the fall-oﬀ in earnings from going written to
earned, the £20 million, what are the implications for your EBITDA to cash conversion?
Thanks.

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

Actually, if I can deal with that one ﬁrst, the EBITDA to cash conversion will improve
because the written to earned has no cash impact whatsoever. So, actually, we should see
our margin a lot less than that percentage because it's just an accounting adjustment
that's got no economic or cash diﬀerence at all to the business.

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

And then if I go back to your ﬁrst question, Robert, in general, we do believe the churn in
the marketplace is a good thing for Saga. But the magnitude and rapidity of change that
hit in quarter four basically required us to correct to ensure that we retain current
customers and we remain competitive in our search for new customers. So what we have
done is we have adjusted in order to achieve that and that's what's aﬀected the current
year projection.
If you look forward at the £10 million investment that we're talking about, I mean that's
going to make us to sharpen our pencil in terms of external pricing and in an environment
where there is churn, that's going to make Saga a more attractive proposition to
customers who are in the market.

We have a follow-up question from the line of Ravi Tanna of Goldman Sachs. Ravi, please
go ahead.

Q - Ravi Tanna

{BIO 16926941 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Just one ﬁnal follow-up on the broker panel I suppose, in arriving at
your previous guidance on proﬁts that you've provided to the market, presumably you
would've had an underlying assumption as to how quickly the panel will have grown in
terms of volumes and the rough margin that you would've earned.
And I wonder whether you could share with us any of the underlying assumptions as to
how you had anticipated that the panel would progress and how you see it from here
because clearly that's been revised downward sharply in fourth quarter because, clearly,
it's a diﬃcult thing for the market to anticipate. But presumably in arriving at your three
year (43:21) proﬁt guidance, you must have made some underlying assumptions. So to the
extent that you can, if you could please share those with us.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

Yeah, I would attach it slightly less, Ravi, to the margins that speciﬁcally come out of the
panel. This is about the margins we make in our Retail Broking business and the level of
persistency that we have in that business. We aim to widen that margin through the
competition between our internal underwriter and the external ones. But we thought that
we are going to be able to deliver a bigger uplift in our Retail Broking business. And it
wasn't an underperformance either from our own underwriter or the external underwriter,
it was the market conditions and the competitive landscape that held us back from being
able to get those margins slightly higher within our Retail Broking business. Does that
make sense, Ravi?

Q - Ravi Tanna

{BIO 16926941 <GO>}

It does, I suppose. I guess the underlying question still remains as to what you'd
previously assumed in terms of market conditions. It's obviously a very volatile market. I
guess what I'm trying to get at is what gives you reassurance that this cannot be repeated.
This is a very volatile market both motor and – well, particularly motor insurance, and
competitive conditions will ﬂuctuate over time. And I suppose that's really what I'm
getting at. I do appreciate that it's not necessarily underperformance by your in-house
underwriter and that it's a function of competitive conditions, but one would imagine that
that will continue over time.

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

I mean in essence, if you look at our forecast for next year the guidance that we're giving,
you can say that we are assuming that the competitive conditions will remain very
Page 16 of 18



Company Name: Saga PLC

challenging. Our assumption is that what we have seen in quarter four to a large extent
represents a new normal and that that's what we will see in 2018. And as a result, we have
lowered our estimate as to how much proﬁt growth we're going to be able to create next
year.

Q - Ravi Tanna

Q - Edward Morris

{BIO 16274236 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks. Just a couple of ﬁnal questions for me. Just on the written to earned beneﬁt,
we have the beneﬁt of that in last year and what we're expecting in the current year. Do
you have the ﬁgures for the other years since IPO, how much of a beneﬁt has this been?
And then the second question is on customer numbers, I mean sort of talked a lot about
the competitive dynamics here, but can you just give us an idea of what you expect your
customer numbers to do next year and then the year after, after the beneﬁt of the
marketing spend? Thanks.

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

For the ﬁrst two years, it was at or above £10 million in both of those years. So it was £10
million then, I think, we'll provide those numbers to you later in detail but it was £10
million then I think above £10 million and then £20 million and then back to £10 million.

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

And then on the second question, we're not going to come out with projections on
customer numbers. I just – I don't want to give that level of detail out into the market, but
you should expect to see growth in both insurance broking side of the business and in
our travel side of the business, which will be really the ﬁrst time that we've invested in
growth since IPO with the focus up until now as you know has been more on PBT than it
has been on a number of customers.
