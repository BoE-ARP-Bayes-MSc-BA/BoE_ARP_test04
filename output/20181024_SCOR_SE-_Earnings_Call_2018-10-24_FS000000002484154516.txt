Good morning, everybody and welcome to the SCOR Group 2018 third quarter results
call. May I please ask you to consider the disclaimer on page 2 of the presentation, which
indicates that the financial results for the third quarter 2018 included in the presentation
are unaudited.
With this, I would like to give the floor to Denny Kessler, CEO and Chairman of the SCOR
Group, who is joined on this call by the entire COMEX.

FINAL

Thank you, Ian and good morning, everyone. The first nine months of 2018 fully
demonstrates the relevance of SCOR strategy and the resilience of the business model.
When you look at the results we presented this morning, we delivered, one, sustained
premium growth that the groups targeted geographical areas and business lines. Two,
excellent technical results in both Life and P&C, and in both Treaty and Specialty. Three,
continuing improvement in the income yield. Four, a stable cost ratio that bears witness to
the efficiency of the Group's operations. Five, excellent operating cash flow. Six, a high
solvency ratio marginally above the optimal range.
SCOR's global footprint, Tier 1 status and go-to-market approach allows the Group to
continuously expand and deepen its franchise globally. At present, co-operating 38 offices
worldwide and covers risk in 160 countries, serving more than 4,000 clients. We expect to
cross the €15 billion mark of gross written premiums in 2018, mainly driven by a
development in the U.S. on the P&C side and in Asia Pacific on the Life side. This translates
into a 10% annual growth rate since 2009 at current exchange rates.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's move to the next slide. SCOR recorded a very solid performance in the first nine
months of 2018. First, the Group delivered strong continuous growth. Gross written
premium stand at more than €11.3 billion in Q3 2018 year-to-date, up 7.4% at constant
exchange rates compared to the same period last year. Strong growth is driven by an
expanded and deepened franchise of the Group's two business engines. Life and P&C
business is 9.2% and 5% respectively at constant exchange rates, which is the right metric.
Second, the Group delivered a strong set of technical results, the P&C net combined ratio
of 93.6%, robust Life technical margin of 7% and a return on invested assets of 2.5%,
driven by a continuing increase in the investment income yield. It is worth highlighting that
despite the high level of natural catastrophic events across the various regions in the third
quarter, the P&C combined ratio year-to-date is tracking better than a strategic plan
assumption.
Last but not least, the Group solvency ratio stands at 222% at the end of the third quarter,
slightly above the optimal range of the solvency scale, driven by robust capital generation.
Putting the impact to the U.S. tax reform, gross net income for the first nine months of
2018 would stand at €405 million, corresponding to a return on equity of 8.9%, higher
than the profitability target set out in the Vision in Action plan.
Given the high frequency of natural catastrophic events in the third quarter, this
performance bears witness to the relevance of SCOR's strategy and its resilient value
creation capability. The Group is in very good shape and we are well on track to meet the
targets of Vision in Action.
Finally, SCOR continues to execute its €200 million share buyback program as planned.
Half of the program has been executed and completion remains on track for July 2019. In

FINAL

the meantime, we're pursuing the optimization of our legal entities, the merger of the 3
SEs will be completed as planned in the first quarter of 2019.
Let's go to slide 5. SCOR is uniquely positioned to accelerate its franchise expansion and
pursue its strong value creation. All three engines are powering ahead. SCOR Global P&C
strengthened its position in the U.S. where we continue to enjoy a steady expansion with
the ability to regain a market position that is commensurate with the global position and
Tier 1 status. At the moment, we're around number 10 in the U.S. versus being number 5
globally. Besides SCOR's Tier 1 status and prime rating are major assets to capture
profitable growth opportunities in a more favorable P&C market environment.
Asia-Pac, SCOR Global Life records exceptional growth, close to 30%, 3-0, per annum,
successfully delivering on Vision in Action and leveraging the quality of the franchise to
outgrow the market.
Finally, SCOR Global Investment expects to strongly improve its financial contributions to
the Group's bottom line from a higher recurring yield. Thanks to the positioning of our
invested assets portfolio, which remains highly liquid, the expected rise in interest rates
would be very positive for SCOR.
All of the three engines have additional room to contribute positively to improving the
return on equity with a continued focus on value creation.

Let me now hand over to Mark for the financial details. Mark, the floor is yours.

Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Thank you, Denny, and good morning, everyone. So, let's begin with slide 6, and I'll walk
you through the financial highlights of the third-quarter results. SCOR underwrote €11.3
billion of gross written premiums in the third quarter of 2018, representing a 7.4% increase
over Q3 2017 at constant exchange rates or 1.9% at current exchange rates.
This top-line growth was generated by the strong contribution of both business engines.
SCOR Global P&C grew by 5%, and SCOR Global Life by 9.2%, both at constant exchange
rates. P&C net combined ratio for the first nine months of the year stands at 93.6%,
including a 7% nat cat ratio due to heavy nat cat activity during the third quarter. The Life
technical margin reached 7.0%, also in line with the Vision in Action assumption. Finally,
SCOR Global Investments delivered a strong return on invested assets of 2.5%, driven by
a recurring yield of 2.3% in the third quarter 2018 year-to-date.
Overall, SCOR's net income for Q3 was €80 million due to the elevated nat cat ratio of
16.5% within the quarter. Year-to-date, net income stands at €342 million with an ROE of
7.6%. Excluding the impact of the U.S. tax reform charge booked in the second quarter,
the net income would stand at €405 million, and this translates into a normalized return
on equity of 8.9%, well in line with our Vision in Action profitability target of 800 basis
points above the five-year risk-free rates.

FINAL

SCOR's solvency position remains very strong at 222% at the end of Q3, marginally above
the optimal range of our solvency scale and at 219%, if we were to take into account the
execution of the remaining part of our share buyback program.
Now, moving on to slide 8, SCOR generated very strong cash flows of €811 million. SCOR
Global Life benefits from strong cash flow, in particular, due to positive impacts from
financial solution deals in the United States, while SCOR Global P&C also provides robust
cash flow. Overall, the total liquidity of the Group is strong and stood at €1.2 billion at the
end of September 30th, in line with our asset allocation assumptions.
Let me now hand over to Victor, who will give you more details on the P&C results.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Mark, and good morning. As an introductory remark, I'd like to say that the
market we have been in for the last seven years is now leading to the emergence of
increasingly differentiated technical performances between insurers and reinsurers. It is,
therefore, becoming increasingly relevant to assess each company's technical
performance on its own merit without putting all of us in the same basket and without
systematically trying to find common ground, trends and fortunes that may not actually
exist.
For us, whilst Q2 was characterized by abnormally high activity in terms of man-made
losses, Q3 has seen, first, a return to normal for man-made loss activity which is reflected
by the technical performance of business solution; and second, significantly higher than
average net cat loss activity.
Q3 2018 events, Jebi, Florence, Mangkhut and Trami are assessed based on the latest
claims information available. Considering the nature and the magnitude of these recent
events, you will appreciate that at this point in time, there is a significant real uncertainty in
these estimates.
Again, for us, all in all, the performance on a year-to-date basis continues to be excellent
with a net combined ratio of 93.6% and a growth of 5% at constant exchange rates. This
growth continues to be fueled mainly by Treaty reinsurance in the U.S., but also, to a
lesser extent, by Treaty reinsurance in Asia and business solution, thanks to our leading
positions on major projects mainly related to infrastructure.
You'll have noticed that we've processed €60 million of reserve release in this quarter
corresponding to 1.5 percentage points of net combined ratio on a year-to-date basis. We
are currently conducting our annual analysis of where our book reserve stands versus the
best estimate and we believe that net of these releases our margin above best estimate
at the end of this year will be at a similar level to the end of last year. These reserve
releases are generated in long tail lines, namely facultative casualty (00:12:11), inherent
defects insurance, and French and UK professional liability, with a good spread over a
number of underwriting years.

Page 4 of 14



Company N ame: SCOR SE

FINAL

You will also have noticed that on a normalized basis the net combined ratio stands at
94.1% on a year-to-date basis, which confirms what we've been indicating about the net
combined ratio range, at which we operate across the entire portfolio. At this point, it is
worth mentioning that the normalized net combined ratios of 94.1% on a year-to-date
basis and 92.1% for Q3 both benefit from around €30 million of positive development in
Q3, in the same long tail lines that generated the reserve releases.
Just like the reserve releases, the positive developments are spread over a number of
underwriting years, which illustrates our disciplined underwriting and our prudent
reserving. This means that our aim to maintain our net combined ratio at around 95% is
realistic. It's also realistic because we expect two ongoing movements that we're currently
observing to balance each other out. On one hand, we may have to slightly adjust our nat
cat budget when planning for 2019 and the following years.
That being said, our nat cat net ratio stands at 7% on a year-to-date basis at the end of
Q3, which even with Michael (00:13:36) already factored in for Q4 does not call our 6%
budget into question in a big way. On the other hand, we are seeing the positive effects
of the pricing improvement that we have obtained across the board in recent years,
gradually materializing in the technical performance, full improvement of the net attritional
ratio. This in mind, we are entering the renewal season in a very sound situation which
allows us to carry on with the same underwriting policies and to continue to offer the
business consistency and continuity that are so essential in our relationships with our
clients.

I will now hand over to Paolo for the presentation of the Life division results.

Paolo de Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Thank you, Victor. SCOR Global Life (00:14:20) delivers a very strong performance in the
Q3 2018 both in terms of growth and profitability. In the first nine months of 2018, we
recorded gross written premiums of €6.7 billion representing an increase of 9.2% at
constant exchange rate or 3.7% at current exchange rate. This strong growth is driven by
the expansion of our protection franchise business in Asia-Pacific which has grown at 29%
per annum since 2016, in particular in China, South Korea, Japan. Asia-Pacific is now
representing a material share of the Life division both on premiums and results.
Growth in Life, as you know, is also being supported by new financial solution deals which
reflect the strength of the teams that we've built in this line of business. Going forward,
we expect the full-year 2018 gross written premium to normalize down in line with the
Vision in Action assumptions or potentially slightly above.
On the profitability side, we see a strong increase in the net technical results standing at
€462 million, up 8.5% at constant exchange rate. The technical margin is solid at 7% for
the first nine months, in line with the Vision in Action assumption. Performance of the inforce portfolio is in line with expectations and the new business underwritten continues to
exceed the group ROE target.

I'll now hand over to François for details on our investment strategy.

FINAL

François de Varenne
Thank you, Paolo. Moving on to slide 11, SCOR's total investment portfolio reaches €27.6
billion at the end of September with an invested asset portfolio of €19.4 billion compared
to €19 billion at the end of June, mainly driven by strong cash flows. The positioning of the
investment portfolio is in line with the Vision in Action target asset allocation. Liquidity is
stable at 5% of the invested assets, in line with the target level defined for the strategic
plan.

Bloomberg Transcript

The share of corporate bond in the invested asset portfolio is stable compared to the
previous quarter at 49%, close to the maximum of 50% designed for the plan. And the
duration of the fixed income portfolio is at 4.5 years compared to 4.6 years at the end of
June. Our fixed income portfolio remains a very high quality with an average rating of A+
and highly liquid. Indeed, at the end of September, expected financial cash flows from the
fixed income portfolio over the next 24 months stand at €5.5 billion, allowing SCOR to
benefit from increasing our investment rate. SCOR has no exposure to Italian government
bonds.
SCOR Global Investments deliver a 2.5% return on invested assets for the first (00:17:05)
nine months of the year, which is supported by a continuing increase in income yield, 2% in
2016; 2.1% in 2017; and now 2.3% during the first nine months of 2018. During the last
quarter, our income yield reaches 2.5%, highlighting the relevance of the portfolio
rebalancing implemented since the launch of the strategic plan. We benefit from an
improved investment yield at 3% at the end of September. Under current market
condition, we expect the annualized return on invested assets to be in the upper part of
the Vision in Action 2.5% to 3.2% range both for full year 2018 and over the entire
strategic plan. This level could be achieved, thanks to the disposal of a significant equity
co-investment that might be completed by the end of the year.
With this, I will hand it over to Ian Kelly for the conclusion of this presentation.

Hi. Morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So, firstly, on the – I guess on the
Q3 cat losses, were any of them surprising and do you have an indication of what the
return period for the losses during the quarter were because (00:19:26) interested in that.
And then I guess following on from that, any thoughts on pricing going into January given
the losses you've had plenty of them this quarter as the year-to-date is still making a very
decent margin, so any updated thoughts on that since Monte Carlo? Thank you.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Victor?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

On the return period, no, we have not completed our studies on that. Well, it's obvious
that you need to go – except last year, you need to go back to 2011, 2012, see the same
sort of ratios in our portfolios. So it's certainly every quarter. Regarding the pricing, well, I
think, first, I insist on that, the situation of each and every company is very specific, and I
think what we are enjoying at the moment is not the same situation for everyone.
In addition, well, the number of lines of business that are in deficit on a worldwide basis
has reached a level that is difficult to imagine that we can tolerate that on a longer basis.
So I think the pricing improvement, in my opinion, will have to continue. They will have to
continue on a very focused basis line by line and market by market and, more importantly,
client by client. I think there are currently (00:20:52) conferences going on, and there are
a lot of remarks that are made by different actors in there which, in my opinion, describe
pretty well the situation whereby, I mean, more and more with the pricing reinsurers, the
leading markets, while discussions are becoming bilateral between the client and the
reinsurers on a global basis, well, the entire business worldwide or in the region where
they operate.
So I think, as I said, we are entering the renewal season in a pretty good position. We
know where we are. We are – as you say, we are good at the moment, but we know what
it takes to be good at the moment, and we believe that in a number of areas and the
latest areas to be highlighted is certainly the large corporate business in the downstream
area, petrochemical refining, where the number of losses this year has piled up to a very,
very high level. So those lines of business or those industry sectors will have to be –
continue to be rectified and corrected.

FINAL

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Good morning. Two questions for me, please. Firstly, just in terms of the U.S. growth on
the P&C side that you're targeting, I think you're kind of deemphasizing workers' comp,
but really looking to grow in general liability. I'm just interested to hear a bit more about
some of the claims inflation patterns that we're seeing there, largely driven by whether
it's wage inflation or whether it's due to other kind of liability and kind of (00:22:46) kind
of issues. But are you still confident that you can still grow? Is this the right time to be
growing in that particular line of business?
Second question, could you update on where you are in terms of S&P surplus capital
versus kind of a AA level? They've recently made some changes to their modules,
particularly around mortality and around ALM requirements. So just interested to hear
what your surplus is over that level and how that has evolved over the year, please? Thank
you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, our growth in the U.S. is a growth on the portfolio of about 250 clients with which we
have established relationship. So it's not a growth across the board. Again, it's a very
focused growth, deepening the relationships and increasing the alliance with selected
clients. So we are very comfortable with the way we grow and the market segmentation
that we've done. We continue to have, well, basically a no-go on workers' compensation.
We do some of it within package of regional companies, but it's a very, very limited
amount of workers' comp that we have.
Regarding inflation. I think we carry like other insurers. I'm sure, we carry very thorough
studies on an annual basis regarding the different parameters and the loss portfolios. So
we have seen inflation. We have repeatedly said last year and the year before that the
price increases are barely covering this inflation and that we are not at the moment in a
situation where the price increases are restoring margin above the loss expectation,
which is why we've grown much less than what we expected to grow. And we've passed
on certain large contracts that have been offered to the market because we thought that
basically the terms and conditions were not reflecting the situation of the market.
But what is encouraging is that the primary insurers in the U.S. are totally cognizant of the
situation and they are themselves with or without the pressure of reinsurers, sometimes
without, unfortunately, they are themselves, well, going on with corrections of the market.
So I think the problems are known and they are being dealt with, probably not at the
depth and the speed we would like to see, but it's encouraging.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thanks. Mark, on the solvency position of the group.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

So, for the S&P capital position, we've had pluses and minuses as you point out from
changes in the S&P model, but we still remain firmly above – well above the AAA

Page 8 of 14



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2018-10-24

threshold in order to maintain our AA- rating. So it's quite secure, not something that I am
particularly concerned about as we do our operating plan.

FINAL

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Would you actually be able to quantify that number? I mean most of your peers do
actually kind of give some kind of guidance about where you are in that. Because it's
interesting to think about that buffer relative to your Solvency II ratio. So is it more of a
limiting factor to you and ideally if you could quantify, that'd be great, please?

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Yeah, it's an estimate obviously, but it's our estimate, not S&P's. It's several hundred
million above the AAA threshold.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

We will now take our next question from Jonny Urwin of UBS. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Just two for me. So, just firstly, just to clarify the message that
you you're giving on the P&C combined ratio for next year. So, is my interpretation correct
that the stronger attritional performance we're seeing today might be offset a bit next
year by a higher cap budget? And then just to clarify again, you mentioned that the 92.1%
normalized for Q3 was boosted by some positive reserve development or is that actually
a normalized number? I didn't catch that, sorry.
And then secondly, have your preparations for the 1st of January renewals been disrupted
at all by the recent Covéa approach? Thank you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

I think you read the message quite clearly. I think what we are saying in a nutshell is that
we have been traveling at 94.5%, 95% combined ratio – net combined ratio, and we
believe that next year considering the nat cat activity and also the penetration of nat cat
business in certain areas of the world, the increased frequency of midsized severity, we
will probably – while it all depends also on our (00:27:36) program, we will renew, but I
think basically it will renew as is. So we will be driven to probably slightly increase our cat
budget, which will be compensated by the continued improvement of attritional, thanks to
the pricing corrections that we have already basically benefited from and will continue
from, benefit from. So overall, I think the 95%, well, as I said, is for us a very realistic
traveling sort of run rate for our combined ratio at the moment.
Regarding the 94.1% year-to-date and the 92.1%, those are two normalized combined
ratio. But well, they both benefit from positive development. Positive development has
Page 9 of 14



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2018-10-24

FINAL

got nothing to do with the margin above best estimate. Now, just positive development
that we see as the years develop. And some of those positive development have been
taken in the accounts of Q3. So if you – and I am talking about €30 million of positive
developments, so if you reintegrate those positive developments in the normalized, well,
your normalized would be again between the 94.5% and the 95%. So I think all of this to
me is showing that there's a lot of consistency in our figures and a lot of stability in our net
combined ratio.
Regarding Covéa, I think this has got absolutely no bearing whatsoever on the renewals.
It's business as usual for us and for our teams. Everyone is from the clients' side and from
our side, we are busy discussing about next year, and Covéa doesn't at all come up in the
conversations.

We will now take our next question from Thomas Fossard of HSBC. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Two question on my side on the (00:29:40) P&C. First one would be
regarding to HIMM losses, just to better understand if you've seen any change to your
early estimate made last year, how that has trended so far and, actually, if you could
mention also how the – maybe the buffer you had at the start of the year may have
changed positively or negatively?
And the second question would be on the gross written premium growth on the P&C
resale. So, year-to-date and constant FX basis, you're plus – you're at plus 5%. But I kept
in mind from the September Investor Day and looking again, this morning at slide 123 of
the Investor Day that you were more guiding towards something which was around 7% to
8% on a full-year basis. So, I mean, should we expect a pretty significant pickup in Q4
based on the nine months' results? Thank you.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Well, on HIMM, first of all, we've paid about 50% of what we have booked in in the
reserves. Secondly, well, for the moment, we see indications that are positive, in the
sense that we still have a buffer, or a cushion of 10% to 15% between our reserve booked
and the sum of all the information that are providing to us by the clients and the insurers.
So, this discussion, we've kept it. We've decided to stay prudent and for the moment,
we've not touched it.
There will be a point in time where we will take a view on that, but for the moment, we
leave it as it is, and we are pretty confident that more and more, as time goes that, yes,
there will be positive out of discussion. But for the moment we've kept it and it is very
stable. So, we are pretty satisfied with what we did in the very first place. I think our
Page 10 of 14



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2018-10-24

reserving has been very solid, continues to be, and we'll see in the quarters to come
whether we take a view or not on this, or when we take a view on this question.

FINAL

Regarding the premium, we are at plus 5%. Well, difficult to say how much will the end of
Q4 will be. But I would think that, well, what we what we gave as an indication but
probably still stands may be a bit softer than that, maybe 6% rather than 7% or 8%.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

We'll now take our next question from Frank Kopfinger of Deutsche Bank. Please go
ahead.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning everybody. I have also two questions. My first question is for François
on the expected realized gains. You said that these disposals might be completed, so is
there any risk that this could be postponed probably also due to the weak equity
markets? But any color on this would be also helpful.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then, secondly for Victor on hurricane Michael, as you mentioned, do have already
any view on the magnitude of potential losses here?

A - François de Varenne
On the first question, on the expected realized gain, so again, this is a core investment
within the equity portfolio. I have strong confidence that the sponsor will execute the
transaction before the end of the year.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

No, no Victor on Michael. No, it's Victor on Michael.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Yes. Well, it's difficult, it's more a feeling that I'm going to give than really is something
that is based on the information. I would think myself that Michael has got a potential,
even though we are not on cat specialist in Florida. But Michael has got the potential to be
maybe slightly higher than Florence. But I think our take on Florence at the moment is
probably a bit conservative. Florence seems to be trending downward. So, I can't give you
a figure at the moment, but the feeling is, well, maybe slightly higher but – than Florence,
but Florence maybe a bit too high at the moment in our reserves.

We will now take our next question from Vinit Malhotra of Mediobanca. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. So, Vinit here from Mediobanca. Two P&C questions, please, for me.
First is on the – so, Victor, this traveling run rate of 95%, of going forward as well. Would it
not benefit a bit from the price increases achieved, or would you say that some of those
price increases might be expected to go into the reserve buffers? That's the first
question. So for next year, I mean.
Second question is, I just noticed that the ceding premiums seem to have gone up quite a
bit in the third quarter on the P&C re side. Is there something we should note? Is it –
because it doesn't just look like another cat bond or there seems to be some more thing
there, if it's just an accounting thing, please could you clarify? Thank you very much.

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, we have repeatedly said for the first two quarters that we had expanded our
requisition in particular our proportional requisition which has got the effect on the ceded
premium, on the earned net premium as well as on the expense ratio. So, there's no
secret about that. We have expanded the perimeter of our proportional requisition and
we have been very open about that.
Regarding the 95%, well, as I said, I mean, we are looking at our cat budget and we think
that our cat budget may have to be slightly increased. If we increase the cat budget, well,
we believe also that our attrition will continue to improve, thanks to the translation of
pricing improvements into the P&L. So – and for the moment, well, our indication is that,
we should have those two phenomenon balancing out. Hence, the stability around 95%.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Very clear. Thank you very much.

We will now take our next question from Michael Haid. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good morning. Two questions also. You mentioned that every
company – every reinsurance company is different. And when I look at the SCOR
combined ratio, I noticed you have a low attritional ratio in the third quarter. And also, I
noticed that you have a low commission ratio, 23.4% only. Is that also driven because of
your retro program, or what is the reason for that? I'm not so sure about that.
And the other thing is, you mentioned the €30 million positive development and,
obviously, the reserve releases of €60 million. Can I just add up these two figures to arrive

at the normalized combined ratio for the third quarter? How sustainable is positive
development of €30 million? I think it's just third quarter event, right?

FINAL

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Positive development is outside of the normalized. Clearly, the normalized is reserved
release and nat cat budget. So, I mean, the positive development I mentioned, because
you have seen that our normalized is slightly lower than our normalized of the previous
quarters, but there is a quarter reason for that. So, I think our normalized on the run rates
continues to be between 94% and 95%, but you've got a bit of positive development this
quarter, positive development of the best estimate itself and not of the margin over best
estimate. So, that's why we provided that information, so that while we are clear on the
fact that on our view, our normalized is 94.5% to 95%, not 94% to 94.5%. I know that Vinit
is trying to drive us downwards by all means but I prefer to be clear of where we are.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

But should we expect the positive development not in each and every quarter or...

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We have a positive development every quarter, but what I'm saying is that this quarter, we
have decided to take a view on certain positive development, and we are having positive
development this quarter that has evolved the, say, average sort of a positive
development we have on each and every quarter.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Okay. Perfect.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

With all the hike. That's all. But that explains why our normalized is a bit lower.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

And the lower commission ratio?

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

The commission ratio, yeah, you're right. I mean you found the reason. We cede more
proportional, but the proportional is higher commission, so you cede something which is
acquired at a higher commission. Oh, yeah, the – mathematically, the effect is you lower a
bit your commission level, yes.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

And is the lower commission ratio then kind of sustainably lower commission ratio for the
next quarters?

A - Denis Kessler

I think at 25%, you have a good proxy of the commission ratio going forward.
