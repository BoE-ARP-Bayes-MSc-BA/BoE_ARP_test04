{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are
very pleased to report excellent underwriting investment results for the second quarter
and first half of the year.
Core income for the quarter was $879 million or $3.45 per diluted share, generating a
core return on equity of 13.7%. In terms of the underwriting results, higher underlying
underwriting income, and net favorable prior-year reserve development as well as the
lower level of catastrophe losses, all contributed to higher core income. Underlying
underwriting income was 8% higher than in the prior quarter, driven by record net earned
premiums of $7.6 billion and an excellent underlying combined ratio of 91.4%.
We are particularly pleased with the continued strong underlying fundamentals in each of
our three business segments. In Business Insurance, net earned premiums were higher
and the underlying combined ratio improved by 3.7 points, and the Specialty Insurance
and Personal Insurance, both delivered meaningful increases in net earned premiums and
continued strong margins.
Turning to investments, our high-quality investment portfolio generated net investment
income of $682 million after-tax, reflecting very strong returns in our non-fixed income
portfolio. These excellent results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to
grow adjusted book value per share by 13% over the past year, after making important
investments for the future and returning significant excess capital to our shareholders.

FINAL

During the quarter, we returned $625 million of excess capital to shareholders, including
$401 million of share repurchases.
Turning to the top-line, the combination of the strong franchise value we offer to our
customers and distribution partners, together with excellent execution by our field
organization produced terrific results. During the quarter, we grew net written premiums
to $8.1 billion, an increase of 11% or 8% after adjusting for the auto premium refunds in the
prior year quarter. Each of our three segments contributed meaningfully to the top-line
growth.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Business Insurance, net written premiums grew by 5%, driven by retention, which ticked
up almost a point, renewal premium change at a near record high of 9.5%, and 9% growth
in new business. Combination of strong pricing and higher retention reflects continuing
strength in the pricing environment. Inside renewal premium change, pure renewal rate
change was a strong 7.1%. Greg will share more detail about the texture underneath
renewal rate change in a few minutes. Renewal premium change also included the highest
exposure growth we've seen in nine quarters, an encouraging sign of improvement in US
economic activity.
In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net return premiums increased by 16%, driven by record
renewal premium change of 12.7% in our management liability business, while retention
remained strong. In our commercial businesses, returned pricing continues to comfortably
outpace estimated loss trend, which will continue to benefit margins as it turns in.
Continued strong pricing in retentions reflect the industry's clear-eyed view of the
ongoing headwinds impacting returns for the industry, including weather volatility, low
interest rates, and social inflation. We expect pricing to continue to outpace loss transfer
some time.
In the Personal Insurance, production was again excellent this quarter. Net written
premiums increased 8% after adjusting for the otter premium refunds in the prior year
quarter. Policies in force in both auto and homeowners are at record levels, driven by
continued strong retention and growth in new business.
While the impact of the pandemic on claim frequency seems to be attracting a lot of
attention when it comes to personal auto, we've been equally focused on applying our
company-wide performed and transform mandate to this business. We're very pleased
with the results. We've accelerated our domestic auto policies in force growth from 1% to
4% over the last six quarters, bringing PIT [ph] count to a record high. This demonstrates
the ongoing success of our three prong strategy in Personal Insurance to meet customers
where they are, serve them how they want, and get them what they need. Going forward,
we will continue to invest in advanced segmentation, multi-channel distribution, and
providing great experiences to continue to deliver profitable growth. Mike will share more
detail in a few minutes.
Our excellent top and bottom-line results this quarter for the first half of the year
demonstrate that continued successful execution of our strategy to grow the top-line at
attractive returns as well as the effectiveness of our well-defined and consistent

investment philosophy. Our focused and well-executed innovation agenda has been an
important contributor to the growth and profitability we have achieved and we will
continue to relentlessly pursue our priorities of extending our list in this -- extending our
lead in risk expertise, providing great experiences to our customers, distribution partners,
and employees, and improving productivity and efficiency. With the momentum we have
and the best talent in the industry, we are well-positioned to continue to create
meaningful shareholder value overtime.
With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.

Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Thank you, Alan. Core income for second quarter was $879 million, compared to a core
loss of $50 million in the prior-year quarter. The significant improvement was the result of
positive factors across the business, including a lower level of catastrophe losses,
improved results, and our non-fixed income investment portfolio, more favorable prioryear reserve development, and increased underlying underwriting income.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our second quarter results include $475 million of pre-tax cat losses, compared to $854
million in last year's second quarter. This quarter's cats were somewhat below of what we
would've assumed for a typical second quarter, but year-to-date, cat losses are still above
what we would have assumed given the high level of losses in the first quarter.
On a year-to-date basis, we have accumulated about $1.5 billion of qualifying losses
toward the aggregate retention of $1.9 billion on our property aggregate catastrophe
XOL Treaty. The Treaty provides $350 million of coverage on the first $500 million of
losses above the aggregate retention amount.
Underlying underwriting income increased 8% to $617 million pre-tax, reflecting the higher
level of earned premium in each of our segments and the strong underlying combined
ratio of 91.4%, consistent with the prior year. As you'll hear from Greg, Tom, and Michael,
improvements in the underlying combined ratio in both Business Insurance and Bond &
Specialty were offset by an increase in the underlying combined ratio and Personal
Insurance. Some of the increase in Personal Insurance was expected given that last year's
quarter benefited from unusually low auto losses as a result of the pandemic.
The underlying loss ratio came in at 61.7%, up 1.3 points from last year's second quarter as
the beneficial impact of earned pricing and excess of loss trend was more than offset by
the comparison to a very low pandemic-related personal auto loss ratio in the year-ago
quarter. Expense ratio of 29.7% is 1.3 points lower than the prior-year quarter as last year's
result was elevated primarily due to the premium refunds we've provided to our personal
auto customers.
Turning to prior-year reserve development, In Personal Insurance, both auto and property
losses came in better-than-expected for recent accident years, resulting in $65 million
pre-tax net favorable PYD. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, $44 million in pre-tax net
favorable PYD was driven by favorable loss experienced in surety and fidelity related to
Page 4 of 23

FINAL

recent accident years. In Business Insurance, net favorable prior-year reserve
development of $73 million was driven by better-than-expected loss experienced in
workers' comp across multiple accident years, partially offset by reserve strengthening in
our run-off book.
Net investment income improved to $682 million after-tax this quarter. Our non-fixed
income portfolio turned in particularly strong results this quarter, reflecting performance in
the equity markets contributing $265 million after-tax. Consistent with our expectations,
fixed income returns were down slightly from the prior-year quarter as the benefit from
higher levels of invested assets was more than offset by a decline in yields. For the
remainder of 2021, we expect fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term
securities, of between $425 million and $435 million after-tax per quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to capital management, operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.8 billion were
again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels and we ended
the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $2.4 billion. During the second
quarter, we took advantage of favorable market conditions and raised the $750 million to
help fund future growth with a 30-year debt issuance of 3.05%, representing our second
lowest 30-year coupon ever and achieving one of the tightest spreads ever for a 30-year
note issued by an insurance company.
The market value of the bonds in our portfolio generally rose as US treasury yields
declined and credit spreads tightened during the second quarter, and accordingly, our
after-tax net unrealized investment gains increased from $2.8 billion as of March 31st to
$3.2 billion at June 30th. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized
investment gains and losses, was $103.88 at quarter-end, up 4% since year-end and up
13% year-over-year. We returned $625 million of capital to our shareholders during the
second quarter with $224 million of dividends and $401 million in share repurchases.
Coming back to reinsurance for a moment, let me direct your attention to Slide 20 of the
webcast presentation for a summary of our July 1st renewables. The structure of our main
cat reinsurance program is generally consistent with the prior year. We renewed our
Northeast Cat Treaty effective July 1st with substantially similar terms and pricing that was
up only slightly on an exposure adjusted basis.
Our Cat Bond, BondPoint REIT 3, is now in the final year of its four-year term. In the annual
reset for the 2021 hurricane season, the attachment point was adjusted from $1.87 billion
to $1.98 billion, while the total cost of the program was flat year-over-year. More complete
description of our cat reinsurance coverage, including our general cat aggregate XOL
Treaty that covers an accumulation of certain property losses arising from multiple
occurrences, is included in our 10-Q, which we filed earlier today and in our 2020 Form 10K.
Before turning the call over to Greg, I'd like to make a few comments about inflation as
the consumer price index has gotten a lot of attention lately. We are relatively less
leveraged to overall CPI type inflation as compared to, say, medical inflation and social
inflation. One place CPI type inflation can impact us is in our short tail lines. That

Page 5 of 23

Company Ticker: TRV US Equity

FINAL

withstanding our strong profitability in PI, as you'll hear from Michael, we are experiencing
a degree of elevated severity. However, relatively short payout periods in short tail lines
limit the impact of that exposure, and although it takes time to earn in over the policy
period, we can price for those increases reasonably quickly.
Additionally, it's important to remember that we have some natural hedges in our
business that mitigate the effects of inflation. First, higher inflation is often associated with
stronger economic activity as well as higher wages and asset values, all of which
contribute to higher insured exposures, and as we've discussed before, higher exposure
contributes to improved margins. Second, although we're not seeing it at the moment, to
the extent interest rates are in correlated to inflation, we would benefit from higher
returns in our investment portfolio as inflation increases. Finally, let me reiterate that we
are conscious of the inflation environment and the uncertainties surrounding it when we
establish our loss peaks and our balance sheet reserves.
With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Greg for discussion of Business Insurance.

Gregory C. Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance had a great quarter with strong financial results and
terrific execution in the marketplace. Segment income was $643 million for the quarter,
compared to a loss of $58 million in the prior quarter. Higher net investment income,
lower catastrophe losses, higher underlying underwriting income, and favorable prior-year
reserve development, all contributed to the year-over-year improvement.
We're particularly pleased with the underlying combined ratio of 93.3%, which improved
by 3.7 points from the second quarter of 2020, primarily attributable to three things. First,
about 2 points of the improvements resulted from earned pricing, exceeding loss cost
trends, another 0.5 point or so resulted from lower non-cat weather, and third, the
improvement also reflects the comparison to the modest net charge we took in the prioryear quarter related to the pandemic. In terms of non-cat whether or the year-over-year
improvement was about 0.5 point favorable, as I just mentioned, this quarter's result was
about 1.5 better than what we assumed for the quarter.
Turning to the top-line, net written premiums were up 5%, benefiting from strong renewal
premium change, including both strong renewal rate and exposure levels that are
trending back to pre-pandemic levels and higher year-over-year new business value. As
for domestic production, renewal premium change was 9.5% of historically high result and
up almost 4 points from the second quarter of last year.
Underlying the RPC, we achieved strong renewal rate change of 7.1% and healthy
exposure growth that reflects an improving trend in our customers' outlook for their
businesses. As Alan said, our ability to continue to achieve historically high pricing with
improved retention speaks to the stability of pricing in the market. New business was up
more than 9% with both select and middle-market contributing. I'll discuss those results in
more detail in a moment when I get to the individual businesses. We're very pleased with
these aggregate production results in our marketplace execution. We've generated

FINAL

written pricing that has been in excess of estimated loss trend for some time now
resulting in significant improvement and the profitability of our BOP.
While this quarter's renewal rate change of 7.1% remains well in excess of loss trend, it
was a little lower sequentially. Let me provide a little more context around that. A
substantial majority of the decrease is attributable to a rational moderating of rate in our
two specialty business units, Excess Casualty, which is inside Middle Market, and National
Property. The bottom [ph] show incomes after three years of very strong compounding
rate increases in these two businesses, so the tempering of rate is appropriate
considering the improved return profile. Also, while renewal rate change was down
sequentially for those businesses, rate increases were still in double-digits. More broadly,
the rate increases we are seeing across Business Insurance continue to be stable and
widespread across both our lines of business and our distribution of accounts.

Bloomberg Transcript

As demonstrated on Slide 12, in our Middle Market and National Property businesses, we
achieved the rate increases in 84% of the accounts that renewed in the second quarter,
up from 81% in last year's second quarter. Even with persistent loss pressures and low
fixed income yields, we will continue to see rate to further improve our margins. We will
also continue to focus on all the non-rate levers to improve the risk profile and profitability
across our portfolio. For example, in our National Property business, our underwriters
continue to focus on improving terms and conditions transaction-by-transaction. Changes
in terms like increase deductibles, management of stock limit, and reinsurance
optimization are meaningful tools in enhancing our profitability and our underwriters
continue to be active in utilizing all those levers.
As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal rate change was 4.3%, more than 2
points higher than the second quarter of 2021, while retention was 80%. These results
reflect deliberate execution as we pursue improved returns in certain segments of the
business and we're pleased with the progress we're making in this regard. Exposure
growth was all over 4% for the quarter, which is an encouraging sign as the economy
reopens. Lastly, new business was up 6% over the prior-year quarter, driven by the
continued success of our new BOP 2.0 product, which is now live in 31 states. This stateof-the-art product includes industry-leading segmentation and a fast easy quoting
experience. We are encouraged with our agents' adoption of the new products as both
submissions and new policies are up.
In Middle Market, renewal premium change of over 9% and retention of 87% were both
historically high. Renewal rate change at 7.4% remains strong in well and excess of loss
trend. Finally, new business was up 16% over the prior year quarter, driven by success with
larger accounts as well as some improvement in the quality of the flow in the market. As
always, we remain disciplined around risk selection in underwriting.
To sum up, Business Insurance had a terrific quarter by all measures. We're pleased with
our execution in further improving the underlying margins in the book and we continue to
invest in the business for long-term profitable growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to the Tom.

Thomas M. Kunkel

{BIO 16615934 <GO>}

Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty posted excellent returns and growth in the quarter.
Segment income was $187 million, considerably more than double the prior-year quarter,
driven by favorable prior-year reserve development, a significantly improved underlying
underwriting margin, and higher business volumes. The underlying combined ratio of
83.4% improved by over 4.5 points from the prior-year quarter, as pricing that exceeded
loss cost trends drove a lower underlying loss ratio.
Turning to the top-line, net written premiums grew an exceptional 16% in the quarter with
solid contributions from all our businesses. In management liability, renewal premium
change was a record 12.7%, driven by near-record rate. Retention remain strong at 86%,
new business increased 6% from the second quarter of last year, our first quarterly
increase since the beginning of the pandemic with strong new business pricing. Surety
also grew for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic and international again
posted meaningful growth, including strong retention and rate. So Bond & Specialty
results were excellent and reflect our ability to successfully manage this business through
a variety of business and economic cycles.
And now, I'll turn it over to Michael for Personal Insurance.

Bloomberg Transcript

Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our second quarter
Personal Insurance results. Segment income of $121 million was up $111 million from the
prior-year quarter, benefiting from lower catastrophes, higher net investment income, and
higher net favorable prior-year reserve development. Partially offsetting these
improvements was a lower underlying underwriting gain, which I will discuss in more detail
in a moment.
Our second quarter combined ratio improved from the prior year quarter by about 1.5
points to 99.7%. Net written premiums grew 16%. Recall that in the prior-year quarter, we
provided $216 million of premium refunds to automobile customers in response to the
impact of the pandemic. Adjusting for these premium refunds, net written premiums grew
a very strong 8%, with domestic homeowners up 12% and domestic automobile up 4%.
Automobile delivered another excellent quarter with a combined ratio of 91.6%. The
underlying combined ratio was an impressive 92%, although up 6 points from our prioryear quarter, which reflected low loss activity during the initial months of the pandemic.
The current quarter results, reflect the benefits of modestly lower claim frequency
compared to pre-pandemic levels.
As we exited the quarter, claim frequency was closer to pre-pandemic levels and we
would expect that trend to continue in the third quarter. Our strong current quarter
profitability also reflects increased severity, particularly in collision and third-party physical
damage claims, driven primarily by higher costs of used vehicles and parts. As auto loss
experience approaches pre-pandemic levels, we plan to begin filing for rate increases in

Page 8 of 23

FINAL

selected states later this year, as we continue to balance business volumes and
profitability. While it will take some time for future rate actions to earn into our results, we
are well-positioned to continue to be -- profitably grow in auto.
In homeowners and other, the second quarter combined ratio of 108.3% was 6 points
lower than the prior-year quarter, driven by 13.5 point reduction in catastrophe losses.
Partially offsetting the catastrophe favorability was an 8 point increase in the underlying
combined ratio. Approximately one-third of this increase reflects non-catastrophe
weather losses, which were in line with our expectations, but elevated over a less active
prior-year quarter. The remainder of the increase reflects continued elevated frequency
and severity of fire and non-weather weather losses. The increased severity we saw in the
second quarter includes higher repair costs due to a combination of labor and material
increases. We continue to see great increases in response to these trends and we'll
continue to actively monitor inflation in loss cost trend changes and factor them into our
pricing and underwriting decisions.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to quarterly production, domestic automobile retention was up slightly to a strong
85%, new business increased by 19%, and policies in force grew 4%. Domestic
homeowners and other delivered another excellent quarter with retention remaining
strong at 85%, renewal premium change increasing to 8.2%, and new business growth of
28%, reflective of increased core activities and increase in average premium, along with
the ongoing successful roll out of Quantum Home 2.0. Policies in force grew 7%.
As Alan mentioned, our policies in force growth, across both auto and homeowners, are
at record levels. Actually, our policies in force across both auto and homeowners are at
record levels, reflecting our ongoing efforts to perform and transform in personal
insurance. When we launched Quantum Auto 2.0, we designed it with a modular product
structure to give customers what they need and to deliver long-term performance. This
has enabled us to seamlessly introduce new rating variables, such as, vehicle history, prior
insurance history, and telematics, allowing us to continually improve our pricing
segmentation.
Regarding telematics, we've seen take-out rates for IntelliDrive increased by 30% since
the launch of our second generation offering, which features a fully redesigned mobile
experience, monitors distracted driving, and improves our ability to match price to driving
behavior.
Our momentum in auto aligns very well with our goal of providing total account solutions
for customers. The Quantum Home 2.0 product is now available in over 40 states,
generating consistent growth in policies in force. Both distributors and customers continue
to see value in our combined auto and property offerings. Our multi-channel PI distribution
strategy allows us to meet our customers where they are. As a result of the success of
our new products, our existing relationships continue to perform well. Additionally, we've
seen more demand for agent appointments, which is contributing meaningfully to our
growth.

Thanks, Abbe. As bitter-sweet as it is, we have one last piece of business this morning
before we turn to Q&A. I want to acknowledge and thank our partner and friend, Tom
Kunkel, will be retiring in September, after a spectacular 37-year career at Travelers.
Tom's impact as the leader of our very successful Surety and Management Liability
businesses has been profound. In addition to delivering exceptional financial results over
many years, Tom and his leadership team fostered a culture of care, community, and
excellence that extends throughout our Bond & Specialty organization and throughout
Travelers. It's one of the many reasons why I'm so pleased that Jeff Klein [ph], currently a
member of Tom's leadership team and Head of our Management Liability business, will
succeed Tom. Jeff has been with Travelers from more than 20 years. He's a proven
leader and the perfect candidate to take the range from Tom. You'll hear from Jeff on
October on our third quarter earnings call. Tom, we're all going to miss you, personally
and professionally.
And with that, we're happy to take your questions.

Questions And Answers

(Question And Answer)
Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We have our first question from the line of Michael
Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael W. Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Thank you and good morning everybody. I want to drill first, I guess Mike, one, from your
comments on Personal Auto, and your comments I think towards the end when you said
you'll begin to file some rate increases later in the year. Question kind of centered around
the timing of that, frequency benefits for you seem to be lasting a little bit longer than
Page 10 of 23



FINAL

Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2021-07-20

some of your peers, maybe that's a mix of business issue that you might have a little
more preferred, maybe you can confirm that. But what's driving -- if frequency started to
come back to pre-pandemic levels and expect that to continue, I guess, why not take rate
now? Why wait till later in the year and what's driving that need for rate? If it's not
frequency and maybe it is, is it more the severity? So kind of a couple-pronged question
there, but more on the timing of the other rate, why not now? And then really kind of
what's driving? Is it more of a frequency or severity that's driving your need for rate?
Thank you.

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure, Michael. Thanks for the question. Really that the timing is really just a function of the
process. We're actively putting together filing packages and engaged in conversations
with State Insurance Departments as we speak. So it's not a question of waiting to get
rate, it's just a function of the process of working with regulators to get rate increases
filed and approved. And to your question about frequency and severity again, I think in my
comments about the quarter in particular, we're seeing frequency coming out of the
quarter, returning more towards pre-pandemic levels and we are seeing severity pressure
has spiked out some of the physical damage pressures and I can give you a just a quick
example there, right?
And you've all seen the news about used car prices being up 50% that particularly
impacts us in the case of total losses where the average cash value and that loss is up
pretty significantly. There's a little bit of an offsetting good guy there because we get
more for the salvage recovery on that total vehicle but net-net that's putting upward
pressure on severity and that's one example total cost to repair vehicles is up - bio injury
[ph] severity is also got up, got upward pressure on it. So, we're planning really to both
frequency and severity to answer your question on the drivers.

Q - Michael W. Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Okay. That's all for Mike and maybe it's the follow-up in a minute. If the timing you say is
more of a process, it sounds like you'd rather do -- can do some sooner rather than later.
Does the -- I mean, your margins today in a second quarter we're still better than 2Q 2019
-- I'm sorry, still better than 3 - but you expect things to change so do - with margin is still
better do you expect much of a pushback from anybody at the state level to say you guys
and maybe some of the industry still have really good profit here. So that might be a bit of
a push back on - I don't know how much you expect to get from rate but that might be
some pushback on the ability to get rate that you want given pretty decent return still?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Yeah. Michael, I think it's a great observation, and it is part of that process that I that I
described is really a conversation with regulators about what the historical experience has
been. But also pointing out that, part of that favorable experience is really due to the
extraordinary event that was the fact -- that is the pandemic. And so we're in
conversations with them about how to weight historical experience versus prospective
views of trend and also state-by-state experience varies and our starting point varies by
state. We've talked in in prior quarters about the fact that we did take rate reductions in
over 20 states across the country. And so those are certainly some of the places we're
Page 11 of 23



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The

looking at initially to see if we could take some of that rate back, which is a different
conversation maybe than in a state where we didn't file a rate decrease historically.

FINAL

So again, great observation and really all part of that process that we're that were
engaging in as we speak.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research.
Your line is open.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Hey, thanks. Good morning. Can you guys hear me?

Bloomberg Transcript

(Multiple Speakers)
I'm sorry about that, just got back to the office today, so getting used to the old phone.
So I just want to keep it on Personal Auto, when we think about where you're seeing some
of the elevated lost trend, Michael, is it more geographic or is it preferred versus more
standard? I mean like what are the kind of a variable is that you're looking at the most to
kind of think about where you're seeing loss trying to come back the most?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Yeah, great, great question Ryan and good morning, welcome back to the office. We are
seeing it -- there are variations across geographies. We look at things like return to normal
indices, we look at driving data by state, and by geography. But broadly speaking most
areas of the country are seeing driving activity return again, to close to pre-pandemic
levels, closer in some places than others. We also continue to monitor as we've talked
about in the past commuting miles versus non-commuting miles and there is still a
different mix of miles today than there has been historically, but when you put all that
together and you look at claim frequency, the frequency benefits we saw and that's what
part of my comment about as we exited the quarter, the frequency benefits we've seen
over the past few months and quarters have started to wane in and wane throughout the
second quarter which is part of our comment about trends returning to pre-pandemic
levels.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Got it. And I guess my follow-up is one of the home side. So the home attritional loss ratio
is above 60 [ph]. That's clearly somewhat elevated, but we've seen the price of
something like lumber, timbers come down quite a bit since mid-2Q. How much of an
alleviating factors should we think about that moving forward, in terms of the type of
pressure that's putting on the loss ratio in home or was putting on the loss ratio on home?

FINAL

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Sure, it's a great question Ryan. I would say a couple things. First, in my remarks I did talk
about frequency and severity in particularly frequency and severity of fire and nonweather water losses, driving some of that underlying deterioration. So clearly the lumber
prices are severity item not a frequency item and we are seeing up - we did see uptick in
the quarter in both. I would take a just a quick step back as we're talking about auto and
property though and just make a couple of observations and then come back and finish
the answer to your question. If you take a step back and you look at the segment
combined ratio on both an overall and an underlying basis. It's very consistent with the
long run average for this business. And when you look at the auto combined ratio, not
surprisingly in the quarter, it still ran below the long-term average. And in Property, in the
quarter, the combined ratio is call it, 4 to 6 points above those long-term averages on a
total in an underlying basis. So, that just sort of gives you a little bit of an order of the
magnitude of what we're talking about here.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'd also remind you that Property -- in Property, the combined rates are the highest
combined ratio we see in the year is the second quarter. So you got to sort of put the
second quarter into context. But that said, the severity pressure we saw in the quarter
was combination of labor and materials. So certainly the, 50% plus increases in lumber are
in there, double-digit increase in roofing materials is in there, high single-digits to low
double-digit increases and labor is in there. And when we look at our property loss cost
mix, it's really labor followed by contents, followed by materials.
So even if -- the short answer your question I think is, even if lumber prices come back
down that does still a relatively small component of the loss cost. But we do see period to
period volatility and frequency and severity and the attritional loss in Property. So again,
that's part of why I give you that long run view of where the quarter was relative to history
and at the end of the day we take a step back and we look at the renewal premium
change. We're driving in Property and our focus really is to continue to drive rate and
property to address some of those pressures.

Q - David Motemaden

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Hi, thanks. Good morning, just wanted to just follow up a bit more on the auto side, so
maybe Michael. I'm just wondering, I guess, obviously you're taking rate. But how you're
thinking about balancing, taking rate versus what could be maybe short-lived severity
increases or is it view that these increases in severity that you're witnessing are not
transitory and might be more sustainable?

Page 13 of 23

Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2021-07-20

FINAL

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Yeah, it's a great question and certainly, as we've talked about severity trend over time,
we've pretty consistently talked about the fact that we take a long-run view of trend when
we set our prices. Now, if the starting point is elevated because we've seen an uptick in
severity and that in our lost costs, the question is your starting point elevated and are you
trending off that elevated starting point or is your experience you're seeing or is the
experience we're seeing in this quarter and normally. I think if I broke apart frequency and
severity for you I'd say again, we continue to see the frequency trending towards prepandemic level that's continuing. How much of the auto materials cost, physical damage
cost, inflation is transitory or not is a key question. And there's a lot of varying opinions
around that and we'll factor our best estimate into that assessment as we factor in what
we think we need for rate on a go-forward basis.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Let me just add to that, whether inflation, what -- our view on whether inflation is
transitory, we're certainly looking out over the duration of the liability. So when we're
talking about CPI-type inflation again, lumber-used cars will (inaudible) up that's impacting
relatively short tail line. So we don't really have to forecast long term in that case, and
because it's short tail, the claim activity comes in pretty quickly, we see it reasonably
quickly and we can react to it pretty quickly.

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Great, point Alan.

Q - David Motemaden

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Got it. That makes sense. That's helpful. And then, maybe a question for Alan, just on the
investment in Fidelis, I was hoping maybe you could elaborate on the thought process
behind that? And maybe sort of thinking around your own non-admitted offering and sort
of aspirations there?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yes, thanks for that question. We've got a fair amount of interest in this, which I'm thrilled
to have the interest in it. We're interested in it as well. Let me put it in a little bit of
context, if you can infer from the fact that we didn't disclose terms, it's not a material
investment for it. So I think that's just important background to start with. But having said
that, when we think about investment activities, we're -- and as we've said, we're
interested in things that provide some strategic capability. And, we've said for a long time
that we're underweight E&S and this gives us a window into a successful innovative
management team that has a lot of expertise in the niche non-admitted space. And in
products and geographies that are that could teach us something as well. So, it really is
about it about a learning exercise for us.

FINAL

Thank you. The next one is from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan.

Q - Jamminder Bhullar
Hi, Good morning. So first just had a question on what you're seeing in the workers' comp
market in terms of pricing, I think there's been an expectation that things would begin to
turn. Are you seeing that? And then I have a follow-up.

A - Gregory C. Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Morning, this is Greg. Yeah, workers' comp continues to bounce around. We've thought
that we were going to hit the bottom of couple quarters back and then with the pandemic
there has clearly been some favorable frequency activity around workers' comp and I
think wages, payrolls et cetera. As we continue to work with the bureaus in terms of their
lost cost recommendations, they are coming in less negative and I think the key will be
around how they treat 2020. That's an anomalous year or if they're going to factor that
into the overall rate making. So the overall book of business, we didn't quite hit a positive
rate number, we are slightly negative in the quarter, but we do see improvement on it
every quarter.

Q - Jamminder Bhullar
And then on tote costs and sort of social inflation with sort of the reopening of courts,
should we assume that we should start to see a little bit of a pickup and social inflation?
And how does that affect your loss ratio? And have you been assuming have you been
incorporating continued high social inflation in your lost picks through the past few
quarters?

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Hey, Jimmy, it's Dan, I'll take that one. We have taken the view that social inflation has
gone nowhere. And that the elevated level of losses that we saw call it pre-pandemic are
going to persist and that the elevated level of lost trend even off of that higher level of
losses which is going to persist. So that's what we've assumed as we've continued to
make our lost picks and assess our reserves. And I think it's going to be a while before we
see courts work through the backlog of having been closed for much of the past year,
priority in some jurisdictions is going to be given a criminal cases over civil cases whether
the courts are reopening for in-person discussions or virtual, it's still a question in some
jurisdictions. So, I think it's going to be a while before we know the answer, I think we said
pretty consistently last year that there's uncertainty in that environment and because
there's uncertainty we were taking a cautious view and our view of lost picks and reserves.
But the short answer to the question is, we think social inflation is as strong as ever and
that's reflected in our numbers.

Q - Jamminder Bhullar
Okay, and then just lastly, I think Alan noted that the fact that you didn't disclose the price
on Fidelis means that it wasn't a large investment, but should we assume that there
should be any impact from the investment on your share buyback plans for this year?

FINAL

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah, Jimmy in part of our overall capital management strategy that's not going to be sort
of almost by definition. It's not going to be not going to have a meaningful impact on our
capital position at all.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 21718992 <GO>}

Yeah, good morning everyone. I just want talk about - there has been a lot of question on
Personal Auto, but I had one more, you - this has been the best month for growth in terms
of new policies that you guys have seen since back in 2016, given that you firmly expected
frequency to return. Is there a risk that you've put on customers' who came in because of
a good price in the pandemic, but the price won't be adequate price post pandemic and
they might lease?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Hey, Josh, this is Michael, I suppose there's always a risk and certainly there's pressure on
retention when you start to increase prices on, that said, we feel comfortable with the
pricing levels that we've been putting business on the books, I mentioned IntelliDrive as a
key driver of some of our growth, distribution expansion, it's been a driver of some of our
growth, there's a lot of things that you can point to including elevated code [ph] activity
that are drivers of growth in Auto. We've seen some slight improvement in close rate in
Auto, over the past few months as we've retained -- we've maintained RPC essentially flat
but there are a lot of other drivers of growth than just price that we can point to the
probably alleviate some of that.

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Hey, Josh, it's Dan. Just one other comment on that. I think we've done a terrific job in the
order book over recent years, in terms of understanding our appetite and having a
consistent appetite. And I just point you to the last time we did take significant pricing in
Auto back in 2017, 2018 timeframe. We did not shrink (inaudible) in that environment.

FINAL

Good point. And an unrelated topic which is sort of been addressed with the court
reopening somewhat not. Can you talk about whether in 2Q you are seeing convergence
between model lost cost trends and actual experience? I assume that you prepared for a
lot more losses on incurred basis during the - for the pandemic that didn't occur because
of the nature of courts. Is that narrowing right now, or we still experiencing loss (inaudible)
far below the model overall?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Let me make sure I understand the question, Josh. You mean, you mean the trend in the
loss ratio or you mean the level of incurred losses relative to ultimate losses?

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 21718992 <GO>}

I mean, in every line of business you assume that the lost call trends will be 4%, 5%, 6%
but during the pandemic it wasn't that because of courts and other reasons but you
assume that that's just a delay. I'm trying to think, are you -- is your loss experience
coming closer in line with your model projections? Or are we still have a huge back load of
reserves for claims that haven't come through because pandemic conditions persist?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, I think closer to the latter. So we still have for example low pay to incurred ratios. We
still have for example the majority of the ultimate losses we recognized be [ph] it for
COVID sitting in IBNR.
And to the earlier question on court reopening again I think people are maybe jumping
the gun on that. I think it's going to be quite wait a while before we work through the
backlog here and see. So we are still expecting longer periods of development in terms
of how long it's going to take to get the ultimate. And again as we said previously, even
though the data itself looked good, we took a cautious view in terms of our loss picks and
our reserves with assumptions more in line with our normal long-term lost trend [ph].

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 21718992 <GO>}

All right then I'll dig in a little bit later, but I don't want to keep up the line, thank you very
much.

Are there better macroeconomic indicators we should be looking at if CPI is a lesser

Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The

measure for long tail lines? I have muscle memory for my formal role that there are other
indices you look at that is more nuanced for your businesses to measure claims inflation?

FINAL

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Yeah, Tracy, let me start and Dan can fill in whatever I miss. We're actually not trying to
forecast CPI or inflation generally, we're trying to forecast lost costs. And we do that by
analyzing our own data and incorporating forecast from third parties and we do that on a
very granular basis. So take workers comp for example, we're not forecasting medical
inflation, we're looking at components. So in prescription drug prices durable medical
equipment et cetera. And we're doing that in the same mix that those (inaudible) cost
contribute to our actual losses. So it's hard, I mean, obviously we can't give you a single
number and it's hard to say, geez, go look at this index or that index because we're doing
it on a funny very granular basis in part by tumbling our own data, squaring triangles and
by reference to third-party sources.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

Okay, so all those nuanced factors that you looking at does that worry you with respect to
inflation if CPI is not the indicator we should be super focused on?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

No, there's nothing about lost cost or inflation that's worrying us at all. In fact, we - the
emphasis on in the conversation here is because to a degree we are seeing it but we saw
pretty good profitability and personal lines and it's into the short term line and the
consequence of that is we can see it very quickly and react to it very quickly and contrast
that to say social inflation, which was an issue for us a few years ago, where takes a little
bit longer for us although, I will say that I think as compared to many we saw that very,
very quickly and there's not nearly as much leverage on the balance sheet. So, there's not
as much risk in the reserves and we can price for it relatively quickly. So, there's, actually
nothing at all about the inflation environment that's of concern to us at the moment in
shorter lines or long-term lines.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

Okay, great, just one follow-up on Fidelis, it's also a reinsurer. So, I'm just wondering if this
partnership could look like a sidecar where (inaudible) own premiums to this platform
where it could potentially compete with reinsurers on your panel?

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Not, so, certainly, not at the moment, not as way we've contemplated this, it really is just
the way we presented it is pretty simple, it's a really interesting business model, it's a
fantastic management team, they've got a great track record, that their cultures are very
compatible, what they do is very interesting to us and we wanted to learn more of that.
For the time being, that's really all the risk to it and, maybe over time we'll collaborate
with them and they'll be business opportunities, who knows? But for the time being it
really is just as we've laid it out.

Thank you. The next one is from Elyse Greenspan, from Wells Fargo.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, thanks. Good morning. Alan, I guess my first question is on the Fidelis investment as
well. Through the years you've said, you guys weren't interested in re-insurance fields.
Obviously, there's unique features of this investment away from just re-insurance, but I
just want to get a sense of just as we think about M&A, like has your stance on reinsurance changed and then you like issues $750 million of debt in the quarter, and it was
earmarked for business growth. So I'm just trying to is - you tying that capital into potential
M&A or is that more earmarked for organic business growth?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Well, let me start with Fidelis then I'll ask Dan to comment on the capital raised. So there's
just nothing at all about this that signals any shift in our thinking about reinsurance, we are
primarily focused on being a primary writer with very limited interest in reinsurance and
that remains the case. It just so happens that Fidelis writes some of their business in the
form of reinsurance, but that's just one of their four pillars of business. There are some
interesting aspects of the reinsurance business. They've got really thoughtful risk
management tools, they are really thoughtful with risk and rewards.
And so there's the potential for us to learn something in terms of managing our own cap
portfolio, and I will point out why it hasn't been and I don't expect it to be any significant
focus for us. We do write a little bit of reinsurance where it's complementary to our core
business. So for example we've got a (inaudible) re-business. So it's not completely
important to us, it's a very small part of what we do. It's no change in strategic focus, but
it's not alarming to us, and in this respect we think that there's something for us to learn.

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

And Elyse, regarding the capital, the capital question, no change at all in our philosophy or
more urgency around M&A or lack of urgency around M&A. It's really coincidental the
timing of when these things came together and again the Fidelis investment was small
enough that it wouldn't have necessitated much in the way of capital management
anyways. I think if you go back in the transcripts, 6 or even 8 quarters ago, we were talking
about, eventually we would have the need to issue more debt just to keep up with growth
in the top line and to maintain a debt to capital ratio that we're comfortable with.

Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The

Okay. Thanks. And then my second question on, can you guys quantify the impact that
exposure had on your premium growth in the quarter? And then within select accounts
within business insurance, I noticed that the premiums declined in the quarter but I
thought exposure would have benefited on that business line as well?

FINAL

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

And so Elyse, it's Dan, I'm going to guess resented, resist the temptation to sort of try to
do a reconciliation of upgrading [ph] premiums as the degree that there's positive
exposure, the same way that the degree that there's positive rate that just means that
the accounts that renewed would have renewed at that much more. Having said that, it's
applicable to the accounts that renewed, that's the measure of that it would apply to. I
don't know Greg, you want to -

A - Gregory C. Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, I mean, just a little bit more color on Select. We've shared with you that we've been
very focused on improving the profitability of that business. And so, we're certainly been
very thoughtful around production and pursuing margin improvement for rates and terms
of conditions and that sort. I will tell you also in the Select business, during the pandemic
because of some of our ability to have a little more flexibility for a customer we
suspended some billing and some cancellation activity and now that's back in play in the
marketplace. You have a little bit of drag on the top line with that, just back to normal
activity, but when comparing that to the base period that has a little bit of an impact also
at least.

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks. Most of them have been asked. I just it's curious, wildfires are kind of kicking
up here in the west coast, maybe you can talk a little bit about what you've kind of been
doing over the last couple of years to get to manage your exposure to the wildfires?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Sure, Brian. This is Michael. And certainly, we're managing our exposure to wildfire across
the business. But I'll start with the Personal Insurance. I think a lot of the actions are
common across the place but Greg can chime in if I miss anything on the commercial line
side. It really is a continuation of the conversation that we've been having with you in
terms of the way we've been managing it, I think we've talked a lot about California in
particular in the context of wildfires, but certainly the peril is the peril that exposes us
across more states in the west than just California.

Page 20 of 23



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The

FINAL

So one specific development I would point you to in 2021 is, we've extended our
agreement with Wildfire Defense Systems to apply to Colorado, in addition to California,
so we've got that sort of risk prevention partnership extending across an additional state
in the west which we think on the margin is helpful. And then, maybe just an update on our
progress in California, in addition to the launch of the new product, which we successfully
got in market in 2020.
We're now converting California policies to that new product so think new pricing
segmentation, think new rate level, think new eligibility as respect wildfire exposure and
just last month we got an additional 6.9% rate increase approved on the property product
in the state. So we continue to manage through rate eligibility terms and conditions. And
we do continue to work our way through the non-renewal activity subject to the lifting of
the moratorium as they expire on as another as another lever we're pulling. And again a
lot of those are specific California comments, but you can think about those on in terms of
again segmentation modeling, exposure management applying more broadly across the
West.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Thanks. I guess the quick follow up here, just curious you continue that's really strong
growth in your commercial property lines. Can talk a little bit about what the kind of
market dynamics are in that line on that line that's the one area that I thought were seeing
pricing really kind of moderate the quickest?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Yeah, we - as you saw we have plus 9% across the property line and really that the
primary amount of growth underneath that is RPC driven. And that's why we gave you that
supplement exhibit or Excess Casualty and National Property, were two of our many
specialty lines that we have but to have certainly been the poster children for some rate
momentum over the last couple years and as I said, still yet in double digit but moderating
somewhat. But that's what's driving that growth.

I think, coming into the quarter. And again, it approach pre-pandemic levels, as we left the

Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess, this is for Greg, when we look at the presentation on
select accounts, the RPC for the first quarter of '21 showed up as 8.8% when you actually
reported in 1Q it was 6.7% that seems from the outside like a big change, that's what you
can talk about the process and how we should think about the inherent estimates in the
RPC.

Yeah, Meyer, both of those quarters don't close - the fourth quarter and the first quarter
developed out, as you said, about two points. And I'll just remind you that, that's an
estimate of what we believe the current force is going to look like in terms of the
exposure growth. So we're always estimating that and when you have a V impact in the
economy, your model sometimes don't keep up with that really quick and adroit change
that's happening. So we basically shortened their model period. So if we were using a 6month moving average thing, we move do a three month moving average to try to keep
up with that change in the marketplace and that gives us a little bit change in the
development. So we think will be in front of that going forward. But that was basically the
methodology underneath that.
