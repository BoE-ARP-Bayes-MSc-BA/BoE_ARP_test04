Fernando.

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Natalia.
Hello everyone. And welcome to the first quarter results presentation. As always, it is a
pleasure to be here with you. This is the first quarter of the new three-year strategic plan;
and as you can see, the numbers are very positive, fruit of the transformation and the
changes that we are implemented.
Looking at the key figures for the quarter, revenue is up almost 6%, mainly due to the rise
in premiums and higher financial income, principally from the change in market value of
some investments. Overall premiums are up over 3%, nearly 4% at constant exchange
rates and life premiums are up almost 14% over 15% at constant change exchange rates.
Our combined ratio has improved 60 basis points and is now under our target of 96%.

FINAL

The net result of EUR188 million has increased 0.6% despite the current low yield
scenario.
Shareholders equity is up a 3.5% as a result of the improved stock market, and also the
fall in interest rates, as well as a currency appreciation. The ROE, excluding the 2018
goodwill writedowns, would have been 8.3%. And the solvency II ratio, which our CRO will
discuss later, stood at almost 190% at the close of December, basically as a result of the
fall in IFRS net equity at 2018 year-end. On the next slide, we'll take a look at the key
figures by unit.
On the right side, you can see the KPIs by region and business unit. Regarding attributable
result, I would like to highlight first Iberia continues to be the largest profit contributor with
close to EUR120 million net result and solid underlying performance. Second, there were
strong improvements in Brazil up EUR10 million, and in North America up EUR17 million,
and strong contributions from both Latam North and Latam South. This improvement in
profitability in these four regions is also reflected in the low combined ratios.

Bloomberg Transcript

Third, MAPFRE which comprises a traditional reinsurance business and the global risks
portfolio contributed over EUR50 million in this quarter, despite a large industrial plane.
And fourth and last, ASISTENCIA continued facing profitability challenges in the UK, which
have impacted the net result by almost EUR3 million. We expect this trend to change over
the coming quarters. Regarding premiums, growth is very strong thanks to excellent
performance in Iberia, Latam North and reinsurance.
In addition, appreciation of the US Dollar and some Latin American currencies has also
supported premium growth in several markets while the Brazilian real has still been a drag
on premiums, but to a much lower extent that land that last year. On Slide 4, we look at
the adjusted attributable result. Despite lower realized gains, the adjusted attributable
result has been stable this quarter, thanks to more benign weather. Regarding cat events,
we were affected by several winter storms in the US.
, heavy rains in Brazil and with storms in Malta. However, and fortunately, we did not
consider impacts relevant, and therefore they have not been taken into account in this
calculation. On Slide 5, we'll look at the capital structure and credit metrics. On the left,
you can see the breakdown of the capital structure, which amounted to EUR12.6 billion.
Our credit metrics remain quite strong with leverage around 24%, affected by the BMN
acquisitions, which had a total amount of around EUR162 million. The remainder of the
increase is mainly due to transitory funding of subsidiaries. In April, we cast in a EUR55
million dividend from Brazil, taking advantage of the current real valuation, which will
contribute to reducing leverage, which should go back down to target levels over the
course of the year. Interest coverage, you have it on the right, is around 20 times earnings
before interest and tax.
Finally, regarding our financial strength, our ratings continue to be affirmed by the main
credit agencies. In March, S&P confirmed the credit rating of MAPFRE and its subsidiaries

FINAL

with a positive outlook. On the next slide, we will take a look at our equity position.
Shareholders equity is up 3.5% to close to EUR8.3 billion.
The main reasons behind this improvement are, first, an almost EUR300 million increase
of an unrealized gains on available for sale portfolio. This change is based on improved
stock markets in Europe and USA, and also a fall in interest rates in Europe. Second, the
appreciation of all main currencies with the exception of the Turkish lira, which has had a
EUR91 million positive impact during the quarter. And finally, the decrease of EUR262
million, corresponds to the 2018 final dividend approved by the AGM.
On the next slide, we'll look at the investment portfolio. On the right, you can see their
assets under management are up by 5% driven by, first, improvements in stock markets
after the important correction at the end of 2018. Second, currency effects as I already
mentioned. Third, the consolidation in March of the BMN bancassurance acquisitions.

Bloomberg Transcript

And fourth and last, real estate increased as a result of the application of IFRS 16
regarding leases, which implies an increase of EUR278 million in the value of real estate
assets, mainly branches across Spain. The breakdown of the investment portfolio is on the
left. Asset allocation has been relatively stable throughout the year and exposure to
government and corporate debt remains mostly unchanged. The large exposures
correspond to a Spanish sovereign debt with a EUR16.5 billion and Italian debt with EUR2.8
billion.
As we have mentioned in the past, the majority of these investments are in immunized
portfolios. Our cash position is up to EUR3 billion and includes a short-term investments
and temporary cash balances. Exposure to equity and mutual funds has gone up slightly
from stock market improvements. On the next is slide, we will look at our actively
managed investment portfolios.
Our portfolio yields are still quite high, almost 2% in Non-Life and over 3.7% in Life, well
above market yields. Nevertheless, the downward trend continues hurting our financial
income. We partially neutralize this effect by slightly increasing duration. Realized gains in
the Euro area reached EUR23 million during the quarter, almost 12 million less than the
previous year.
Stock sales were quite selective during this quarter as we expect the positive trends in
equity markets to continue. At the end of this quarter, the actively managed portfolios in
Iberia and MAPFRE RE had unrealized net gains for EUR37 million. Please turn to the next
slide, where we will begin a breakdown by business unit, starting with Iberia. Iberia is again
MAPFRE's greatest contributor to group results.
Premium performance has been excellent. Of the top five players in the Spanish Insurance
market, we had the highest rate of growth and we are once again leader in non-Life. In
Motor, premiums are up 2.6% with positive developments in Spain both in retail and in
fleets. Our average premium grew 0.2%, while the market fell by the same amount.

FINAL

General P&C growth was mostly driven by homeowners up 4.7% and condominiums up
8.1% helping to offset the fall in commercial lines. Sales campaigns in both bancassurance
and agent channels drove the Life business. It's also important to mention that we wrote a
large group policy in the first quarter for EUR45 million in the bancassurance channels.
Moving to results and combined ratio, motor maintained an excellent ratio in a very
competitive market environment.
The improved result in Portugal with a strong reduction in the combined ratio is also worth
highlighting. Profitability in health and accidents was affected by higher hospital costs. We
expect the combined ratio to level off throughout the year. We are currently implemented
measures in order to reduce hospital costs in the coming quarters.
Now let's take a look in now Brazil. The impact of the depreciation of the Brazilian real on
average exchange rates has negatively affected premiums and results. BB MAPFRE,
where we hold 25% of the share capital, comprises Life and Agro business in the Banco
do Brasil channel. There has been over 2% growth in local currency thanks to higher
insurance especially in the Life protection segment with over 30% growth in local currency.

Bloomberg Transcript

These positive movements in life were offset by weak issuance in Agro insurance due to
seasonality. In MAPFRE Seguros, where we hold 100%, there was a fall in premiums as a
result of selective underwriting measures implemented in both motor and general P&C
including tariff increases. The attributable result of MAPFRE Seguros went up almost
EUR18 million driven by motor business. The increase help offset the 21% fall at BB
MAPFRE due to weather-related events affecting Agro insurance.
The motor combined ratio showed an outstanding drop of almost 10 points standing at
104.4%, thanks to several claims management measures. Regarding financial income, we
took advantage of the market context to opportunistically harvest gains during the
quarter. Regarding the ROE, please keep in mind that current figures are not
representative. ROE figures are calculated with the last four quarters results.
And because of the restructuring of the Banco of Brasil agreement, neither the equity
base nor the results have been homogenous in the last year. Now, LATAM North is
benefiting from tailwinds from currency movements across the region. Mexico has a
strong premium growth in local currency up 11%, driven by motor especially in the
dealership channel as well as strong performance in the retail health and Life segments.
Motor combined ratio went down almost 4 percentage points to 95.4%, thanks both to
tariff and risk selection measures.
The Dominican Republic is so strong local currency growth in premiums up 14% and
resilient combined ratio under 93%. Regarding Central America, Panama experienced an
increase in the low ratio in motor, general P&C and health. Technical measures have been
implemented in the motor and health segments including tariff increases in health to
correct claims experience. Honduras continues to have excellent and recurring results with
an outstanding combined ratio below 83% at the close of the quarter.

FINAL

Now, Latam South; on this slide, we have the key information about this region. With the
exception of the Argentine peso, there were overall strong local currency trends across
the region and tailwinds from currencies. In Peru, premiums were up 1% in local currency
and it had strong technical performance reducing the combined ratio by 7 percentage
points and increasing their ROE by 1.4 percentage points. Columbia had local currency
growth of 6% supported by a large corporate policy.
There was a strong reduction in the combined ratio offset by negative adjustments in the
Annuities run-off portfolios, as a result basically of updating local -- sorry, long-term
financial assumptions, mainly the minimum wage. Chile saw local currency growth of 19%
including the effect of a large corporate policy. There was improvements in the combined
ratio in motor offset by an uptick in general P&C Argentina saw a decline in premiums
driven by the fall in average exchange rates minus 50 approximately. There was also an
increase in the combined ratio in industrial risk and motor.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's move to North America. The appreciation of average dollar exchange rates up 8.5%
has a positively impacted premiums and results. Premiums are down almost 10% in local
currency in North America, as a result of the exit from five states in 2018, and also
underwriting measures applied in the non-Northeast states. The over 17 million
improvement in the attributable result and lower combined ratio explained by first of all
improvements in personal motor, thanks to tariff increases, cancellation of
underperforming business, and also the exit already commented from five states.
And also lower weather-related losses helped improve the homeowners result and
combined ratio. In Eurasia, there was a positive premium and combined ratio
development in Germany with a higher attributable result. The situation in Turkey, on the
other hand, is very complicated. There was a strong depreciation of the Turkish lira, 22%.
Premium growth in local currency was up 13%, but below inflation. We continue applying
the strictest underwriting guidelines in Motor to protect our performance. The attributable
result is currently negative and the combined ratio has deteriorated, driven by the impact
of the MTPL tariff regulation, higher parts prices, and other inflationary effects and
currency depreciation. MAPFRE's strategy remains quite conservative, as we prefer to stay
away from cash flow underwriting and want to focus on underwriting discipline rather than
issuing premiums just to get a return on high yield investments, a practice by the way that
we see in some local peers.
Italy experienced a strong premium performance driven by the dealership channel and
strong improvement in the combined ratio than 3 percentage points. As we disclosed in
our financial report, we started the transformation of our Italian business in to a verti spain
branch under European Union regulation. This transformation will allow us to improve our
KPIs and also to optimize capital allocation. The combined ratio increased in Malta as a
result of weather conditions in February.
Let's move to MAPFRE RE Regarding MAPFRE RE, in March 2019, administrative
authorization was received to carry out the corporate restructuring of MAPFRE global risks,
so it's reinsurance activity, along with the related assets and liabilities were transferred to

FINAL

MAPFRE RE Accounting effects were booked retroactively as of January 1, 2018. Premiums
have benefited from currency movements, especially the US dollar as well as the
contribution from the new subsidiary operating in Vermont. The combined ratio was
affected by a large industrial claim during the quarter, which had an approximately EUR20
million pre-tax impact of which EUR12 million correspond to global risks. Realized gains
were down as disclosed on the slide.
Now our CRO, Ramon Carrasco is going to discuss the solvency II figures.

Ramon Carrasco

{BIO 1748033 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Solvency II figures as at 31st of December 2018 confirm MAPFRE's
strong solvency position. The 189.5% solvency II ratio is based on a high-quality capital
structure of EUR8.8 billion in eligible own funds of which 87% is unrestricted Tier 1 capital,
and the remaining 13% is subordinated debt.

Bloomberg Transcript

The increase in September's solvency II ratio was temporary, as it included the
subordinated debt issued in August to finance the renewed agreement in Brazil, but not
the cash outflow. The difference with the solvency II position at December 2017 is mainly
explained by the higher risks considered for the equivalent countries. The greater
participation in Brazil and the inclusion of catastrophic risks in the regulation of US caused
an increase of the regulatory capital in these countries. The improvement in the IFRS
equity during 2019 will imply roughly a 5 percent point uplift in the solvency II ratio.
On the following slide, you can see our sensitivity analysis. As you can see the impact on
the solvency position from the various events is limited. Sensitivities are very much in line
with last year's except equity, where we have refined the methodology. The greatest
impact occurs when an increase of 50 basis points is considered in the corporate and in
all government bond spreads, in which case the ratio will stand at 179.2%.
The rest of the information regarding Solvency II figures can be found in our financial
report. That's all from my side. I look forward to your questions during the Q&A and I will
now pass the floor back over to Fernando. Thank you.

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Ramon, and I would like to finish with a few closing remarks. It was the first
quarter of the new three-year strategic plan. We are very satisfied with these results, fruit
of the transformation and the changes that are being implemented. In Iberia, premiums
and profitability trends continue to be excellent despite a very competitive market
environment.
Results have been resilient at the MAPFRE RE and they continue to be an important profit
contributor. In Brazil and North America, we've seen a clear turnaround in results thanks to
the measures implemented and we expect this momentum to continue throughout the
year. The strong underwriting performance across all of Latin America is remarkable with
stable combined ratios at 96% and even below in all three regions. Regarding Turkey and

FINAL

Colombia, we are carefully monitoring results, but the impact of the Group performance
is limited due to their size.
Finally, we continue to have an exceptional solvency and leverage position, and we expect
ratios to convert to targets throughout the year. We hope, the new layout and of the
presentation with greater detail by country and business unit gives you a clearer
representation of the Group positions and also operations. And now, I will hand the call
back to Natalia to begin the Q&A session. (Question And Answer)

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay.
Thank you, Fernando. We can start with the Q&A First question is regarding balance sheet
and investment portfolio. It comes Ivan Bokhmat from Barclays. 1Q, 2019 realized gains
came below the full year '18 average.
I recall you have mentioned gain should remain stable in the next three-year period. Could
that suggests potentially higher gains in the rest of the year consistent with EUR145
million, EUR 170 million level booked in 2017, 2018?

Bloomberg Transcript

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Ivan. As we said capital gains -- realized capital gains has been quite stable for
the last, I would say two, three years. This first quarter is the bullish moment we expected.
Remember last quarter, last year was horrible and with significant drop in the value of
stocks and this first quarter was superb, and we apply; I mean the trend is your friend, and
so we were quite selective selling some equities in order to produce some capital gains,
but you're right, probably and we want to keep the same level of capital gains. So
probably, we should increase the pace of capital gains, realized capital gains during the
second quarter. We're quite -- we're more optimistic. The outlook is much better and also
as well it will help us, I mean real estate capital gains, in order to achieve the same level.
Currently, we have some units on the market. We haven't done any transaction during the
first quarter, but the units are there and regarding the rotation of real estate units, we will
keep on doing the same in last year and we expect some realized gains to come up in
the remaining quarters.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. The next one is also from Ivan Bokhmat and it's regarding the leverage
level of 24%, appears slightly above the 22nd level you flagged as comfortable during the
Investor Day.

FINAL

That's correct. Let's say that it was almost 1.5 increase in our leverage and basically the
main driver for this increase, is the BMN Bancassurance acquisition, but also it was some
temporary funding of subsidiaries due to the different cash flow of dividends and -- but
what we expect therefore the year end is to have an increase in leverage similar or
equivalent to the consideration the amount paid for acquisitions. Basically this is our policy
and we will stick to this policy.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much.
Now, we are going to talk about MAPFRE RE The block of questions is the regarding the
reassurance and global risks businesses. Ivan Bokhmat also at Barclays has sent us the
following question. MAPFRE RE result was strong despite large industrial claim from global
risk business with good premium growth and better combined ratio. Reinsurance rate
seems to be hardening across regions particularly in property business.
Are you more optimistic now than in March?

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, thank you. Ivan, again. As we said during the Investor Day, what we have seen is so
far is some strengthening the market, especially in those territories affected by large
losses in last years, but we've seen prices picking up at least a bit. We should see medium
sized price increases in these affected areas.
In the rest, a stable outcome should be expected. Our main renewals period is January,
but there is another renewal as well in June -- April and June, and so far and nothing has
happened to make us change our opinion. So far, everything is going well.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay.
Thank you very much. There's another question regarding MAPFRE RE that comes from
Michael Huttner in JP Morgan. Why is MAPFRE RE down so much, when they combined
ratio is just up 1%. And why are premiums down 10%, but allocated capital up.

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Michael. The fall in the result in the reinsurance business is due to lower
earned premiums in non-Life, which are still reflecting somehow last year's fall in written
premiums, as well as the EUR10 million less in realized gains. As I previously mentioned,
we should retake the pace of realizing gains particularly for MAPFRE RE during the second
quarter. Written premiums are growing over 10% this year and shareholders' equity is up
to 7%.

Page 8 of 17



Company N ame: M apfre SA

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

FINAL

So, the premiums were up -- sorry, that -- yeah, the premiums were up 10%.

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

10%.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

No down.

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah, the premiums are growing over 10%, yeah, sorry.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Now we have questions regarding Iberia. Ivan Bokhmat at Barclays has asked results
in Iberia remain very strong, particularly on the P&C technical result side with combined
ratio in the lower end of the 92%, 94% range.
Do you consider it sustainable? Is there any reason for us to think this trend should change
over the coming 6 to 12 months.

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you Ivan again. Yeah, we're growing in premiums over the market in both life
and non-life segments with excellent combined ratio, best in class in motor at 90.6% and
maintaining an over 5 percentage gap compared to the market.
As we mentioned in past results presentations and also our Investors Day, we considered
more sustainable a combined ratio for Motor of around 92%. Anyway, we are quite happy
with the current combined ratio that stands at 90.6%. Regarding growth, economic activity
in Spain should continue to stimulate the premium growth in the insurance business
especially non-life and also our excellent profitability level will allow us to select market
share segments that we consider most interesting. That's where we are currently doing
particularly with fleets, and we are selecting those low combined ratio expected fleets
and so far they're quite profitable.
Regarding competition in Spain, let's say that the Motor segment is still very competitive.
As you probably know, a couple of peers already published the results showing
deterioration of combined ratio in both cases; that's the same for MAPFRE, but to a lesser
extent, in our case just 30 percentage points. Competition is fierce and they're

advertising on TV, practically every hour with lower prices and also free periods of time for
coverage if you change your carrier, but we're keeping the same underwriting discipline.
One of the examples is that the our average motor premium is growing 20 percentage
points while the market is dropping the same amount 20 percentage points.
So overall, let's say that the competition is still there in the market, but MAPFRE is quite
strong. Our underwriting discipline is extremely stable and we expect to keep the same
trend in business, in profit contribution for the remaining quarters.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much for Fernando. There is another question coming from Carlos Peixoto
at Caixabank.
And this question is regarding the increase in hospitalization costs witnessed this quarter
in Iberia. Do you see that sustainable?

Bloomberg Transcript

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well, what we have seen in the past is that the hospital costs were quite low and it was
expected sort of an increase like the one we're seeing, but our management is taking the
measures we need in order to reduce this impact in our combined ratio in health,
particularly trying to reduce the impact from the hospital costs. Obviously, you see that
the combined ratio for this quarter is pretty high, quite similar as well to last year, and
there are seasonality reasons behind this level, and we expect the combined ratio to
reduce in the coming quarters.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay, thank you.
Another question, in Iberia. Is Caja Granda Vida and Caja Murcia's contribution this quarter
including their activity for the whole three months or have they been incorporated into
your accounts at a later moment?

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes, thank you, Carlos. There is a full disclosure of this transaction in the financial report.
Let me summarize In terms of premium contribution, the contribution was quite small, like
4 million, more or less, in terms of Life premiums.
Regarding assets, there was an increase of almost 330 million approximately, and
regarding our net equity -- let's say the other way, and regarding our goodwill, our
intangibles, it was up 55 million increase in intangibles due to the consolidation of these
acquisitions in March.

FINAL

Okay, good, thank you. Now we can move to Brazil. Ivan asks that in Brazil minority
deductions remained at a high level, with a larger share of the profits still going to your
partner, despite last year's transaction and better performance in the non-Life business.
When do you expect a more pronounced improvement of the result attributable to
MAPFRE?

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Ivan, thank you. There's going to be high deductions, even for the next years in
terms of non-controlling interests, because of the percentage held by Banco do Brasil is
pretty high in BB MAPFRE is 75%. So, let's say that three quarters of the net result goes to
Banco do Brasil.

Bloomberg Transcript

Anyway, there is a relevant increase in the MAPFRE SEGUROS profit contribution during
this quarter, particularly in the business acquired MAPFRE VIDA is reporting a wonderful
results and also MAPFRE Vehicles, which is the entity that we bought from Banco do Brasil,
and now is together with MAPFRE SEGUROS GERAIS, is improving results compared to
last year. So, overall, we're quite happy with the results. The share of minority will remain
pretty high in the future because of the 75 shareholding of Banco do Brasil. And also,
we're happy with the current outlook in Brazil.
We're optimistic regarding the future. It's a country, which we know very well, and we're
convinced that the reform process that Bolsonara is pushing for will be very positive for
the economy and also the future of Brazil. If they stopped in the reforms, my guess is that
we will have again volatility in macro metrics.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay, good.
Also Andrew Sinclair, would like to know about the Brazilian combined ratio that jumped to
meet the 2021 targets already. Is it sustainable? Are there any one-offs in here we should
be aware of ?

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Andrew. It's just the first quarter and there is still three years ahead in order to
transform and convert MAPFRE Brazil operations into quite profitable business. Obviously
there is a big reduction in combined ratio.
We believe that we are doing things in the proper way, but just one quarter is too early to
reach a final conclusion regarding the pace of reduction in the future. We are pretty sure
that the we will see a consistent reduction in combined ratio year-by-year in order to
meet the targets that the we published at the Investor Day. Regarding one-off

FINAL

adjustments, let's say that this quarter is standard quarter in terms of premiums earned
and losses, and there is no extraordinary items that could affect the combined ratio. The
only thing -- but it's not affecting the combined ratio -- is financial income that is coming
from realized gains on fixed income.
It's not a big amount -- it has been disclosed in our financial report combining both Banco
do Brasil subsidiary and also MAPFRE SEGUROS, the net profit contribution is like 3 million.
And we realized these capital gains in quite a good economic context, and also being
opportunistically in order to cash some money in to pay the dividends that we mentioned
of 55 million, and cash in according to the current Brazilian real currency exchange, which
is very positive.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay, great, thank you. Also there is question regarding Brazil non-Life premiums that
have been reduced.
How far should we expect Brazil non-Life premiums to reduce after a significant cut in Q1?

Bloomberg Transcript

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah, at the Investor Day, we set growth targets for the traditional insurance business -7% in motor, and 4% in multi risk. Let me see, I'm reviewing the numbers for the threeyear period. Of course, it's natural in the short term to see a reduction, due to the
measure implemented to improve profitability. As we mentioned at the Investor Day,
we're applying a significant reduction in some agent accounts, where there are lossmaking portfolios and also increases of tariffs across the board.
Obviously, these increases, they are causing a reduction in the number of policy holders.
We expect this trend to turn around in the next quarter or perhaps in the third quarter.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. Carlos Peixoto of Caixabank BPI asks the Brazilian auto combined ratio
stands currently below the 105% target for the year.
How much of this improvement was related to external factors, seasonality or weather,
and how much was the result of the measures you have implemented. Should we expect
a potential upgrade in the combined ratio guidance for the unit?

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah, thank you, Carlos. I will answer first your last question. We shouldn't expect a
potential upgrade in the combined ratio after just one week -- one quarter sorry.

FINAL

Let's say that what we published that we set targets for a three year period, and we are
still at the first quarter and we believe that those targets are still valid. Regarding
combined ratio increases -- sorry, the combined ratio improvement, last year a lot of new
measures were implemented in order to improve our claims management process and
this year 2019, most of the measures implemented will be focused on underwriting and
particularly tariffs. So, let's say that we should expect better a performance once the
measures regarding underwriting will be fully implemented throughout this year.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Great, thank you very much.
Now we can move to Eurasia, Ivan Bokhmat at Barclays is asking, what is your outlook for
the Turkey business at the current moment? Should we expect continued losses in 2019,
considering weak currency and macro outlook?

Bloomberg Transcript

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah, thank you, Ivan; great. Well, as I explained at the presentation, the current market
context in Turkey is quite complicated and we are carefully monitoring the business, but
Turkey, we have to put Turkey in the group context, is a medium-sized entity and it
shouldn't represent a large share of the group results nor equity, but we are
implementing a defensive business model in Turkey. Growth is low; premium growth is
low in local currency; and as we made our current motor portfolio more defensive,
lowering our units in motor MTPL in response to the 2017 tariff regulation. I can give you
some figures.
MTPL has fallen to 5.6% from over 11% at the beginning of 2017. And also what we're
doing is adapting our cost structure to the new business volumes. What we're facing is a
sort of claim cost pressure as a result of a higher inflation. As you know, over 75% of the
spare parts are imported and nominated in Euros.
We're keeping part of our financial asset as well nominated in Euros in order to hedge this
situation, but inflation is affecting our results by over 25% of a the minimum wage
increase. MAPFRE has a lot of experience, so I can give you some comfort, and proven
track record in emerging and inflationary economies. We know the importance of cash
flow in these economies; and despite the short-term volatility, we're pretty confidence in
the long-term outlook of our business in Turkey. Turkey is a strategic market, and will
remain as that for the coming years, and that's all.
I mean Turkey's difficult; it's complicated, but we know what to do.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay, thank you very much Fernando. I think that comprehensive answer covers also the
one coming from Farquhar Murray at Autonomous that was also regarding the Turkey
market. Now we can move to Latam South.

We have also received some questions regarding Colombia. Farquhar Murray from
Autonomous asks, please could you quantify the negative adjustments in Life Annuity in
Latam South from the long-term assumptions update?

FINAL

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Farquhar. We have not disclosed the exact figure, but in Colombia the
majority of losses are in run off annuity portfolios.
Those are portfolios that we stopped renewals in 2014 and 2015, if I remember well. And
as you can see, non-life performance has been quite good with a 4% reduction in the
combined ratio. We are doing a lot of things in order to have a sort of a protection in our
Life portfolio and a lot of measures are being taken to reduce the impact of these runoff
portfolios. We have filed with the supervisory body an authorization in order to change our
asset investment structure.

Bloomberg Transcript

The majority of the assets are to maturity, classified as a financial investment held-tomaturity and the situation is against our proper ALM policy. So, part of the assets will be
classified probably in March as assets available for sale with some capital gains, we
expect, and also an increase in yields from new bonds. And also we're going to mix our
structure reducing sovies and having corporate bonds in order to increase return from
investment. There is also other measures, as you know.
We got rid of some Annuity in Latin America; they are non-strategic business. And if
market opportunities arise, we could contemplate potential sales of this portfolio as well. I
hopefully, will give you more color at the second quarter presentation, when this change
in the classification of assets will be completed, and also the yield that we're getting for
the new portfolio, and also a better estimation of insurance liabilities.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay, thank you very much.
Now, we have almost the last set of questions, and they are taking different issues, and
the first one is regarding Solvency. What is Solvency after the two bancassurance deals? I
think that Ramon Carrasco could help us with this one.

Ramon Carrasco

{BIO 1748033 <GO>}

Thank you, Natalia. It's always difficult to have this impact.
If we consider only the cash outflow on the percentage, it could be two percent below
what is currently, the height of 189.5%, but of course, we obviously need to consider
future generation of own funds, and the capital requirement, and that will include the
business. It's very difficult to take this into account nowadays.

FINAL

Thank you, Ramon. There is also another question I would like to take because we've
been asked during this morning about this and I would like to take this opportunity to
clarify regarding the evolution of claims and financial income in the Life Insurance business
in Spain and Eurasia.
Afterwards Fernando could give us more color about what we can expect going forward,
but I would like to tell you that to follow the evolution of the Life business and mainly
saving businesses, you have to take into account together the movements in claims,
provisions and financial income. So, the line you have to follow to track and to better
understand the movements in Life is the total result of Life business. We have not
changed the portfolio. It continues to be basically the same kind of products.
During the last three quarters, we have seen kind of a stability in the results coming from
Life in Iberia and also in Eurasia. In Eurasia, the portfolio comes from Malta. And this
portfolio, the assets reflects movement against the P&L account, but basically the
policyholders bear the main liabilities from this portfolio. So, I would like to give this idea
that the Life business has to be tracked through the line coming from results from Life
business together with claims and financial income, because otherwise there is a lot of
volatility, there are a lot of movements that counterbalance one with the other.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, I hope this clarifies or any way we can answer more specific questions afterwards.

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah, thank you, Carlos. Regarding moving forward -- going forward. Apart from what
Natalia mentioned, there were a couple of, let's say, non-recurring events in Life, in
particularly in Iberia.
First is due to campaigns. There were a lot of new production in savings, particularly in
Bankinter Portugal as well. And also there was a large policy that was written in the first
quarter that was booked in Bankia Vida that fueled premium growth during the first
quarter. Going forward, we shouldn't expect a similar premium growth in the second
quarter.
It was something extraordinary during the first quarter and the premium growth should be
lower than the pace that we reported.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, thank you very much. Next question, I guess, this is the last one .
Okay. The next question is regarding investment. It comes from Michael Huttner at
JPMorgan, and the question is why is the result down despite combined ratio better?
Investment income in non-Life is down from EUR178 million to EUR148 million. Why is it
down so much? How long will this decline continue?

FINAL

Yeah, thank you, Michael.
We're not worried, but we are working on the fixed income portfolio in order to keep it
stable or to reduce the downward trend of accounting yield. In the financial report, there
is a chart showing the evolution of the accounting yield. If you look at the numbers, it's like
a 41, if I remember well, a 41 percentage point decrease in yield, for non-Life, non-Life
comprises both Iberia and MAPFRE RE The base for the financial income in non-Life is
approximately 7 billion; so if you multiply, it's approximately the 30 million difference for
this year compared to last year. The base is quite similar.
There is a slight reduction because part of the maturities -- we set aside some money for
alternative investments, but in terms of accounting yields, you're right, there's a decrease.
Regarding the future base, it's extremely difficult. We're taking opportunities according to
the changes in the yield curve and for instance last quarter -- this quarter-- we increased
the duration in order to have a better moment in order to increase positions in more
profitable bonds, but the future pace is difficult to foresee, but we're looking at this
situation and monitoring the current deal here from bonds.

Natalia Nunez

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay.
Thank you, thank you very much. There is another one regarding the effective tax rate in
first quarter 2019. The effective tax rate was close to 30%. How close to normalized is that
number? Were there any one-offs or we should assume a similar level in the rest of the
year? This question comes from Ivan Bokhmat at Barclays.

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah, thank you, Ivan. In terms of tax deduction, the quarter was a standard quarter and
we should assume that the current level of 30% for corporate tax, the effective tax rate is
the standard and should be similar in coming quarters. Regarding the nominal tax rate for
different regions, by far the largest is in Brazil with 45%, and as long as profits are
increasing in Brazil, obviously the tax rate should grow as well, but since the business in
Spain is growing as well. And the tax rate in Spain is 25%, we should offset this increase in
Brazil by a reduction in Spain.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. And perhaps to follow up on the question coming from Michael Huttner. Michael is
asking about when will investment income stabilize, because it has fell a lot in the 1Q,
2019. Fernando has answered about this decrease in the first quarter, but going to more
specific numbers, we can give you some hints because there are lower realized gains.

FINAL

Yeah, that's correct. I forget this situation. There's lower realized gains approximately
EUR30 million less that's before taxes, mainly in MAPFRE RE We should retake the pace of
realizing gains, capital gains, in the second quarter. And the other reason for the decline is
basically the recurrent financial income, but they're coming from bonds and basically the
decline is, as I mentioned, is the decline of yields.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay, so thank you very much. There are no more questions. Thank you very much,
everyone.

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you everyone for joining us today.
It has been a quite good start for the year, and we expect this trend to continue in the
coming quarters. For those of you in Spain, enjoy the long weekend, five days off. And for
everyone else, have a good week. Thank you again and bye-bye.
