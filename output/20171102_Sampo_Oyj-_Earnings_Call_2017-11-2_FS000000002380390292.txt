MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this conference call on Sampo's Third Quarter 2017
Results. I'm Jarmo Salonen, Head of Investor Relations at Sampo. And with me here at this
studio, I have our Group CEO and President; Kari Stadigh; Group CFO, Peter Johansson;
and Deputy Head of P&C Business, Ricard Wennerklint.
We'll have the same procedures as normally. Kari will start with the summary of Q3
developments. And then we'll take your questions. Before handing over to Kari, let me
remind you that you can follow this call on our website sampo.com/results, and a
recorded version of the call will later be available at the same address.
With these words, I'll hand over to Kari. Kari, please.

FINAL

Thank you, Jarmo. Welcome to the conference call on my behalf as well. It's really
pleasing to report a strong third quarter where the insurance results compensated well for
(01:02) in the Nordea results. Proﬁt before taxes was up 6% to €475 million, not taking into
account the positive one-oﬀ from the consolidation out of Denmark.
If P&C reported the best ever nine months combined ratio of 85.9%, this without the
positive one-oﬀs in earlier years. Based on this strong development, we have also
announced the lowest ever guidance for the combined ratio, 85% to 87% for the full year.
The underlying trends are also very strong. In the retail segment, the number of
customers is growing in all markets as are the customer satisfaction KPIs. Given the strong
numbers and the underlying trends, we have decided to distribute an all-time high
internal dividend of SEK 6 billion in December from If P&C to Sampo plc.

Bloomberg Transcript

It is also worth noting that our reserve strength has in general stayed at the same level or
slightly improved. At the same time, as the eﬃciency measured in cost ratio continues to
improve as planned. Our new subsidiary, Topdanmark also announced the best ever
combined ratio for the ﬁrst nine months at 81.9%. It is also worth noting the size of Top's
life operations has their gross written premiums were highest ever at €850 million and the
unit-linked volume exceeded that on Mandatum Life. Topdanmark also announced that
they are looking for a new CEO.
Nordea's third quarter numbers were soft. However, the value creation path is very
interesting. In the foreseeable future, Nordea's digital retail oﬀering will be able to
diﬀerentiate itself from an otherwise at present very homogeneous setup. This will also
pave the way for the low 40s cost to income ratio as Nordea has communicated earlier.
On the corporate side, the bench strength is key. And given the composition of their
Nordic teams, the bank will continue to be the preferred choice in the Nordic corporate
sector.
Wealth management is not growing at the same pace as it used to, but given its size the
numbers are still impressive and the value creation model is intact. All in all, a very strong
capital generation forming a basis for a gradual increase in dividend for Nordea as well.
Mandatum saw its gross written premiums exceed the volume of the corresponding
quarter last year and it's paid an extra dividend of €150 million in September to Sampo
P&C.
In my opening remarks, I wanted to mention the internal dividend streams as this gives
more clarity to the fact that we remained a dividend stock with gradually increasing
dividends to our shareholders also in the future.

Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Thank you, Kari. And ladies and gentlemen, we are now ready for the questions, please.

Yes. And we'll take our ﬁrst question from Matti Ahokas with Danske Bank.

FINAL

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. Two questions please. Firstly, regarding the internal dividends,
which I think was very useful that you provided the information, also regarding If. But,
obviously, we will not know the dividend proposal of Nordea yet, but should we expect
that you will pass that through to Sampo shareholders in its entirety or not?
And the other question is regarding the premium growth in If, obviously, Sweden has
been the main driver, but could you maybe elaborate a bit on was it the private or
industrial segment or which part of the Swedish business you saw most growth during the
ﬁrst nine months? Thanks.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Thank you, Matti. I'll take the ﬁrst one. Whether we pass through dividends or not from
our subsidiaries or associates, it is not really relevant because what we strive for is
gradually increasing dividend for our shareholders. So, I more use these examples to
demonstrate that we have ample resources to continue to gradually increase our own
dividend.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

As to the growth in Sweden, it was actually in all three business areas. Maybe I can
highlight that it was primarily new and more customers rather than changes in prices or
increased prices, but it was all business areas.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Just if I may have a follow-up also. Could you give us the same information regarding
Norway? How was that split?

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

In Norway, there is growth in private and to some extent in commercial. The industrial part
is such a small piece of the Norwegian business. But I actually don't recall what the
development was on a year-on-year basis.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great. Thanks a lot.

And we'll take our next question from Paul De'Ath with RBC.

Q - Paul De'Ath

FINAL

Yeah. Hi, there. And couple of questions, please. And going back to the internal
dividends points and ﬁrstly just on the life dividend, so the extra €150 million that's been
paid up in September. And I guess, can you give us any indication of how to think about
this going forward? Is this is a complete one-oﬀ? Is this something you would expect to
do on a semi-regular basis? And presumably, as the capital rolls (08:01) oﬀ the life
business, but just kind of to get an idea of what to expect going forward would be good?
And then secondly and also on dividends please, on the If P&C dividend, as you say this is
the another record level. Should we pencil in this as the new kind of payout ratio for If
going forward or how should we think about it? Is there any kind of one-oﬀ within the
number? Thanks.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I think that the Mandatum dividend was a one-oﬀ, and we have a history of distributing
the dividend in the spring. Of course, the only remaining question is, when Danske pays
the €340 million for the portfolio in 2018, would that then require an additional one-oﬀ,
but I think it's too early to speculate on that. But this as such was a one-oﬀ and then we go
back to ordinary dividends in the spring.
On If P&C, I would say that given the strength of the result, this is a conservative level of
dividend and there is no reason why you should read anything one-oﬀ in this.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Paul De'Ath
Okay, great.

Operator
We'll take our next question from Steven Haywood with HSBC.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everyone. On your recent investments, I see Denmark is obviously a key
market for you now, and you invested in Saxo and in Nets. Can you give a bit more
information about why Denmark is quite interesting to you, and why Saxo and Nets are
interesting propositions? What do these oﬀer in terms of future growth dividends and
opportunities for Sampo?
And then, just on the P&C side, on the corporate business, now that Topdanmark has lost
all of its corporate clients, has this then pick up any of Topdanmark's corporate clients
over the last few years? Thank you.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I think that it's a coincidence that the two signiﬁcant investments that we did in the third
quarter were in Denmark. We normally describe ourselves for our international
shareholders as a proxy for the Nordic ﬁnancial market. I suppose that given our ﬁnancial
Page 4 of 16

FINAL

strength and that we are known to be quick and no hassle decision makers, all deals are
shown to us. For many years, we haven't done really that much because there has been so
much uncertainty in the regulatory framework, which has aﬀected our risk appetite and
also has aﬀected the valuation of the targets. These two came simultaneously more as a
coincidence. Of course, all Nordic capitals have signiﬁcant know-how basis in the ﬁnancial
sector, and Copenhagen has especially a very signiﬁcant talent pool. So, it's natural that
there are good investment opportunities.
Nets is an industry that we know really well. And there, we are a passive investor together
with the private equity fund; the private equity fund is in the lead. We expect that to return
a return which is in line with what private equity industry in general returns to their
shareholders. So, it's around 20% IRR, which is the target of the private equity industry in
general. I don't want to mention about this case speciﬁcally.

Bloomberg Transcript

Saxo is a little bit diﬀerent, because Saxo is one of the few ﬁn-tech unicorns in the Nordic
sector that have a global reach. And we were impressed by the trading platform and the
technology behind that. We were impressed by the quality of the software and of course
the people. We see that there is a very strong trend supporting our investment in Saxo,
because it's clear that it's not worthwhile for many ﬁnancial institutions to develop or own
proprietary software for trading. And we see that the company has a signiﬁcant possibility
to do much more white labeling.
So, as an owner, we want to support them to improve their global reach and become
clearly a software based ﬁn-tech company, it's an excellent platform for that. As such, I
think that Saxo is going to develop well in the coming years. And we have based our
investment case on that. Our return on equity target for these type of investments is
above 17.5%. And our base case is, is well above that. There is also, of course, small
optionality in Saxo, and that is something that comes with a new main owner, Geely.
Geely bought, as you are all aware of, 51.5% of the company and we are honored to
participate in this endeavor with Geely.
There is a great potential for the trading platform in Asia, and we are really curious to see
how Geely can support Saxo in their Asian operations. We haven't calculated this into our
investment case. So, the Chinese market or things like that that would be an extra plus.
But ﬁn-tech wise, we are impressed by what they do and we are a happy owner, once the
deal closes.

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

On the Denmark question. They're active in the retail segment on a small and medium
commercial, not really in large corporate. So, they have not really aﬀected large corporate
market in Denmark. And Jarmo gave me the number for industrial Norway; we've actually
had a small growth also for our industrial business or large corporate business in Norway.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks very much. I appreciate the in-depth comments on Saxo and Nets as well.
Thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Vinit Malhotra with Mediobanca.

FINAL

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. Just one thing remaining for me, sorry. On the bond side, I've
seen – I mean there is a U.S. ﬁxed income impairment. And given that Sampo is usually
not in these high-risk zones, could you just comment a bit about whether it's a concern,
whether it's something that is completely one-oﬀ or probably comment a bit about that?
Thank you.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yeah. We have a one-oﬀ write-oﬀ in the ﬁxed income portfolio in If, roughly SEK 400
million. And it's from the oil and oﬀshore industry. Our high yield portfolio has had a very
good yield in 2016 and 2017. So, this is an old historic case which we wrote oﬀ now. No
change in the risk proﬁle of the ﬁxed income portfolio in If as such.

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

And mark-to-market that's all the time being on the negative side in the AFS portfolio. So,
mark-to-market, it didn't change much.

And we'll take our next question from Blair Stewart with Merrill Lynch.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Good afternoon. I have a couple of questions. Firstly, I know you don't really like talking
about underlying combined ratios, but here we go anyway. If you strip out the reserve
releases completely and also adjust for the large losses, I think there was a 1.5percentage-point improvement for the nine months versus the nine months last year. I just
wonder, is there something structural there? Is it perhaps just an element of good luck
with low frequency, or I wonder if you could just comment on that aspect?
Secondly, I'd be interested in your view as a signiﬁcant owner in Nordea. What your own
thoughts were on the somewhat disappointing Q3 and the outlook for you as an owner?
And ﬁnally, if I can, just wondered on your updated thinking on that leverage capacity at
Sampo. Thank you.

FINAL

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Okay. Let's start with the combined ratio. No, I haven't changed. Underlying, it's a diﬃcult
subject. 1.5% (sic) [1.5-percentage-point] (18:08) improvement sounds a bit on the high
side to me. If I compare nine month to nine month, we have seen very good weather this
year, no real events. We have seen positive development in smaller claims, frequency
claims. So, far enough, that is an improvement this year compared to last year. We see
better business momentum. We see higher growth now compared to last year. So, yeah,
there is an improvement. I wouldn't put it at 1.5-percentage-point; that sounds high to me.
Yeah.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

So those elements have good luck in there with regards to frequency, I guess, would be
the answer (18:50).

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Also good luck is a diﬃcult concept. But that is fair enough. Let's call it good luck.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Okay. On Nordea, I think that the main thing for me was that the communication was
unclear. I think that somehow Nordea succeeded in confusing two things in their
communication. The ﬁrst thing was that earlier Nordea had communicated that their costs
in 2018 are going to be on the same level as 2016. And then when they came out with
their new restructuring program, I think some people in the market interpreted that they
are not delivering on the ﬁrst promise, so now they have some kind of smokescreen here
in front of us.
From an owner's perspective, I think that we are quite ﬁrm that we want them to deliver
on their ﬁrst promise deﬁnitely. So, we want to see that the underlying costs in 2018 are
on the same level as 2016. Then there is completely a diﬀerent issue, which is what they
are going to do long-term when the investments are bearing fruits and they are able to
change their oﬀering to a more digital oﬀering, when they are able to decrease the sizes
of their branches or change the composition within their branches. And then they say that
we are going to decrease 6,000 persons, out of which 2,000 are consultants. And we are
going to bring the 2021 costs to the same level. It's, once again, the same number €4.8
billion.
And I think that from an owner's perspective, we are now investing €1 billion in a very
scalable business where a huge bank is transforming to a much more digital oﬀering. So,
of course, we want to see a payback on this investment. And one form of the payback is
that the structure of the employees will change and the number of people involved will
change because so many things are going to get more automatized. And therefore, I

Page 7 of 16



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2017-11-02

FINAL

think that both programs should deliver. And we are, of course, as owners, fully
committed to transform the bank in such a way that these cost measures are met.
Then another thing, which I think that that is interesting that there is no Elon Musk in
Nordea, because no one wants really to lean forward and promise something they are not
able to deliver. If Elon Musk was running this bank, he would already have told how the
bank will deliver completely diﬀerent client experiences in 2021. But even if I'm not Elon
Musk, as an owner, I think it's clear that with this investment, Nordea will take a quantum
leap compared to the Nordic banking scene.
If you today visit a Nordic bank, the oﬀering is pretty much the same in all banks. If
Nordea makes this transformational change, it will be easier and more convenient and
more mobile to interact with Nordea than with other banks. And that's the goal what they
want to reach. And, of course, Kaspars has many times said that his ambition is to take the
cost income ratio in the private sector to the low 40s. So, all in all, if this is delivered then
as a rule of thumb I would say that the bank should make €1 billion more in proﬁt.

Q - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Great. Very interesting. Thank you, Kari. I guess the answer on debt leverage is that it
depends.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Debt leverage, I think that, yes, we have still room. Peter can, modeling wise, give
you an answer. I use a number which is between €1 billion to €2 billion if necessary.

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Yeah. I think that's a good ballpark, because we still have plenty of hybrid capacity
available in the group.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

But then of course, in order to do that, we have to ﬁnd something really attractive. And
you have been, Blair, following us such a long time that you don't always ﬁnd something.
So, we are patient hunters and disciplined.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

And we'll take our next question from Wajahat Rizvi with Deutsche Bank.

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everyone. Wajahat Rizvi from Deutsche Bank. Two questions for me
please. Firstly, some of your mutual peers in Sweden and Finland are oﬀering, we've seen,
Page 8 of 16



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2017-11-02

bundle products and going down the route of vertical integration like building their own
hospitals and things like that. On that basis, can you comment on the competitive
dynamics from this longer term?

FINAL

Secondly, the solvency ratio was a little shy of our expectations. I understand some of this
is from Topdanmark's consolidation. Can you please provide some color here please?
Thank you.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I think, the ﬁrst question, we could try together with Ricard to comment on it. I take a more
general view, and we are insurance and banking nerds. We know nothing about hospitals.
So, I'm not very keen on seeing this group expand into areas where we cannot be best-inclass. Our philosophy is to be involved in the Nordic ﬁnancial sector, where we have a
market leading position, where we can have clearly bigger scale beneﬁt than our
colleagues and where we can have higher retail content, plus a high degree of
automation and have a digital oﬀering. We are probably one of the biggest buyers of
these services. So, I think that it's going to be very interesting to be in procuring these
services in the future. And I think that that will maximize the shareholder value for our
shareholders. But please, Ricard.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Ricard Wennerklint
Maybe to add to that, we have had mutual or semi-mutual competitors in all of our
markets for as long as we've been around. And I think with the market as they develop
with more digitization, more automatization, more regulatory demands that's actually to
our advantage as a large non-mutual. So, I don't really see the competitive theme
changing. And when it comes to competitors or to customer demands, I don't see
mutuals being in a better place than what we are.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

On your solvency question, I don't know which company you referred to, but Mandatum
basically even if we took the €150 million out from Mandatum, it still has roughly twice the
regulatory capital, so signiﬁcant buﬀers. If we made the dividend decision of SEK 6 billion,
so that has already been deducted from the solvency numbers. And on group level, when
we consolidate Topdanmark, we take it with the standard formula. And that, in practice,
means in the conglomerate model that there is a small drop in the solvency ratio.

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

Sure. Thank you. Also, just on Top, if you don't mind me for follow-up. So, they do have
approved partial internal model, are you not allowed to include that in your numbers on
internal model?

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

For the time being, when we calculate the group solvency, we have to use the standard
model both from If, even If has approved. Partially internal model for Sweden and now we
did the same with Topdanmark, but I think that we will start discussions with the regulator
Page 9 of 16



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2017-11-02

that this is somehow unfair. So, I don't promise you anything because the regulators are
never easy on these things. So, I think that the right thing would be that we could also use
their partial internal models when we calculate the conglomerate solvency.

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

Thanks. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Youdish Chicooree with Autonomous Research.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everyone. I've got two questions, please. The ﬁrst one is in relation to
the investments you made in Saxo Bank and Nets. I mean, these investments were
primarily funded by excess liquidity in Sampo plc. I was wondering if the right opportunity
comes along and the IRs are as attractive as you mentioned, would you consider
modifying your asset allocation in If P&C and Mandatum, and do the investments from
these units?

Bloomberg Transcript

And secondly was just on your dividend guidance. You talked about gradual growth in
dividend, but I was wondering just to help us frame our expectation. Do you, when
thinking about that, include the dividend you're going to expect from Topdanmark early
next year?

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

We don't really think of from where the dividend is coming, and I don't really want to bore
you with saying that our dividend should be aesthetically beautiful curve, but when you
tempt me to do it. So I think that our dividend history is such that we just want it to grow
gradually and it should be pleasing to the eye. So, regardless from where the internal
dividend streams comes, and I think that we are well positioned to gradually increase the
dividend in the coming years.
I didn't really get your point on the investments in Saxo and Nets. Peter, can you help me
out here?

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

If we would ﬁnd something else to invest in, so, it would be a long road where we would
have to change the investment allocation in If and Mandatum. So, if we ﬁnd something
else to invest in, it will still be business as usual in Mandatum and If, because we have so
much scattered...

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay. No, because at the moment, your allocation to alternatives, like BTE or real estate or
any other asset class is quite low in your insurance business. So, I was wondering with

Page 10 of 16



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2017-11-02

your risk appetite improving, whether you are more comfortable to take more risk in those
businesses.

FINAL

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

In If we have always been more conservative on investments, because that we want to say
save the cash ﬂow coming in from If. So, normally we have taken more risk in Mandatum,
which investment risk, because it's a non-rated entity. So, we don't – that's the reason why
we use more Mandatum's balance sheet.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay, understood. Thank you very much.

Operator
We'll take our next question from Michael Huttner with JPMorgan.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. Thank you very much. Just a question. Just going back to the combined ratio,
maybe you've answered it before and I apologize if you have. The thing I noticed is that
Sweden got so much better Q3 versus Q2, so 83% versus 90%. I just wonder if you could
just help us out and explain what you see is a right sustainable ﬁgure of those two.
And then the other question on solvency, so, asking what my predecessor asked, but in
slightly diﬀerent way. You've done those two deals which reduced solvency a little bit,
there's a bit of extra capital required at the level of Sampo plc. How much more would
you have room for, I mean, how many more deals like this can we expect in the short or
medium term?
And then ﬁnally on Nordea, the discussion was so good, but it was framed, as I
understood it, mostly in earnings. And at the Investor Day, your Investor Day, you focused
or, so what was said that the dividend of Nordea could grow not just by €0.01 or €0.02 a
year but by more. Is it focused on earnings now meaning that you're slightly not focusing
so much on the cash? Thank you.

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

I'll start with the combined ratio for Sweden. It's true, Q3 was a strong quarter. You
shouldn't read too much into it, it's volatility in large claims, some prior year gains. So,
well, and again no events during the third quarter.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Okay. On the solvency side, I think that we partly answered this question already earlier.
From the parent from Sampo plc, we still have room to make investments up to $1 billion
to $2 billion if necessary. So, that's the framework where we have room to maneuver. But
it's highly dependent on whether we ﬁnd anything that meets our risk reward and return
criteria.

FINAL

On Nordea, I can assure you that we are as concentrated on cash as ever. However, I don't
think that I should communicate anything else than Nordea has communicated on the
dividend. And Nordea has communicated that their ambition is to have a gradually
increasing dividend going forward. We should leave the dividend guidance of Nordea's
dividend to them.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Excellent. Okay. Nothing. Thank you.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

And the solvency (33:35), both Nets and Saxo together, the total capital eﬀect on the
holding company level on Basel III rules is less than €100 million.

Q - Michael Huttner

And this is for an investment total for about €300 million for the two together?

€500 million?

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

€495 million, beg your pardon.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

So less €100 million is capital consumed.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thank you very much.

We'll take our next question from Thomas Seidl with Bernstein.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks. Good afternoon. Three questions quick ones. First, the cost ratio in P&C
keeps on improving. And in light of your comments, Kari, on the bank side, can

technology bring the cost ratio of If below 20% in the mid-term is my ﬁrst question.

FINAL

Secondly, in the past you have mentioned life is not a particular business you like now.
With Topdanmark, you get a life portfolio which has more spread business than
Mandatum. So, I wonder what your view is on Topdanmark's life portfolio. Is it something
you would like to develop or is something you want to trim back to the business you like,
which is mainly unit-linked.
And the third question is on If, if I do remember correctly you said Norway, competitive
pressure coming down, and now you say growth is 1.7% on constant FX. Does this mean,
we should expect more growth of this or is 1.1% to 2% the maximum you get out of
Norway?

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

May I start with the cost ratio? I just say that we don't give long-term guidances on cost
ratio. We have said that our job is to make the company more eﬃcient year-after-year.
And therefore, we knock oﬀ one decile or something every year. And I think we continue
with that even if the world is becoming fully digital or if you disagree or agree.

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

I agree.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

You agree. Then on the life, we are not really super life enthusiastic. I think that the unitlinked business is a fee business and that we, of course, like because it's a high ROE
business, where we have been quite skeptical is the with-proﬁt business. However, the
way Topdanmark is running their life business, I think, is super professional and
conservative. So, as an owner, we support the management decisions that they have
taken in regard to their life business.

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

On the Norwegian market, it's true. Currently, we see the Norwegian market as better
than in some time. Having said that, Q4 (36:48) cost growth is diﬃcult. It's a combination,
of course, of what claims inﬂation we will see, competitor actions and possibilities in the
market. So, I will not give a forecast on growth, but what we saw in Q3, the market was
more stable and more calm than in some time.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah, just a quick one. Any update on the timing of the completion of the life bid (37:28)
disposal sometime next year?

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah, sometimes next year most likely. Towards the end of the year, of course.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

The end of the year. Okay. Thank you.

Operator
And we'll take the question from Ida Gjøsund with Carnegie.

Q - Ida Melvold Gjøsund
Hi. Good afternoon. I have two questions, please. Both to you, Ricard, on If P&C. Firstly, on
the combined ratio in industrial, there is a worsening of 17 percentage points year-overyear. What are the drivers of this? And also, some of your competitors have started price
increases in this business area, especially in Norway. Do you ﬁnd this necessary as well in
If P&C?

Bloomberg Transcript

And secondly, on large claims, they are €31 million higher than expected this quarter. Are
there any particular events or product that drives this up this quarter? Thank you.

A - Ricard Wennerklint
Let's say, combined ratio industrial, as always, aﬀected by large claims. So, the volatility
you've seen in industrial is coming from the large claims situation.
Second on price increases, Norway, as I understood your questions, yeah, in parts of the
business we did premium increases in Q3, more tilted towards the commercial side of the
business. Again, what we will see going forward is diﬃcult to comment on, but I don't see
any sort of dramatic need. I don't think our top line will start to increase as a result of
premium increase to any large extent in Norway, but of course we have to monitor the
situation.
Thirdly, large claims in both commercial and industrial, if I comment on the ﬁrst ninemonth, very traditional large claims meaning ﬁres, property-related claims. So, nothing
really out of the ordinary.

Q - Ida Melvold Gjøsund
Okay. Thank you. Just for a clariﬁcation. So, now price increases in industrial Norway
currently at the moment?

A - Ricard Wennerklint
That market isn't really sort of homogenous enough to comment on as a market, but no I
don't expect – if I comment the corporate market or the industrial market Nordically, I
don't see currently any real push up in prices.

FINAL

Q - Ida Melvold Gjøsund
Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
And we have a follow-up from Michael Huttner with JPMorgan.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thank you. Thank you very much. And just like (40:38) from the Mandatum Life deal, you
gave in August the sensitivity of the Mandatum solvency ratio to the deal, which is plus 15
or plus 20 points depending on where you take the, with or without transitional ratio.
Could you say, how much, from the beneﬁt, would be at the level of the group, please?

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

On the group level, it's not big, but it's a couple-of-hundred million euros extra for
Mandatum Life. So, it's a big number for Mandatum, but on group level, we have a capital
buﬀer of €4 billion. So, it doesn't move the needle so much.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Excellent. Okay. Great. Thank you.

Operator
And we'll take our next question from Per Grønborg with SEB.

Q - Per Grønborg
Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I came in a little bit late, so sorry if the question already
has been asked. You now have two segments operating in the same market, any thought
about consolidating your Danish P&C operations? There must be some synergies to have
it.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

No plans whatsoever. The synergies are smaller than the market thinks. Both companies
are extremely well run. So, no plans.

Q - Per Grønborg
Okay. Thank you, Kari.
