Dear ladies and gentlemen welcome to the conference call of CNP Assurances. At our
customers request, this conference is being recorded. As a reminder all participants will
be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation there will be an opportunity to ask
questions. (Operator Instructions) May I now hand you over to Antoine Lissowski, CEO of
CNP Assurances who will lead you through this conference. Please go ahead sir.

Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much, and good morning to everybody. Before all I want to
apologize because I have had (inaudible) rendezvous which was decided this morning
and we had to leave the meeting at half past 11. And let my friend Thomas and his teams
develop the informations we will provide to you. If you look at the presentation on Page 5,
you see that the signiﬁcant events of the years relay in four ﬁgures. First we were very
resilient in the phase of COVID crisis. Second, we continue to adapt our economic model
to the low interest rate environment. But it is also clear that the year was speciﬁc for CNP,
because we made the link-up with La Banque Postale which took the control of the
company in March 2020. And we signed new agreements with the Brazilian partner, Caixa
Economica Federal and we entered in a new area of activities in that country, a multipartner development which is now possible for us.
If I can -- we have more details on these diﬀerent aspects on Page 6. I make several
comments on the performance during the year. But ﬁrst crisis. Of course this crisis had an
eﬀect on the operations, the premium income is down over the year. And it is clear that

this performance is due to the ﬁrst half of the year when the certain part of the networks
were closed, but it was followed by a very strong recovery in business in second half of
the year. Regarding the company, all the employees are working remotely and in fact it
started in March very easily and we had to simplify several processes, notably the creditor
insurance acceptance with no automatic medical check. This opens ﬁeld to diﬀerent
evolutions in our way of coping with our guidance. The company was invited to make
diﬀerent gestures of solidarity with diﬀerent customers. We devoted the EUR30 million to
contractual, non-contractual obligations for vulnerable policy orders and we made the
contribution to an insurance industry solidarity fund which was settled in France for EUR25
million regarding CNP.

Bloomberg Transcript

The loss experience of the company, which was observed was relatively low. We have an
impact, negative impact on underwriting margins limited to EUR13 million and a very
small decline in savings and pension withdrawal rates. The major eﬀect in fact was on the
investment portfolio with lower revenue due to the cancellation or deferral of some
dividends. And nevertheless we took beneﬁts of a very careful hedging policy of the
company, which protected us at the level of EUR62 million against negative impacts of
capital market at certain moments. We by the way made also signiﬁcant contribution to an
investment program, which was settled by French federation of insurance in order to help
to the industrial recovery.
If I come up on Page 7 to the link-up with La Banque Postale, you see now that the
company is owned at roughly 63% by La Banque Postale who itself hold -- owned at 100%
by La Poste which in its turn is owned at 66% by the Caisse des Depots and 34% by the
French State. And direct control of Caisse des Depots and CNP is in fact maintained at
roughly the same level as before. If you consider also the overall aspects, BPCE is still in
the -- shared impact with La Banque Postale for 16% and the overall investors represents
still 21.1%. That allows us to say that with La Banque Postale we constitute the New
European leader in bank insurance and responsible ﬁnance and it is clear that the group
which we constituted with La Banque Postale takes place immediately among the largest
bank insurance groups in Europe.
On Page 8, the several things we wanted to draw your attention to. The fact that new
business is now aligned with market conditions, the united -- unit-linked weighting was
increased in France, where the company produced 26.6% of its premiums -- savings
premiums in unit-linked. In the rest of Europe, we are at the top level of 76.7% and in Brazil
is 99%. Beside it, you can also appreciate that, if you look at the new money, net new
cash, in France, it was negative on traditional savings by EUR7.2 billion and positive in
unit-linked. The positive ﬁgure also illustrates activity in Brazil and the rest of Europe, that
means that the transformation of the production of the company in savings business has
been very clearly started and is important. There is another ﬁgure below it, which
underlines the same thing, the transfers which are allowed in France under the PACTE
regulation, people being authorized to transform without losing the tax advantage,
traditional contract to a new contract, the transfers were relatively important with EUR3.4
billion. And the unit-linked weightings of new contracts is double of what it was with the
same contracts before. And of course, to spur this tendency, we have launched diﬀerent
unit-linked as Immo Prestige, My Selection in Italy and diﬀerent SRI funds in diﬀerent
countries.

I mentioned and I come back to that on Page 9, the multi-partnership development in
Brazil, then we have a 25 years agreements with Caixa Economica Federal covering
personal risk insurance, consumer loan insurance and retirement products. And also we
are in a process of closing a 20-year agreement in the Consorcios business, which is a
speciﬁc insurance activity in Brazil. Then the renewal of these agreements is very
important for us. You might consider the importance of Caixa Economica Federal as a
partner. And together the activities which we had in 2020 were representing roughly 13%
of market share, and make us the third insurance company in Brazil last year. Now we can
have diﬀerent of distributors in Brazil as the Caixa has diﬀerent over insurance, and we
can also make contracts though our distributions relation is not exclusive longer as it was
during the ﬁrst period of our partnership in Brazil. Then we settled an agreement with
national postal service operator Correios, which is very promising in terms of multi
customer distribution strategy.

Bloomberg Transcript

On Page 10, I underline the level of dividend, which will be proposed at the General
Assembly at a level of EUR1.57 per share. This is a combination of EUR0.77 for 2020,
representing a 40% payout ratio for the year and 80% for 2019, representing as well 40%
payout ratio. After the year of I would say diﬃculty to make sure the situation of insurance
industry in general, and in CNP in particular, we take advantage of a very strong position
of a company in terms of solvency ratio and in terms of capacity to generate revenue. And
we proposed to shareholders to reestablish the payout ratio for 2019 and to conﬁrm it for
2020. We are at a low level of bracket for this ratio because we have spotted a policy
between 40% and 50%. But we consider that the time is to resume the payments even if
context encourages us to be very careful on that respect.
The last thing I wanted to draw your attention to are our strategic initiatives, which are on
Page 11. I don't -- I will not go through the diﬀerent items, which are in this page, but you
can observe that the strategy of transforming the model of CNP, transforming the savings
model, integrating property and casualty and personal risk businesses, transforming with
Brazilian and with BPCE partners, transforming in terms of digital excellence, the process
is very well ongoing. Then the company is now contemplating with a very good
conﬁdence of the future as we consider that we are completely engaged in the
transformation of the model.
I now give the ﬂoor to Thomas Behar for following of the presentation and I say goodbye
to you.

Thomas Behar

{BIO 18964489 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Antoine for your last presentation of results. And I will present now
all the key ﬁgures for CNP Assurances for 2020. If we go to the key ﬁgures on Page 13, the
attributable net proﬁt is EUR1,350 million, which is only reduction of 4.4% in 2020. The
EBIT is EUR2,614 million and reduction of 5.7% at constant exchange rates, and we don't
focus on exchange rate due to the reduction of the real of 33%, the premium income is
around EUR27 billion, a reduction of 11.5% and the APE margin is 12.2%, a reduction of 4.9
points due to the very low interest rate level environment. The consolidated SCR
coverage is 208%, a reduction of 19 points.

So we will go now to the diﬀerent areas of the Group and present the diﬀerent key ﬁgures
for each of them. Let's go now to France and main criteria to describe 2020 is a
transformation of savings and pensions premium income and technical results in the -with the aim of getting more unit-linked and less euro contracts. You could see that in the
numbers, but ﬁrst if we go to the evolution of the premium income, you can see a
decrease of 21.4%. It is in line with the evolution of the main competitors that we can know
today and the market. And if you go more directly to the numbers, you can see a
decrease of around 33% of the traditional euro guarantees. And only a slight decrease of
1.1% of the unit-linked. It is a characteristic of the transformation that we are trying to do
and that has been done in 2020. This reduction of 1.1% is a mix with some networks being
slightly positive. It is a case of La Banque Postale and the high wealth management. If -and this evolution explains the evolution of business mix. We have an increase from 20%
to around 27% of the share of the unit-linked inside the premium income. For personal
risk and protection, you have a slight decrease of 2% during the year. Net new money
reﬂects exactly the same, with positive inﬂows for unit-linked product and negative inﬂows
for traditional savings and pension products with -- it's in line with 2019 with an increase of
the evolution of the euro contract.

Bloomberg Transcript

In addition to the premium income, you have the transformation of technical reserves. We
have a number of EUR3.4 billion of transfer from old contract to new contracts due to the
low PACTE that Antoine Lissowski has just explained before. This evolution of EUR3.4
billion is not recognized in premium income. And when we do -- when the networks are
doing the transformation, we have an increase of more than 10 points of the business mix
to unit-linked in each of the -- in the contracts that are conﬁrmed.
If we go now to the revenues. The revenues is a slight decrease of 10% which is fully
explained by the evolution of the revenue that comes from the own-fund portfolio. The
important decrease of 33% comes from the fall in the dividend income that we received
from the equities that we are following the COVID-19 crisis, so downtrend in bond
revenues and basis eﬀect that due to the proﬁts that we have taken in 2019 last year at the
end of 2019. The NIR, the interest revenue is quite the same around EUR1.8 billion.
(inaudible) administrative cost you have a decrease of 5%. So we -- it's -- we had the full
last quarter where we have the decrease that was decided following the beginning of the
crisis at the end of the ﬁrst quarter of last year. And so it just produced full eﬀect and we
have this decrease of 5%, which comes from costs that would not happen due to the
COVID-19 but also a reduction of the costs that we voluntarily decided this year. It's
explained that the cost to income ratio is at the lowest point 32.1% in France. And as a
result, we have the evolution of the EBIT. For Europe, excluding France, we have a very
high unit-linked sales and an evolution for example for CNP Unicredit Vita which was able
to go up to 78% of unit-linked inside the premiums. As a total, the premium income has
not changed. We had very good numbers for CNP Unicredit Vita. At the end of the year
with some months being three times the worst month of the year during the ﬁrst part,
where the branches of UniCredit were closed.
This evolution is aligned with what we are doing in France with a priority to unit-linked
and you can see in the numbers a reduction of 31.8% of the euro contract and an
evolution of 17.7% for the unit-linked part. For the evolution of personal risk and

FINAL

protection, you have a decrease of 5.3%, which reﬂects a decrease in loan originations
especially in Italy. The net new money is very characteristic of what we wish we've an
increase and obviously unit-linked and in pension products with EUR1.8 billion of net new
money in unit-linked. For the EBIT, so we have a very good evolution of 6.7% of the EBIT in
a year where we have the COVID-19 crisis, and we have EUR298 million of total revenue
for Europe excluding France. And we have an evolution of the net insurance revenue of
3.4%. We have a slight decrease of the administrative cost, 0.3% and the EBIT is up 13%.
Let's go now to Latin America. We had also as in Italy a strong recovery during the second
part of the year with one of the month being 5 times the worst month of the year, it was
December. We have a very good increase of 10.7%. And if we go to each lines of activity,
for unit-linked saving and pension products, it's an increase of 12.5% and personal risk
and protection an increase of 6%. Caixa Seguradora has become the leader in consumer
ﬁnance term creditor insurance where we are number one in the Brazilian market. And in
the new series that has been formed at the end of the year, we have this market. We are
also very good in pensions, we are the number three in the market for pensions with
around 19% of market share. For the revenue it's a slight increase of 2% of the revenue
due to the addition of the generation especially for pensions. So it's an increase of 1% for
the net insurance revenue. Administrative cost is a slight increase of 0.1% of the EBIT 2.3%.
If we go now to the value of the new business. So on one side you can see -- on one end
you can see the eﬀect of the good diversiﬁcation of the good balance of the business mix.
So we have Latin America and Europe, excluding France, which has very good APE
margin, 17.2% in Europe, 35.5% in Latin America. At the opposite, we have France, due to
the saving business we have 4.1% as the total loss APE margin for France due to the
negative interest rate environment that we know. At total the new business value is
EUR339 million.
Let's go now to the bottom line of the accounts. We go from the EBIT to the net proﬁt. I
will only look at fair value adjustment and then net gain and losses, so we have done, of
course, less net gains during this year. And we have done --we have oﬀset net gains by
non-recurring items, of course, we have the EUR25 million that was decided the ﬁrst part
of the year as a contribution to the SME separate fund of the French Federation of
Insurance. But we have also done EUR300 million growth, transfer to the policyholders'
surplus reserve, which is the EUR205 million net transfer. Among this EUR300 million, we
have EUR200 million, which go to the PPE in unit-linked which will help the transformation
of the contract.
Net operating free cash ﬂow is EUR1,334 million is the net operating free cash ﬂow. So we
have not taken into account this number, the subordinated debt that were issued during
the year. We are at the same kind of level as the net proﬁt, which is playing. Also our
capacity to pay the dividend and of course due to the level of interest rate you have an
increase of the required capital for new business.
SCR is at 208%. What are the main explanations comes from the market changes, it's a
reduction of 40%. We have now fully taken into account the PSR and we are respecting
SEPA rules to take into account this PSR, there's an increase of 17%. And as a total amount
inside this 208% of SCR, you have 77% which come from the PSR which is EUR12.6 billion

which are included in the surplus own funds. And you have on the right the diﬀerent
sensitivities that we have on the SCR.
In this Slide 26, so we remind you that we are now followed by three diﬀerent rating
agencies, and in addition to Standard & Poor's and Moody's, we have now Fitch, which is
following CNP Assurances. On the asset liability management side, you have the ﬁnancial
income that we were able to get from -- written from ﬁxed rate investments. In 2020 we
had 2.15% on the ﬁxed rate even for In-Force. And on the new business we were able to
invest at 1.08%. We don't have guaranteed yields as you can see and it's a permanent
policy of the Group.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we look at what kind of investment we have done, we continue to invest on equities,
private debt, property and infrastructure and private equity. And you can see the level of
the bonds we have both in 2020 and the average maturities of them. We continue to
invest only in positive interest rate bonds. If we look to our support to the real economy,
you can see the diﬀerent numbers that we have shown to invest in 2020 private equities,
property and forest assets, infrastructures, private debts, and you have seen our recent
press release about (inaudible) infrastructures that -- and we will continue that kind of
policy in 2021.
Let's go now to the last part, corporate and social responsibility. If we begin by corporate,
so we remind you of the rating that we have, the parity score of 99 out of 100 for the third
consecutive year on gender pay. We had an agreement signed with the Paris Region to
help to provide appropriate housing for people representing an aggravated health risk
and we have helped some people for reducing social inequalities in term of healthcare in
France. For responsible investor, we had an objective of 40% reduction in property
portfolio carbon footprint, it has been achieved last year. And we are continuing to invest
in SRI funds, we were only at EUR2 billion last year and we are now EUR11 billion of unitlinked which are 100% SRI label. We have long-term commitment, we are fully subscribing
to the United Nation principle for sustainable insurance. And we have the commitments
to withdraw completely from the thermal coal industry in EU, OECD by 2030 and the rest
of the world by 2040. And we had set up new policies regarding oil and gas industry.
As a new climate objectives for the period to 2025 aligned with the goal of making the
investment portfolio carbon neutral by 2050. So we are fully committed to help to meet
the Paris Agreement of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees and you can see on Page
33 the four diﬀerent objectives that we are targeting. And especially we are engaging
conversations with companies where we have equities and asset managers to encourage
them through this dialog to adopt the 1.5 degree strategy before the end of 2040. And
we will publish the details of the progress in meeting these objectives each year.
In Page 34, you have some detail box, what we are trying to target to protect climate and
the biodiversity with tighter rules of investment in fossil fuels and green investment. And
you see the ban that concerns direct investment in companies operating in the oil and gas
industries, that derive more than 10% of the revenue from unconventional fossil fuels.
Investment in greenﬁeld or brownﬁeld infrastructures for the extraction of unconventional
fossil fuels and investment in greenﬁeld oil infrastructure. Green investment, we wish

them to be doubled by end of 2023 to EUR20 billion. And at the end of 2020 this
objective was 86% met.

FINAL

That's the end of the presentation. And with all my colleagues, we are now ready to
answer your question.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions). We've received the ﬁrst question. It is from
David Barma of Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.

Q - David Barma

{BIO 19957338 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you and good morning everyone. So I have questions on two topics on dividend
ﬁrst and on solvency sensitivities next. First on dividends. The -- you announced today as
you say around 40% payout for the 2 years. In the past you used to do something more
north of 45% closer to your 50% upper range. Should we see this year's announcement as
of sort of a compromise given the global environment or should we read anything into it
for the following -- for the next years in terms of a payout level? That's my ﬁrst question.
And then on Solvency II two small ones. So ﬁrst if I look at the evolution of your solvency
sensitivities and on rates especially, rates have moved quite a bit again by just looking at
the end of '19 versus '20. And so that combined with the complexity of the book, I would
have expected solvency sensitivities to increase, but they haven't moved much on rates. Is
there enough setting factor there from the increase in asset duration that has taken place
during the year. And is there anything else to take into account when looking at those
sensitivities?
And similarly on equities, markets have been quite strong at the end of the year. And I
expected a higher positive than what you've disclosed from equity markets. Is the lower
sensitivity just driven by your -- the changes in asset allocation you've done in earlier in
the year. Thank you.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Thank you, David. I will answer ﬁrst, the ﬁrst question, dividend and Stephane will answer
the second one. On the dividend, EUR1.57, in fact we are living very exceptional years
2020-2021 with the COVID-19 crisis and the ﬁnancial crisis that we all know and the Board
has chosen to be at the bottom of the range 40% to 50%. So it was when we decide to be
at the lowest point between 40%, 50% without seeing and even discussing what it will be
in the future. So we ﬁrst leave this year with all the diﬃculties that you know outside us.
And we take careful position being at the bottom of this trend 40% to 50%. And of course
the Board will decide later next year what it will be for the next years, but there is no
decision and even no discussion about the future dividends, it will be seen later.

Of course, we have seen that, as we have not paid anything in 2019, so we are now taking
back and being able to this year to pay with, as you have seen, we haven't had any fund
supervisor as there was no provision for paying the dividends this year. And we have
looked carefully about all the stress test before proposing such kind of dividends to the
Board. You can see also that the net proﬁts were very solid, very good results. We've only
had a decrease of 4.4%, which represents very solid performance, which explains also that
the Board was conﬁdent for this level of payout ratio. And it's also conﬁdent also both in
the capacities of the Group to adapt to the very low level of interest rate that we all know
today. Transformation is in due course and we'll continue to operate in the next year.
Perhaps we can go to the second question. Solvency II sensitivity. Stephane Le Mer from
the risk group direction.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Stephane Le Mer
Yeah, so, on the sensitivity and the interest rate sensitivity is quite aligned with the
sensitivity that we have in previous reporting and eﬀectively there is a new factor that is
taken into account because as it was explained the methodology that we use to compute
the surplus fund, we -- when we -- and we are now taking some additional items in the
conference. At year-end 2019 the computation of the surplus fund was based on the
conventional approach when -- where we took 70% of the PPE. And now it's a calculation
that is in line with ACPR technical guidance. And it's actuarial calculation and this item is
consisted by taking -- discounting on projected cash ﬂow of the PPE and where -- when
the rate decrease, there is a slight increase of this item. So that's why you see a relative
stable sensitivity on interest rate compared to the reporting of last year end. So, this is on
interest rate. And the second question on the sensitivity on equity. Compare on the
reporting of year-end 2019, the sensitivity is quite stable. And this is still quite natural as
the equity market are at a level comparable at the year end 2019 and year-end 2020. So
we had -- we have relative stability on the sensitivity on the equity.

Q - David Barma

{BIO 19957338 <GO>}

Right. Thank you. And just if I may, on the interest rate points for 2021, do you still aim at
reducing your duration gap for recent changes in inﬂation and rate trajectory, expectation
change anything to that?

A - Thomas Behar

{BIO 18964489 <GO>}

I will give the ﬂoor to Olivier Guigne, which is -- who is the Head of Investment
Department.

A - Olivier Guigne

{BIO 18263857 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you Thomas. Regarding the duration gap, we ﬁrst we have the same strategy
as before, it is to complete the gap very progressively. And we still have the strategy for
2021 as we did it in 2020. And so, it's not in -- we are (inaudible) regarding the evolution
of the market also and I think with some rising rates recently, it's still a good strategy for us
to be very progressive in that movement.

Thank you. The next question is from Michael Huttner of Berenberg. Your line is now
open. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, thank you very much. And thanks for that, lovely surprise on dividends. And I had
two questions. One is on equities and the other one is on transformation. On equities, so
you said of ﬂows 9% was invested in equities and I think 3% in private equity. And at the
half year, I just looked it up, I think it was 5% in equities, and 2% in private equity. So the
ﬂows have gone up. And can you explain why and will you be increasing equities more?
Beyond I am hoping to hear that's probably wrong, is that, this is partly linked to the fact
that yields allows you a little bit more ﬂexibility for the capital needed for particular class
of equities I think long-term or something.
And my second question is on the transformation. And here, the more you can tell me
because I don't understand very well the transformation of the French traditional life
portfolio deal of your contract. And so you started with EUR3.4 billion, where could this
ﬁgure go to this EUR3.4 billion PACTE transfers? And is there a kind of ﬁgure that you
have in mind that you would need to achieve to transform the portfolio and make the
interest rate sensitivity and the exposure to low interest rate much less of a challenge?
Thank you.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Okay. First, as you can see, due to the PSR that we have now, which is included inside the
calculation of the solvency capital ratio, one of the aim of the government when they
decided to align the French regulation to the German one, which enables that kind of
funds to be taken into account in the ratio was also to help undertakings to be present in
the equity market. And though that's -- in fact what we have in reality apply. When we look
to the numbers and to the level of the solvency capital ratio, we're able to take a little bit
more risk, not a lot of risk. We've always choice of the time -- of the timing of the
investment to increase slightly this equity in investments. And we still think that due to the
level of the interest rate, it's also very good for the insured person to have assets backing
the contract, which are the components of equities, which is signiﬁcant as the opposite of
other insurers. So it's something that's characterized as us, but it also helps to give good
revenues to the policyholders and to our shareholders. Perhaps you can develop that,
Olivier?

You said almost. Also has that, yes, just a few points on the equity, you remember perhaps
that we sold almost 3 billion equities in 2019 in the last quarter of 2019. We sold a bit
more at the beginning of 2020. So we were a bit short of our target allocation regarding
the equity side. And so, we bought back part of this equity sold before under (inaudible)
as you see it in the ﬁgures during the rest of the year. So it has led the portfolio to grow in
value in fact. So from the equity point of view, it was a good year, it's 2020 because our
portfolio has grown in value during the year given the fact that we sold some at the
beginning and we bought back afterwards.

Questions, so you ask matters about the PACTE transformation of EUR3.4 billion, in fact
it's an opportunity for the networks LBP or BPCE to meet the customer and look at the
insurance contract and see if this contract ﬁts or not well ﬁtting the current position of the
insured regarding risk, regarding savings. And so, it's an opportunity of discussion of
dialog with the customer to look at contracts. And when they look at the contract due to
the level of interest rates, at the end of this meeting usually there is a transformation
going to an old contract to a new contract that is being sold. But it comes from a 100%
contract to more a mixed unit-linked and always we have an increase of the unit-linked
component there in contract, which is over 10 points. So then this go up to 20 -- 15 points
depending on the network of increase of the unit-linked components inside the savings of
the insured. We have French ﬂow PACTE which enables us to do that without any tax
penalties and no taxes in line with this transformation. And especially regarding the limit
of the 7 years old hedge that we have in the French ﬂow of the matters. So it's -- and we -and just keep the tax structures that are in this old contract. So it's a beneﬁt from the
(inaudible) the new contract, which is more adapted to its new situation and it's also good
for our balance sheets with an increase of the unit-linked component.
Do we have targets? Of course we have targets to do this transformation. But, as usual, we
are not disclosing futures target -- future conﬁdentiality objective. But this policy will
continue and as you have seen in the diﬀerent lines of the strategic objective, this part is
number one in what we have to do as management of the undertaking, which is a
transformation of our savings business. And so, we are working hard to continue that and
the new unit-linked that we are proposing to the customers is also an opportunity for the
customers to go to more unit-linked (inaudible) contract. And you have also seen that we
have bonuses for policyholders who have more than 30%, 40% or 50% and in 2020, so
we had very good policy bonuses up to 1.9%, which is over traditional bonuses from
insurers that were given to people who have more than 50% of unit-linked. So it's part of
the whole policies that we have to transform our business mix on the stocks that we have.

But put it other way, what was the -- in January this year compared to January 2020?

A - Thomas Behar

{BIO 18964489 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

For the ﬁrst part of the year, I think you have to wait until May that we disclosed the ﬁrst
part of the year numbers. What I can say is that the branches of the various networks that
we have are opened and are fully operative during this part of the year as they were in the
last part of 2020. So all the activities are fully operating nowadays as it was last year. But
for the numbers, I think you have to wait a little bit. So therefore [ph] it is public, you can
see that the age of the people who are suﬀering from COVID-19 has not changed for the
best part. And so, further you can see in the statistics that people were below 60, 65 years
are not dying from COVID-19. And so, you can suspect what it did for our death insurance.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Lovely. Thank you very, very much.

Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Thomas Fossard of HSBC. Please go ahead, your line
is now open.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. Just two quick questions. The ﬁrst one would be on the reinvestment
rate in 2020, so you had 108 basis points. It was up from last year, which is a bit (inaudible)
having in mind the drop in interest rate and the reduction in the spreads. So maybe you
can help us to understand how you managed to achieve that. And possibly if you expect
additional changes in your asset allocation as far as you further concerned in order to
maybe be stable or a further increase with 1.08% reinvestment rate.
And the second question would be relative to your risk. The risk part of your business, if
I'm looking at the combined ratio, the combined ratio was up in 2020, not signiﬁcantly,
but still up 1% to 92.1, little death or mortality due to COVID. So maybe if you could shed
some light on the, on the increase in the combined ratio.

FINAL

And the last point would be, maybe a more strategical question relating to your -- the
transformation of your business model. Antoine mentioned that, I mean, you will become
the main or the key insurer for La Banque Postale, so there might be some sale of assets
as well taking place at some point. Would be also interested to better understand for us
when this may take place and what the process. And yeah, any color on that would be
interesting? Thank you.

A - Olivier Guigne

Perhaps -- so Olivier Guigne speaking. I'll start with the ﬁrst question on the reinvestment
rate in 2020. So it's, yeah, you're right, it's up in comparison with the previous year. And
it's linked to the fact that we invest especially during the crisis period in March and April
2020 when the spreads have widened a lot. And so, it allows us to add this higher rate
that we could have expected during the full year. So it's -- it is -- so this market timing
explain the trait for 2020. And regarding the allocation on how we could manage, it's
right on the new investment. Our allocation strategy is not to take more risk on the asset,
on the bond portfolio. So we remain very cautious and we aim to keep the average rating
of the portfolio at a very high level, you know. And we prefer to take some risk on equities
as Thomas said. And to have a kind of bubble in the portfolio is a very secure part on the
bond side. And perhaps a bit more risky side on the diversiﬁcation with some equities.

A - Thomas Behar

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 18263857 <GO>}

{BIO 18964489 <GO>}

So second question is about the combined ratio. As we have 82.1% at the Group level
versus 81% last year, I would say that the evolution is not very signiﬁcant, because it's an
average of the evolution of three diﬀerent areas. In France, you have a better combined
ratio 99 point -- we have a reduction of 1.5% at 89.9%, 89.9%. In Latin America we are
44.1% -- 55 point sorry, 54.1% an increase of 3.1 points. And in Europe, we are at 86.4%, an
increase of 1 point. So you have a decrease of 1.5 points in France, increase of 3.1 points in
Latin America and the 1 point in Europe, outside France. So it's also a result of the
combined ratio between claims and premiums. In funds you have two diﬀerent eﬀects,
you have an additional EUR30 million which is cost of the extra guarantees that we have
taken into it -- we have taken in the ﬁrst part of the year on one set, so reduction of EUR30
million.
In addition we have EUR30 million in the claim cost, but on the other side, we have
reviewed some commissions that we had on collective risk, which is a one-oﬀ point of
EUR60 million. So both plus EUR60 million minus EUR30 million, so it's a release of
EUR30 million of claims cost which explains the evolution of the combined ratio for funds.
Latin America, Europe upfront [ph], we will begin with Europe upfront, you have a slight
increase of claims very limited one, but which exist for Santander, our JV with Santander,
CNP Santander with some additional reserves that have been done due to some
guarantees regarding coming from unemployment guarantees of things like that. And in
Latin America, it's an increase of 3.1 points, which is an evolution of both the claims and
the premiums during the year. We got a very important explanation behind this evolution
due to the evolution of the objectivity.
Last question, Thomas, was about the transformation with acquisition of the subsidiaries
of LBP. As Antoine said, there is a long process that will take place in 2021, in fact,
Page 12 of 18

understand that acquisition will be fully operated in 2022 when all the measures will be
done, all regulatory matters. And after the publication of the accounts, so we will begin to
open the book of French subsidiaries from La Banque Postale in insurance, and look at
them and we will have a process of, technical process of acquisition of them, that will take
place without having yet a precise agenda, but it will take place in 2021 and with
regulatory approval hoping in 2022.
Any question?

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Thomas.

Operator
Thank you. Then we go to the next question, it is from Benoit Valleaux of ODDO BHF. Your
line is now open. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Benoit Valleaux

{BIO 2443205 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. Two questions on my side. Maybe the ﬁrst one is regarding dividend.
I know it's not ready for you maybe to comment. But can you tell us what has been the
discussion or the turn of the discussion with the French regulatory. You were just saying
that the 40% payout ratio over 2 years is a decision from the Board, but it's also a
constraint coming from the French regulatory or not? And still regarding dividend, I know
that you are sticking on your 40% to 50% payout ratio policy. Nevertheless, if '21 I would
say is a bit more normal year, at least from a ﬁnancial point of view, will you say that, it is
fair to assume that you should pay at least EUR0.94 dividend per share this year, which
was initial proposal for 2019. Or would you say that it's a bit too early and that it will
depend from various factors?
Second question regarding to earnings. When you look at your earnings, you have -- you
said two signiﬁcant negative impact in 2020. First one is coming from lower revenues,
coming from your own account, so due to lower interest rate, but also to lower dividend
received. Regarding dividend, can you quantify or give us some view on what do you
expect for this year, which level of pickup we may expect on this side and if it may or not
counterbalance the negative impact from low interest rate?
And then second I guess, impact is coming from a negative FX impact, especially in Brazil.
Can you tell us what is your hedging policy for this year. I mean, at which level are your
hedged regarding any potential decrease on the Brazilian real. And maybe my third or
fourth question is related to solvency. Can you tell us what could be the potential impact
on your solvency margin from the FFA [ph] proposal on the potential hit [ph] on Solvency
II? Thank you.

A - Thomas Behar

{BIO 18964489 <GO>}

Okay. First question is about dividends. France, what was the discussions with the French
regulators. And of course we are before public decision from the French regulator SEPA
Page 13 of 18



Company Name: CNP Assurances

FINAL

and we have all listened carefully to the Governor of the French of Banque de France who
said that in February, the French supervisor for insurance will express the pubic position
regarding the dividend for insurers. As it says there was no public communication for that,
so the only possibility was to present stress test about our solvency capital ratio for the
next years. And we have presented this -- the stress test to the public supervisors,
(inaudible)
(Technical Diﬃculty) of the economy? To have (Technical Diﬃculty) to the Board. But still
we don't know and we are very careful about that kind of decisions. And quite -- I may
think that the real discussion that can happen on that topics will only be in next year
during at the same kind of time -- of timing possible.
For the third question is about the expectations about equities. So well we can all also try
to know what will be the diﬀerent decisions regarding dividend for the undertakings. We
all hope that the dividends will be paid again. But Olivier is looking also about how this
(inaudible) priced in the market with -- and you can get access also to the pricing of the
fact that the dividends will be paid or not and perhaps Olivier, you can say a little bit
about that as you, we are looking at the market.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Olivier Guigne

{BIO 18263857 <GO>}

As you may know the market as we saw it is not expecting a full recovery of dividend as
soon as this year. So our expectation is that we will recover some of the diﬀerence, but not
all the diﬀerence. On the other side, as you ask it, we still have a decreased interest rate
on the global portfolio, as you see it in the presentation. So we will see it, this increase in
dividends in comparison with last year could compensate totally or part of the decrease in
rates, but it's perhaps too early to say at the moment.

A - Thomas Behar

{BIO 18964489 <GO>}

On the FX and hedge that we have on 2021, you have some -- the program is always in
slides that we are publishing. And it's at the end of the document. If your question was
about the hedging strategy, according to the real and you have the description of it
regarding currency risk on Page 63 of the document. And that Olivier, you can say a little
bit about our policy for this year.

A - Olivier Guigne

{BIO 18263857 <GO>}

Regarding the currency risk, so we continue the same strategy as the year before, which
means that we are hedging the results of the Brazilian subsidiary again to depreciation of
the real. So we did it again this year. On that all what we hedge regarding the real.

Q - Benoit Valleaux

{BIO 2443205 <GO>}

At which sorry -- at which even [ph] are you hedged exactly because I just saw the ﬁgures
in terms of nominal coverage (inaudible). But I mean, what is here the absolute FX,
(inaudible) at which you are fully...

FINAL

So we usually (inaudible), so it's technically we hedge it through a (inaudible) option. So
it's -- it means that we cover the results against the variations that could occur during the
whole year are not speciﬁcally at one point. And the strike of the option is around the
level of the end of the year. So, it's around 6.50 and with a little margin. So it's between
6.50 and 7 for the current option.

Q - Benoit Valleaux

{BIO 2443205 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator

A - Thomas Behar

{BIO 18964489 <GO>}

The last question from Benoit about Solvency II calculations about the future, Stephane?

A - Stephane Le Mer

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, thank you, Thomas. So we prefer not to provide any element regarding stand-out that
has not been yet approved. And we also remind that, (inaudible) technical advice in
December so that some just to say changes, positive in equity negative in interest rates.
However, there is a long journey before this standard been completely approved and
implementing because it's necessary to have a transposition into national law. And
regarding what has been publicly said by the diﬀerent bodies, we expect that the full
implementation will be around 2025 or 2026.

A - Thomas Behar

{BIO 18964489 <GO>}

So again what will be the adaptation of Solvency II to the current context and what will be
the decision of the European Commission, that we don't know yet. Thanks, Benoit.

Q - Benoit Valleaux

{BIO 2443205 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you. Then we now have another question of Michael Huttner of Berenberg. Your
line is now open. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Two very light question. The ﬁrst one is on the policyholder
participation. I think you mentioned the ﬁgure of 1.9% for the policies, which are either
40% or 50% in unit-linked. And I just wondered what the -- what happened to the
standard -- what is the standard distribution and how that changed relative to the previous
year? And my other question is on the accounting, did I understand correctly that the 20-

Page 15 of 18



Company Name: CNP Assurances

year deal with Caixa on this Consorcios is not fully closed, would that have an impact on
solvency or cash or anything? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Thomas Behar

{BIO 18964489 <GO>}

I will ﬁrst answer your ﬁrst question and after that, we will ask you some details about the
second question. For the ﬁrst one, the average discretionary participation in front is
0.94%, 0.94% is a reduction of EUR0.20 of the participation. It's in line with evolution of
our main competitors that we have seen in the ﬁrst publication for the survey [ph]. So we
are continuing to decrease the participation not at the same level of the decrease of the
ﬁnancial income, but we thought that the reduction of dividends was not a recurrent one.
And so, we decided to apply newly what was recurrent in the reduction of our ﬁnancial in
capital, reduction of EUR0.20, 0.94%.
On the second question, could you perhaps explain a little bit your question please?

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

It's probably a long question, so you know, you did the deal, the big deal with Caixa,
which was closed just before the event. And then as I understood it, there is still
discussion on the 20-year contract for the Consorcios product. Would that have any
implication on cash or solvency for the Group?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Thomas Behar

{BIO 18964489 <GO>}

For Consorcios, it's already taken into account in the Solvency II calculation. So you don't
have to expect any implications on the solvency capital ratio. But it's not the same kind of
this according to the amount as the ﬁrst one, it's more very limited numbers if I
understand. I don't have in mind the precise number for Consorcios, it's BRL250 million,
EUR39 million, so it's a very limited number. But it's already taken into account in the
calculation.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Just -- thank you. Yes, so I did, yes. Just on the participation rate, the 0.94%, did I
understand correctly that when -- if I have a contract, which has a lot of unit-linked, I would
get 1.9%?

A - Thomas Behar

{BIO 18964489 <GO>}

More than 50 depends on the contract, it depends on the networks. But if you have one,
for example, in La Banque Postale we have a (inaudible) contract too. And you have again
you can get 1.9%. But it depends on the contracts and on the network that you -- that you
have, but you can ﬁnd all our discretionary participations on our website. And it will be
our pleasure if you want to win the right one.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

And then I had a last question. You know when the advisors do these PACTE discussions,
do they get a commission on the transformation?

{BIO 18964489 <GO>}

Sorry, for the question, the...

FINAL

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

So you know when you do the PACTE discussion so to transfer, to look at the old contract
and maybe transform it to a new contract. Does the advisor gets a commission, is that an
incentive?

A - Thomas Behar

{BIO 18964489 <GO>}

You all know the IDD's directive, which prevents any incitation from the networks in going
for in advising something to the customer, which might be a diﬀerence between unitlinked and euro components. So it's something which is prohibited to direct the
commission that we pay to the network to this kind of advice. And for the last point, in fact
it's part of all the commission arrangements that we have with the networks. And I'm not
sure that we disclose that kind of arrangements that we have with our diﬀerent networks.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Brilliant. Thank you very much.

Thank you. As there are no further questions at this time, I would like to turn back to you.
We just now received a follow-up question of Thomas Fossard of HSBC. Your line is now
open. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes, sorry, just a very quick one. That was on the free cash ﬂow, because looking at my
notes, the free cash ﬂow in H1 was down at 27%. And it seems to be relatively stable unit
year-on-year. So yeah, I guess as part of that, you too -- to the operating proﬁts, but as the
new value -- the new business value was also a bit under pressure, maybe you could give
us a bit of ﬂavor of how we should think going forward about the evolution of your full
cash ﬂow? Thank you.

A - Thomas Behar

{BIO 18964489 <GO>}

So, perhaps, we'll give the ﬂoor to Quentin Boudoux which is our new -- with our new
actual function head, Quentin, so perhaps you, I don't know if you can answer a question
that I have also, which is the forecast of MCEV and OFCF, which is something not so easy
to do. That's about the evolution.

A - Quentin Boudoux
(inaudible) free cash ﬂow is slightly decreasing because of the cost of capital on
traditional selling products. So the new business value is decreasing, so you have impact
on the operating free cash ﬂow, but concerning the (inaudible) is decreasing because of

trend for the next year. So, I could not disclose this information.

FINAL

A - Thomas Behar

{BIO 18964489 <GO>}

And of course you have some sensitivities that you can see in the MCEV report regarding
to the forecast you can do on the numbers, can give you some insight about, for example
the risk evolution that we can have in the future. And as you know in Solvency II, the fees
is part of the own-fund, so it can give you a ﬂavor that what could be the future about this
numbers, if you take your own assumptions about the evolutions of the numbers,
(inaudible) sensitivities that are on our website in the MCEV report.
