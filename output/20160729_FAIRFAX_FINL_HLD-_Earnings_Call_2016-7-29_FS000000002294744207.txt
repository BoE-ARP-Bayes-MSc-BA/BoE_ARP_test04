Your lines have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct
a question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any
objections, you may disconnect at this time.
Your host for today's call is Prem Watsa, with opening remarks from Gladwyn Saba (0:37).
Mr. Saba (0:38), you may begin.

Unidentified Company Representative
Good morning and welcome to our call to discuss Fairfax's 2016 second quarter results.
This call may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ perhaps
materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements as a result of a variety
of uncertainties and risk factors, the most foreseeable of which are set out under risk
factors in our Base Shelf prospectus, which has been filed with Canadian Securities
regulators and is available on SEDAR.
I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Prem Watsa.

FINAL

In the first half of 2016, book value per share increased by 3.2% adjusted for the $10 per
share common dividend paid in the first quarter of 2016. Our insurance companies had an
excellent first half in spite of Fort McMurray losses with a combined ratio of 94.5% with
excellent reserving and significant underwriting profits of $204 million.
In the second quarter all our operating segments had combined ratios at or below 100%
with an overall combined ratio of 95.7%. Zenith had an excellent combined ratio of 83.9%,
Fairfax Asia had 83.3% and as shown on page 35 of our quarterly report we realized gains
on our investment portfolio of $315 million before equity hedges.
Excluding all hedging losses and before mark-to-market fluctuations in our investment
portfolio we earned $490 million in pre-tax income in the second quarter, including all
hedging losses and mark-to-market fluctuations in our investment portfolio we reported
after tax earnings of $294 million in the second quarter or $239 million after noncontrolling interest.

Bloomberg Transcript

Insurance and re-insurance business volume was up in the second quarter of 2016 by
17.7%. If you exclude Brit insurance which wasn't there last year at this time the increase
was 6.8%, and while our combined ratio as I said earlier was approximately 95.7%.
At each of our subsidiaries the change in net premium written and the combined ratios
were as follows. OdysseyRe up 13.9% in premium for the second quarter combined ratio
of 94.4%, Crum & Forster up 9.3%, combined ratio 98.6%, Northbridge in Canadian dollars
up 7.4%, combined ratio 100%, Zenith flat premiums 83.9%, Fairfax Asia up 8.2% with an
83.3% combined ratio and Brit we didn't own last year so the combined ratio was 99.9%.
As we have said before, very low interest rates and reduced reserve redundancies means
there is no place to hide for the industry. Combined ratios have to drop well below 100%
for the industry to make a single digit return on equity with these low rates. While the
short term is always tough to predict, fundamentals will eventually play out.
Net investment gains of $229 million in the second quarter consisted of the following.
Please refer to page two of our press release. Net losses on equity and equity related
investments were $413 million resulting from net losses of $208 million on our equity
investments due to stock fluctuations and a $205 million net loss in our equity hedge.
Stock fluctuations in three stocks BlackBerry, Eurolife, Eurobank and the Bank of Ireland
accounted for most of the net losses of $208 million in common stocks. Our realized
losses of $42 million on our individual equity hedges was mainly due to a switch between
two individual companies. This is offset by realized gains in our common stocks of $24
million.
Also, we had gains of $640 million primarily on our treasury and municipal bond portfolio
because of the impact of dropping long term treasury bond rates. As we have mentioned

FINAL

in our annual meetings, annual reports, quarterly calls with IFRS accounting, stocks and
bonds are recorded at market and subject to mark to market gains or losses, quarterly
and annual income will fluctuate widely and investment results will only make sense over
the long term.
Our CPI-linked derivatives with a notional value of approximately $112 billion produced
unrealized losses of $2 million in the second quarter. The majority of these contracts are
based on the underlying U.S. CPI index or the European Union CPI index. Further
information is available on page three of our press release where we have included a
table on our deflation swaps. On average, they have approximately 6.1 years to run.
These contracts are very volatile. But as I have said many times before our CDS
experience comes to mind. When you review our statements, please remember that
when we own more than 20% of a company, re-equity account and when we own more
than 30%, we consolidate, so that mark-to-market gains in these companies are not
reflected in our results.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you can see on page 12 of our quarterly report, the fair values of our investments in
associates is approximately $2.8 billion versus a carrying value of $2.4 billion an unrealized
gain of about $400 million not on our balance sheet.
Investment gains have been an important component of our returns overtime; since we
began we've had $11.5 billion in realized and unrealized gains. Previously announced, last
December Fairfax agreed to acquire a 40% interest in Eurolife, the third largest insurance
insurer in Greece, this transaction is subject to governmental and regulatory approvals
and closing conditions. Closing is now expected to occur in the third quarter of this year.
On June 27, 2016 the Company through its wholly-owned subsidiary Fairfax Asia Limited,
agreed to acquire an 80% in AMAG, an Indonesian insurer. AMAG has an excellent long
term track record in the Indonesian general insurance sector a well-diversified sales
channel with Panin Bank and there's a great opportunity for us to continue to expand our
operations in Asia. This transaction is also subject to closing conditions including the
regulatory approvals and is expected to close by the end of the fourth quarter of 2016.
On July 6, 2016 the Company agreed to acquire 100% interest in Zurich Insurance
Company South Africa, a South Africa and Botswana insurer. Africa is a continent that
represents a long term growth opportunity for Fairfax but where we have traditionally
done little primary commercial insurance business. This transaction again is subject to
closing conditions, including various regulatory approvals, and is expected to close by the
end of the fourth quarter of 2016.
Recently, one of Thomas Cook's subsidiaries, Quess went into public -- went public in
India. Under Ajit Isaac the founder's leadership, the Company went public at a market cap
of approximately $600 million. It is trading today at a market cap of about $990 million
versus our original investment in the company three or four years ago at a market cap of $
60 million. Fairfax owns 42% of Quess indirectly which is worth approximately $420 million
at today's prices through its 68% of Thomas Cook ownership which in turn owns 63% of
Page 3 of 16

Quess. So very significant investment for Fairfax and we think Ajit has a long runway ahead
of him.

FINAL

Fairfax India has now almost fully invested its $1.1 billion that it raised about a year ago in
six investments. We like all of them and are excited about the potential in India under
Prime Minister Modi's leadership.
We continue to be very concerned about the prospects for the financial markets and the
economies of North America and Western Europe accentuated as we have said many
many times before by potential weakness in China and emerging markets. We have said
now for some time we believe there continues to be a big disconnect between the
financial markets and the underlying economic fundamentals.
As of June 30, 2016 we have $5.8 billion in cash and short term investments in our
portfolios, which is approximately 19% of our total investment portfolios to take
advantage of opportunities that come our way. As a result, in the short term our
investment income will be reduced.
Now I'd like to turn it to Dave Bonham, our CFO, so he can give you some more
information on the underlying financials. Dave?

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Thank you, Prem. Fairfax reported net earnings of $239 million in the second quarter of
2016, that's $9.58 per share on a fully diluted basis and that compared to the second
quarter of 2015 when we reported a net loss of $186 million or a net loss of $8.80 per fully
diluted share.
Year-to-date Fairfax has reported net earnings of $188 million or $7.07 per fully diluted
share and that's an increase from 2015 when we reported year-to-date net earnings of
$40 million or about $0.71 per share on a fully diluted basis.
Underwriting profit at our insurance and reinsurance operations in the second quarter and
the first six months of 2016 was $82 million and $204 million and that was at combined
ratios of 96% and 95%, somewhat lower than underwriting profits of $136 million and
$263 million and combined ratios of about 92% in each of those respective periods in
2015.
Quarter-to-date and year-to-date underwriting profit is lower by about $54 million and
$59 million and that's principally due to higher current period catastrophe losses partially
offset by increased net favorable prior year reserve development.
Current period catastrophe losses were higher in the second quarter of 2016 and totaled
$158 million or eight combined ratio points and were $189 million or five combined ratio
points in the first six months of 2016.

The most significant CAT event in the quarter was the Fort McMurray wildfires which
accounted for $63 million of the quarterly and year-to-date total CAT losses.

FINAL

By way of comparison, cat losses in the second quarter and first six months of 2015 were
$36 million and $64 million and represented about two combined ratio points in each of
those periods.
The combined ratios benefited from higher net favorable prior year reserve development
in the second quarter and first six months of $175 million and $260 million and that
translated into about nine and seven combined ratio points in each of those periods. That
compared to a net favorable reserve development of $84 million and $152 million in the
second quarter and first six months of 2015.
Net premiums written by our insurance and reinsurance operations increased by 18% in
the second quarter and 19% in the first six months and that reflected the incremental
impact of the consolidation of Brit's net premiums written that impacted about $201
million in the quarter, $606 million on the year-to-date net premiums written.

Bloomberg Transcript

So turning to the operating company results, we'll start with Northbridge. Northbridge's
underwriting profit was just a fraction better than breakeven in the second quarter of 2016
and was $3 million for the first six months and that produced combined ratios of about
100% and 99% in each of those respective periods. That compared to underwriting
profits of $12 million and $19 million and combined ratios of 95% and 96% in those same
periods in 2015.
The underwriting results in the second quarter and first six months included $21 million of
current period catastrophe losses translating into nine and five combined ratio points at
Northbridge and that was almost entirely comprised of the impact of the Fort McMurray
wildfires.
Northbridge's underwriting results in the second quarter and first six months of 2016
included the benefit of net favorable prior year reserve development of $38 million and
$37 million respectively of 17 and 9 combined ratio point's favorable emergence there
was primarily arising on the accident years 2013 and prior and relating to casualty lines of
business.
In Canadian dollar terms, net premiums written by Northbridge in the second quarter and
first six months increased by 7% and 9% and that reflected increased renewal business,
new business writings and modest price increases across the group.
Moving over to OdysseyRe. OdysseyRe reported underwriting profits of $30 million and
$74 million and a combined ratio of 94%, 93% in the second quarter and first six months
of 2016 and that compared to an underwriting profit of $71 million and $129 million in those
same periods in 2015.

FINAL

Catastrophe losses in the second quarter and first six months totaled $75 million and $102
million and that translated into about 14 and 10 combined ratio points in each of those
respective periods and that was an increase from the cat losses of $33 million and $56
million that we experienced last year in the second quarter and first six months of 2015.
OdysseyRe's combined ratio in the second quarter and first six months of 2016 included
the benefit of $68 million and $103 million of net favorable prior year reserve
development that's about 13 and 10 combined ratio points respectively and that
principally related to favorable emergence on prior years' catastrophe loss reserves.
Odyssey wrote 631 million and just a little over 1.1 billion of net premiums in the second
quarter and first six months of 2016 and excluding the impact of the non-renewal of the
Florida property quota share reinsurance contract on June 1, 2015 so that's last year and
we've mentioned that on prior conference calls. Net premiums written increased by 2.4%
in the second quarter of 2015 and decreased modestly by 1.8% in the first six months of
2016.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to Crum & Forster, Crum & Forster produced underwriting profits in the second
quarter and first six months of 2016 of $6 million and $16 million with combined ratios of
about 99% and 98% respectively. That compare to underwriting profits of about $10
million and $15 million in the prior year and there is no net favorable prior year reserve
development in either of 2016 or 2015 at Crum & Forster.
Crum & Forster's net premium written increased by 9% and 13% in the second quarter
and first six months and that primarily reflected growth in accident and health lines of
business combined with incremental impact of the 2015 acquisitions of Redwoods, Travel
Insured International and Brown .
Zenith reported an underwriting profit in the second quarter and first six months of 2016
of $32 and $63 million with corresponding combined ratios of 84% in each of those
periods. That compared to underwriting profit of $22 and $62 million in the second quarter
and first six months of 2015 respectively.
The combined ratios included 10 and 12 combined ratio points of net favorable reserve
development in the second quarter and first six months of 2016 and Zenith wrote net
premium written of $163 million and $491 million in the second quarter and the first six
months of 2016, that's an increase of 4% in the first six months and that's principally
reflecting an increase of an exposure, partially offset by modest price decreases.
Turning to Brit, in the second quarter and first six months of 2016 Brit contributed $352
million and $758 million to consolidated net premiums written and produced underwriting
profits of $400,000 and $14 million. During those periods the combined ratios were
99.9% and 98% respectively. And as a reminder, Brit was acquired in June 2015 so
comparative figures for 2015 are only for the period in which Fairfax owned Brit.
The underwriting results in the second quarter and first six months of 2016 included
current period catastrophe losses of $32 million and $35 million which translated into nine
Page 6 of 16

FINAL

and five combined ratio points during those periods. Cat losses were principally
comprised of the impact of the Fort McMurray wildfires where Brit incurred net losses of
$22 million and that increased its combined ratio by six and three combined ratio points in
each of the second quarter and first six months of 2016.
Brit also experienced net favorable prior reserve developments of $22 million in the
second quarter and first six months benefiting the combined ratio on those periods by six
and three combined ratio points. Reserves development primarily reflected better than
expected emergence on casualty and property reinsurance lines of business.
Fairfax Asia's underwriting profits of $13 million and $25 million and combined ratios of
83% and 81% in each of the second quarter and first six months of 2016 improved when
compared to underwritten profits of $8 million and $14 million combined ratios of about
90% in the comparable periods in 2015.

Bloomberg Transcript

The insurance and reinsurance other segment produced underwriting profits of $1 million
and $9 million, and combined ratios of 99% and 96% in each of the second quarter and
first six months of 2016. Lower underwriting profit in 2016 principally rose from higher
current period catastrophe losses and the lower benefit of net favorable prior year
reserve development partially offset by improved non-catastrophe loss experience
related to the current accident year.
Looking at runoff, runoff reported operating losses of $1 million and $16 million in the
second quarter and first six months of 2016 that compared to operating income of $25
million and $12 million in those same periods in 2015, the decrease and operating
profitability year-on-year was principally the result of lower interest and dividend income.
Turning to our consolidated results, consolidated interest and dividend income increased
from $147 million and $261 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2015 to $161
million and $314 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2016. And that
principally reflects holdings of higher yielding government bonds year-over-year and the
impact of consolidating Brit's investment portfolio.
We ended the second quarter with an investment portfolio inclusive of holding company
cash of $29.5 billion compared to $29 billion at the end of 2015.
And turning to our financial position, our total debt to total capital ratio increased to 23.2%
at June 30, 2016 from 21.8% at December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of the issuance of
400 Canadian principal amount 4.5% unsecured senior notes in the first quarter and that
was offset to somewhat by the increase in our common shareholders' equity where we
issued 1 million subordinate voting shares. The proceeds from these offerings will
principally be used to finance investments in ICICI Lombard which closed in the first
quarter of 2016 and the acquisition of Indonesian insurer AMAG and Eurolife in Greece,
both are expected to close later in 2016.
And now, I'll pass it back to you, Prem.

now open.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Good morning, Paul.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

I have two questions. One is related to the bond portfolio and second is to the insurance
operations. So, with respect to the bond portfolio, it looks like in the quarter you sold just
over a $1 billion worth of munis and then redeployed that into U.S. treasuries. So
wondering if that's purely just duration driven, and if you'd have capacity to do more of
the same?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yes. So, Paul, that's right, we sold approximately $1 billion in muni bonds. These are mainly
pre-refinanced. They call it pre-re bonds which have been refinanced by municipalities
which own underlying treasuries, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.8% to the date of refinance. And we
bought treasuries, we bought long treasuries, and so our treasury position, long treasury
position is a little above $6 billion.
And interest rates, Paul, as you know have come down significantly in the past six months.
So, for example, in Germany they've dropped by 110 basis points, one point -- there's a
long German bonds, 1.5% to 0.4%. In the U.K. in spite of Brexit it's gone down from 2.7%
to 1.7%, so approximately 100 basis points again, and the 6 points I'm talking about.
And then the United States has dropped about 70 basis points from three to two, -- 3%
to 2.3%. But the United States still has the highest rates and the spread is in fact higher
than it used to be in the past. We've talked about that at our AGM. So, we still have
treasury bonds. We think it reflects these rates coming down. Of course reflects the
quantitative easing in Europe and Japan, but it also reflects the fact there's too much
supply in the world on a global basis and the lack of ability for the global economy to get
traction.
Page 8 of 16



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2016-07-29

So, yes, so we like treasury bonds and we like the position that we have today Paul, and
that position we have. We never talk about what we will do in the future of course, but we
like what we have.

FINAL

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay, good. And then the question on insurance operation is specific to OdysseyRe and
the favorable reserve development in the quarter, which was equal to roughly 13 points of
premiums earned. More than double of what we've seen in the recent period. So, I guess
my question is, where do those PfADs come from on the property cat given that we
haven't seen any major cat events since 2011. And then, is there capacity for those same
PfADs to favorably impact future quarters?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yes. So, Paul, the way we've always said, we like to put the reserves in a conservative way,
so that – and as time goes by we have redundancies as opposed to deficiencies and so,
because it's a very uncertain world we live in. And so for us we put the accident loss ratio
at levels which we think are conservative and we expect reserve redundancies over time
and so we continue to feel very comfortable about our reserve positions across all our
companies.

Bloomberg Transcript

And we just went through our audit committee at the end of June and we looked at Peter
Clarke who does our Chief Risk Officer, looks at reserves in each of our companies and
we feel very comfortable with the reserve position that we've got.

Q - Paul Holden

Good morning. First, I'd like to thank you for putting that operating earnings and earnings
reconciliation table on the front page. It's really helpful to have that up right at the front
and center?

FINAL

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Reacting to your comment Mark, and we were thinking about what make sense and it's a
simplified version of what's available in our income statement that's in our quarterly
statement, interim reports, but as you pointed out putting it up there, makes it a little
easier for all concerned. So thank you for that.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

That's definitely appreciated. Second question, maybe this is just a little bit more general
question, but I was little bit surprised to see that Brit had exposure to Fort McMurray fires.
I guess I had thought that Brit's book of business was a little bit more U.K. and Euro
centric. Obviously, I wasn't quite right in that assessment. But I was just curious I guess
what lines of business that might have been in? And maybe just a little bit of description
about maybe my own identification isn't quite right about where they really do most of
their writings?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

No. Your observation is right that a significant portion of that business is in the United
States particularly, then of course the U.K. and Europe. But the beauty of the Lloyd's
franchise is that it's worldwide, and it's a worldwide book of business that they have
written in London, 450 people, it's now a little more than – little – approximately a year
since we bought it. And I much say we are very happy with our Brit acquisition led by Mark
Cloutier and Matthew Wilson.
But they do also have reinsurance book, Mark, that is also a worldwide treaty book. And
so when you have a cat like we had in Fort Mac, well, that flows right through, well within
limits and well within their expectations and that was a horrendous loss for the community,
Fort Mac, but of course reinsurance and insurance helps and the Canadian companies
were all protected from this type of loss.
But anytime you have a loss like that worldwide we'll have some impact, it will be some
impact on us. Brit on the other hand in their way of – their cat margin they don't release
still now. Really the – it's more focused on the end of the year, the third and fourth
quarters, because that's where the exposures come from with the Florida wind storm and
European storm.
So, we focus on – they focus on that and we are comfortable with that. And so, we are
very happy with our Brit acquisition year ago for the record, Mark, the South African
purchase that we made and announced just recently came from Brit, came from Mark
Cloutier particularly. He identified it. They did their due diligence with our group of course
and Andy and Paul are all involved in it. But it came to fruition, but the lead was Brit
through Mark. And it's a terrific acquisition that we'd love to tell you a lot more about as it

Page 10 of 16

goes through the process through regulatory approval to closing. But we are very excited
about it as we said in our press release.

FINAL

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Thank you. That's helpful. The other question that I had relates to the CPI derivatives. And
I know you've consistently disclosed what the average amount remaining duration is on
those various positions. I was curious what the nearest term expiration as which is to say,
is there some part of that book that is getting close to rolling off that will either need to
be renewed or otherwise just allowed to lapse?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yes. Mark, that's a good question. There's enough – so we have enough flexibility Mark,
like we can extend the term. We can refresh it as and when. The most, the closest one
may be four years, four years something like that. So, we don't expect any expiry. But we
do have the ability to freshen it up and/or extend term. We would have to pay more
money for it, of course. We've done it in the past as you know and we can do it in the
future, but we have – the closest one is perhaps four years to go something like that.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. Very good. Sounds like there's still pretty fair amount of runway there. Thank you for
that and good quarter.

Hello. Good morning, Prem.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Hey, good morning Jeff.

Q - Jeffrey Fenwick
I just want to follow-up here on the CPI-link derivatives and I guess this pertains to Brexit
and some of the potential for changes in the EU. And I'm wondering how does that
impact if at all the CPI contracts that you were to have a country or more countries leave
the EU. Does that change or nullify or somehow impact the return or the way those
contracts are going to work?

FINAL

Yes. They've never faced that, Jeff, in terms of a country. Brexit taking place, of course is
the first one in a long time. And our thinking is the CPI index will just be adjusted and it
goes forward, but a good question, we don't see any impact from that. But we'll review
that again, but we basically don't see much of a change, you know I forget 16, 17 countries
in Europe, well, their CPI Index will go forward.

Q - Jeffrey Fenwick
Okay. That's all I had.

Hey, good morning, Tom.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Question just following up on this reserve development discussion, in your prepared
remarks you continue to point to reduced reserve redundancies in the industry, and I get
that, but Fairfax is running sort of the highest we've seen over the last 10 years in terms of
favorable reserve developments. And just given the prepared remarks on the industry do
you suspect that your favorable reserve development would be able to trend higher
going forward or lower going forward?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

I know it's around 9 points on the combined ratio now and its sort of average about three
over last ten years?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

So, Tom, if you look at the pricing, the pricing you know in the industry we operate
worldwide and the cat area has come down very significantly, like even in the last quarter
cat pricing, property cat this is down 8%. So cat prices have come down significantly, but

FINAL

for the other lines of business they're flattening out, maybe a little down but basically
flattening out.
And the point I'm trying to make on that when I make the comment on low interest rates
like even if you get a combined ratio below 100% with these interest rates every time a
bond renews, right, you have a lower investment income. And for you to make a 5% or
6% rate of return is going to be very significant at these low interest rates. So you need
an underwriting profit. And now you are seeing in the industry combined ratio is moving
up as people are discounting in different areas and eventually our thinking is that, that will
change. It's still not a hot market by any stretch of imagination. It will turn when capital gets
tight. And our thinking that might well be on the asset side. It always happens of course if
you have a major catastrophe, earthquake in California or huge wind storm in Florida.

Bloomberg Transcript

But it also will be affected by changes in the asset side, spreads widening, common stock
prices coming down, stock markets coming down, all of that will impact the industry and
we like where we are, Tom, in the sense that you know we are very decentralized, so we
have the ability to expand significantly and you have to be ready to expand in terms of
people and capital when the opportunity comes and we are in that position, and have
been in that position for some time. I'm not forecasting any change but if it takes place
we would take advantage of it.
And so, as I said earlier, our reserving position is very, very solid, you know this reflects of
course, Tom, 30 years in the business and we've seen cycles up and cycles down, and we
recognize that our reserves always have to at very high levels and we're not frighten to
reduce premiums. And so, OdysseyRe if you look at, its premiums have been flat to
coming down some and if you look over the years. So, that's our position there, Tom.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. So, if the current pricing environment persists do you think especially like at
OdysseyRe that we'd be able to sort of maintain these very high levels of favorable
development or do you think they should probably come down a little bit?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

They could well come down, Tom. They could well come down over time and yes, they
could well down over time, and particularly with – and particularly in a soft market. But
remember OdysseyRe is a global company insurance and reinsurance and they have the
ability to pick their niches, pick their – the products and countries where they can expand
or contract.
And it's a tremendous franchise that Brian Young runs, that Brian and Andy built over 20
years. The OdysseyRe by the way is celebrating 20 years, it is just one outstanding
company, now run by Brian Young. And it's a global franchise run from New York and
Stanford and it's one of the premier broker reinsurance companies in the world. So, they
have – they've built a tremendous company that we are very proud of.

Thank you very much, Tom. Nicole, next question.

Operator
Thank you. Our last question is from Mikel Abasolo of Solo Capital Management. Your line
is now open.

Q - Mikel Abasolo

{BIO 3756596 <GO>}

Thank you very much Mr. Watsa for taking my questions. Very briefly and my first question
revolves around your renewed bid on deflationary trades being loading up on treasury
bonds and inclusion of equity hedges coming from someone who shares completely your
deflationary scenario. Don't you think that you're concentrating the investment portfolio
too much into that theme, meaning that it works for your advantage that will be a big hit
and a big success, but otherwise it could be big hit to the company? That's my first
question.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second is, I see that you have raised equity this year in the March underwriting
exercise in the previous years at multiples that are 1.2, 1.3 book value and since you're
very well capitalized and ready to capture opportunities, I was wondering if that is a
statement of what you consider to be a fair value or fair economic value for Fairfax
Financial.
And my last question if I may, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that some of the
equity losses came from two companies. I don't know if you could be more specific and
say which one of those if that is pertinent? Thank you very much.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Thank you very much Mikel for your questions. The first one is as you point out we worry
about deflation and we bought some long treasury. In a deflation environment Mikel, the
worry will be a lack of investment income. If you look at what happened in Japan over 20
long years as interest rates came down and down and down and now they are negative.
But they've been like 1% for maybe 10 years. And so, there's very little investment income
that you can make and our worry has been that.
And if you take credit risk which you might be able to get more income, and most
insurance companies are doing that, taking credit risks at very low spreads. So we don't
like taking credit risks right now, we'd rather take duration risk or term risk in terms of
buying treasuries and our focus on the fact that income in the future might be tough to
get, meaning these rates could last at low levels for a long time in a deflationary
environment.

FINAL

And so that's our thinking. And we watch this very carefully. Treasury bonds are easy to
sell if we change our minds. We have no expectation that we will, but we can change our
minds very quickly. So, we feel comfortable with that position that we have. Mikel on the
valuation of our own company at 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 times book whatever the current number is,
you know we always say you have to make that judgement, as to what you think is fair
value for our company.
We're long-term. We've always been long-term. We don't worry about fluctuations in our
stock price. Fluctuations in stock markets or bond markets, but we look at the fact that
we've taken a book value over 30 years from a US$1.5 to $400 change and that's a
compound growth of 20% in the past. In the future we expect to make 15%. But our first
criteria is to be financially sound, is to survive whatever comes in front of us.

Bloomberg Transcript

Today we have all sorts of possible pitfalls. You just had Brexit. Brexit by itself is not a
significant factor, but it is significant in the fact that it's taking place at a time when interest
rates are negative, zero, pretty well in the western world and you have too much debt in
the system. So that's when Brexit is taking place. You got Scotland looking at leaving
Britain, leaving the U.K. You've got problems with Northern Ireland surfacing. You've got
the possibility of France having a referendum, Holland having a referendum, Italian banks
there's a concern. So you have all of these taking place, with Germany having negative
interest rates. Switzerland – every bond is negative, even the 50-year bond is negative
today.
So, it's not an environment that is without risk and that's the point that we are trying to
emphasize, and it's difficult in this environment to make a return. And so, we are focused
on stability, on downside protection and only then on making a return for our
shareholders. And so, if any of these unintended consequences come, take place, we will
not only survive, but we will thrive and for that we take a cost. There's a cost to that and
we in the last few years we paid that cost, but we think that if any of these unintended
consequences take place we will thrive.
And so, we've got a terrific group of shareholders who I thank very much because they all
take a long term view and we benefit from the fact that our shareholders – we see them
every year. We saw them in April and at our Annual Meeting, and we benefit from that. But
your point is well taken and as far as the companies and equity issues I just highlighted
one in our case Quess, but I didn't know if you – I – you were thinking some losses, what
did you have in mind, Mikel there. Sorry.

Q - Mikel Abasolo

{BIO 3756596 <GO>}

No. I was – I think that you mentioned that the equity losses that you recorded and I didn't
quite understand if it was in the first half or in the second quarter?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Oh, yes. So, what I was saying there Mikel is just that you have fluctuations in stock prices
so I was highlighting the fact that BlackBerry's and Eurobank and Bank of Ireland had come
down in the quarter. And their fluctuations and you know, they've shown us unrealized

Page 15 of 16

losses and important point to make is they are unrealized our view is overtime we'll still
do well on...

Q - Mikel Abasolo

{BIO 3756596 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much for the clarification.
