{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Good afternoon, to all of you dear shareholders. I'm extremely happy to be once again in front of
you for your general meeting. 2017 was a year of structural choices. 2018 was a year that saw
action and decisions. You saw many decisions, which were implemented, the creation of AXA XL,
the listing of our Life business in the U.S., the 100% capital increase in AXA Tianping company and
certainly, the rollout of innovative offers. 2018 was a year of transformation. But at the same time, a
year for good operating results.
It was 2017 where we made structural changes. The first choice was the organization. How can be
far simpler? How could we be much closer to our clients? And how can we give far more autonomy
to our local entities, which are the closest to the needs of our clients? On the other hand, we
agreed and decided on the strategic axis. The first axis or priority was to transform the risk profile
of the AXA Group. Second decision, to focus on key markets. There are 3 of them: Health,
Protection, Commercial P&C Insurance. And third decision, continue and implement innovation.
2018 turned out to be the year where we put many things into play in order to build a new AXA.
What does it entail to build a new AXA? First of all, it involves investing in specific targeted
markets. Our strategic choice was how could we get closer to our clients? How -- are we more in
contact with them in order to really better consider and fulfill their needs?
The first choice was clearly around the acquisition of the XL Catlin company. The combination
between AXA and XL created the #1 worldwide in P&C risks. The other major investment in order
to strengthen our presence in the specific markets was to invest in China.
A ramp-up up to 100% our shares in the AXA Tianping, which turns us into the first foreign insurer
in regard to P&C in China. Building a new AXA involves also a growing in innovation in new services
for clients. We can see today that the payment of claims is not enough. Our clients want us to
support them to have a better life.



Supporting involves first the health aspect. We are all facing the hardships in terms of medical care.
And AXA launched several years ago a telemedicine service. And today, we are the largest in the
telemedicine business based on 2 activities. On the one hand, AXA Assistance and on the other
hand, our business in the care start-up that we put together.

FINAL

The second priority or axis is about mobility. We can see that the strong need today of insuring.
The path of people -- up until now, we have ensured more than 1 billion so-called path or itinerary.
The third, believe the partnership of a modern bank insurance with ING across Europe is certainly
another innovation pillar where we are reinventing together with ING, the combination between a
bank and an insurance company. All of this was made possible because we created an innovationrelated entity, which is called AXA Net (sic) (Next). It's on a standalone basis and it develops such
innovations. And right now, we are at the moment when we need to launch them into every entity
in France and elsewhere.
Guillaume Borie, the Chief Executive of AXA Next, will present to you in a few minutes what we did
in regard to innovation and what are we planning for the next steps.

Bloomberg Transcript

Building a new AXA in 2018 was also about how could we desensitize AXA to financial risks. We
took 3 major decisions in order to cut down our sensitivity to financial risks. And it started really
around the financial crisis in 2008. We made a decision at the time of reducing our exposure to
financial risks. And it just gained momentum in the past two years with 3 basic decisions.
First of all, the listing of U.S. business in Life & Savings and this took place last May. And you saw
recently that we reduced our stake below 50%. A second key decision was made, namely
restructuring and transforming a collective life insurance in Switzerland and moved from a
guaranteed rate to something which is more similar to asset management. The third major
decision was to sell our variable annuities business in Europe and the AXA Life in Ireland.
2018 turned out to be for us a return to growth driven by the 3 target segments: Health, Protection
and Commercial P&C Insurance. Our growth was at 4%, which leads us to revenues of $103 billion.
Such growth was truly driven by a 5% rise in Commercial P&C Insurance and 7% in regard to Health
and driven in regard to Protection by 3%.
Clearly, the insurance business in terms of commercial P&C was the strongest. And after XL's
acquisition, today, we have 25% of our revenues, which are in that segment. And for us, it's a major
mainstay and major driver of growth for the future. Such integration -- the XL integration is certainly
a complex integration. And this is why we are spending a great deal of time on this. We're making
many efforts because creating that #1 on a global basis in P&C is very important for us.
I must admit that I'm very confident today that such integration is going on quite well. Following the
close of the transaction in September last year, we took a first decision, which was to align our
reinsurance programs towards the AXA philosophy and towards the AXA risk appetite. And today,
we have a reinsurance program, which is fully realigned.
We also put in place our commercial organization because this combination between AXA XL is
something which is very enriching for the 2 companies. Now we can do business that none of the 2
in isolation were able to do. And you can see this already in numerous countries that there's a very
strong cooperation in order to truly obtain a mutual growth, which was not possible previously.
Certainly, in Europe, the challenge is to integrate these 2 organizations, namely XL and AXA
Corporate Solutions. And you might have seen that we presented a European organizational
project with our industrial partners. And today, I can say that we're totally aligned with our
ambitions and the goals that we communicated last year. And once again, I'm quite confident that



such integration is running very smoothly. XL and AXA XL also give us a commercial momentum
which we didn't have previously.

FINAL

I had shown you before that the growth in commercial insurance is very positive because we're
covering many of the new needs. Remember the cyber issue, the climate-related methods and
others that create new needs.
In 2018 with AXA XL, we saw a rise in revenue of 10% driven on the one hand by a real growth in
new needs. But on the other hand, thanks to a momentum of higher prices, which were really
driving the markets.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we look now at the renewal in 2019, I'm also quite confident because renewal rates turned out to
be very positive. And AXA XL also provides us a new direction in terms of quality of service. It was
in 2018 that AXA XL was awarded for the third time in a row, the ranking of being the #1 global
insurer with the best service in terms of customer satisfaction with regard to the major risk, the
famous J.D. Power's award and we are very proud of this. And certainly, our ambition is to retain
such a ranking.
If we look now at all these moves, we can see today an AXA Group, which is far less exposed to
financial risks compared to 10 years ago. 10 years ago, 80% of our operations were in the Life &
Savings arena. And today and certainly, following the total disposal of our U.S. operations in Life &
Savings, we find ourselves with 80% of our businesses, which are related to technical risks in terms
of preferred segments, such as Health, Protection and the risk for private people and corporates. It
makes us far more solid because these technical risks are de-correlated -- disconnected from the
financial markets. It is quite difficult to cover one's health and be diversified in a world of capital
markets, which are very much intertwined. This is why focusing, I mean, on technical risks means
increasing our diversification. It also means being de-correlated from the financial markets.
Clearly, we see volatilities in financial markets. And at the same time, in regard to technical risk,
remember the nat cats. Now if you look at the effect on our balance sheet, we can clearly state
that technical risks and the volatility of them are far less serious for our balance sheet than the
financial risks, which are interconnected. In addition, there's certainly a large market for alternative
capitals where we can hedge ourselves against such technical risk if we don't want to retain them.
If you now look at the share price over one year, there are certainly moves in that share price. We
see basically 3 different stages. The first stage, which was the stage following the announcement
of the XL acquisition. And there, we could see that the AXA share underperformed the CAC 40
index because the surprise effect and the uncertainty about the integration and on the transactions
that I mentioned before and the listing of AXA equitable and the transformation of our Life
portfolio in Switzerland, et cetera, were not clear as yet at the time in September.
Following the close of XL, we saw a change occurring. And in the third stage, which is far more at
the beginning of this year, we see the AXA share is stronger, is outperforming the CAC (inaudible)
, which over a year puts us in a position where we slightly outperform the CAC 40 index.
Being an insurer -- an insurance company entails being in the middle of society at large and helping
society in order to have a better life. Right from the beginning of AXA with Claude BÃ©bÃ©ar, it
was already a major trump card for us. And you noticed in 2018, we made further progress on this.
We took decisions in 3 areas. The first area was clearly fighting against climate change. You saw
the fact that we were moving out of the coal business. And the second major topic was about
health, including starting innovative services such as telemedicine. I mentioned before the
partnership, et cetera. And the third one was clearly our actions in order to improve the economic
inclusion and social cohesiveness.



FINAL

Each year, we can gauge also our performance. We take indices, which are recognized worldwide,
the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. And I'm quite proud to share with you that for the third year
consecutively, we are among the top 5%. I'll not say more because CÃ©line Soubranne, who is
taking care of our responsible company business, will speak to you later on and give you far more
details.
And the second topic, which we promoted in 2018, was our brand. AXA was in 2018 for the 10th
time the #1 brand worldwide in regard to insurance. We still said, "Look, we need to make further
progress and we want to invest." You saw at the very beginning of this general meeting, the new
film, the new campaign that will be launched in France shortly. Such a campaign is based on the
concept having confidence in oneself, no, you can. Clearly, it's a message towards our clients
because there is a lot of uncertainty in life. However, if you believe in yourself, you can make it. And
this is clearly also a message to AXA's employees that it is possible to transform, that it's possible
also to succeed in a market which is not easy.

Bloomberg Transcript

A second investment in regard to the brand is our partnership with the Liverpool Football Club. And
there, we see that the Liverpool Football Club and AXA are very much aligned in their life vision.
And certainly, for the brand awareness in Asia, this partnership is very important because there are
millions of fans in Asia, who are following Liverpool.
2018 was the year where we implemented strategic choices. We will continue in 2019 in the similar
vein. Implementing the major decisions is at the very heart of things and very much at the heart -the integration of XL is at the center of things. Today, we are on the right path of our 2020
Ambition and I'm very much confident that we will succeed and that we will reach the targets that
we set in 2016, which -- so that it means that we're continuing to far more develop and roll out
innovative services for us. It's a strategic matter, which is absolutely fundamental.
And I'm very happy. And it's my pleasure now to turn it over to Guillaume Borie, who is in charge of
innovation. He is the AXA Next Chief Executive and who will show you what we are doing in regard
to innovation and what does it involve in terms of benefits for our clients.
I thank you dear shareholders for your trust and for your attention. Thank you.

Guillaume Borie

{BIO 20415256 <GO>}

Good afternoon, to you all. And I'm very pleased to be with you this afternoon to share with you
about the group's efforts for innovation. What does innovation means for AXA? And how these
efforts will be accelerated, thanks to the strategic priorities of AXA Next, which is the entity that we
established at the beginning of this year 2019 in order to strengthen our efforts for creating new
services and developing new business models to be able to support our customers.
At the outset, AXA Next was built on the strategic conviction of the group that we have to
transform the AXA model from a claims payer to being a partner for our customers and to remain
relevant in supporting our customers in their protection needs. We need to develop new services
and establish a much more frequent interaction with our customers. And this will make it possible
for us to support you to be more effective, much closer to your needs in providing complementary
insurance services. The commitment to protection is the commitment taken by the AXA Group and
this is seen in insurance. But will be extended also through our efforts for deploying new services.
And at the heart of the objective of AXA Next is the intention and the determination to make our
customers' lives simpler. And the best way to talk about that is to talk about the 4 main priorities
that we have set in order to extend AXA's role and diversify its business models in order to
provide the best possible services to our customers. And we have these 4 ecosystems that will
help us to make it possible to offer new services and new activities to our customers with the
potential of providing daily support in all their protection needs.



FINAL

The first of these ecosystems is Health. All the health needs in the world in 2020 will represent
EUR 8,000 billion of revenues around the world. And this is an area where the insurance business
is only handling 15% of the needs. And so if we want to provide better support to our customers,
the major challenge for us is to be much more complete in our value proposition. And at the same
time, meet very specific needs.
And I would like to dwell a few minutes on this health sector. And I just take one fact, that all
countries in the world are experiencing, be they developed and emerging markets. And that is the
prevalence of chronic diseases. Today, 45% of the global population is at one moment or another
in their lifespan going to experience chronic disease. We are about 1,000 people in this room this
afternoon. That means 450 out of us here will at one moment or another during their lifetime
experience chronic disease. And apart from being properly covered from an insurance
perspective, the question is also how do you access the right doctors at the right moment and get
the right and best treatment and the proper follow-up and how can you progress in taking care of
that chronic disease.

Bloomberg Transcript

And for a chronic -- a person who is suffering a chronic disease, for example, someone from
diabetes, there is almost a daily follow-up that is required. And we can provide these support
services through telemedicine, through the care coordination pathways and also (priding) the very
best establishments for caring for these patients suffering from chronic disease. And this means
that we want to go beyond the mere provision of insurance cover. And the same diversification
effort will also be undertaken in the ecosystem of platforms, all the digital platforms. Thomas
Buberl was referring to this a moment ago.
In these digital platforms, we interact on a daily basis, buying and selling services. And this also
requires protection, protecting digital identity, protecting the projects that we bought, protecting
also repatriation when we've bought a trip abroad. And the challenge is to position these at the
right moment, in the right place and on demand. And this digital platform ecosystem is very wide.
EUR 3,500 billion expected in terms of turnover in 2020. And we can expand also our role there.
And the same efforts is going to be deployed in the ecosystem of mobility. How do we provide
better support for mobility? Coming on to the scene of vehicles that can handle automatic driving
procedures, the advent of new modes of travel and of exchanging and car sharing and other
things.
Then also in terms of our support for businesses for commercial companies, how can we provide
the best service to SMEs and how can we provide where -- just the mere provision of insurance,
which is necessary is not sufficient? As an example is cyber-attack risks. Today for an SME, the first
challenge is to know if there are any weaknesses in its IT systems. And if there is an attack, how
can the system be rebooted and how can we develop these services with new solutions?
And to develop all these new services and accelerate the diversification of AXA's business
models, we have brought together in AXA Next a number of units that since 2015 have been
dedicating efforts in to investing in start-ups, in providing new business incubators and creating
strategic partnerships for the benefit of all the groups' customers.
Since 2015, AXA Group has dedicated over EUR 1 billion of investment in order to put on the
market these new services and new propositions. And each of these entities has played a role in
the development of these new proposals such as our Kamet start-up incubator and also AXA
Venture Partners and our global entity for the industrialization of service propositions, AXA
Partners.
And this ecosystem is now really going full out for the objective to make available to the largest
number possible of our customers these new services in all the markets where we are present.
And this is at the heart of our priorities for the coming years, to industrialize these innovations. So
that we can better serve our existing customers. But also reach far more end customers of these
services.



FINAL

And in the last 3 minutes of my presentation, I would just like to say a couple of very practical
words concerning our 2 main priorities, which are health and platforms. In health care, Thomas
Buberl has said that we have an objective, which is to develop telemedicine. And for those of you
who live in France and which is probably the majority of those present in this room today, you can
already today, if it hasn't been already a case for you, is to use Care, our telemedicine service,
which gives you direct access through videoconference, to a consultation with a number of medical
specialties from general practitioner needs, right to dermatology and nutritionist and addict
support and other specialties.
Today, after just a few months having started up, we have over 130 consultations each day. And
our objective is to make available to all AXA France's customers this service in connection with the
teams of Jacques Peretti's AXA France teams. It is a service where customer satisfaction is very
close to 100%. More specifically, 98.5% of users say that they are extremely satisfied.
And there, we see clearly how thanks to these services, we can create value and customer
satisfaction with a much closer connection, more intimate, I would even say, connection in the daily
life of our customers. Another example of these health services is (My Visit SantÃ©), which is an
advisory platform for well-being in order to provide better support for our customers in their
efforts for nutrition and handling addiction and well-being at work.

Bloomberg Transcript

As for the platforms, the major part of our efforts is put on the provision of insurance on demand.
And in this context, we are in connection with the major digital players, find services that meet the
specific needs of the user. If you take the case of BlaBlaCar, it's one of these start-ups, which
today is worth over EUR 1 billion on the market, which is a French start-up and is a car sharing
system. And its needs are very different to those of classic insurance business.
And so with BlaBlaCar, we've developed a new assistance system that covers the driver, their
liability for passengers who they very often don't even know and passengers and also makes it
possible in terms of assistance in case of a breakdown to make sure that we can pick up the
passengers where the breakdown has happened and each one is then taken to their initial starting
point, whereas in car sharing, everyone is going to a different destination. And this solution in 2018
provided 10 million journeys in France and its over 1 million users who have benefited on a daily
basis from AXA's services for these new mobility modes.
So you see that all our efforts are going towards more intensive use of services and insurance
cover. It is something that we always, by definition, hope never to have to need because it implies
that something unpleasant has happened in your life. Well by transforming our role to that of a
partner, we want to be present with you on a daily basis on the good days and the bad days. And
this is how we believe we can accelerate AXA's services and make available our protection
services for the largest number of people.
Thank you for your attention.

Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Thank you, Guillaume Borie. And I'll hand over now to CÃ©line Soubranne, in charge of AXA's
Corporate Social Responsibility, who will give us a presentation on how AXA is working as a
responsible leader.

CÃ©line Soubranne
Good afternoon, to you all. You must be asking yourself what does the actual title of this
presentation mean, working as a responsible leader. For a company such as AXA today, working as
a responsible company means taking into account the most demanding expectations of our
customers. But also answering the concerns of society in general, be those social or environmental
concerns. It means otherwise acting as a citizen company.



FINAL

And our first role as such a company is intrinsically related to our insurers' business, which is to
protect and preserve our common heritage and that's why, for many years now, AXA is a partner
and sponsor providing services globally for art centers such as the Louvre Museum or the
Pompidou Centre. And we will also be establishing a partnership with the MusÃ©e -- the d'Orsay
Museum of impressionist art and also the ChÃ¢teau in Versailles. And of course, more recently, we
were all very moved by the fire that has hit Notre-Dame Cathedral. And here, we have also already
mobilized EUR 10 million to contribute to the rebuilding. Thank you, thank you for your applause.
We're very pleased to be able to take part in this project.
Now this role of being a sponsor for our common heritage also includes all the strategic
dimensions of our activities. And it's a key moment in terms of the impact for the purchasing
intentions of our customers and also in terms of investor choices. Thomas mentioned a moment
ago, the DJSI, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index ranking, which each year assesses our
performance as a responsible company and covers all the aspects of our company, which goes
from HR to sustainable management of our sites and also our investments and how we handle our
suppliers. Don't worry, I won't be going into detail of all those actions. But I would just like to focus
on the 3 major commitments that we have taken and that Thomas was referring to a moment ago:
climate change, health and protection and social inequalities and inclusion.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now for climate change, you know we've been a pioneer in the finance sector by pulling out of
coal industry since 2015, the COP21, we took this commitment even further, when in 2017 we
pulled out as an insurer from these businesses and we extended that also to energy coming from
bituminous sands. And we have applied all this policy to our new vision AXA XL.
You need to know that as an investor these last three years have led us to pull out EUR 4.5 billion
of investment in energy. And at the same time, we decided to develop and invest in the energy
transition and developing our investments for green infrastructures, in renewable energy and a
very ambitious objective that we have set for ourselves of EUR 12 billion worth of investment by
2020. And so already next year.
Now today, we have many players in the finance sector who have chosen to contribute this to
fighting climate change. But you need to bear in mind that 15% today of the major bank insurance
businesses are committed to this. And we hope to be increasingly numerous because it is only
thanks to the investment of all that we will truly contribute to reaching the objectives for limiting the
global warming by -- 2 degrees as established by the Paris Agreements.
The second aspect in terms of prevention and commitment to health care. And here too is a major
player in global health insurance. We have taken one of the major issues today, which is tobacco.
Tobacco is still today the #1 cause of avoidable deaths around the world. 8 million people die every
year and whether it's in industrialized countries, even though the tendency to consume tobacco is
tending to reduce. But it is hitting emerging countries even more.
And here, AXA was the first to divest our business in terms of covering the insurance of the
tobacco industry. And this was efficiently not new stats. The General Assembly of the United
Nations last year in launching a very bold and daring approach, taken at the General Assembly
together with World Health Organization, putting out a call that all investors should free up their
financial investment from investments in tobacco. And today, 550 people -- companies have
signed this collective movement.
And the last major commitment that we've taken to be responsible is fighting inequalities and our
action in favor of social inclusion. We need to know that even though the general standard of living
is on a general rule increasing around the world, at the same time inequalities have increased over
the last 30 years between the richest and the poorest sections of population. And this widening of
the quality gap concerns all regions, be it the Americas, Africa, Asia, Latin America, even Europe.
And -- even though it is compensated somewhat by our national social security systems. But here
as a responsible company, we want to move only 2 level. First of all, providing direct support to the



FINAL

most disadvantaged. But also making insurance more accessible. And in this case, that last
December, we joined the collective group of -- as 19 major French companies such as Danone,
Adecco and working for great economic inclusion. And AXA France, in particular, has decided to
offer 1,000 single-parent families in provision for covering the education of their children. And we
also have a program in Italy and in France too for providing support to women, who are the victims
of violence. And we're providing legal and emotional counseling and support.
Precariousness does create problems in terms of access to health care for the most vulnerable
population, which makes their situation even more fragile. And that's why that AXA Morocco has
established wonderful initiative of the health care caravan, providing health care systems in the
rural areas of the country. And since the beginning, 6,000 free consultations have been provided.
In India, we're establishing a public-private partnership with local states to provide the minimum
health care protection for the population living below the poverty threshold. And we're also
working on various ranges of product to make them more inclusive to vulnerable population
groups, working on guarantee levels at marginal cost.
This is the case. As you can see here, we have a micro insurance system for micro entrepreneurs in
France, in New Mexico; micro insurers for the communities that are exposed to natural disasters.

Bloomberg Transcript

And generally speaking, last year, at the same general meeting, you had -- the presentation of my
colleague, (inaudible) who talked about inclusive systems that we're developing in micro insurance
in the emerging countries. And this seems to be possible to touch some 10 million customers.
Now these major commitments of climate change and health care and protection and social
inequality are also carried by our staff with some 30,000 volunteers in their business. But also
because they give of their time and their skills in our voluntary program, Hearts In Action. And this
makes it possible to provide tremendous support.
(presentation)
In 2018, it's over 30,000 voluntary employees who volunteered for this service. It really is a key
element of our company that we're very proud of. And I have been very proud and happy to share
this with you this afternoon. Thank you.

Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Well thank you to CÃ©line Soubranne for this great presentation. I'll ask (GÃ©rald Harlin) now to
introduce the performance of the company in 2018. But before that, we will look at a video
covering the highlights of the past year.
(presentation)

GÃ©rald Harlin
Ladies and gentlemen. Good afternoon. It's my pleasure to present you the results and the
financial solidity of our group and your group.
Starting with growth in 2018, growth was dynamic and profitable and driven by our 3 target
segments. And you can see that we have a sharp growth in Commercial P&C plus 5%, Protection
plus 3%, health reaching plus 7%. Such growth did not come at the cost of our profitability. On the
contrary, the combined ratios in Protection and in Health are improving. The same with P&C
excluding AXA XL. So good growth related to our 3 business lines, which are our priorities.



FINAL

Let's take a look now at the underlying earnings. In 2018, we had a very good growth of our
underlying earnings across the group. Starting with France, see that the underlying earnings
increased by 10% in Europe, plus 10% in Asia, up 5% in the U.S., plus 4% international and
transverse lines plus 24%. AXA XL shows a loss of EUR 0.2% -- billion due to nat cats.
So let's get an update on AXA XL's results. We consolidate XL and have been doing so only since
October 1, 2018. The 2018 result for AXA XL, therefore, is made up of their results of the last
quarter for XL and the annual results for AXA Corporate Solutions and AXA ART.
Let's take a look now at the graph, which is in the middle of the slide. And that graph explains why
we are showing a loss of EUR 0.2 billion for AXA XL, from the left to the right. Normally in the
Fourth Quarter, the contribution of XL to the results based on a level of normalized nat cat should
have been EUR 0.2 billion. In the Fourth Quarter of 2018, we suffered the Michael Hurricane and the
Californian fires, which represents 0.5% -- rather EUR 0.5 billion. All in all, in the Fourth Quarter, the
XL reported result is minus EUR 0.4 billion. Add to this, the contribution over the year in 2018 of
AXA Corporate solutions and of AXA ART that's EUR 0.1 billion all in all that represents a loss of
EUR 0.2 billion for AXA XL.

Bloomberg Transcript

Nevertheless, as you can see, we benefited from a very strong growth of our operations plus 10%
and the market conditions improved. They improved in 2018 with higher rates or prices on average
by 4% and the renewal in January 2019 are good with plus 4% price hikes. So take away that AXA
XL was hit by an unusual level of natural disasters in 2018. However, we do confirm our goal for
underlying earnings for AXA XL for 2020 and that goal is an up underlying earnings of EUR 1.4
billion with a normalized level of natural disasters at 4% of gross premiums. Therefore, we are
confident about that goal, thanks mainly to the synergies that we foresee.
Let's now take a look at the performance of France. Underlying earnings, as I said before, where
we had a solid result and the key targets were achieved. As far as we're concerned, underlying
earnings sharply up, plus 10%, as I said before. That very high operating result comes through a
dynamic growth in Health, in Protection. So plus 12% Health, plus 5% Protection, plus 3% rise in
corporate Commercial P&C. And our combined ratios were better. We make more technical
profits. And as you see, all the combined ratios are down.
Likewise, you see rate at 39%, which is the Unit-Linked one. We can show that Unit-Linked rate
remains about 10 points higher to the one of the French market. Therefore, the level of Unit-Linked
accounts remains at the very high level and outperforms the markets.
Therefore, it was a good year or even a very good year for AXA France.
The group result for 2018 now. The underlying earnings is at a all-time high, with EUR 6.182 billion,
the -- now, we are up by 6%. Now the adjusted earnings are up by 3%. The difference with a
growth of the underlying earnings is due to lower financial markets at the end of 2018. Now the net
result is EUR 2.140 billion. And the difference between the adjusted result and the net result is due
to 2 elements. Mainly, first of all, depreciation of AXA Equitable of -- and secondly, as you
mentioned -- as mentioned before is the impact of exceptionals. And mainly, we stopped our -the business in of savings and life in Switzerland. These 2 elements that I mentioned are
exceptional and they're nonrecurring by definition and they're related to the transformation of a
company, which moves from mainly life-based company to one that will be based mainly on P&C.
Let's now take a look at the balance sheet. The 2 main indicators are the equity and solvency ratio.
Now the equity are at EUR 62.4 billion. The decrease compared to last year can be accounted for
lower shares and realized capital gains at the end of 2018 when we saw lower financial markets. It's
also an uptick of interest rates and expenses and the rates actually of the bonds. So a good part of
that down drop was we caught this up. Thanks to the excellent performance of the markets in
certain of the solvency rate at 193% is at a very good level. And the financial ratings, here, you see



FINAL

that we're equivalent AA-, stable with the 3 major agencies, very solid. We're proud of having
found again the ratings before the acquisition of XL. And this confirms as a matter of fact the
confidence of the ratings agencies in terms of our transformation.
What about now? Where do we stand with regard to our 2020 Ambition plan? As you can see here
on the slide, we are on the right path to reach the goals that are in the Ambition 2020 program.
First of all, with the per share underlying earnings up by 3%. And on average, that is between 2015
and 2018, It's so an increase of more than 5% per year, which is quite in line with our 3% to 7% goal
over the plan between 2015 and 2020.
Now let's take a look at the free operating cash flow, which was at EUR 6.6 billion. So a higher level
in 2018. So that we ought to be rather in the upper range of EUR 28 billion to EUR 32 billion, which
is forecasted between 2015 and 2020 in aggregate terms.
Now the current ROE is at 14.4%. And in November last year, remember, during our Investors Day,
we ramped up that profitability -- return on -- the ROE, we moved it -- it was around 12%, we
moved it up between 14% to 16%, which is a good sign.

Bloomberg Transcript

The solvency ratio is at 193%, in line -- quite in line with our target between 170% and 220%. And
there, again, it was reconsidered in November and that was -- the range was then between 170%
and 230%. So these very good results, these very good indicators translate into higher dividend.
We're suggesting a dividend up by 6% at EUR 1.34. On the right-hand side, you can see the payout
rate is at 52%. And remember, before the payout rate was between 45% and 55% of the adjusted
earnings. We have moved up that range, it's now between 50% and 60%. So with a dividend at
EUR 1.34, we can say that our share is -- gives one of the most attractive returns in the market.
Now to conclude. For AXA, 2018 can be summed up with 4 major highlights. First of all, the
speeding up of our growth. It was driven by our target segments. Secondly, the underlying
earnings is at an all-time high. We are on the right path in order to fulfill the goals of our 2020
Ambition plan. And finally, a new rise in the dividend.
Thank you for your attention.

shareholder relations system.
(presentation)
Thank you, dear shareholders for your loyalty to AXA. Before I give the floor to Jean-Martin Folz,
who will present the governance of the company and the remuneration policy of its leaders. I
would like to indicate that Jean-Martin Folz, Director for our company for 12 years had decided not
to request a renewal of his term of office. He will leave the Board at the close of this meeting.
I would like on behalf of the AXA Board to thank him very warming for his contribution to the work
of the Supervisory Board and then of the Board of Directors for the past 12 years. His experience,
his strategic vision and his contribution as a Chairman of the Remuneration Governance

I now give him the floor.

FINAL

Ladies and gentlemen, dear shareholders. As a Senior Independent Director, I'd like to share with
you how the AXA governance operated in 2018 and the remuneration policy of its leaders.
First of all, governance. You can see, displayed on the screen, the current makeup of the Board of
Directors of your company. The Board includes 16 members, 8 women, 8 men and 8 nationalities.
The percentage of women at the Board is today at 50% and will subject to the approval of the
resolution proposed to 53% following this meeting.
In addition, always subject to your approval, at the end of this meeting, the Board will be made up
of nearly 50% of members who are of foreign-origin. Such diversity combined with a variety of
different roles and work promotes a depth in quality of our discussions at the Board.
Among the criteria defined during the selection process of the members of the Board, you can
see, they're looking for an appropriate balance between technical skills and professional
experience as well as diversity in terms of age, nationality and culture.

Bloomberg Transcript

Lastly, every year, the Board tries to assess the situation of independence of each one of its
members in light of the Afep-Medef Code recommendations. Early 2019, the Board considered 10
of its members out of 16 as being independent.
Now on the screen, you can see a summary of the way the Board operates. As you know, it's -behooves the Board to take the most important decisions, mainly to decide the split or not of the
roles of a Chairman of the Board and of the Chief Executive and appoint the General Management
Board, also benefits from the work of its 3 committees, which prepare such decisions through
recommendations.
Lastly, as a Senior Independent Director, I make sure that independent directors can actually play
the major role, which is there in practice. I'm involved in the preparation of each Board meeting,
together with the Chairman and the Chief Executive, we look together at the timetable of the
meetings, the agendas and the documents sent to the members of the Board.
Following our general meeting and subject to your approval for the renewal of the term of office,
Jean-Pierre Clamadieu will be the Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the Remuneration
and Governance Committee. Jean-Pierre Clamadieu has been a Director of our company since
2012 and a member of the Governance and Remuneration Committee since 2015. The Board
decided to appoint him to succeed me given his experience, his knowledge of the group and his
strong commitment in the work of the Board.
Concerning now the Board's work, 2018 saw a sustained activity. We met 12 times with 97% on
average attending the 3 Board committees. All in all held 19 meetings in 2018 also with an average
attendance rate at 97%. The main topics that the Board had to handle in the past year are the
following ones: the group strategy, of course; reviewing the acquisition project of XL and its
integration into AXA; the listing of U.S. life and asset management business; the major disposals
and acquisitions that are important; looking at the annual and half-year accounts of policy of this
payout of dividends; and also the ORSA, the internal evaluation of risks and solvency; and also the
various policies written as part of Solvency II; and finally, composition of the Board and its
committees.
As is the case each year, the Board of Directors also assessed its own way of operating. In 2018,
that exercise was led by an external consultant who collated the contribution of each director as
well as the assessments and suggestions on the work and operation of the Board. He took into
account the opinion of each director on the participation and contribution of each one of the other



members of the Board. The Chairman of the Board communicated to each director during
individual interviews, the conclusions related to their personal contribution.

FINAL

In my case, I shared with the Chairman the conclusions relative to his own contribution. The overall
conclusions of that self-assessment and the main identified access of progress were reviewed in
detail by the Remuneration and Governance Committee, which -- and they issued
recommendation examined and approved by your Board last December.
At that -- during that opportunity, directors underlined that the quality of operation of the Board
had improved and had remained at high level according to the opinions. Thanks to the maturity of
its processes as well as due to the effectiveness and smoothness of the relationship between the
Chairman and the Chief Executive.

Bloomberg Transcript

The main points of improvement identified during that examination were the following ones: first
of all, the need to provide special attention to the selection of the future directors in order to offer
the appointment of people who have predefined skills in the field of insurance, finance, the digital
technologies, human resources or again marketing. We're also underlying the need to cut down
the number of directors sitting at the Board as well as the importance of maintaining the common
role of a Senior Independent Director and the Chairman of the Remuneration and Governance
Committee. These 2 roles being intimately intertwined. Finally, the directors indicated their wish to
continue and develop the study sending by the Chief Executive information notes related to the
sector of the insurance and to public announcements made by the company.
With regard to the vote that will take place later on, we will ask you to renew the mandate of JeanPierre Clamadieu. Take a look at his track record. He will -- following this, he will be the Senior
Independent Director and the Chairman of the Remuneration and Governance Committee for the
term of his office.
During the vote, we will ask you also to ratify the (co-opt date) of Elaine Sarsynski as a Director. Her
resume, you can see now on the screen. Co-opting also Elaine -- the cooption of Elaine Sarsynski
was decided by the Board meeting on the 24th of May 2018, replacing Deanna Oppenheimer, who
wished to put an end to her role due to new responsibilities.
Lastly, in pursuant to legal provisions, 2 directors representing our employees have joined our
Board in 2018. Martine BiÃ¨vre, who is an inspector in charge of claims since 2018 and was
appointed by the French Group on the 13th of June 2018. And Bettina Cramm, who works at AXA
Konzern AG, German subsidiary was appointed by the European Works Council on the 20th of
June 2018.
Subject to the approval of the resolutions that I have just present given the nonrenewal of my term
of office, the size of the Board will be reduced from 16 down to 15 members at the close of this
meeting. Following the presentation of the operation of AXA's governance 2018, we'd like to
report now about the remuneration policy of its top managers. In line with the legal provisions, you
are to decide on the elements of the remuneration allocated in 2018 to each Corporate Executive
Director as well as the remuneration policy applicable to the -- for 2019. Four resolutions will be
submitted to your vote, 2 regarding the ex-posts of the Chairman of the Board and the Chief
Executive and 2 resolutions regarding their ex-anti-remuneration for 2019.
In this context, you will find summarized on the screen, the various components of the
remuneration of the top leaders at AXA. The cash remuneration in short term is made up of the
fixed salary and part of the annual variable remuneration come after that so-called deferred
remuneration elements made up of the other part of the annual variable remuneration as well as
their options and performance shares. This remuneration structure aims at promoting the
conventions of the interest of management with those of the company and the shareholders of
the medium and long term.



FINAL

In the preparation of these proposals made to the Board regarding the remuneration of the Chief
Executive, the Remuneration and Governance Committee assesses all the elements of that
remuneration. It reviews also, of course the market -- the benchmark market remuneration practice
made up of compared with companies to AXA on a European and global basis with the aim of
proposing a consistent structure and levels that are competitive, encourage performance and
aligned a level of the remuneration really obtained with the results of the company. The
Remuneration Committee reviews on a regular basis the overall principles of the policy of the
remuneration and make sure that there's internal fairness and taking in the right way account the
individual performance and the collective performance.
So the Board on proposal of its Remuneration Committee has decided to set the annual target
remuneration of the Chief Executive at EUR 2.900 million. This will come -- will made up of a fixed
remuneration and a variable one. The fixed one is EUR 1.450 million per year. And the other one,
which is due to demanding performance elements is also EUR 1.450 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, the determination of the full remuneration of the Chief Executive is based mainly on a study
carried out by an external Board relative to remuneration policy for similar roles in a sampling of
international companies in the financial sector.
In addition, in order to involve the Chief Executive in the creation of value over the long term, each
year, the Board grants it long-term incentives in the form of options and performance shares.
These LTIs are fully subject to demanding performance, conditions internal and external and do
not guarantee a minimum gain. These LTIs are major share of the remuneration of Chief Executive.
So the value of the LTIs, which is allocated is determined in order to position the overall
remuneration in securities and cash between the median and the third quartile of the market
benchmark. Besides the Chief Executive does not benefit from any top of so-called retirement
regime. It is benefiting from the same elements that benefit management executives of AXA
France. And also, all of this is based on performance obtained each year.
Finally, the Chief Executive has compensation if his role is terminated subject to performance
conditions. First of all, it is set at 12 months. It's equated with 12-month, it can be increased by 1
additional month. It can never exceed 24-month. And by the target remuneration in cash of the
Chief Executive has been unchanged since he was appointed in 2016 and will remain the same in
2019. The Board of Directors also determines the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board.
In line with a recommendation of the Afep-Medef Code, the Board felt that the structure of
remuneration which is best consist in paying to the Chair of the Board only a fixed remuneration. In
order to determine the amount of that remuneration, the Board took into account the extensive
missions. They decided to allocate to Denis Duverne as President and talk to an external
consultant.
In addition, the Board took into consideration the fact that Denis Duverne, who decided to retire -I mean, mature that he would decided to give up an additional annuity, which represents on an
annual basis about EUR 750,000, he decided to benefit from it only at the end of his term as a
Board. And the Board of Directors have decided to set the amount of this annual remuneration at
EUR 1.200 million. This has remained unchanged since his appointment in 2016 and will remain
identical in 2019.
Let's now look at the variable remuneration attributed in 2018 to the Chief Executive. The
assessment of the annual performance of the Chief Executive is based on 2 components, the
performance of the group on the one hand and its individual performance. The group's
performance is assessed based on the changes with 3 criteria: the per share underlying earnings,
the current profitability of equity, the revenues in priority strategies, P&C for corporations and
protection health and then the Net Promoter Score.



Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

The indicators are directly linked to the group's strategic orientations based on reaching a target
score, which is previously set. Early 2018, the Board had decided to assess the performance of the
Board for the current period by neutralizing the impact of 2 operations. On the one hand,
operations in capital achieved in 2018, including the listing of the AXA Equitable Holdings in the U.S.
and the acquisition of the XL Group; and finally, the buyback of shares in excess of the volumes
required to make sure we have no dilutive effect coming from the attribution of performance
shares to employees of the group.
However, given the very high score of the group's performance neutralized from the elements
mentioned before, that is 137% performance. The Board upon proposal of its Remuneration
Governance Committee finally decided to take also into account the performance of the group,
including the 2 pre-mentioned operations that is the listing of AXA Equitable Holdings and the
acquisition of the XL Group leading to a score of 89% and to retain the average of the group's
performance scores with and without neutralization. So the performance of the group was set at
113%.
With regard to the individual performance, it is assessed based on specific goals reviewed each
year. Different indicators and goals in terms of quality and quantity are fixed by the Board in the
letters that reached before the period where we measure the performance. The Board has set
the individual performance of Thomas Buberl based on 5 major goals set in the -- in that letter. The
listing of the AXA Equitable Holdings in U.S. and redeploying the equity about 20%, continuing the
2020 Ambition plan goals and the group's growth strategy at 35%, the speeding up of the
innovation strategy representing 20%, reinforcing the group's talent pools and also the personal
development for top executives at 15%, finally reinforcing internal control in terms of IT, security
representing 10%, individual performance of the Chief Executive for 2018 is assessed at -- by the
Board at 105% of the actual variable remuneration 2018 paid to the Chief Executive subject to your
approval will amount to EUR 1,725,500 or 119% of his target variable remuneration.
The Board decided to renew for the Chief Executive a deferred payment mechanism of in part
equal to 30% of the variable remuneration over a period of two years. The amount actually paid
could depend -- retains depending on the stock market and with a limit of a floor of at 80% and
over cap at 120% introduction of this deferred part within the variable remuneration even though
not required by the applicable French regulation is designed to reinforce the alignment of AXA
with the regulatory and regulations practices that are on the international level.
AXA is also allocating options and performance shares to its employees in France and
internationally. These allocations without any discount takes place each year at the same period.
The total amount of options allocated to the members of the Management Committee are
submitted to performance conditions and be -- can be only vested only if the performance of the
AXA Group exceeds the ones of the stock market, which acts as a benchmark. The Board also
decided that as from the allocation of options done in 2017, the vesting of options will be stopped
if we have a negative net income for the group as long as that result remains that way.
Yes. All those benefiting from this in the hierarchy received performance shares in full, 100% of the
value. And these bear on the group performance, 40%. And the -- this is the net earnings per
share. And also, the performance of the entity to which the beneficiary belongs for 50%. And lastly,
10% for the group performance in terms of corporate social responsibility. And this last criterion is
based on the CSR reference index, which is the Dow Jones Sustainable Index, which accounts for
10% of the overall performance.
And lastly, in line with the best practices in the industry and with the recommendations of the
regulators, the performance shares associated with an acquisition period of minimum duration of
three years with the -- as for the members of the management committee and these will be
mandatorily consent for two years and stock options are also exercised by 1/3 from the third,
fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of attribution. And the objective here is to search for the
measurement of the performance conditioning the final acquisition of the shares for a period



FINAL

equal to three years. And all these compensation elements for the AXA managements are
reviewed in the reference document of our 2018 for AXA. And you are free to consult them if you
wish to have more information.
On slide now you have the account of the attribution of the stock option performance shares
between 2011 and 2018. Since the beginning of 2012, the decision was taken to limit the attribution
of options to only these senior executives of the group. And this explains the reduction in the
number of beneficiaries. Accounting for -- beginning in 2019, only the members of the
management committee will see stock options.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you will see this in 2018, over 7,300 employees of the group received performance shares.
Next June, the Board will proceed to a new allocation of options and performance shares. I'll add
that since 2016, all the executive managements of AXA Group France, some 500 people benefit
from performance shares dedicated to their pension. These fully submitted to performance
conditions and fulfilled during the year. And next December, the Board of Directors will proceed
with a new allocation of performance shares for pension purposes. And I emphasize here that
these occasionally represented 0.24% of the company's equity and without any dilutive effect for
the shareholders.
Lastly, a few words about group policy in terms of employee shareholding. And AXA has
undertaken a very voluntary action in terms of employee shareholding. And each year, the group
offers to its employees in France and internationally an employee shareholding plan called
Shareplan, with the form of a capital increase, which is reserved for them. In 2018, over 24,000
employees in 36 countries took part in this operation for a total underwriting of some EUR 330
million corresponding to the issuance of some 15 million new shares. And in order to eliminate the
dilutive effect of the Shareplan offering, the decision has been taken, as in previous years, to
redeem and then cancel a number -- equivalent number of shares. Now on 31st of December
2018, group employees and officers held 5.2% of the capital and 6.4% of the voting rights of the
company.
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes my presentation. But before I leave this platform, I would like
to say that it has been for me an honor to be, for the past 12 years, a member of the Board of the
company and support AXA in its transformation. And dear shareholders to whom I owe my
presence here to thank you and to all my colleagues of the Board and the executives of the
company to whom I wish all the very best for the future.

it for you something already in the past? Or is it too complicated for you to be able to discuss it
today?

Well I'll ask Thomas to answer the question. But I do want to pay tribute to Dominique Senequier,
who is the former Chairman of AXA Hearts in Action.

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. Thank you for this question. Concerning Brexit, it's true that we didn't refer to the
topic today. But that doesn't mean that we are not concerned by it. two years ago, we began to
prepare for Brexit. We've always worked with a scenario of a hard Brexit because we still don't
know today what actually is going to be happening. For Brexit, we have 2 dimensions at AXA. The
first is local operations. We have already strong presence in the U.K. in the health care sector and in
commercial, P&C insurance and investment managers. Now these operations remain local. And we
hope that there will not be a lot of negative impact from Brexit among our customers. Concerning
our international business, we have plans placed on a hard Brexit scenario for each of our entities
to distinguish clearly between what is local and what is international. And today, we are prepared
for the worst case scenarios even though we hope that those scenarios for which we have
prepared will actually not happen.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Chairman. Good afternoon. Three quick questions. First of all, the possible payment of dividends
and shares. The second question concern possible bonuses of those dividends either by an
increase of 10% that is done -- being done by one of your colleagues on the CAC 40 or free of -free share issues of 1 for 10 as another of your competitors on the CAC 40 are doing. But they
would seem that the fire of Notre-Dame had an impact on AXA because of your coverage of
certain artists. Do you already know what those damages are?

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Thank you for your questions. Well the question of dividends in payment in shares was being
regularly asked. The Board has not wished to go in that direction because we consider that our
solvencies is satisfactory. And our shareholder -- as the shareholding structure of AXA is very
international, our shareholders prefer a dividend in cash and rather than having diluted by extra
shares. And because of this very international shareholding structure, the (votes) on dividends is
not taken as a decision chosen by the Board. Concerning the Notre-Dame fire, I'll hand over to
Jacques de Peretti.

Thank you. Of course, we are not insurers of the Notre-Dame Cathedral because you know, it is a
state property. And the state is its own insurer. We do have a number of contracts at play, in
particular, 2 contracts concerning the personal responsibility of those intervening which is very
modest. Nothing into the cost of burning the cathedral. And we do indeed have a very modest
contract, just a couple of million euros concerning works of art, that could have been in the
cathedral and might have burned, knowing that from all the information we have received. The
major works of art have fortunately all been saved.

Thank you. Number one?

Q - Unidentified Participant
(Claude Aroche). Two questions. The first is on medical teleconsultations. And the second on selfdriving vehicles. AXA is the #1 private player launching medical teleconsultations in France. As Mr.
Borie reminded us in his presentation, these formulas launched in France have been extremely
successful with a very high level of satisfaction. However, the medical teleconsultation services
have until present only be over to AXA's customers and its affiliates. But due intend to open them
out to any customers? Both AXA customers and noncustomers as already is the case of Doctolib,
which has been (raised) of EUR 1 billion of capitalization.
This brings me to self-driving vehicles, which represent huge opportunities for society and the
environment. But which has new types of risks, less frequent. Accidents will nevertheless have a
stronger impact and rising the individual cost of a claim and exacerbation of the cyber risk and the
search for responsibilities and so on and so forth.
Hence, my question, how are you adapting or how are you reinventing your car insurance models
in the presence of this extraordinary revolution? Thank you.

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Thomas, would you like to answer?

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}



FINAL

Yes. Thank you for these 2 questions. For the first question, teleconsultation, you have seen that
we've looked at things in stages. And as I mentioned in my presentation, we have today 2
operations. One, which is based on the AXA Partners' operations, which indeed serve AXA
France's customers. Then we have a second operation called Care, which is the start up within our
Kamet incubator, which is already serving third-party customers. And clearly, our objective after the
first stages that we have taken and given the very high level of satisfaction explained by Mr. Borie.
We want to expand the scope of these teleconsultations go to people who are not customers of
AXA. Our model nevertheless is different from that of Doctolib in as much as we either have our
own doctors under AXA Partners or we have very high level experts in the case of Care. And we
would like to keep that model of our own physicians who are 50% dedicated to teleconsultation
and 50% in their own practice in order to always be able to meet demand.

Bloomberg Transcript

Concerning self-driving vehicles, clearly, this is going to change the car insurance business. And I
must say, it has already changed our business because the phenomenon that you've described is
absolutely spot on. We're seeing reduction of the frequency of accidents. But an increase in the
major accidents because we're already in level of autonomy between a level of 2 and 3 out of a
maximum of 5 on the scale of 5. And that's the reason why we believe that the acquisition of XL is
the right position for us to be a leader in innovation in terms of self-driving vehicles. Because
what's happening today? Today, you have private civil liability. But with self-driving vehicles, this will
be much more transferred to a manufacturer's civil liability. In other words, it becomes a
commercial line risk. And secondly, if we have vehicles that are far more shared, it's much more a
fleet risk, which again is a commercial risk. And consequently, with association between AXA and
XL, we have this opportunity to take these opportunities and get the best potential out of these
self-driving vehicles.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Yes. Good afternoon. (Philippe Solange). And just a short question just to bring a smile to our rather
sleepy audience. Do we have any interest in Asia, in particularly in Japan? And is Mr. Thomas Buberl
going to go to Japan soon? And I'm just thinking of his safety there.

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Yes, clearly, we do have business in Japan in several sectors. We are a major player in health care
sector. We are a major player also in terms of protection. And we also have a part in direct
insurance for cars. So much for insurance. And in terms of asset management, we also have an
AXA Investment Manager activity and through Equitable also an activity of AllianceBernstein, which
are both growing well. Now for us, the Japanese market is exceedingly important. And despite the
fact that other French managers have had recently bad experience in Japan, I will continue to go
there because I do believe in the potential of this market. And we are clearly a reputable player
there. And I do expect to come back here for the general meeting next year.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Mr. Chairman, I have a suggestion and a question. My suggestion is, we've been given bags at the
entrance, very practical. But then I understand that our international company does have an English
slogan. But I'm very surprised that there isn't a French translation. And my suggestion therefore is
to ask your legal department to revise its understanding of the Toubon Law on the use of French
language in France. My question is the following. You're attacking tobacco. But when you're going
to attack alcohol, drinking, which is also a significant factor contributing to fatalities on the roads?



FINAL

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Your second question is complicated because tobacco is clearly a very important topic for us
because the first cigarette is harmful. It's been shown and 7 million people die every year. This was
explained earlier. And the question of alcoholic drinks, it's different because moderate
consumption is not harmful. And even some say -- some physicians say that a moderate
consumption is on the contrary beneficial. And so therefore is not a reason for exclusion of
investment. We have quite a lot of areas of investments which are excluded. But it doesn't seem
too favorable to take it any further in terms of health care to the alcohol question.
Question number 2?

Q - Unidentified Participant
Good evening. You've talked about AXA's development potential in the health care and protection

Indeed, thank you for reminding us that we do have a bank entity called AXA Bank. And this entity
has been developing on a regular basis in terms of increasing number of customers. And today, it
has 600,000 customers. The number of AXA active customers is increasing by some 20% to 30%
a year. And for us, it still is a fundamental asset in the establishment of our networks. In other
words, we believe that once we have reached a level of augmented branch office through
digitalization and artificial intelligence and systematic issue of data, we will have increased the
bandwidth of our network of general agents and we'll be able to go much further in disseminating
the bank through that network because we can say that today that barely 1/3 of our general agents
are active distributors of this bank, which is a purely digital bank.

Number four?

Q - Lucie Pinson
Lucie Pinson, Friends of the Earth. I have 3 questions. In terms of your management of climate risks.
The first is that in line with the imperative of carbon neutrality by 2050 and exiting from fossil
energies, you're strengthening your policies of exclusion from coal. This is very favorable. But we
are lacking visibility and we'd like to see this small visible as, in particular, with the adoption of a
commitment to completely pull out of fossil energies to be aligned with the cumulative climatic
objective of reduction by 2015, which would make it possible for you to increase your effectiveness
with your stakeholder. So my first question is, can you take that commitment this year as Allianz and
ING have done?
My second question bares on your investments in companies that are continuing to develop new
coal-fired plants, you have on several occasions talked against the development of coal. But
unfortunately, your current policies still allow you to invest in companies that are envisaging as
much coal-fired plants as those in India and Indian subcontinent, South Africa together. So that's a
6x the consumption of the France production. Now do you intend to pull out of those companies?
My third question, which is more worrying bares on your investments for third parties because in
2017 AXA took the commitment to apply its 2015 policy to assets managed by 2017. But in 2018,
AXA IM invested EUR 33 million in companies, which were supposedly excluded, of which EUR 21



million in RWE, which is not only the largest polluter in the European Union. But also the #1 producer
of lignite in the world. So my question is, can you apply your policy to third-party assets?

FINAL

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Thank you for your questions. And thank you, first for having acknowledged already the efforts that
we are undertaking to take into account climate risks in our investment policies. As you know you
remind us in 2015. And (inaudible) mentioned it too and also Thomas Buberl mentioned it too. In
2015, AXA was one of the first institution investors to pull out of coal investment just before
COP21. With the acquisition of XL, we are now committed to extending the -- our policy in
insurance, including AXA's -- XL's activities based on these criteria because at the outset, we
excluded companies producing energy based on coal by 50%. And we followed the indication of
NGOs to reduce that to 30%, which was in line with your recommendations.

Bloomberg Transcript

But going as far as eliminating all fossil energies doesn't seem to us to be realistic today to
eliminate fossil energies because the world would be incapable of operating eliminating all fossil
energies. And so we've been vigilant. And we will maintain our pioneering position in excluding
investment in insurance in fossil energies with coal and bituminous shale. But pulling out completely
is, we feel, taking things too far too quickly.
And regarding your second question, we do indeed have a minimal threshold of 3 gigawatts for
our investments. And we will be looking in depth whether this threshold needs to be changed. And
also, we do take -- we will take your question into account and examine it. And your third question,
investments for -- on behalf of third parties. You said AXA IM has extended the group's coal -- 50%
gold policy for its third-party contracts as well and will be applying this with the 30% threshold by
the end of 2019 and this should provide an answer to your third question. Thank you for your
questions. Number 7.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Good afternoon, (Mr. Novak Norvi) shareholder, customer of AXA Life. Given the work of the family,
he's not here, he's not answering the questions, I have a concern with AXA Life, which deals with
the (coalesce) contracts. The shareholders who are customers be careful with the costs we have
an example here, where AXA gives us fictitious debit charges whilst it was AXA who made the
mistake with coalesce. So what is worrisome when someone decides, for example, there's some
shares -- European shares of a small company. All of a sudden if he's not -- he might be cut,
anyways he might come up with a money market unit fund if he is not aware, there's a potential
loss of about 50% or even more. So therefore, I would like to know if AXA was going to look at this
Life AXA, the family wanted to put some money again on this contracts. For the time being, given
the concerns, we are not investing more money, we're just waiting to see what you intend to do.

at 92%. Therefore, AXA in that index is doing extremely well. You have 45.45% of women on the
boards. Therefore, you have applied the law quite well. You also have 32% of women in the top

are only 9% of women at the EXCOM management committee? At the management committee,
there's only one woman sitting after such beautiful results, I'm so sorry about this. Mr. Folz, I was

that we've done a lot in regard to the organization, especially when it comes to the top 100 of the
AXA Group and 32%. And we are very proud of that success. But you're quite right as well that at
the management committee, there's only one single woman. Our approach has always been to
say, "Look, it is better to develop these talents in house in the company," and if you have seen the
latest appointments and recruitments that we made, well, certainly, in the major countries, such as
Spain, Thailand, many women with a lot of potential and my goal and our goal is clearly to expand,
to develop this population of the 30% of women so that they can join the management
committee. And this is why we gave quite ambitious goals to the entities for them to develop
these women. And I promise you if we have an opportunity and when we have an opportunity to

treasury shares and self-control. What is the difference between these 2 French notions, which are
one and the same as far as I'm concerned. Let's talk about an innovation that wasn't mentioned by

deployment that you're talking about?

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Thank you for your questions. Now first of all, to defend Mr. Jean-Martin Folz, who doesn't need it.
But I still want to do it. Look, when the general meetings are assessed by the press that you read
as a shareholder, well, this press is keen that we pay enough time to the explanation of the
resolutions. I mean anything that relates to resolutions on remunerations, it's a bit complicated. We
could keep it silent and then people would blame us for that. Regarding the next date for our
general meeting, it's a piece of information that we usually share with you. I can give it with you. I
usually give it at the end of our general meeting. It's on the 30th of April 2020. With regard to
auto-control. And we have treasury shares. And with regard to connected cargo, I will ask Mr.
Buberl to speak about this.

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you for this question on the connected cargo. This is something as a matter of fact, which is
quite interesting for us because with the combination between AXA and corporate solutions and
XL, once again, we are the largest insurer in the world in the marine arena, which is mainly
represented by cargo. There, we see that there are many thefts and fires. And we started to
understand well the stakes in the sensors in this field. We have already made some tests and trials
with our key clients. And they have made progress in this regard. Today, in the containers with
fresh goods, it's fairly straightforward and easy to put in sensors. When you have -- we have
electric sources through the goods and through the freshness. And now in dry containers, today,
it's still a problem with batteries and reception. However, we are studying this field in order to truly
speaking do the same things that we did with telemedicine with regard to commercial risk, what
can we offer our corporate clients in the way they track their goods to make sure that thefts and
fires may be cut down significantly. And it's certainly a field where we want to be a bit stronger.

Q - Unidentified Participant
(inaudible) individual shareholder with a large number of shares. What about the major difference
between your accounting results according to the IFRS standards and on the other side, the
dividend that you're paying out to shareholders? Because when you look at the IFRS standards,
your results are divided by 3 and with regard to the dividend, thank God, it is hiked but this leads
me to the following question. Aren't you burning your available cash, especially looking at various
countries? We see that in the U.S. the 2017 income was at EUR 1.4 billion, which we came into a loss
in 2018 of EUR 2 billion. So how can you account for that? And what can you say to reassure us? I
know the IFRS is an accounting notion. But it does make sense, normally. So could you give us
some explanation on this?

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

GÃ©rald Harlin, the CFO for the company, will explain.

A - GÃ©rald Harlin
Sir, thank you for your question. First of all, you're mentioning the dividend and remember the
dividend is based on the adjusted results, which is made up of operating income plus or minus
capital gain. The major variance that you underline between the net income and the adjusted
earnings are due to exceptionals, which are not cash related. In other words, these are factors,
which are due to depreciations of goodwill, mainly as I said before, EUR 3.1 billion, which is due to
our disposals coming from the U.S.
Your -- last part of your question concerns the results in the U.S.A. and there, as pointed out in my
presentation early on, is a result, which is quite positive, i.e., EUR 1.1 billion. Now the EUR 2 billion
you are referring to is related to the disposals that we may have made and some disposals gave
rise to losses. And all of this is part of the goodwill depreciation. So these are exceptional items.



And remember, the United States is an operation that has been -- where we have consolidated
80% of AXA U.S. for a contribution of EUR 1.1 billion to the underlying earnings.

2019 in Direct Assurance with -- and mentioned in the various French journals said that AXA France
had lost 30,000 contracts in 2018. And this had been lasting for three years. My first question will
be that figure of 30,000, is it the net balance of AXA France? Or is it weighted down by the Direct
Assurance results, which is a subsidiary of AXA. In the 2 press articles, (Henri Gupta) says that the
price of the new rate will be 30% cheaper than the former offer, which is a very good piece of
news. Can you tell me if the AXA clients of the former offer may well benefit from this new offer,
which is cheaper than the current instrument or if they moved to another instrument?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jacques de Peretti

{BIO 18970697 <GO>}

Thank you. Thank you, sir, for your question. And thank you for reading carefully what we publish.
As a matter of fact, to answer your first question, we are losing, as a matter of fact, 30,000
contract. We lost them last year. And these 30,000 contracts are net-net of the contracts of AXA
in France, which is about EUR 4.5 million. So 30,000 contracts for a portfolio or for just over EUR 4
million is a result, which does not endanger the soundness of our group. However, since we
consider that such a situation deserve to be corrected, we have launched a product, which is quite
innovative, quite competitive, which in addition, is interesting because it can be found in branches
agency and on the (wet and mix), it easier for our customers because it's seamless, the figures
that were given to you corresponds to all of AXA in France, i.e., with a subsidiary of AXA France
called Direct Assurance and the contract that we launched with our agents several weeks ago is, of
course, open to all the clients of AXA.

Q - Unidentified Participant
(Harish Mehta). I was quite interested in the report made by Mrs. CÃ©line Soubranne regarding the
assistance provided by AXA for single-family households and for women who are victims of
violence. I wanted to know who could have access to such help and on the other hand, should one
be a policyholder at AXA? I'm interested in that. Can we advise other people that we know if
people experience such issues, can we advise them to go to AXA under what conditions and so
on? Now second question. I appreciate your fight against tobacco in terms of health. But for my
part, I have a hard time with electronic cigarettes. We know that U.S. researchers have conducted
research and to my knowledge from what I read, they have been banned to -- from publishing
these results under the pressure of lobbyists. I'd like to know if AXA has already any concerns
about this problem bearing in mind that in France, the research of the U.S. are obviously known. But
France apparently would have -- has postponed the publishing of these results based on
observations and postponed until the fall this year. I think that this products are as harmful as
tobacco and cause reactions in the body on the health. For me personally, it's also a problem. I will
not give you the specifics of everything that we can -- we have to suffer. But this is a major concern
to me. Now third and last question. I know that AXA owns forests that it offers to investors. And I
think for the TronÃ§ais forest, there are many oak trees. So what about your offer to repair NotreDame de Paris. And apparently, there would be the equivalent of 21,000 hectares that AXA might
be the owner of and there, my fear is that this forest be dealt with as is the case in most of the



FINAL

forests in France. You just uproot them with all the pollution this can generate in the soil with floods.
And if you plant Douglas trees at high temperatures because these trees do not let the light
penetrate. So it is a black forest, et cetera. I'll skip the details and also be aware that if these are
Douglas trees quite often, there are some chemicals that are used on them. There are about 60
different sprays that are used on them. And therefore, the neighboring populations may suffer the
consequences of these sprays, such as cancer and other diseases. So I'd like to know how AXA
experiences this kind of split or disconnect?

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

Thank you, madame, for your questions. I'll answer your second question and make a third
comment. And I will hand it over to Jacques Peretti. Regarding your first question on the question
of the electronic cigarettes, yes, there are some U.S. studies that seem to point to the harmfulness
of electronic cigarettes, which generally is promoted by the same tobacco manufacturers and in its
-- AXA now has excluded this. So therefore, we are with you as regards the inclusion of the
electronic cigarette and with regard to the other cigarettes. Concerning AXA's investments in
forests, I can assure you that this practice is in line with the best-presumed title environments. And
I do not subscribe to your comment concerning AXA's ill-treatment to forests. And I can assure you
that AXA is very attached to all the strictest and most advanced environmental standards. And for
your last question, I hand over to Jacques de Peretti.

objectives. The first was to say, what can we do to increase our reputation and presence in Asia
because despite Brexit, football's global impact will not stop. And we've seen that in Asia. There
are a number of European clubs, which are very strong. Liverpool FC is one of them.



FINAL

Second issue was -- the question, is there a football club that is aligned with our vision? Our vision,
as you've seen, say Know You Can, with our new tagline. What can we do to help people live out a
better life and the vision of Liverpool, if you see, it's never walk alone. So very close to what we
want to do. And it's more a question -- a practical question as well. These football clubs are in high
demand and have long-term partners and finding a good opportunity is not always easy. And if you
take these 3 objectives, we found that in this partnership we're extremely well established now
and which is growing very well. And you'll see in the coming weeks that there are -- there's news
bearing on this. And we're very satisfied with this partnership, in particular, to strengthen our brand
image in Asia.

Question number 2 and with that, it will be the last.

Q - Unidentified Participant

Bloomberg Transcript

(inaudible) I am an AXA shareholder and I'm also a GP and a possible future chronic patient
because we've been told that 45% among us here will be subjected to chronic pathology. So first
comment, one is that telemedicine is now in the area of covered by national health insurance. So in
conditions and as -- maybe it's better not to use the telemedicine term, rather than medical
teleadvise where telemedicine is a medical action. That was my first comment. Two questions. I've
heard from Mr. Borie, the term of Care pathway and this puts us under the French law governing
hospital treatment and imposes the prescribing physician as the key player in recommending a
Care -- is AXA going to take the GP's place? And I see as a Care stream now do you respect a
patient's free choice or will AXA be proposing to its insured customers? In position of the name of
a patient. And so it is both the shareholder and the physician who is asking the question.

A - Denis Pierre Marie Duverne

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

I'll ask Jacques de Peretti to answer and maybe Thomas.

A - Jacques de Peretti

{BIO 18970697 <GO>}

Well first of all, thank you for your question because our cooperation with physicians is essential.
Medicine in France is delivered by doctors -- medical doctors. And we fully intend to continue
working with them. And just one remark in passing and that is that healthcare complementary
insurance is what in France today makes it possible to free practice GP, where the physicians can
establish themselves freely where they wish and to allow all French citizens access -- free access to
the doctor of their choice. And so this complementary insurance in -- which is available in their
country, does preserve that freedom of care. And I think the more it is clearly stated, the better it
will be because it's not always well understood.
But secondly, our group is sensitive to the general issue of medicine today in France. You know that
there are medical deserts in France today. And it is something that we must take into account. You
also know that today some customers, some patients, as you say, do not have easy access to
certain specialties. For example, today, consulting an eye specialist in Paris today is very
complicated. And it's based on this acknowledgment of fact that we say can we do something?
Can we help? Could we help our -- improve our situation today being a blind so -- as a blind payer
to be a partner? And this is the initiative that we've taken with teleconsultation, as your teleadvise,
as you say. And it is one of the initiatives that we are thinking about extending. But quite clearly, we
are fully aware that medicine in France is delivered by medical doctors. And it is essential that this
profession be respected and that has always been the policy of our AXA Group in France.

{BIO 1521138 <GO>}

Thank you, Jacques. And Thomas?

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}



FINAL

Maybe for your first comment is it telemedicine advise or teleconsultation? The term
teleconsultation was specifically chosen because today it is possible to prescribe and undertake
medical (dips) in the context of an agreement with the local -- with the regional health authorities.
So it is general practice on -- by video on the -- one end of the phone. But as Jacques de Peretti
says, fully integrated in our network. So today if a customer calls us, we can handle 70% of cases.
And for the 30% remaining cases, we then refer them to specialists.
