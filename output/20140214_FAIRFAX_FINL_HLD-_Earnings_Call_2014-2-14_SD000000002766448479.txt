Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at
this time. Your host for today's call is Prem Watsa with opening remarks from Rick
Salsberg. Mr. Salsberg, please begin.

Rick Salsberg
Good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss Fairfax's 2013 year-end results. The call
may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ, perhaps materially,
from those contained in such forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of
uncertainties and risk factors, the most foreseeable of which are set out under risk factors
in our base shelf prospectus which has been filed with Canadian Securities Regulators and
is available on SEDAR.
I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Prem Watsa.

FINAL

Thank you, Rick. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Fairfax's year-end
conference call. I plan to give you some of the highlights and then pass it on to Dave
Bonham, our CFO, for additional financial details.
Our insurance companies had an outstanding year in 2013, with a combined ratio of
92.7%, with excellent reserving and record underwriting profits. OdysseyRe had a record
low combined ratio of 84%, while Zenith made an underwriting profit for the first time
since we purchased them in 2010. We realized gains from our common stock portfolios of
$1.3 billion in 2013. Excluding all hedging losses, and before mark-to-market fluctuations in
our investment portfolio, we earned $1.9 billion in pretax income. Including all hedging
losses and mark-to-market fluctuations in our investment portfolio, we reported a $0.6
billion after-tax loss for 2013. We expect the unrealized mark-to-market losses to reverse
in the future.

Bloomberg Transcript

In fact, as of February 11, a few days ago, we had in unrealized mark-to-market gain in
2014 of approximately $900 million. After-tax this would have eliminated our loss in 2013.
In the past we had two years, 1990 and 1991, that we had a negative total return. In both
cases we rebounded significantly in the following year. I caution you, we don't pay too
much attention to short-term fluctuations in market prices. Our common stock portfolios
continue to be fully hedged. And we continue to be soundly financed with year-end cash
and marketable securities in the Holding Company of $1.3 billion.
Moving on to our insurance and reinsurance businesses, our insurance and reinsurance
businesses' premium volume remained flat in 2013 after a number of years of growth.
The combined ratio for our insurance and reinsurance operations in 2013 was 89.1% for
the Fourth Quarter and 92.7% for the whole year. At the subsidiary level, the increase in
net premiums written in the year 2013 and combined ratios were as follows. OdysseyRe,
increase in premiums in 2013 was flat; combined ratio of 84%. Crum & Forster, increase in
premiums flat; 101.9% combined ratio. Northbridge had a 4.6% increase in premium;
98.2% combined ratio. Zenith 13.1% increase in premium; 97.1% combined ratio for the
whole year. And Fairfax Asia had a 7% increase in premiums, with an 87.5% combined ratio.
As we have said before, very low interest rates and reduced reserve redundancies mean
there's no place to hide for the industry. Combined ratios over time will have to drop well
below 100% for the industry to make a single-digit return on equity with these low interest
rates. While the short term is always tough to predict, fundamentals we think will
eventually play out. Net investment losses of $1.56 billion in 2013 consisted of the
following. Please refer again to page two of our press release.
Net losses on equity and equity-related investments of $537 million resulted from net
gains of $1.4 billion from the table, and a $2 billion net loss on our equity hedge, principally
reflecting the temporary mismatch between the Russell Index and our equity portfolio.
This is predominantly because of the Russell 2000 significantly outperforming the S&P
500 in 2013. We realized gains of $1.3 billion on our equity portfolio in the year 2013. The
realized loss of $1.4 billion on our equity hedges was due to the sale of common stocks
and, consequently, a permanent reduction in our hedges. Also, we had unrealized losses
of $1 billion in our municipal and treasury bond portfolio because of the impact of rising
interest rates.

FINAL

We expect the mark-to-market losses to reverse, as I said earlier, over time, and we have
seen some of that already. As we have mentioned in our annual meetings, annual reports
and quarterly calls, with IFRS accounting where stocks and bonds are recorded at market,
and subject to mark-to-market gains or losses, quarterly and annual income will fluctuate
wildly, and investment results will only make sense over the long term. Core inflation
continues to be at or below 1% in the United States and Europe, levels not seen since the
1950s, in spite of QE1, QE2 and QE3.
Our CPI-linked derivatives, with a nominal value of $83 billion, are down 76% from costs,
and are carried on our balance sheet at $131.7 million, even though they have 7.5 years to
run. As I have said to you before, our CDS experience comes to mind. When you review
our statements, please remember that when we own more than 20% of a company, we
equity account. And when we own about 50% we consolidate. So that mark-to-market
gains in these companies are not reflected in our results.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let me mention some of those gains. As you can see on page 14 of our quarterly report,
the fair values of our investment in associates is $1.815 billion, which is a carrying value of
$1.433 billion, an unrealized gain of $382 million that's not on our balance sheet. Also, as
we own 75% of Thomas Cook and 74% of Ridley, which are consolidated in our
statements, unrealized gains on market values as of December 31, 2013, on both these
positions is approximately $152 million. Thus, total unrealized gains not reflected on our
balance sheet is $534 million.
On top of this, Europe properties, our investment in an exceptional Greek REIT with
outstanding management, where we have increased our investments of the rights issue,
has another unrealized appreciation of $109 million not included in our balance sheet. For
a grand total of $643 million, all not on our balance sheet. Of course, all this works out in
the long term so take these mark-to-market fluctuations as just that, fluctuations that have
no impact over time.
As I've said before, the Company held $1.3 billion of cash, short-term investments and
marketable securities at the Holding Company and is in a very sound financial position. We
have reduced our equity holdings because of increasing markets by approximately 20%.
And we continue to be approximately 100% hedged in relationship to our equity and
equity-related securities, which include convertible bonds and convertible preferred stock.
We continue to be very concerned about the prospects for the financial markets and the
economies of North America and Western Europe, accentuated, as we have said many
times before, by potential weakness in China and emerging markets. We continue to feel
that there is a big disconnect between the financial markets and the underlying economic
fundamentals. As of December 31, 2013, we have over 32%, or $8 billion, in cash and
short-term investments in our portfolios to take advantage of opportunities that come our
way. As a result, in the short term our investment income will continue to be reduced.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Dave Bonham, our CFO, so he can give you some
information on the underlying financials. Dave?

FINAL

Thank you, Prem. First I'll focus on Fairfax's consolidated results for the Fourth Quarter of
2013. Then I'll move on to the Operating Company results and finish with a consolidated
financial position.
For the Fourth Quarter of 2013 Fairfax reported a net loss of $6 million. That's a net loss of
$0.98 per share on a fully diluted basis. And that compares to the Fourth Quarter of 2012
when we reported a net profit of $402 million, net earnings of $18.82 per share. On a
year-to-date basis the Company reported a net loss of $573 million, translating into a net
loss of $31 per diluted share. And that compared to net earnings last year of $527 million,
or about $23 per diluted share.

Bloomberg Transcript

Fairfax's underwriting results have shown significant improvement in the Fourth Quarter
and full year of 2013, with our insurance and reinsurance operations reporting combined
ratios of 89% and 93%, and underwriting profits of $165 million and $440 million during
those respective periods. That's a year-over-year increase in our underwriting profit of
$280 million in the Fourth Quarter and $434 million in the full year of 2013. By way of
comparison, in the Fourth Quarter of 2012 we reported a combined ratio of 107% and an
underwriting loss of $115 million, and a combined ratio of 99.9% and an underwriting profit
of $6 million in the full year of 2012.
So that improvement, representing about 18 combined ratio points quarter-over-quarter,
and 7 combined ratio points year-over-year, principally reflected higher catastrophe losses
in 2012, mainly reflecting the impact of Hurricane Sandy, and the continuation into 2013 of
higher net favorable prior-year reserve development. In terms of reserve development
we experienced $212 million and $440 million of net favorable prior-year reserve
development in the Fourth Quarter and full year of 2013. And that benefited our
combined ratio by 14 combined ratio points in the Fourth Quarter, 7 combined ratio points
for the full year. That's a little bit more than double the amount of net favorable
development we experienced in the Fourth Quarter and full year of 2012.
Current-period catastrophe losses were significantly lower in 2013 relative to 2012,
totaling $71 million, or about 5 combined ratio points in the Fourth Quarter, and $289
million or also about 5 combined ratio points in the full year of 2013. The Fourth Quarter of
2012 included current-period catastrophe losses of $277 million, 18 combined ratio points,
mostly related to Hurricane Sandy. Current-period catastrophe losses amounted to about
$410 million or 7 combined ratio points in the full year of 2012. The year-to-date
underwriting results in 2013 reflected the impact of the Alberta floods, Toronto floods,
Germany hail storms, Central European floods, and Typhoon Fitow, with Typhoon Fitow
being the most significant catastrophe loss reported during the Fourth Quarter of 2013.
As Prem mentioned already, net premiums written by our insurance and reinsurance
operations increased in the Fourth Quarter and full year of 2013 by 0.2% and 2.9%,
respectively, prior to giving effect to two significant unearned premium portfolio transfers
at OdysseyRe related to a specific quota-share reinsurance contract. And I wanted to
note for you that page 43 of our Fourth Quarter interim report contains a detailed
discussion of these transactions, including their impact on OdysseyRe and Fairfax.

FINAL

So let's turn to our Operating Company results, starting with OdysseyRe. In the Fourth
Quarter and full year of 2013 Odyssey reported an underwriting profit of $122 million and
$380 million, and combined ratios of 79% and 84%. Underwriting profit increased yearover-year by $88 million and $114 million in the Fourth Quarter and full year of 2013, and
that reflecting lower current-period catastrophe net losses and higher net favorable prioryear reserve development.
Catastrophe losses in the Fourth Quarter and full year of 2013 of $65 million and $203
million translated into 11 combined ratio points and 9 combined ratio points of those
respective periods, and were principally comprised of Typhoon Fitow and Windstorm
Christian in the Fourth Quarter, and the Alberta floods, Germany hail storms, Toronto
floods, and Central European floods during the rest of 2013. Current-period catastrophe
losses in 2012 principally reflected the impact of Hurricane Sandy, with total losses of $175
million in the Fourth Quarter and full year of 2012.

Bloomberg Transcript

OdysseyRe's combined ratio in the Fourth Quarter and full year included the benefit of
$134 million, or 23 combined ratio points, and $215 million, or 9 combined ratio points, of
net favorable prior-year reserve development. Principally relating to net favorable
emergence on prior-year's catastrophe losses. OdysseyRe wrote $541 million of net
premiums in the Fourth Quarter of 2013. And that's a decrease of 6% from the net
premiums written of $574 million in the Fourth Quarter of 2012.
The decrease principally reflecting lower writings of property catastrophe and casualty
business, which was partially offset by increases in most lines of business in their US
insurance division. In addition to these factors, OdysseyRe's net premiums written in the
full year of 2013 also reflected increased writings of US crop insurance and higher yearover-year recurring net premiums related to a significant property quota share
reinsurance contract which had incepted midway through last year.
Turning to Crum & Forster. Crum and Forster's underwriting results improved in the Fourth
Quarter and full year of 2013, reflecting lower net adverse prior-year reserve
development and lower current-period catastrophe losses. Crum & Forster reported an
underwriting loss of $21 million in the Fourth Quarter, $24 million in the full year of 2013.
And that's a significant improvement over the underwriting losses of $87 million and $113
million in the Fourth Quarter and full year of 2012.
Net adverse prior-year reserve development was lower year-over-year, and totaled $8
million in the Fourth Quarter and full year of 2013, reflecting net unfavorable emergence
on general liability loss reserves at First Mercury, partially offset by net favorable
emergence on one single large liability claim at Crum & Forster. That contrasts the net
adverse prior-year reserve development of $49 million or 15 combined ratio points, and
$54 million or 4 combined ratio points in the Fourth Quarter and full year of 2012.
Current-period catastrophe losses had a nominal impact on Crum & Forster's combined
ratios in 2013. Those combined ratios were 107% in the Fourth Quarter and 102% in the full
year of 2012. Whereas the combined ratios of 127% and 109% in the Fourth Quarter and

Page 5 of 17

Date: 2014-02-14

FINAL

full year of 2012 included 6.5 and 2.4 combined ratio points respectively, of current-period
catastrophe losses, mostly related to Hurricane Sandy.
Net premiums written by Crum & Forster increased by 7.8% in the Fourth Quarter of 2013.
And that primarily reflected increases in specialty lines of business, primarily accident and
health, partially offset by lower standard lines of business. And that was due to the reunderwriting of the workers' compensation business which is now complete. Crum &
Forster's net premiums written decreased 1.6% in the full year of 2013, reflecting
decreased standard lines of business, which was more pronounced through the first three
quarters of 2013, and changes in the mix of the specialty lines of business. Net premiums
written in the full year of 2013 also included the incremental premiums from the
acquisitions of Hartville and American Safety of $14 million and $13 million, respectively.

Bloomberg Transcript

Zenith reported significant improvements in its combined ratio, which decreased to 88%
and 97% in the Fourth Quarter and full year of 2013, from 114% and 116% in those periods
last year. The improvements reflected the following. Year-over-year increases of 15 and
10percentage points -- sorry, year-over-year decreases of 15 and 10percentage points in
the accident year loss ratios in the Fourth Quarter and full year of 2013. That's reflecting
earned price increases that exceeded estimates of loss trends.
Secondly, increased net favorable development of prior-year's reserves, representing 10
and 5percentage points on the Fourth Quarter and full year of 2013. And finally, decreases
in the expense ratio, including commissions, of 2 and 3percentage points in the Fourth
Quarter and full year of 2013. And that was as a result of 14% and 13% increases in net
premiums earned year-over-year. Net premiums written by Zenith of $126 million and
$700 million in the Fourth Quarter and full year of 2013 increased by 14% and 13%,
reflecting premium rate increases.
Northbridge's combined ratio improved from 114% in the Fourth Quarter of 2012 to 90% in
the Fourth Quarter of 2013, and from 106% in the full year of 2012 to 98% in the full year
of 2013. In both the Fourth Quarter and full year, Northbridge's underwriting results
reflected increased net favorable development of prior-year's reserves, coupled with
lower current-period catastrophe losses quarter-over-quarter but higher current-period
catastrophe losses year-over-year.
Northbridge's combined ratio included the benefit of a net favorable reserve
development across most accident years and lines of business of $46 million or 19
combined ratio points in the Fourth Quarter, and $154 million or 16 combined ratio points
in the full year of 2013. And that compared to net favorable development of $10 million or
4 combined ratio points in the Fourth Quarter, $61 million or 6 combined ratio points in the
full year of 2012.
Catastrophe losses of $5 million in the Fourth Quarter of 2013 primarily related to the
Toronto ice storms; whereas catastrophe losses of $61 million in the full year of 2013
principally related to flooding in Alberta and Toronto. These two events together added
approximately 5percentage points to the combined ratio in the full year of 2013.
Combined ratio -- sorry, catastrophe losses in the Fourth Quarter and full year of 2012 of

Page 6 of 17

Date: 2014-02-14

FINAL

$24 million and $39 million added 10percentage points and 4percentage points to the
combined ratios in those respective periods, and primarily reflecting the impact of
Hurricane Sandy.
Adjusting for the one-time impact of the inter-Company unearned premium portfolio
transfer between Northbridge and Group Re, that we describe on page 51 of our Fourth
Quarter report, net premiums written by Northbridge increased by the Fourth Quarter and
full year by 17.8% and 8.8%, expressed in Canadian dollars. And that reflects increased
premium retention following the termination of that inter-Company quota share
arrangement and modest growth in writings at Federated Insurance.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to Fairfax Asia, Fairfax Asia's combined ratio increased from 84% and 87% in the
Fourth Quarter and full year of 2012, to 88% in each of the Fourth Quarter and full year of
2013. On a year-over-year basis net premiums written by Fairfax Asia increased by 12%
and 7% in the Fourth Quarter and full year of 2013, principally reflecting increased writings
of commercial auto business in the Fourth Quarter of 2013, and increased engineering
and liability business, partially offset by lower writings of Marine Hall business in the full
year of 2013.
At insurance and reinsurance other, the combined ratios of this division improved from
110% in the Fourth Quarter of 2012 to 92% in the Fourth Quarter of 2013, and improved
from 104% in the full year of 2012 to 97% in the full year of 2013. Net premiums written
decreased by 27% and 23% in the Fourth Quarter and full year of 2013. The unearned
premium portfolio transfer that we mentioned in our discussion of Northbridge
suppressed to the net premiums written by Group Re in the full year of 2013 by $39
million.
If we exclude the initial one-time impact of this transfer, net premiums written decreased
by 15.9% in the full year of 2013, reflecting the decrease in Group Re's quota share
participation on that inter-Company reinsurance contract from 10% last year to 0% this
year. And also reflected the re-underwriting of certain classes of business at Advent Polish
Re, combined with decreased usage of reinsurance at Advent. And that was partially
offset by growth at Fairfax Brazil.
Runoff reported operating income of $91 million and $77 million in the Fourth Quarter and
full year of 2013. That's an increase over the operating income of $13 million and $8 million
reported in the same period last year. The improvement in operating profitability primarily
reflected net overall favorable prior-year reserve development in 2013 compared to net
overall adverse reserve development at runoff in 2012. And also reflected a gain on a
significant commutation in the full year of 2013.
Moving on to some of our consolidated results, our consolidated interest and dividend
income increased from $73 million in the Fourth Quarter of 2012 to $104 million in the
Fourth Quarter of 2013. Decreased $409 million in the full year of 2012 to $377 million in
the full year of 2013. Both periods reflected lower investment income due to sales of
higher-yielding government and corporate bonds in 2012 and 2013, and sales of dividend

FINAL

paying equities in 2013, the proceeds of which were reinvested into lower yielding bonds,
cash and short-term investments.
The Fourth Quarter and full year of 2013 also reflected lower total return swap expense
period-over-period. The decrease even more pronounced in the Fourth Quarter,
reflecting terminations of equity index total return swaps and certain short positions
during 2013. The Company recorded a recovery of income taxes of $24 million and $437
million in the Fourth Quarter and full year of 2013, representing effective tax rates of 93%
and 44%, respectively. The higher effective tax rate in the Fourth Quarter and full year of
2013 primarily related to significant pretax losses in the US, which increases our effective
tax rate when we're in a loss position as tax may be recovered at the US tax rate of 35%.
And that's substantially higher than the Canadian statutory income tax rate of 26.5%.
Moving to our financial position, we issued 1 million subordinate voting shares on
November 15, 2013 for net proceeds after commissions and expenses of $400 million.
And we repaid the $183 million principal amount of OdysseyRe unsecured senior notes
when they matured on November 1, 2013. Our total debt to total capital ratio increased to
26.1% from 25.5% at December 31, 2012, due primarily to the decrease in our common
shareholders' equity during the year 2013.
And now I'll pass it back to you, Prem.

Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Thank you, Dave. Now we are happy to answer your questions. Please give us your name,
your company name and try to limit your questions to only one so that is fair to everyone
on the call. Okay, Caroline, we are ready for the questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions)
Jeff Fenwick, Cormark Securities.

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

Prem, a little bit of movement in the investment portfolio through the quarter here. As you
mentioned you sold some of your positions and closed out your S&P 500 swap there, as
well. How are you feeling in terms of the mix today and where you would like to position
the portfolio here going forward in 2014?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes, Jeffrey. We're quite happy with the way we've positioned it, Jeffrey. We're 100%
hedged on our common stock portfolios, large cash positions, as you know.

Page 8 of 17



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2014-02-14

And we muni bonds, predominately protected by Brookshire Hathaway guarantee. And
we have some US government bonds. But very little corporate bonds. So we are basically
risk averse, you would say, and concerned about what's happening in the financial
markets.

FINAL

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

And just in terms of that waiting on the muni bonds, something that obviously served you
well from a yield perspective. But it's obviously a pretty heavy component of your fixed
income. Are you still comfortable with that size of the muni position in the portfolio?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes. We're very comfortable with our muni positions. We don't think there's any credit risk
in the muni bond portfolios. They do have fluctuations, Jeff, in terms of interest rates
going up and down.
And so when I talked about that $900 million gain from the end of 2013, one-third of that
was from bond portfolios going up because long rates have come down. And the rest
was basically from the common stock portfolios. And markets going up, of course, the
hedge benefited.

Bloomberg Transcript

So there is volatility because the markets are volatile and you're into mark-to-market
positions on a regular basis. But there's a lot of concern, as you know, in terms of, which
we've talked about in the past, in the US economy. It's still tepid, in our minds.
And Europe -- we've talked about China. And of course, emerging markets are causing
some problems.
So there's many unintended consequences. And we continue to be very cautious given
that markets have gone up so much and spreads are so narrow.

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

And just one follow-up, on the exit from the S&P 500 total return swap, I assume that's
going to help you out a little bit on the dividend and interest income line there. You had a
bit of an expense associated with those swaps. Is that a correct way to think about it?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Dave, do you want to add to that, Dave?

A - Dave Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Yes. That's absolutely correct. We saw a little bit of that already in the Fourth Quarter
where our dividends that we pay in respect to those total return swaps is coming in lower.
And that's going to continue into next year.

FINAL

Paul Holden, CIBC.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

I have two questions for you. The first is related to the insurance operations.
I'm hoping you can provide us with a little more color around the favorable reserve
development this quarter, namely at Northbridge and OdysseyRe, since we haven't had a
chance to see the reserve tables yet, which I know will be included in the annual report.
But I haven't had a chance to look at it yet so maybe help us out there.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes. I'll pass it on to Dave but perhaps just to make the point that we always reserve
conservatively on an accident year basis. Then, of course, we watch how the reserves
develop.

Bloomberg Transcript

And so we are being very conservative on an accident year basis, for all our companies.
But Dave, specifically to OdysseyRe, would you add a few comments?

A - Dave Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Sure. OdysseyRe reported favorable development of $114 million in the year and $134
million in the Fourth Quarter. And that was principally related to prior-year's catastrophe
loss reserves developing favorably. And also related to casualty reserves developing
more favorably this year.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. Then, sorry, at Northbridge was there anything in particular?

A - Dave Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Nothing specific at Northbridge. Favorable development across all of the lines of business
and all of the reserves. And that was about $154 million on the year, $46 million on the
quarter.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. Then my second question is related to the investment portfolio.
Prem, you've been warning about the potential for a hard landing in China for some time
now. And reiterated that a bit again today. Certainly we're starting to see some cracks in

Page 10 of 17



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2014-02-14

the financial system there. So my question is, have you contemplated more direct
investment vehicles to potentially profit from a hard landing in China?

FINAL

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Paul, that's a very good question. We haven't identified anything specific. What we are
more interested in -- China's a very large economy, as you know, and anything happening
in China will impact the world.
China takes almost 40% to 50% of every commodity. So of course China will have an
impact on Canada and will have an impact on many of the commodity-producing countries
like Australia and Brazil, other countries in the world. So we are focused on protecting
ourselves, first and foremost, and not making as much of a gain.
Now, some of you will say we are hedged, 100% hedged on the upside and 100%
hedged on the downside. So Paul, how are we going to make any money?
And what happens -- we've realized a significant amount of gain, $1.3 billion from the
common stock portfolios. And we've reinvested it in things that we like, which are
significantly down from where they were.

Bloomberg Transcript

And we are protecting our portfolios, equity portfolios, from significant drops. Not a 5%
and 10% drop but like 30%-plus drops. That's what we're worried about, Paul.
And in that environment, the fact that we've sold our common shares that have done very
well, and bought things that haven't done as well, means that we'll be protected on the
downside. We don't expect to go down as much as the indices. And that's happened in
the past. It happened more recently in 2008 that we came down significantly less and
made a lot of money on our hedges. And we think that's yet to happen.
But it's fascinating to me that here we have a huge monstrous bubble in real estate in
China and you're asking me the question, it's written about in the press, a year ago there
was a CBS documentary on it. And it seems to me that almost no one worried about it.
It reminds me what happened in the housing crisis in 2003, 2004, 2005, the boom in
housing. It reminds me, or it takes me back to the tech boom where companies, big
companies like Northern Telecom and others, were buying small little companies for $10
billion and $20 billion, with no sales, no revenues, and nothing other than a few engineers
together. And it takes me back to the 1980s when you had the same type of experience
in the oil industry.
The problem with these booms or bubbles is that they last for some time, and you can
never tell when it will change. And our experience over 35 years, 40 years is to stay away
from them, and have the fortitude to continue to stay away even when you look very
wrong.

Like last year, for example, if we were really smart, we wouldn't have hedged our
common stock portfolio, and perhaps begun to hedge it later in the year or now. Well
we've never done that over 28 years. We've always taken a long-term view.

FINAL

When we've recognized problems we've reacted to it, and quite often we've been wrong
or too early. Then, as a friend of mine said -- wrong, wrong, wrong -- and then right.
Perhaps better than the other way around.
And so, Paul, we continue to be worried about all of these things in spite of the fact that
2013 wasn't the year to have that position.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

A question from about, I think part of the reason for the cash, the higher cash position,
was to provide the flexibility in case you really wanted to -- in case the insurance markets
really started to firm. And if we look, net premiums written were up 23% in 2011, 10% in
2012, and now they're flat. So do you think that you've missed this opportunity to take
advantage of firming markets, insurance markets, particularly the reinsurance markets?
And maybe a little bit more on some of the thesis for that sizable cash position

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

That's a good question, Tom. But remember, there wasn't a wholesale hard market. It was
a hard market in the cat area after 2011. We took full advantage of that. OdysseyRe took
full advantage of that.
But in the other areas, in the workers' comp area, Zenith has gone from $400 million to
$450 million in premium when we bought it to $700 million last year. So it's done very well.
But other than that, you've had 5%, 10% increases over these last few years. And so it's
not been a full-fledged hard market. But we've taken as much advantage as we can.
More recently the cat prices are down 15% to 20%. There hasn't been a cat event last
year. Likely that drop will continue. And likely our premiums will drop in that segment, just
reflecting the fact that prices are coming down with similar or additional exposures.
We've had losses in Calgary, of course, with the flood losses, and in Toronto. So that
would be a little bit of a plus for our Canadian markets. But the markets happen to have
been -- the insurance markets haven't had a full-fledged hard market like we've had after
2001.

FINAL

And the financial markets have been very good, so most people have made good money
in the investment portfolios. But you can see a possibility where spreads widen and
perhaps common stock prices come down where there is a squeeze on capital.
Ultimately, that's what happens. You need a squeeze on capital.
It happened -- it's happened in the past, can happen again-- or, of course, a very
significant catastrophe. The cash positions, though, it would be fair to say, we should have
had very low cash positions, Tom, and put a significant amount in the stock market or in
bonds and corporate bonds as spreads have come down further. And perhaps not
hedged to our common stocks. So our strategy, our longer-term strategy was definitely
wrong in 2013.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

What would be the things you would look for before you would want to redeploy the
cash? I don't know if investors really want to have one-third of the portfolio earning hardly
anything. But maybe you can just elaborate. And if it's not necessarily firming -- (multiple
speakers).

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We are very long term in orientation. And so our investors, the ones that we've had for a
long period of time, understand the view that we have. But many investors will not, and
they want to be fully invested. So we wouldn't be the company that they'd invest in.
We've just taken a long-term view in all our activities. And the fact that you have cash -remember, in 2008, 2009, one of the reasons we benefited so significantly was the fact
that we had government bonds and cash to take advantage of opportunity. You can't take
advantage of opportunity if you don't have cash. We think this is a good time to have a
significant amount of cash in your portfolios.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks for that, Prem.

Arte Charpentier, Merit Research.

Q - Arte Charpentier
In your introductory comments, you mentioned that the very low rates available on
investment are going to require some more discipline on underwriting so as to earn
underwriting profits because you can't rely on investment profits going forward. Obviously
the combined ratios improved dramatically in this last year. But at the same time, to a
good degree, it was a much less, much lower catastrophic event year.
So my question really is, are you implementing -- how much of this improved combined
ratio is a result of implementing what you might call a different and maybe more
Page 13 of 17

demanding underwriting approach? And how much of it is a result of essentially being
maybe a lighter than normal catastrophe year?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

FINAL

Arte, that's a very good question. And we have benefited from the fact that there's been
few catastrophes last year. No question.
But I said last year at our annual meeting that our Company has benefited very
significantly from the fact that a few years ago we put Andy Barnard, who built
OdysseyRe, in charge of all our insurance operations. And the effects of Andy working
with our officers, like Peter Clarke and Paul Rivett, has been very significant, and will
continue to be significant.
In fact, Andy mentioned last year at our AGM -- and, by the way, you're welcome to
attend our AGM -- Andy said that he would like Fairfax to be known for its underwriting as
much as it is known for its investment record over a long period of time. And I think that's
gradually coming into play. There's been significant improvements in each of our
companies and they'll continue to take place.
So we have benefited from the lack of catastrophes. But there's many improvements
taking place across all our companies.

A couple of questions, first on the reserves. This was probably the best quarter for
reserve releases maybe ever, but certainly in as long as I'm able to remember. You
itemized some of the details on it earlier.
What I was wondering, I'm sure this was part of the normal year-end detailed review with
your outside actuaries, et cetera. I was wondering if there was any particular change in
assumption, or anything like that, that might have led to the favorable results. I don't
doubt what came up. It's more a matter of whether it's something that we might expect
to see more of in the future.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

First of all, we're very conservative. But a few years ago, Mark, you might have
remembered, we tightened up our reserving at Northbridge in terms of paying claims
quickly and reserving to ultimate. This is a few years ago and perhaps focused on
Lombard. And that's coming through last year and this year.
Page 14 of 17

But broadly speaking, we put our accident year loss ratios, combined ratios, at a higher
level, and we expect the redundancies to come in over time. But Dave, would you want to
add to that, Dave?

FINAL

A - Dave Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Yes, I would echo your comments, Prem. No real changes in assumptions driving this.
Maybe one extra point to my Northbridge comment.
We're seeing favorable case reserve developments coming through there, which is
positive. And as Prem said, reflects the conservatism that we may have had a few years
ago. And in general, it's just a reaction to the favorable claims emergence that we're
seeing at many of our companies, specifically Northbridge and OdysseyRe.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

That's traffic. Hopefully that gives up. The second question I had related to -- you guys
announced after the end of the year the acquisition of the Keg Restaurants. And I just
wanted to check whether that was going to be -- maybe a little bit of background on that,
as well as whether that's going to be a consolidated subsidiary or an affiliate held
investment.

A - Dave Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. That will be a consolidated subsidiary. So that will be in our other reporting segment
in the First Quarter of 2014.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. That's all my questions, then.

Q - Howard Flinker
Just a minor question and then a comment. Did you sell a preferred and replace a
preferred? Or is that a new preferred? I was confused by that.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Which preferred were you talking about, Howard?

Q - Howard Flinker
You did the preferred offering. Was it in the Fourth Quarter? Straight preferred?

We did that -- sorry -- Howard, that was a common stock issue that we did. We did 1
million shares at $431 a share.

Q - Howard Flinker

FINAL

Oh, it was common? I misread it. That's my error.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Not a problem.

Q - Howard Flinker
Because I still saw the preferred on the books and I thought, maybe I had some other
misunderstanding. That was my mistake.
There is another way, which I'll mention to John in a separate call, how you could possibly
capitalize on the deflationary pressures. I'm sure you guys --.

A - Prem Watsa

We'd love to hear from you, Howard, when you can give John a call.
