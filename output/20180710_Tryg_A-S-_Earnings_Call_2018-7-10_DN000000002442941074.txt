Presentation
Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. This is Gianandrea Roberti, I'm Head of Investor Relations at
Tryg. We published our Q2 results this morning and I have here with me, Morten Hubbe,
Group CEO; and Christian Baltzer, Group CFO.
Over to you, Morten.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you, Gian, and good morning from my side as well. We start on slide three, where
we show a pretax result of 735 million with an increased insurance technical result and a
reduced investment income. Technical result improved 4% year-on-year to 846 million,
impacted by some 24 million increase in weather claims and an increase of some 76
million in large claims. Pleased to see a continued improved trend in the underlying
claims, which improved 40 basis points both in Private lines and within the group. Clearly,
a low investment income for the quarter, minus 90 million, which is a change of some 210
million year-on-year, but Christian will elaborate on that.
In Q2, we see a dividend per share of 1.65, which is clearly in line with the guidance of
stable and increasing dividends. That results in a Solvency II ratio of 292, but bear in mind
that that is elevated and it is expected to reach some 170% after the Alka transaction.

FINAL

Speaking of Alka, we are expecting authority approval now in Q3. We were very pleased
to see that Alka, Friday, last week, performed or reported an H1 performance, which is
very strong with the technical result of a 187 million and a combined ratio of 83.4%.
If we look at slide four, we elaborate a little bit on the cost highlights, clearly a strong
quarter for the customer related ﬁgures, particularly retention rates in all areas are very
strong compared to last year, and in Denmark, in particular, we see the highest level of
retention rates for the past ﬁve years. Continue to focus on developing digital solutions
and very pleased to see a more than 45% increase in the number of customer logins in
Denmark and Norway, clearly supportive of our Capital Markets Day targets. And then we
have seen now for the third time in a row TryghedsGruppen paid out the membership
bonus in Q2, which is clearly supportive of our retention levels. We are seeing an
increased awareness of the bonus both for customers and non-customers and we want to
continue to improve that trend in the coming years.

Bloomberg Transcript

On slide ﬁve, we elaborate on the split of the technical result. As mentioned in total,
technical result for the quarter is up 4% year-on-year, despite the higher level of large
claims and weather claims, a very strong continued performance in private and
commercial, while in corporate, we still have a focus on improving proﬁtability, and then
especially in corporate Norway, we are working hard to increase proﬁtability with current
run rate of price increases of around 7%, which is a journey that we will continue in the
coming years.
On slide six, we show a little bit of background on the strong shareholder focus in Tryg,
clearly illustrated in the historical valuation development. From 2011, very strong
development in share price relative to the sector. and for the quarter, a dividend per
share of 1.65, continuing focus on stable and increasing ordinary dividends and the 1.65
should be the expectation for the coming quarters as well.
On slide eight, we show a high line growth of 4.9% compared to 2% year-on-year. Strong
development for private lines of around 5% supported by the acquisitions of FDM and
OBOS, but also a strong organic development for private Denmark and improved trend in
Norway. Commercial growth of 4% driven by OBOS in Norway, but also an increased
number of customers in both Denmark and Norway. Headline growth in corporate of
around 6%, which looks high, but in reality is only around 1%, so when adjusting for
continued growth in the guarantee business and regulations in Q2 last year. We see
clearly a drop in corporate Norway due to the proﬁtability initiatives as expected, but we
have also been able to make new agreements in low risk areas in Norway.
Private line -- when we see slide nine, we show the continued focus on increasing average
premium for all products in accordance with inﬂation, reﬂecting Tryg's focus on
proﬁtability. We are making sure that we see inﬂation as early as possible that we react to
that and we adjust prices accordingly. When you look at the increases in motor insurance
premium in Norway, particularly the increase of only 1% looks low, but it is impacted by a
regulation of one very large and proﬁtable aﬃnity agreement in Norway, while the rest of
the portfolio on motor has signiﬁcantly higher increase.

FINAL

On slide 10, we show the -- mentioned very strong development in retention rates
increasing in all areas to all time highs in several areas. And Denmark supported by the
membership bonus, but also working with insurance packages and private increases
retention and we see strong service level improving the commercial business. In Norway,
we also see an increased retention and we see in the (inaudible) focus on customer
satisfaction. And as we see it, clearly high retention rates and low costs are cornerstones
of strong value creation in our line of business.
On slide 11, we've given a new slide regarding the market as such in Norway. We've seen
some changes in the structure of the Norwegian market and also for Tryg's agreement
with Nordea, and therefore included a slide with a few facts on that. In general, we think
that history shows that consolidation is healthy for the market structure. And in general,
we believe in bancassurance, but as we also show on the right hand graph, we have seen
sales performance reducing signiﬁcantly in the recent years. And if you look at the actual
sales that happened currently in the bank branches in Norway, that is actually below 2% of
Tryg's total sales in Norway.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, the ending of the Nordea bancassurance agreement in Norway in the short run will
have a cost advantage because we don't need to pay a proﬁt commission and sales
commission. But in the long run, we want to replace that with alternative arrangements
and we have (inaudible) (been considering diﬀerent options. We also see that we have a
very strong distribution on our own of life and pension products, which we know that
several parties and potential partners ﬁnd very attractive.
Speaking of Norway, we're pleased in Q2 to see that in our Norwegian business,
underlying claims improved 0.5%, while we have a signiﬁcant proportion of our large
claims and weather claims in (Technical Diﬃculty). We're pleased to see top-line growth in
private Norway of 2.9% and year-on-year growth of 13,000 customers in Norway.
And over to you, Christian.

Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Thank you, Morten, and good morning, everyone. Turning to page 13, as Morten
communicated that we are seeing an improving underlying trend for the second quarter
of '18, which is positively impacted by our claims initiatives and the price adjustment
carried out throughout the portfolio. For the group, the underlying improvement in the
second quarter was 0.4% and we saw a continued improvement in our private business of
0.4% also, again most of this is carrying the price initiative and price increases through
our portfolio helping our underlying proﬁtability. And also especially, the proﬁtability
initiatives in our corporate Norwegian business is supporting the overall underlying
development on the group. Now as communicated before, we expect the full year '18
from underlying perspective to be better than full year 2017.
Turning to page 14, we still have a strong focus on claims inﬂation in motor. In the previous
presentation, we've showed average claims on bumpers and we've done a little upgrade
here, where we're actually seeing that the trends is not just on bumpers, but also on other

parts of the cars, I have used the headlights to show that technology is actually driving
some of the increases in claims inﬂation. Now, the frequency continues to increase
slightly, but not with the same rate as we saw in 2015 and '16, and overall, we are seeing a
general increase on claim inﬂation from motor and we'll manage this through claims
initiatives and pricing throughout the portfolio.
Now, slide 15. This is a slide that's a repeat from our Analyst Day in Bergen, where we're
kind of highlighting some of the Norwegian insurance claims inﬂation trends, broadly we
see a 4% increase in the repair cost on cars and are pushing through a 5% increase on the
prices in Norway. Now, we do have an exposure to electric cars and hybrid cars and
deﬁnitely see a diﬀerent risk proﬁles compared to normal, however, bear in mind, that
Tryg proportionately actually has a less exposure to the faster kind of models of electrical
cars, like Tesla's and the likes. So we feel quite comfortable having the electrical part
under control.
Turning to page 16, as Morten has already mentioned, we have had a larger amount of
large claims here in the second quarter of a 134 million. Now, that is higher than last
quarter, bear in mind that it's very much in line with our guidance of 550 million per
annum. Now, we are coming to a couple of quarters, where we had very low level of large
claims. And please note that almost half of the large claims are deriving from Norway in
the second quarter '18 versus a very small amount of large claims in second quarter '17.
And as Morten mentioned, you cannot see the underlying on Norway, but we are giving
you the guidance of a 0.5 improvement on the Norwegian business as a totality. Weather
claim is a bit higher than the second quarter and again mostly driven by our Norwegian
business. We are pleased that the ﬂooding in Norway did not become as severe as we
thought it would be ending our Q1 numbers. The run-oﬀ level is relative high in the
quarter, but it's also helped by some other gains we've seen in our Swedish motor thirdparty liability portfolio.
Turning to page 17 on our expenses. We're improving our expense ratio from 14.3 to 14.1.
It's helped by the initiative that was put in place during 2017 and also helped by the good
development in our top-line growth here in the second quarter. Now, the number of
employees have been increasing over the last couple of years, predominantly driven by
portfolio acquisition and an increase in some of our IT employees as we've in-sourced
some of the key personnel in IT. Expense ratio target for the full year for 2020 will be
around 14, as communicated at our CMD. Turning to page 19, which is somewhat of a
benign slide from the fact that there's not much changes either in our free portfolio or in
the split.
So turning to page 20, which is a little bit more interesting. As we are seeing an overall
negative result, I'll get more into the details on this on the next slide, Tryg remains with
the low risk proﬁle as you can see in the upper right corner that shows the market risk
capital charges versus invested assets. Now, we have 92% of all our group as ﬁxed income
asset on AAA rated and another 3% is between AAA and A rated.
Turning to page 21, which is a new slide, but we felt in this quarter it was a good quarter to
double click a little bit on our development on our investment portfolio. We have a
negative 90 million investment result in the second quarter. The free portfolio returned
Page 4 of 19

FINAL

only 10 million, equities was up only 1%, where we've gotten used to quite higher
numbers in the past. The widening of credit spreads on emerging market bond and
investment grades dragged down the overall ﬁxed income return by about 37 million. In
the free portfolio, Tryg has around 4.5 billion of covered bonds, where yields are negative.
Overall, investment income in the free portfolio remains under pressure, especially in the
quarter with almost ﬂat equities and widening credit spreads.
And our match portfolio was also slightly negative, primarily because of a slightly negative
performance. Do bear in mind that we, in Q1, had a positive performance, and year-todate, we have on the match portfolio a positive of 15 million year-to-date. Also, we have
been guiding that on our match portfolio, you should expect a zero result in general.

Bloomberg Transcript

Other ﬁnancial income and expenses at negative 85 million is impacted by our preimplementation of IFRS 16, the leasing standard of approximately 10 million per quarter.
Also, there has been an impact on our Tier 1 and increased interest cost on our Tier 2. The
cost hedging on our Norwegian equity is also aﬀecting this line and has moved up in this
quarter. In general, it's a slightly volatile post on our -- in our balance sheet on a quarterly
basis. And as communicated on our -- the fourth quarter 2017 call, we expect roughly 250
million annual cost on this, but do bear in mind the volatility on a quarter-by-quarter basis
on this line.
Turning to page 22, solvency ratio is up 292, up from 883. Our own fund is primarily
driven -- own funds upward is primarily driven by the new Tier 1 issue and the spread
between proﬁt and dividends. Our SCR increase is driven by a slight increase in market
risk. It's -- the equity dampener is up slightly, equity exposure is also up slightly, and bear
in mind that here you actually -- it's the reduction of a hedge that we have done in our
equities and also a modest high -- higher exposure on high yield bonds. Tryg continues to
expect a solvency ratio around 170, as Morten communicated, once we have the Alka
acquisition fully consolidated.
On page 23, I only want to highlight one thing, which is that our Tier 1 capacity is virtually
used once Alka is consolidated into our balance sheet and not much new on this slide
else.
And Morten, I think with those comments on investment, I would turn it over to you.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you, Christian. And I will just ﬁnalize on the targets and outlook, where we reiterate
our ﬁnancial targets, with a technical result of 3.3 billion including Alka in 2020, combined
ratio at or below 86; cost ratio at or below 14%, including a higher (Technical Diﬃculty)
investment and cost; and ROE post tax at or above 21% in 2020. Adding to that ambitious
customer targets, where we would further build upon the current positive trends in
retention, which is very strong addition to the value creation in our portfolio.
And of course, we as always end with our favorite quote, and with that we should turn to
your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator

FINAL

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And the ﬁrst question is from the line of Asbjorn Mork
from Danske Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. From my side, a couple of questions. First on Norway, if I understood
you correct, Morten, you said that the underlying claims ratio for Norway was down 50
basis points year-over-year for private lines. Was that correctly understood? And if it was,
is that what we should expect looking ahead as well?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, good morning (inaudible) Asbjorn. The 0.5 is for the total Norwegian portfolio
underlying, but otherwise, the number is correct. I think we don't guide on the speciﬁcity
on each segments underlying. We see that what we are doing currently in terms of
eﬃciency measures will over time improve our underlying further, but we don't split that
into segments as speciﬁc as that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Okay, fair enough. Then if I look at your corporate, your combined ratio, your underlying
combined ratio was basically 5% better year-over-year. You're also growing quite
signiﬁcantly in the guarantee product. I was just wondering, if you could give us a little bit
of ﬂavor on what is the combined ratio for the guarantee product at this quarter at this
stage and how you see the growth there looking ahead? Thanks.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think I'll comment a little bit on this one. There is no doubt that we kind of stopped
doing the reporting on corporate underlying because there are volatility, we see some
quarters are really being very positive and other quarters being negative, especially hit by
medium size claims. Yet, when we look at the corporate, we're happy to see that the
underlying is actually improving and in the guarantee business, it's very much in line with
what we have communicated before around the 60% combined ratio on the guarantee
business. Now, from a growth perspective, I think we are continually seeing a slow, but -and controlled growth on our guarantee and starting to take our ﬁrst step into the
German market in a very controlled manner.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Okay. But then I guess, you are still seeing a pretty decent improvement to the underlying
corporate also excluding the guarantee if you look at Q2 versus Q2 last year?

A - Christian Baltzer

FINAL

We are, Asbjorn, but we're just cautious on the trending of that because the reality is that
we see the 7% price increase in corporate Norway, which is of course positive, we need to
continue that. We're working bit hard to secure that we increase our prices also in
corporate Sweden and reduce our exposure on risk further. And then we are a little bit
hesitant to draw a -- too far the line of a trend too far into the future because the volatility
is simply high on corporate. So you're right, we appreciate positives, but we are not out of
the wood yet in corporate, not at all.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

Okay. Because if I look at the corporate, if I exclude run-oﬀ gains, exclude the guarantee,
you're basically not making that much money on the corporate. So basically, would you
expect that business to be proﬁtable in the mid-term?

A - Morten Hubbe

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Our view is that over time, we would like our retail portfolio being private and commercial
to be larger than today and we would not dislike our corporate portfolio to be smaller
than today. And having said that, we are spending a very large amount of resources,
ﬁnding the route to optimizing exposure, pricing and return in corporate. We see the
challenge by far being highest in Norway. That's why the 7% price increase starts there
and will continue for several years. We're working very hard on Sweden as well, and then
we have a group-wide initiative to look at the total exposure on corporate, where we see
the ROE in corporate as such being below what we think it should be. And therefore, we
are running this group-wide project to ensure a higher long-term ROE on corporate than
today. So within an insurance portfolio, which -- where the performance is very strong, we
are not satisﬁed with corporate, but that is a structural phenomenon that will take us a
couple of years to move, but we are quite determined to do that.

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Just a little addition to that, Morten, I think Asbjorn when you look at corporate and take
out the run-oﬀ gains, you have to bear in mind that we are setting aside more than the 3%
on corporate that is a quality line that we're putting aside for future run-oﬀ gains. So you
can't just freely take out all the run-oﬀ gains because then you're actually taking out some
of the actual quality that we're putting aside for the future.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And you should be taking out the underlying savings or margin on new claims as well. So
it is not fully meaningful.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Okay, fair enough. Then on the investment income as you also highlighted earlier this
year on the IFRS 16 and I guess the Tier 1 impact, could you just -- I know you had a slide
on it, but could you just give us a little bit of ﬂavor, where do you see sort of normalized
investment income looking ahead? What kind of level should we expect in this line?

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}
Page 7 of 19



FINAL

Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2018-07-10

Well, I think that the normalized investment income is a very interesting kind of a thing to
talk about. You could argue, we did -- in our newsletter back in 2016, we talked about 7%
on equities and I think 5%, 6% on properties and whatnot. I think currently we are seeing
an other expense that has increased compared to that newsletter we put out and we've
kind of guided that the 250 is more -- roughly the new level with some volatility as the FX
protections might have actually impacted that. I don't think we guide necessarily on
investment income, it's a small portion of our total earnings, it's a volatile portion of our
earnings and I think most of our focus is back on the technical, so back on driving a core
business that is proﬁtable in the long run.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Okay, fair enough. Then a ﬁnal question on Alka. You said that you expect it to close Q3. I
was just wondering, is that just basically because it didn't close in Q2 or do you have any
new information that makes you quite comfortable that this is actually going to close in
Q3?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think that the planning is in our hands and the synergy is in our hands. Authority
approval is not in our hands, unfortunately. We have given the guidance from authorities
side that we should expect Q3, and that is all we know and that's why we base our
expectations on that. I think certainty is a strong word, but that's the guidance we have
given.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

And there's no indication that (Multiple Speakers) sorry?

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Sorry, Asbjorn, I was just -- I think it's important to highlight what Morten mentioned in his
walk through of the numbers that Alka is actually coming out of the ﬁrst half of the year
with very good proﬁtability numbers and we can see when we talk to many that the focus
on driving the core business is still very much there. So it's -- that's very comforting from
our point of view, while we're waiting. I guess (Multiple Speakers) no, sorry, continue.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

No, I was just saying that, of course, I agree, I just wanted to see it in your hands, the
business, but I fully understand that the H1 was strong.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

But it's -- what we are doing Asbjorn is that we are detailing our planning of integration
even further and that is working out extremely well, but of course, we are as keen as you
to see the ﬁnal authority approval and we'll see that in Q3 according to the guidance of
the authorities.

Okay, that's great. If I may, just one ﬁnal question. Now, of course, '18 is going to be a very
diﬀerent year due to all the acquisitions. You still see 0% to 2% organic growth for the
year, could you maybe specify that a bit more?

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, I guess that if you look at the current trends, we are seeing improved trends
organically and then when we're seeing the bolt-ons adding to that growth and then
ultimately we will see Alka adding to that reported headline growth as well. If you need
any help specifying the splits, you're more than welcome to contact Gian or Peter oﬄine.
And I think longer-term, we have no changes to our organic outlook.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

Operator
And next question is from the line of Jakob Brink from Nordea Markets. Please go ahead,
Jakob, your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Thank you and good morning. I have two questions, please. The ﬁrst one is regarding
page 11 in the slides, at least it was in the invested one, the one with the new
bancassurance models in Norway. I know you talked about it already, Morten, but could
you give some more ﬂavor on this? I mean, a lot of things has happened since we met at
the Analyst Day in June. I think there you said that there was not so much risk capital
available in the Norwegian insurance market anymore and since then we have seen two
new partnerships. So, how do you see this all panning out, maybe just a bit more details?
And then also on dividends, the extraordinary dividend, what solvency level should we
aim for here? I mean, what level could you go down to and still pay out a dividend,
please? Thank you.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Good morning to you as well, Jakob. If you look at the Norwegian trend, I think what we
commented on the Analyst Day is that in the recent 10 years, you've seen a lot of new
entrants into the Norwegian insurance market. A lot of these have subsequently been put
up for sale or struggled to deliver results. And therefore, there is a, clearly a lot lower risk
willingness of capital to new initiatives in the Norwegian market. I think we see on this
slide a couple of examples of further consolidation, which I think is natural and as we see
it also a positive thing for the structure of the market. I don't think it will make big
diﬀerences to the market, but it shows that a couple of players have found initiatives to do
business together instead of one by one. And to be honest, we see strong competitors
and consolidation in the market as a positive.
We also commented on the bancassurance as such because I guess if you go back a
number of years, bank branches were selling a lot of insurance also for Tryg, but what we
show in these graphs is that over the recent years, that has been reduced signiﬁcantly to
Page 9 of 19



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2018-07-10

the point where today this is more a leads generating machine for the Tryg business. And
thereby, we have both the opportunity to work with other leads and work with other
partners in the future and that is a process we have been preparing for a while. So
hopefully that gives you some idea of the magnitude of that cooperation currently.

FINAL

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

(Multiple Speakers) Solvency rate -- yeah, go ahead.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Just -- sorry, on the Norway thing. So what would you expect yourself would be the topline impact for you because of the (inaudible) and Nordea partnership or acquisition and
the partnership afterwards?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Broadly speaking, we would expect to be able to replace that currently below 2%
distribution with other arrangements, both moving our own sales force towards other
leads from OBOS, from NITO, from (inaudible) et cetera because today we actually have
only so much distribution capacity and using that on other leads is fully possible. And
then longer-term, exploiting any of the other opportunities with other potential partners
because working together with banks we believe make sense, both for the banks and for
us and we also see that we have, as mentioned, a very strong own distribution of life and
pension, in which we ﬁnd several parties in Norway that is interested in. So there might be
a little bit of movement short-term, but longer-term, we will be able to replace that and I
don't see that having any severe impact.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

So, Jakob, to your second question, I think we've been trying to be somewhat clear that
we don't really guide on our solvency level of what we accept or not. We have
communicated that the 125 is where we think the Danish FSA would knock on our door
and kind of ask for plans and what we are doing. I think for us, it's an annual process that
we do year-end, where we look at our solvency position, we look at our prognosis, we
kind of run simulation on what we believe is the right thing and where for us to keep in
mind is the stability of our ordinary dividend and we also have our ROE target. So the
stability of our ordinary dividend and our ROE targets are the two kind of components
that are making -- that are put into the kind of -- the ingredients that are put into the pie in
order to ﬁgure out whether there will be extraordinary dividend. And I think we were
trying to communicate very clearly that for 2018, we do not expect that to be the case.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I guess, if you look at it slightly longer-term, when you do the math, it's quite clear, but if
we don't return to extraordinary dividends, then our general equity will grow too much

Page 10 of 19



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2018-07-10

and then we will struggle with our ROE and that is the kind of discipline we've installed in
the model and that is the kind of discipline we will continue.

Q - Ida Gjosund

{BIO 19788453 <GO>}

Good morning. A few questions from me as well. On your Norwegian underlying
business, you mentioned an improvement of 0.5 percentage points year-over-year. Is this
a result of price increases in corporate or eﬃciency measures? A bit color on this would
be great. And then second, Morten, you have mentioned previously that there are some
synergies between the corporate business and the rest of the business in Norway. Could
you remind us of what those are, again, just trying to understand if there are any
consequences for the rest of the business, if you exited corporate in Norway? And then
last on the run-oﬀ gains, which are close to 7% this quarter. I was wondering, if you still
expect this level to come down to somewhere between 3% and 5% in 2020? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Ida, I think I'll do number one and three, and Morten will take the second question. On
Norway underlying, I think deﬁnitely here we're seeing both corporate, commercial and
private pulling in. As you're mentioning, this is price increases carried out within
corporate business that are deﬁnitely helping, but it's also the proﬁtability measures that
are done on our procurement side in general and also just on our overall kind of pruning
our business. So it's both -- kind of both things that are impacting our underlying
development. I think the reason why we are trying to give you a guidance on the
underlying development is when you look at the headline numbers for Norway, it's kind of
hard to kind of dissect what is large claim, what is weather claims or (inaudible) claims and
whatnot. So that's why we're giving that kind of input.
On the run-oﬀ gains, yes, you're right that it's in the higher range. I think that we are still
maintaining our 3 to 5 guidance for 2020. There's no doubt when we look at our
reserving position in Tryg, it is strong and also why we have the ability to have this almost
7% run-oﬀ gain for the quarter, but there will be a little ﬂuctuation on this post also going
forward.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And I guess lastly, Ida, on your synergies question and corporate Norway. First, we don't
have any plans to exit corporate Norway, but what we're trying to say is one, we want our
proﬁtability in corporate to be higher than today, and that is actually not only for Norway,
that is across all three countries. And then, as far as synergies is concerned, you're right,
that's an important topic because when you just look at the headline numbers, you might

miss the point that on underwriting on brokers on larger claims management, there is a
synergy between commercial and corporate. And then secondly, of course, corporate
helps also pull their weight on the group IT expenses, group staﬀ functions, et cetera, et
cetera, which means that corporate adds to the group also in addition to what you can
see in the reported numbers, but that does not at all change the fact that we have a
strong ambition to create a higher return in corporate in isolation and that is what we are
working very hard on both in Norway and Sweden and across all three countries.

And next question is from the line of Mads Thinggaard from ABG. Please go ahead, your
line is open.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Yeah, hi, this is Mads from ABG. I have a couple of questions left. The ﬁrst one is regarding
the underlying claims that we are seeing this 0.4% drop year-over-year, I think, for two
quarters now. I mean, is that kind of when you guide for lower underlying claims in '18 and
perhaps also going forward with all your initiatives, is that kind of what you should look for
year-over-year a 40 basis point drop in underlying claims?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Good morning, Mads. I think actually last quarter, we've communicated that the rates of
the improvement would be roughly what we have been reporting the last couple of
quarters. I think on private, it's less volatile, so you'll probably see that range on the
private book. And on group level, we do see some volatility up and down. So whether it's
exactly 0.4, I don't think I would put down, but we will see an overall year-on-year
improvement in the range of what we have seen in the ﬁrst two quarters for the full year.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Okay, thanks. And then I'm just a bit curious. I mean, moving back to the run-oﬀ gains, I
mean, when you started kind of skewing expectations down to this 3% of 5% in 2020,
were you kind of thinking a kind of a path into that where you would have this 6.6% in Q1
and 6.8% in Q2 '18 or are you seeing something that is actually a bit surprisingly high in
your view here?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think, Mads, that the way we see it, some of our liabilities are between 15 and 20 years,
so generally, we see liabilities and run-oﬀs as a long-term trend question. But from
quarter-to-quarter, there will be volatility. We're seeing now, for instance, in this quarter,
signiﬁcantly higher large claims, more weather claims and higher run-oﬀs. So in some
quarters, we've seen the opposite trend and we will see those kinds of ﬂuctuations from
quarter-to-quarter, but the general trend is a controlled process from the elevated level
Page 12 of 19



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2018-07-10

towards a slightly more normal level in a rather smooth steady process. So not very
surprising. And a thing you will see also in future quarters, volatility quarter-on-quarter
and on a longer-term trend that mirrors the path we've explained.

FINAL

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Okay. Okay, thanks. And then just one last kind of technical or speciﬁcation here. I mean,
as I understood you -- if I understood you correct, you have -- it's like Tryg in Nordea
employees behind 3 percentage point of the distribution in -- I mean, in private Norway
and then you say -- I mean, you think you can kind of (inaudible) et cetera using those
employees. I mean, is this in addition to this -- the -- I mean, the cross-selling or lead sales
you already planned before this deal between Nordea and Gjensidige?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, your perception is completely right. I think what one needs to bear in mind is that
partnership agreements are very important for the lead generation, but also that our total
distribution capacity only has a bandwidth of so much. So what we're seeing is that
currently we have actually a very strong position in Norway to make sure we have strong
leads to our sales force and that we are able to use those new partnership agreements for
leads to our current sales force. And therefore, as such, it's not mechanical that less than
2% or this 3% of our staﬀ in Nordea branches will fall away, it is more a redirection of
those sales resources towards other leads.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

That doesn't take away the view that we want to do bancassurance in Norway longer-term,
anyway. It is just to give a perspective that what actually falls away is below 2%, which is
the actual sale by Nordea staﬀ in the branches. The other part of it is actually the leads
that we can move to other partnership agreements and then longer-term we want to
replace and ﬁnd a new structure for bancassurance corporation. And then we actually
make the comment on the slide as well that if you want to be cynical then actually shortterm we have higher proﬁtability without bancassurance because it's actually quite
expensive, but that doesn't change the fact that longer-term we see the value creation of
bancassurance and therefore we will want to work with new partner in Norway as well.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just one left actually. So just
thinking a bit more about pricing versus claims inﬂation trends. Just wanted to conﬁrm
that you're still pricing ahead of claims inﬂation on average at the group level. I can see in
Norwegian motor, you're seeing 5% price versus 4% claims inﬂation. I felt like maybe a bit
early you're ﬂagging higher claims inﬂation in motor. I just wonder, if there's anything to
worry about there? Have you managed to stay ahead of that curve with the pricing
increases or have you fallen behind? Thanks.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Good morning, Jonny. I think that on an overall group perspective, we're seeing on
average the 3% price increases carry out throughout the entire book and we have an
expectation between 2% and 2.5% inﬂation. So yes, we are carrying out price increases
ahead of inﬂation. Now, I think the underlying development that you see on private is also
the kind of the show that we actually are carrying out these numbers. I think motor has
just been a conversation topic on -- in many diﬀerent kind of calls here, but also with some
of our peers, which is why we are highlighting both some of the risks that are in motor,
but also some of the initiatives that we're pushing through. And I think when you do lineby-line, there will be lines where we are pricing much more ahead of the inﬂation and
there are other lines where we are more on par and that's kind of our portfolio we are
massaging in -- throughout the year or throughout the year so that we kind of on average
do the 3% and have about 2% to 2.5% inﬂation.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. Also a couple of questions from my side. You talked about 13,000
new clients in Norway, your growth numbers looks great. But I'm looking in your report, I
cannot really ﬁnd any organic growth numbers. Can you tell us what the organic growth
has been in the ﬁrst half, and if possible, divide it on what it was in Denmark, what it was
in Norway?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think we would have to revert. Good morning, Per. I think I'll actually let Gian and Peter
get back to you with those numbers. I think it's closer to what we've been guiding at the 0
to 2%, and probably closer to the 0% to 1% on -- when you take organic only. Deﬁnitely,
there has been the positive development of some of our acquisitions. So we will get you
the speciﬁc numbers after the call.

If we look the main -- well, if I can just elaborate a little bit, Per, our organic growth doesn't
jump on a quarterly basis, it's a quite stable number. I think what is mainly impacting
organic growth at the moment is that retention rates are increasing. So there is no
signiﬁcant jumps in organic growth.

FINAL

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. When I look at the latest data from the Danish insurance organization, they are
talking about an industry growth in Denmark of 5.8 in the ﬁrst quarter. Looks like, you are
growing signiﬁcantly less and I actually assume that you had pricing power due to the
client dividend from TryghedsGruppen. How should I look at the gap between your
organic growth and the market growth? Do you have any comments on that?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

If you look at private Denmark speciﬁcally, we are currently growing more than 6%,
around 6.5%. In my view, that is more than the market growth. I think maybe we should
revert and comment more because I don't think the general market growth is 5.8% at all.
So maybe, we should look into that statistics, Per, and give you some feedback on that. I
think on average, the Danish market has been growing more like 2% than 5.8%, so that
number sounds surprisingly high. So I think we would need to understand what that
number is.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

I'm also a bit surprised to see the last two months where we have seen pretty high growth.
I mean, you are talking about 6% growth in private Denmark, that's still including
(inaudible) growth. The organic growth is clearly lower, I assume.

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Exactly. Yeah, it is clearly low. Yes. So 5.8% Danish market growth would be fantastic, but
that doesn't sound right.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

I was also surprised when (inaudible) the last two months of data. My ﬁnal question.
Sweden, your country result for Sweden versus -- indicate that you have a signiﬁcant loss
in corporate Sweden. Can you indicate how high is the combined ratio for corporate
Sweden this quarter?

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

I think you can actually reverse your numbers into corporate Sweden, if you kind of
subtract the Sweden result and the private result, there's no doubt that we have a
signiﬁcant run-oﬀ loss on our old year -- prior year development on one single (Technical
Diﬃculty), but we're also seeing some run-oﬀ gains on our other Swedish portfolio in our
motor MTPL. So I think this is a one-oﬀ thing that we have noticed in corporate Sweden
but as Morten mentioned, corporate Sweden is deﬁnitely an area where our focus is on
pricing, pruning and exposure kind of reduction in general.

FINAL

It's fair to say, Per, on corporate Sweden that our liability business in Sweden has given us
some very large claims and also that we see our professional motor segment in corporate
Sweden with negative margins as well. So there are several areas of corporate Sweden,
where earnings is not satisfactory, which impacts this quarter negatively. But also, if you
take away the (inaudible) reﬂects a unsatisfactory balance between risk and pricing. So
we're working quite hard to mitigate that.

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, good morning. Thank you very much. And just a sort of a follow-up on the technical
and then one or two questions on the investment side, please. So ﬁrstly on the technical
result. On the 50 bps improvement underlying in Norway, just trying to understand, is this
in anyway giving or should give us more conﬁdence that in the future years, so '19, '20,
when this sort of 40 bps steady path could actually evolve into something slightly higher?
So that's -- I mean, is there -- is that giving us more hope? So that's one question.
Second question is on the emerging market bonds. I mean, it's a very small portion of the
asset base, but it's probably the biggest line item now in the P&L. Is there any -- in the 1H,
I mean, is there any thinking around whether we should -- you should be there or any
other hedges you would like to place around that?
And then, I also noticed this equities, which is quite low compared to what we could see
from the outside. And then you also have removed the hedge from hedges. Was it -- I
mean, even after removing hedges, lower thing. If this -- could you comment a bit upon
this hedge action? And sorry, one sort of strategic question. This new partnership that you
could explore in Norway or banking, can it be imagined to be sort of a similar size of
budget in your mind or any guidance on what scale you are looking at? Thank you very
much.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I will start out. Vinit. Good morning to you. On the technical part, as you mentioned, on
Norway, the 0.5, I think in general, when you look at Norway and we're seeing retention
rates going up, we are seeing our portfolio having more traction on the price increases on
corporate and we're also seeing kind of customer satisfaction in general in Norway kind of
increasing. I think there are many positive trends in Norway that are making us kind of
pleased to see. Whether this should make you more bullish on the underlying business in
total, that would be up to you and your models, I think in general, we are seeing the slow

Page 16 of 19

FINAL

kind of progression on underlying development of this year, of the level that we have
seen to be what you also would be seeing going forward.
With respect to the emerging market bond, I think in the newsletter we have back in 2016,
we actually have an emerging market index. And I think if you look up that index, it's
about roughly minus 5%, which is also what we're pretty much posting, even though it's,
as you said, a fairly low amount of exposure only with the 400, and I think it's 30 [ph]
some million in exposure, it does impact us when we have a negative movement of minus
5%, 6% in this quarter. Now, could we do something to hedge this, I think that we are not
positioning ourselves to do any changes in the emerging market, the ﬁxed income area,
it's deﬁnitely been some of the trade war, it's kind of some of the political scene that has
given us some of this volatility. We would love to see the reversal of that, but we're not
changing our position as we think the diversiﬁcation eﬀect that we are getting and
diversity in our portfolio is positive.

Bloomberg Transcript

And your last question on the investment part was the equities of 1.1 versus what you
could expect. I think you're right, we are a little lower than expectation or benchmark in
an emerging -- or in the kind of MSCI world. Sometimes, we're above, sometimes we are
below. And in this quarter, we are little below. I think with respect to the hedge that we've
talked about, in the end of the second quarter, we removed a downward hedge on
equities, expecting a couple of quarters of upward movement equities and didn't need
kind of the protection downwards, which then impacts our SCR with about the 109 million
in total on the market risk. So you're right that we have taken out some hedge. You can -you'll more see that in the SCR than you'd actually see it in our results.
So, Morten, I don't know, if you want to comment on (Multiple Speakers)
The new partner question, I think, Vinit, it's important to see that ﬁrst of all the magnitude
is not very high. Secondly, the solution is one that would be a combination of organic
redirecting sales resources to other leads, where we have strong new agreements with
new partners ready and then new partner agreements with bank. And there's no doubt
that for us having some level of sales through banks longer-term has a value creation in
there. And typically for banks or the life insurance company, it's attractive for them that we
are able to sell a -- it'd be a signiﬁcant distribution capacity in life and pension. Whether
future agreements is with one partner of a similar size or with several partners, I think both
options are on the table and we have been working on these options for a while and we
see good opportunities in the market and we see that we have time to ﬁnd those
solutions and really that we are in no rush to ﬁnd short-term solutions, this is really about
ﬁnding the longer-term value creation. And I think there's no doubt that the banks in the
Nordics are changing their digital landscape signiﬁcantly. We are doing the same. So it's
also a matter of ﬁnding the new distribution and collaboration models that will work in a
more digital world because we are clearly moving away from the more old fashioned
model of bank employees, selling insurance and the bank branches. So we expect to
replace it both organically and with partners and that could be one partner or it could be
several partners.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on the question that Vinit just asked
about the options you have for Norway bancassurance and really go into a bit more detail
on trying to understand, which banks don't have any agreements in place already in
Norway or don't have any non-life businesses established currently in Norway. So I'm
trying to sort of gain a picture of the whole landscape throughout the Norwegian non-life
bancassurance deals. And then on a separate question, Morten, I think you mentioned in
one of your comments in the press release about TrygXplore, can you explain a bit more
about this and what do you mean by making it easier to be Tryg? Thank you.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning to you, Steven. Well, on the bancassurance side, ﬁrst of all, it's important
to say that it has two sides to the coin. One would be banks selling insurance for us and
the other would be us selling life and pension for a bank or their life company. So it is
both sides of the coin. I don't think it would be wise for me to comment on speciﬁc names
in the negotiations phase, so I think you'll have to be a little bit patient and we'll
communicate more when we have new agreements to communicate about.
When we look at TrygXplore, I think it's fair to say that we've seen in the recent years a
more positive trend on innovation and growth in Denmark than in Norway. And therefore,
we have directed more of our innovation capacity also towards Norway and TrygXplore is
an example of that. What we see is -- let me give you a couple of examples. We have
started a corporation with the Norwegian startup called Lifekeys, which focuses on
psychology treatments, which is clearly an area that's interesting for us because we see
that insurance of people and health will be a growing area for Tryg in the coming years.
Second example is IMO [ph], which is a German initiative, which focuses on 3D body
scanning as part of health and preventing claims and being observant of health issues
that you should manage. Again, relating to health, which we see will be a growing part of
our business. But I guess, your last question, Steven, on making it easier to (inaudible) and
Tryg component both tells you that we want to more work harder on preventing claims
and advising customers on how to prevent claims and making it easier as much about the
customer experience on the digital journey. We see now that almost 50% increase in the
number of customers that contacts us online just year-on-year and making more and
more digital solutions that makes it easier to cooperate with us on faster claims handling,
automatic claims handling or be that on servicing, et cetera. That is a major area of focus
because a lot of customers still ﬁnd it's frustrating and diﬃcult to be in contact with an
insurance customer -- insurance company. So those are the main components in easy and
Tryg.
