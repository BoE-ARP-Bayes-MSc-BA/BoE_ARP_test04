Thank you Matt. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our call.
Notwithstanding a record first quarter for U.S. weather events for Axis, 2021 is off to a
promising start. Our consolidated current year ex-cat loss ratio of 55, ex-cat combined
ratio of 89, and sub 99 all in combined ratio, all provide solid additional data points
indicating that our work to reposition our business is delivering a portfolio that is both
more profitable and more resilient than that of prior years. And it appears that our
momentum is only accelerating. This represents the seventh quarter in the last nine that
we delivered improvements in our core underwriting performance, highlighting a clear
positive trend in our results. Our insurance business is firing on all cylinders, taking
advantage of attractive market conditions to grow premiums -- gross premiums written by
17%, delivering an ex-cat combined ratio of 88 with a two-point reduction in each of the
attritional loss and expense ratios. Even the cat loss ratio showed the progress at less
than six points to bring our all in insurance combined ratio to below 94. In addition, our
reinsurance team is contributing equally to our progress with continued underwriting
discipline and portfolio management emphasizing enhanced profitability and managing
volatility.
Our reinsurance current year ex-cat combined ratio improved again to 85, allowing us to
absorb the U.S. winter storm losses, and still reported 100 all in combined ratio. I'm
confident that our continuing improvement of the portfolio will lead to increased
profitability and further reduce our vulnerability to cat events.
We've added and continue to add strong underwriting talent to bolster our efforts to
drive profitable growth. And we feel very good about our team, our culture and our
consistent ability to attract top caliber talent. We worked very hard to get to this point.
There's a strong sense of optimisms throughout the organization and we're excited
about the future.
I pass the floor to Pete Vogt, who will walk us through the first quarter financials, then I'll
come back to discuss market trends and we'll have a Q&A. Pete?

Thank you, Albert. And good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we generated strong
results featuring net income available to common shareholders of $116 million and an
annualized ROE of 9.9%. Operating income was $83 million and an annualized operating
ROE of 7.1%. As Albert noted, core underwriting results continue to show improvement as
the company produced a current accident year combined ratio ex-cat and weather of
89.2% or over four points better than the prior year quarter. As previously announced the
quarter pre-tax cat and weather-related losses, net of reinstatement premiums were $110
million or 10.1 points. The cat for the quarter were primarily attributable to the Texas area
winter storms, as those events contributed $88 million of cat, weather-related losses to
the quarter. The consolidated current accident year loss ratio ex-cat weather was 55.1%, a
decrease of two points over prior year with the decrease attributable to both segments.
The consolidated acquisition cost ratio is 19.8%, also a decrease of two points, and again
the decrease was attributable to both segments. The consolidated G&A expense ratio of
14.3% was a slight decline to the first quarter of 2020. Overall, operating efficiency and
expense control remain important goals for us. And we continue to target G&A ratio in the
low 14s for 2021. Fee income from strategic capital partners was $12 million this quarter
compared to $16 million in the prior year quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'll now discuss the segments. I'll start insurance where we had some impressive
performance across the number of metrics this quarter. The gross premiums written
increased 17% to $1.1 billion this quarter. The increase primarily came from new business
and favorable rate changes in the professional lines, property, marine and liability lines.
Net premiums written grew -- growth was higher and I'd note that reinstatement
premiums paid last year was a contributing factor to that growth.
During the quarter, the insurance for an accident year combined ratio ex-cat weather
decreased by four points from last year as the repositioning of the portfolio continued to
earn through. The current accident year loss ratio, ex-cat weather decreased by 1.9 points
in the quarter, principally due to favorable pricing over loss trends across virtually all lines
of business and improved loss experience in property lines associated with the
repositioning of that portfolio. These positives were partially offset by a large marine
cargo loss. The acquisition cost ratio decreased by a point in the first quarter compared to
2020 mainly attributable to the increase in ceding commissions associated with the
growth in professional lines. The underwriting related G&A expense ratio decreased by
slightly over a point in the quarter, largely attributable to an increase in net premiums
earned.
Let's now move over to the reinsurance segment. The reinsurance segment's gross
premiums written of $1.4 billion for the first quarter was $58 million or 4% lower than the
prior year. Gross premiums written decreased in motor, engineering and catastrophe lines
as we look to better balance the portfolio. This decrease was partially offset by selective
increases in liability lines, where turns were attractive.
During the quarter, the reinsurance current accident year combined ratio ex-cat weather
decreased by over four points from 2020 as the repositioning of this portfolio continue to
earn through. The current accident year loss ratio ex-cat weather decreased by 1.6 points
in the first quarter principally due to favorable pricing over loss trends in most lines of
Page 3 of 16

FINAL

business. And benefits associated with the repositioning of the portfolio. This was partially
offset by an increase in loss experience in non-cat property lines. The acquisition cost ratio
decreased by over three points in the quarter due to changes in business mix driven by
reductions in proportional business including trade credit and non-cat property. The
underwriting related G&A expense ratio increased by 0.5 point in the quarter attributable
to the decrease in net premiums earned.
Net investment income for the quarter was $114 million, and this was $21 million higher
than the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to increase in returns from alternative
investments. This increase was principally related to private equity funds and hedge
funds, which are reported on a one-quarter lag, so that performance is indicative of the
fourth quarter of 2020. It was also helped by a gain of $17 million associated with sale of a
venture capital investment. This was partially offset by decrease in income from fixed
maturities attributable to decreased yields on the portfolio.

Bloomberg Transcript

At quarter end, the fixed income portfolio had a book yield of 2.1% and a duration of 3.3
years and our new money yield was 1.5%. For the quarter, you'll note there was a higher
than usual effective tax rate, this was driven by earnings and capital gains realized in the
U.S. and Europe while the losses from the winter storms mostly impacted the Bermuda
balance sheet. Diluted book value per share decreased by $2.06 in the quarter to $53.03.
This was principally driven by the decrease in net unrealized gains reported in other
comprehensive income due to the rise in interest rates. Overall, the continued
improvement in most operating metrics and momentum in the core underwriting book
notwithstanding notable cat weather events. This was a good quarter for AXIS.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Albert.

Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you, Pete. Let's do a brief overview of market conditions and outlook. And then
we'll open the call for questions. Across both our insurance and reinsurance segments, we
saw positive rate action continue during the first quarter. This represents the 14th
consecutive quarter in which we've seen overall rate increases in our insurance book. And
the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit average rate hike. This quarter, the average
insurance rate increase was up about 13%. This is more than three points higher than the
first quarter of 2020, but sequentially down from last year's fourth quarter reported level
of 18%. In most lines, we monitor sequential rate of change in pricing has increased, while
it has remained flat or crusted in others.
Looking at our insurance segment by region, the U.S. is strongest with average rate
increases of close to 15% while the London market is up nearly 10%. By overall line, in
insurance, liability is strongest with increases at close to 18% with the best conditions in
U.S. excess casualty space at plus 25, while primary casualty is in the mid teens. European
rates are up in the mid to high single digits.
Professional lines are close behind with average rate increases at 17%. Strongest is our
London book where we're seeing great increases in the mid to high 20s. Canada, U.S.

D&O and financial institutions are all strong with increases in the 19% to 20% range, but
with sub-lines over 30%. Cyber is accelerating rapidly with increases anywhere from the
mid-teens to the high 20s. Property averaged up about 10% with U.S. E&S property and
global property strongest in the 13% to 14% range while other lines were more in the high
single digits. Our portfolios specialty lines, including marine, political risk and NH saw
increases that averaged in the high single digits. Although here again, many sub-lines are
in the double-digit range. For example, marine, cargo and facilities are up 15% and 16 %,
while the aviation was strong at 18%. Overall, virtually all of the insurance portfolio
renewed flat to up with more than 50% of the book achieving renewal rate increases
above 10%. New business we feel is priced at least as well as renewal business.

Bloomberg Transcript

In this environment, our insurance team did very well. Retentions are up versus last year's
first quarter, and new business production set a new record. I would observe that with
these recent changes in pricing more of the opportunities that we're seeing are meetings
our hurdles. Indeed the past two quarters have been the largest insurance production
quarters in our company's history.
Let's move on to reinsurance. In the first quarter, the estimated overall reinsurance rate
change was up about 11%. Rates were strongest in the U.S., and global specialty lines with
increases in the 12% range. While EMEA, which for us is Europe, Middle East, Africa and
Latin America was up about 10%. And Asia saw average increases in the low single digits.
But on the business, professional lines saw increases that average in the mid-teens with
our EMEA region up 17% and U.S. up 12%. Liability averaged increases in the low teens
globally, with the rates up 14% in EMEA, 12% at Lloyd's and 10% in the U.S. Generally, we
found other specialty reinsurance lines to be up in the double-digit range while aviation
was much higher reaching up to 40%.
In the first quarter, property cat averaged about 16% in the U.S. while we saw increases in
the 5% to 10% range in the rest of the world. We found these rates to be unimpressive
given recent property cat losses, a fact which we were again reminded with the U.S.
winter storms. Non-cat property changes were generally in the single digits. Given the
property and cat pricing we observed, our underwriting actions led to a reduction of
approximately 5% in the gross writings and premiums of our property and cat reinsurance
in the first quarter. All in, our first quarter reinsurance gross written premiums were down
about 4% as we focused on enhancing the profitability and reducing the volatility of our
book all the while growing in the more attractive lines.
Looking at April 1 reinsurance renewals, rate momentum was in line with our expectations.
We're seeing evidence of a growing supply of capital and competition which may in the
future dampen the overall improvements that are needed across the sector. The largest
part of our renewal was Japan, where we experienced property cat and non-cat rates
increasing in the 5% to 10% range, but where loss impacted risk and (inaudible) treaties
were renewed rates were a bit higher than that. Elsewhere, U.S., professional lines saw
increases of 11% and U.S. liability was up more than 20%. Overall, we booked a modest
reduction to expiring premiums at the April 1 renewals.
I'm not concerned about the premium reductions in reinsurance. One of the benefits of
being a hybrid company is that we have access to business across lines in many markets

and geographies. It gives us a wealth of choices from which to choose and create the
best optimized portfolio under available circumstances. I'm just as proud of the strong
growth delivered by our insurance team in attractive market, as I am by the disciplined
response exhibited by our reinsurance team under more mixed market conditions. They
both contribute to building the best portfolio for AXIS in terms of balance, profitability and
lower volatility.
Stepping back. As we look to the months ahead, we anticipated favorable market
conditions will continue throughout the year and very likely into next year. Even if in some
lines rates of increase come off their peak levels. The many issues that our industry is
facing right now including low interest rates, ongoing uncertainty as to longer-term
impacts of the COVID pandemic, loss cost inflation and climate change should sustain
pricing discipline. And if relative market conditions stay as they are currently with the
environment more favorable than insurance, we anticipate that much of our growth will
continue to be focused there particularly in non-cat expose lines of business.
As we continue to build our optimized one AXIS portfolio, we see the hybrid model as a
competitive differentiator providing us with flexibility to allocate capital to the areas of our
business that are offering the best returns. And as I said earlier, we feel great about the
future, we're in a good place right now and we believe the wind is at our backs. And while
we're seeing exciting progress throughout our business and we're actively taking
advantage of all of the opportunities presented by the current market, we feel
encouragement, we see our momentum, we're satisfied with this quarter's results, but
we're not satisfied with where we are overall and we know there is much to do and we
remain focused on delivering additional progress towards the achievement of our goals
and ambitions.
Our action plan is very straightforward to make the most of the current market to both
enhance the balance of our portfolio and grow profitably to invest in talent and
technology, to accelerate growth in existing and new markets and to leverage technology
and growth, increase our capabilities, productivity and efficiency, while lowering our overall
expense ratio. We believe that all of the years of hard work to reposition the business are
now starting to be more fully reflected in our financial results and we look forward to
continuing to keep you updated with our progress.
And with that, let's please open the line for questions. Operator?

Hi, thanks. A couple of them here. First, you talked a little bit about cyber and the prices
going on. Can you talk about kind of loss trends continuing in that line of business and just
give us kind of a quick update after last quarter's kind of elevated lost specs in that area?

FINAL

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Good morning, Brian. There, we're continuing to see things kind of within our
expectations. Obviously, we've made a number of changes in the portfolio during the
year. We continue to do that. So, we feel our actions are doing good impact on our overall
results. We think pricing is going to continue. But by and large, I would say that cyber in the
first quarter met our expectations. Combined ratio below 100 is kind of doing what we
expect it to do.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. And then my next question. Just curious, so two of the lines of business you
mentioned that you reduced in the reinsurance area were non-cat-exposed property and
trade credits on a quota share basis. I'm just curious I would have thought that those two
lines of business are probably pretty attractive right now from an underlying kind of
season's economics perspective. Why would you be reducing those lines?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

They're two different issues. I think on the non-cat side -- on the non-cat property side,
we've been I think pretty clear in telling you that reducing the volatility is a very important
goal of ours, and there's no doubt that property cat had increasingly, especially -- the noncat property actually has a very large amount of cat property in it. And so, we found that it
was contributing a lot to our volatility.
And I go back to the point I made earlier, one of the great things as a hybrid is we can
take property cat volatility anywhere in the world, insurance, reinsurance, E&S standard,
whatever. And right now, the best returns for us are in the E&S property space. And so, if
we're going to -- for what property cat-exposed volatility we're willing to take, we're
getting better paid right now on the insurance property and E&S property side. And we
think that's a smarter place to put our exposure.
With regards to the credits, and you'll notice we actually reduced credit both in insurance
and reinsurance and I think, frankly, that's just a question of where the economy is and
where the opportunities are. And, again, that's just following where the market is. Now,
we are adding a little bit less quarter share credit. And that's just because when you add
the very high acquisition expense ratios to reduce volatility there. we think a smaller
amount of that business makes sense for us.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Makes sense. And then last question, just curious acquisition cost ratio continues to come
down. I know you talked a little bit about that. Should we continue to see that coming
down during the course of the year both in insurance and on the reinsurance side?

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

FINAL

Well, again, we're not big on giving guidance, but what I will tell you is what drives these
things. So, part of the drivers of reducing the acquisition expense ratio on the insurance
side is that, as we're repositioning credit portfolio, favoring certain lines versus others,
we're writing a little bit less cover holder business. That cover holder business, as you
know, have generally a higher acquisition ratio. So, as we write less of that cover holder
business, that will have a lower acquisition impact.
And the other thing is we've got a good growth book of business. Reinsurers are happy
to participate in that book. And we've been able to get a good ceding commissions to
offset our acquisition expense. So, those kinds of things are moving in our favor.
On the reinsurance side, it's also a question of, as I've just discussed, reducing some of
the higher acquisition expense lines of business that we feel ultimately are not giving us
the technical ratio we want. So, the trend that you're seeing in Q1, I think, is consistent with
what we're expecting,. But Peter, I don't know if you want to add anything to that?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. The only thing that I'd add, Brian, is remember when we talked early about what our
expectations were for '21, we said we thought the acquisition cost should come down by
at least a point. I think we said improve a point in our discussions with folks. And this is full
year. Last year, it was 21.3. I said as it come down to around 20, we'd get a little bit more
actions. So, now, it's in the 19s. I would say the first quarter is representative of what I
expect for the rest of the year.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

My first question goes back to reinsurance. I guess, I get that you have the hybrid
capabilities here and it allows you to kind of pick and choose where you want to play. Is
there a -- what's the end play for the reinsurance segment? Is it going to be as dominant
part of the business over time or is it something that really becomes a much smaller
component of the overall business?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

FINAL

I think, what you've seen over the history of this company is that we've kind of gone up
and down growth rates of each of the segments based on the opportunities there. I don't
want to say right now that reinsurance is always going to go down. I don't want to say that
reinsurance is always going to go up. I don't want to say it's the same. I think it really
depends on where the opportunities are.
What I will say is that over the last two three years, we've been spending more and more
time running not two portfolios, one insurance portfolio, one reinsurance portfolio, but
increasingly running one portfolio. And when you run one portfolio, you really have the
opportunity to choose. And in some cases, we're going to make the call on the insurance
side. In some cases, we're going to make the call on the reinsurance side. And we will
focus very much on how we build that best portfolio.

Bloomberg Transcript

There are some lines of business right now, for example, where we prefer to allocate our
capacity much more on the insurance side. Good example of that would be on cyber.
Most of what we -- we write some on reinsurance side, but most of it we write on the
insurance side. We think that's the better way to play it. Certainly, I will tell you that I'm
very, very grateful for all of the contributions that reinsurance makes to the lines of
business that we do not write in insurance.
We're a very strong E&S player. We're very strong in the wholesale markets in the US and
in the London market. But that in and of itself tends to be a book of business that is very
focused. That has generally a little bit of volatility to it. And we can add -- with our
reinsurance book, we can add some very good international business that we don't have
access to, very good standard lines of business we don't have access to. So I think that
the two of them will always be at every planning session, at every quarterly review. All of
the opportunities come up from the bottom. They get explored. They look -- we look at
what contributes to the best portfolio and we move in that direction.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And my second question. Looking at the underlying loss
ratio in insurance, I think if we adjust for the runoff losses that you had in 1Q '20, you got
to about a point of improvement year-over-year. Is that all coming from rate over trend?
Or do you see maybe some impact from kind of the slowdown in the economy and
maybe courts being closed also benefiting the loss ratio.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Peter, you can follow up on that. But what I would tell you is we're not, I can tell you that as
a part -- general part of our reserving philosophy, we are reserving kind of our
expectations or (inaudible) there was a dire number. We recognize absolutely as you say
that right now there may be short term factors. And so, we're not letting favorable A
versus E impact where we're booking these loss ratios. We're taking a more prudent
views than that. Peter, you want to add to this?

FINAL

Yeah. I'd say that we have been seeing, as you noted, some favorable ADs, but we're not
letting that flow through to the bottom-line. There is an expectation that when the court
open up that there will be claims that will go into those courts. And so, we'll wait and see
what happens in the future. And I think you're about right, if I look at the adjustments with
the book that has run-off, which was very poorly, that's about eight-tenth of the 1.9 and
the rest of it really is coming from good rate over trend as well as some other
underwriting actions in obviously the property portfolio.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Got it. And the runoff is essentially done here?

A - Peter J. Vogt

The next question is from Derek Han of KBW.

Q - Derek Han

{BIO 20338442 <GO>}

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I really wanted to touch on how you're
thinking about capital deployment opportunities for the balance of the year. On the
reinsurance side, you've obviously had significant underwriting actions and you've pulled
back your cat-exposed businesses. But is that something that could potentially change this
year, given the severe dislocation that we're seeing in the Florida market?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, the Florida market is to come. I think it'll be interesting to see ultimately where it
goes. I think we told you already, we found that most of the renewals to date have been
lukewarm to us at least. But I think Florida could be dislocated. We will take a look at there.
I think there will be some natural reductions that is much as a few of the clients that we
support in the past. (inaudible) we're writing less. There's -- I would take a look at Florida
on its own merits. But it doesn't change the fact that when we look at our portfolio, we
are being very careful about managing our volatility. The southeast remains our largest
zone, so we're not going to -- want to go crazy in terms of having a peak zone compared

Page 10 of 16



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2021-04-29

to the rest of our zones. I'm not looking for any massive increase in cat pricing if the
relative trends stay the way they've been for the last six months.

Q - Derek Han

{BIO 20338442 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thanks. And then my second question is more qualitative. Is there any way to
assess the conservatism of you're exiting your 2021 loss picks?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

That's always a difficult subject, but what I would recommend is that you do what probably
you've done with other companies, such as ours which is how do you reconcile. Average
growth rate increase last year of 14% with loss ratio is going down only a couple of points.
And I think what that speaks to is the fact that we believe there's a lot of uncertainty in the
current environment, and we're reflecting by definition in our loss picks much higher loss
ratios than you would anticipate simply by doing rate minus trend.
And the reason for that is we feel there's a lot of uncertainty right now. We'd rather take a
more prudent approach. And I'd like to believe that when these lines of businesses start
to mature, we will be able to bring them down to a better loss ratio. But we'd rather start
high and finish low than the other way around. But if you look at rate over trend, you
would, after year, have expected a higher -- a greater reduction in the loss ratio. You're
not seeing that because I think we're showing the appropriate prudence. Peter, I don't
know if you want to add to that.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

No, I think you pretty much covered it there, Albert. That's exactly what I would say. I
mean, I do believe we're being appropriate in our loss picks. There is risk and uncertainty
around lost cost inflation. And I think we're being appropriately prudent. And I would
remind folks that our standard reserve philosophy is we put a bad news early and --I mean
we put a bad news early and we take good news later. So, we'll see how these reserve
develop over the next couple years.

The next question is from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is probably, I think, following-up on the last
question. So, in the outlook that you guys also released for the year, you pointed to two
to three points of underlying loss ratio improvement for the full year. You guys came in at
2% in the Q1. Tying some things together, it sounds like still good healthy rate increases,
but some slow down, and you guys are being conservative with loss trends. So given
those two forces, would you expect the underlying improvement to pick up as we go
Page 11 of 16

through the year and getting closer to the high end of that range or the 2% in the Q1 kind
of a good barometer for the next three quarters?

FINAL

A - Peter W. Wilson

{BIO 4267902 <GO>}

I guess, Elyse, this is Peter, I'll take that. I mean, the full year ex-cat loss ratio consolidated
last year was 57.7. We came in at 55.1. So, that's about 2.5 points. That's like -- at least
when I go full-year to first quarter, that's like spot on the middle of the two to three. I'd
say the first quarter is pretty indicative. We'll see how much more rate we get. But I would
say the first quarter is fairly indicative of where we think things will play out for the rest of
the year.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

That's helpful. And then one quick number. You pointed to a large marine and cargo loss
in the quarter. Just trying to get a sense of the magnitude of that in terms of the impact
within the insurance segment.

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yeah. We had one big Japanese cargo loss in the quarter that ran through -- I don't like to
point out the large losses per se. But if I'm looking overall, that probably hit the insurance
loss ratio by about, I'd call it, let's see if do, maybe a little less than a point in the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yeah. I wouldn't want to make too much of that -- I wouldn't want to make too much of
that. We have--

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

(inaudible)

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

We saw large losses before. We're going to have large losses, right? The issue is we're
going to absorb them. And generally, we have a couple of them, one or two a quarter, no
big deal. We've talked to you in the past, sometimes we've had an unusual quarter with
more than that. But I don't want to assume that we're not going to have $10 million, $15
million losses here or there. That's part of our business. And as long as we can absorb it, I
consider those part of the attrition loss ratio. And I really wouldn't want to make anything
exceptional out of that.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. And then on the cat side, you guys, I think, alluded to, right, you
brought down your PML, then lowered your cat exposure. You also I think alluded to a cat
ratio about two to three points better than your five-year average, excluding COVID. So, I
think, it imply something just around 7.3% to 8.3% for the full year, given that the Q1 was
elevated. And I just see some of your PML did come down at April 1. Is that still a good rule
of thumb for the full year, given with a slightly higher cat loss at the start of the year?

I don't think so--

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Go on. Go, Pete.

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

I would say so, Elyse, mostly because when we talked about the cat loss ratio and we said
we're bringing it down, I think a couple of you folks thought that we should bring it down
even further. So, I would say our expectations were to be even better than that. And this
Texas storm just put some pressure on it. So, I'd say that's still a pretty good ballpark,
Albert?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yeah. What I would just say is we always love to kind of create patterns on cat. And cat is
by definition is unpredictable and volatile, and so you don't know where things are. What
we do know is that we've got less exposure than we've had in the past, that we're
building our portfolio better and smarter than we had in the past, that we have less
exposures at lower layers, which would give us less again just on a frequency basis. So,
we think that we're building a more intelligent cat-exposed portfolio. But I think I've been
in this business a long time. I don't make projections on cat ratios.

Good morning. So, if I look at some of your competitors, not many but some, you see a
few outliers, maybe a few more that are growing top-line 15% 20% rate here. And some
of them are even buying back shares at the same time. Obviously, the excess growth is
not necessarily at this point as robust it might be in the future, but the share repurchase
activity isn't as strong. Can we talk a little about how much capital is being consumed by
business mix/growth changes? And given the stock trades at onetime book, how are you
doing the math between cancelling shares versus investing in the business?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I can tell you that right now if the market opportunities are the way they are, we anticipate
using all of our capital to fund growth of attractive business and to build our positioning in
our chosen markets for the foreseeable future.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 21718992 <GO>}

Has your activities consumed capital over the past three months? You lowered cat
exposure. I assume that freed-up capital and we're just not really -- I guess we're not
seeing it so greatly on the top-line side. Is there more capital consumption going on in the
book than there was three months ago?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think it's just different kind of consumption. I mean, you've got cats -- you've got cat,
which takes up short-term consumption, but then -- and rebalancing our book to bring our
property down, again from over 30% of the overall book down closer to the 20% range.
You're, by definition, going to be writing lines of business, like liability in professional lines
that have a longer reserved tail, which requires you to keep capital longer to support
those reserves. So, again, we -- what we're looking to do is to allocate our capital to those
areas that will deliver the best portfolio, delivering the best profitability at acceptable
volatility. So, you know as well as I do, liability can use up a lot of cash in the same way as
cat can use up a lot of cash. They just do so differently.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 21718992 <GO>}

Do you have less excess capital now than you did one year ago or about the same?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I would say that our -- certainly, when we look at our rating agency models, when we look
at where we are, we feel very good. I mean, I think you can read the various rating
agencies, tell you that we have a very strong capital position. We continue to believe that
to be the case. We're growing more now than we did last year. So by definition, we're
going to start to use a little more of the capital, but we still feel very comfortable with our
capital position. I don't know if you want to add anything to that, Peter.

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

No. I think we're using the capital well. And the only other thing right now we'd just add is
obviously last year at the end of the first quarter, where interest rates went -- the capital
was pressured just because interest rates rose so much. So, right now, we're just keeping
Page 14 of 16

our eye on interest rates too. We did have about two -- most of the drop in the book
value was because of interest rates going through OCI. So, we just keep our eye on that
too, Josh.
