Welcome to Aviva Plc’s Q1 2021 Trading Update.
Please let me hand you over to Amanda Blanc, Group Chief Executive Officer.

Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. I hope you are all well. Welcome to Aviva’s Q1 2021 Trading
Update.
I’m going to start with a brief overview of our first quarter performance, and then I’ll hand
over to Jason, who will go through more of the detail.
I’m pleased to report, we made good progress in the first quarter across each of our
strategic priorities, and this is building our confidence in Aviva’s ability to deliver improved
performance and stronger returns for our shareholders.

FINAL

First, we said we would focus the portfolio, and we have. We’ve been decisive and moved
the pace to simplify Aviva, selling 8 noncore businesses, which will generate total cash
proceeds of GBP 7.5 billion on favorable computed. And this will be the conclusion of the
divestment part of the strategy that I announced in August last year.
More specifically, we have completed the disposals of Aviva Vita in April and AvivaSA in
Turkey earlier this month. And in fact, we have completed the necessary presale
consultation processes and have now signed the formal sale and purchase agreement.
This paves the way for regulatory approval and completion, hopefully later this year.
Second, we have significantly strengthened our balance sheet and financial position.
We’re delivering on our debt reduction plan, reducing it by GBP 1.9 billion in the first half of
2021, which is actually ahead of our original expectation. The key capital metrics we are
disclosing today, solvency, debt ratio and liquidity are all robust and healthy.

Bloomberg Transcript

Third, we are building momentum in our core businesses as we focus on the crucial task
of transforming performance. In that regard, you’ll have seen my announcement
yesterday of new leadership for our U.K. and Ireland general insurance business in Adam
Winslow, who will help accelerate the delivery. Our first quarter numbers show our ability
to grow, where we have strong capabilities and leading position. The standout this quarter
was savings and retirement, where we have delivered record quarterly net flows, driven
by strong performances across both workplace and platform.
In general insurance, we’ve delivered our highest Q1 sales in a decade on the back of a
strong commercial lines performance and resilience in personal lines. We’re also
continuing to exercise tight control over our costs and progressing well towards delivering
our 2022 target. So from my perspective, overall, a good first quarter. We have reshaped
the portfolio, significantly strengthened our financial position, and our trading
performance gives us increasing confidence that we have what it takes to capitalize on
our market leadership.
All these notwithstanding, I am very clear that this is just one quarter, and we have much
more work to do to achieve the level of sustained, dependable performance that we’re
looking for, the shareholders have the right to expect and which I know the business is
capable of.
Before I hand over to Jason, let me turn briefly to the topic, which I know will be fresh of
mind for almost all of you today, capital returns. In March, at our full year results, I said that
once we complete the disposal program, our intention is to make a substantial return of
capital to our shareholders. Nothing has changed, and that remains our intent. But this is a
trading update and just too early to be specific on our plans to return excess capital at this
point in time, not least because we still have to complete the largest of the disposal
collect the proceeds and obtain regulatory approval for the distribution.
I promise that we will return to the topic at the appropriate time. You should be in no
doubt in the meantime that a substantial return of capital is right at the top of our agenda,

both as a management team and the Board. Thank you for listening. And with that, I’ll
hand over to Jason.

FINAL

Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everybody. The first quarter showed excellent
progress on strategic delivery. Our businesses are showing positive momentum, allowing
us to look forward with growing confidence. So let me take just a few minutes, before we
get to your questions, to highlight what I see as the key numbers in this trading update.
But first, let me start with our capital position and center liquidity, which remained strong
at 209% and GBP 2.9 billion, respectively.
As you know, we will have completed our planned GBP 1.9 billion debt reduction by the
end of June. I want to quickly walk through the impact of this and the other movements on
our reported solvency and liquidity as there is a little to unpick.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Q1, the solvency ratio increased to 7%, benefited from capital generation and the
positive impact of higher interest rates. This was partly offset by the full year dividend and
the GBP 1.1 billion reduction of subordinated debt. The debt reduction includes our
successful tender, GBP 0.7 billion of which related to subordinated debt, as well as GBP
0.4 billion related to 2 bonds maturing in Q2, which lost their regulatory capital status as of
March 31.
Our pro forma Solvency II ratio, which allows for the completion of the divestments and a
further GBP 450 million debt to be redeemed in June, is estimated at 253%, with
leverage reducing to approximately 26%.
Looking at center liquidity. This stood at GBP 2.9 billion at the end of April after the debt
tender. But unlike the capital position, this does not include the final dividend and the debt
redemptions in May and June, which together totaled GBP 1.4 billion. And as Amanda just
said, we expect to make a substantial return of capital to shareholders following
regulatory approval and the completion of divestments. And of course, we will maintain
leverage below 30%.
Turning now to our trading performance. We’re pleased with the growth in the key areas
as we capitalize on our leading market positions. Net flows in savings and retirement
increased by 31% to GBP 3 billion, a record quarter. This included GBP 1.5 billion in
workplace as we benefited from a successful tax year-end campaign and recent scheme
wins. Our adviser platform also had a strong start to the year, attracting net inflows of
over GBP 1.4 billion, delivering the highest rate of growth amongst the large adviser
platforms.
Aviva Investors delivered improved inflows, including positive, albeit small net inflows from
external clients. And it was good to see investment performance improving, with 81% of
assets above benchmark over 1 year. Volumes of bulk purchase annuities in the quarter
were subdued. And what we know can be a lumpy business, combined with a very strong
start in 2020, total sales across annuity and equity release were 52% lower in the quarter.

FINAL

And while we continue to win a fair share of business in the market, we maintained our
focus on returns despite lower spreads, and higher allocation to gilts, which affected VNB.
Encouragingly, we made a good start to the second quarter. We’ve written around GBP 1.6
billion of BPA volume year-to-date. And in terms of 2021 outlook, we expect BPA volumes
to be weighted toward the second half. Our general insurance business performed
strongly, both in the U.K. and in Canada, recording the highest Q1 for premiums in the last
10 years. This was driven by commercial lines, where premiums grew by 11%, a
combination of hardening rates but also new business wins, helped by our strength and
reputation with our broker partners.

Bloomberg Transcript

Personal line premiums were 1% lower. Nevertheless, this was a strong result, given the
soft rate environment in motor, and the continued impact of COVID on travel and some
of our distributors in the U.K. Our retail direct business in the U.K. grew premiums by 4%,
helped by the successful launch of the Aviva brand, motor and home offerings on the
major price comparison websites. Our share of business on PCWs has doubled since the
first quarter of last year, a clear demonstration of the strength and untapped potential of
our brand.
General insurance combined ratio improved sharply to 90.6%, owing to better
underwriting performance, benign weather, a reduction in COVID-related claims and
frequency benefits in motor. However, the significant decline in motor rates seen in the
last 12 months is expected to offset the Q1 frequency benefit as lockdown restrictions are
lifted. As such, we expect the combined ratio for the year to increase, but to be below
95%. Controllable costs, excluding implementation and IFRS 17, are down 1% to GBP 720
million.
For the full year, we expect those costs to reduce by 1% to 2%. I’ll stress that improving
efficiency remains a key focus, and we remain on track to meet our $300 million cost
saving target in 2022. So in summary, trading in the first 3 months highlights our ability to
grow profitably, underpinning our confidence in the targets we announced earlier in
March, but with no doubt that we have more to do to deliver a better proposition to our
customers and to deliver stronger returns to our shareholders.
I’ll leave it there and hand back to the operator for Q&A.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question today comes from the line of Oliver Steel of
Deutsche Bank.

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Three questions. Look, I’m going to sort of try one question on capital, and then I’ll move
on to the operational side. So on the capital front, I’m just wondering, given that your
Page 4 of 18



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2021-05-27

FINAL

solvency ratio has benefited from lower interest rates this year -- sorry, higher interest
rates this year. To what extent is the 180% threshold, still the main sort of guidance for us
in terms of judging how much capital you can return, or is it practice liquidity, the constraint
instead? So that’s question one.
Second question is on bulk annuity sales. I mean you said the first quarter is exceptionally
low. You’ve had a better second quarter. Can you give us some sort of idea of the
pipeline over the course of the year or an expected range of bulk annuity sales over the
course of the year?
And then final question is on well, on the GI side. I wonder if you could give us a little bit
more of an indication about what the frequency saving was in the first quarter and the
weather saving?

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thanks, Oliver, for that question. I mean, just on the capital, I’m sure, as you say, this
will be a question that we’ll be asked a number of times today. And as I mentioned in my
introduction, we’re not going to give too many details today. What we are doing is sort of
confirming our commitment to the substantial return and returning excess capital above
180% to shareholders. That guidance, that has not changed.
We’re also saying that we are clear on the priorities for the deployment of the capital,
which is the debt reduction, as Jason said in his opening, to a leverage below 30%, some
investment in the business to accelerate growth and, of course, the substantial return to
shareholders. So I think normal, what you really say. I think the point on liquidity, maybe
Jason can share.

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

Yes, Oliver. It doesn’t change over the medium term. I mean, clearly, from quarter-toquarter if the ratio about -- is around their actual cash. But the balance of the restructure
actually brings capital and liquidity more into line, given the more simple group. So I don’t
see those being out of line as we do our more detailed work.

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

Jason, do you want to take the BPA question?

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

Yes. On BPA, we wrote GBP 0.65 billion in the first quarter, we’ve written about GBP 0.9
billion so far in Q2. So moving along nicely, we wrote GBP 6 billion last year. So that’s a sort
of aiming point, if you like, for us to want to sort of say that the business is continuing to
develop. I mean we said that, we wrote for the year before that. So that was a huge
amount of growth. So that lumpiness that we’ll continue to talk about, we’ll see GBP 6
billion with an excellent performance.

So what I did say in my comments is we’re working toward a strong pipeline, to answer
your question. And that has actually built quite sharply in the last couple of months. But we
still expect sales to be weighted into the second half.

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

FINAL

And on the GI frequency?

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

Yes. On the GI, look, we haven’t given any specifics today to unpack the figure. Clearly,
frequency benefits are starting to kind of get clouded between the rate reductions and
the frequency -- frequency is off, and I will say that. But the actual calculation of a benefit
certain to rates is a bit subjective. So we’re not going to give a specific on that. I mean the
weather did contribute -- it’s one quarter and all that doesn’t make a summer or indeed
the spring, but there was quite a few cats in the quarter.

Operator
Your next question today comes from the line of Jon Hocking of Morgan Stanley.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jonathan Hocking
I’ve got two questions, please. Firstly, just to come back to the capital return piece. All
right, you don’t want to be specific. But is it possible that you can actually do more than
one capital return if certain disposals complete before the year-end? And have your
thoughts crystallized in terms of the form that capital return might take? And then
secondly, just on the workplace business, have you seen any impact from COVID in terms
of either sort of lower salary increments or unemployment in that book?

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

Thanks, Jon. I’ll let Jason pick up the workplace question. Just on the -- the sort of, I guess,
the form of the capital return, look, we’re looking at all of the options for that, and we’ve
started to see cues from our shareholders on that, and we’ll give you an update in due
course.
On your question around whether there will be more than one as the disposals complete,
as I said, I’m just going to get very boring on sort of repeating that we’ll come back when
the disposals have completed and when we’re in a position to say more on that, as Jason
was really clear about in his opening and in mine. So sorry, we don’t have any more on that
today, but we will, as we said, over the course of the year, as we make progress, come
back to you on that. Jason, on the...

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

Yes. On the workplace, I think I’ve said this before, it’s been surprisingly positive. I would -I’m not even saying resilient, positive actually. It’s been growing across the period, we’re
seeing strong growth in the -- obviously, we’ve got some scheme wins in there. But we
are seeing significant savings going in through the workplace. It’s the primary source of
Page 6 of 18

Date: 2021-05-27

long term savings within the U.K. So the signs are positive. There’s probably a little bit too
much allocation to cash would be anything, I would say, we’re looking to try and make sure
people don’t stay in cash and they move into longer term investments. That’s it for now.

Operator

FINAL

Your next question today comes from the line of Greig Paterson of KBW.

Q - Greig Paterson
Three quick questions. One is you disclosed gross written premiums on the GI side,
where previously in the quarter, you had been disclosing net written premiums. I was
wondering if there was any change in the reinsurance programs i.e., can we assume the
same year-on-year trends for gross written premiums and net written premiums in the
quarter? That’s question one.
The second one is just in terms of fintech, I mean there’s been a proliferation of fintech
launches in GI personal lines, U.K. protection. I was wondering if that these have been
material enough or you see them being material in the future to move the down, i.e.
material threat to top line?

Bloomberg Transcript

And the third question is, in terms of the cash at the center of the group, now and
previously, you’ve made some comments about investing in the business. I was wondering
what the sort of magnitude, the budget you have there. Is that GBP 1 billion you can invest
in the business? Or are we talking just some small bolt-ons?

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Greig. I’ll pick up the last two. And Jason, I’ll pick up the GWP.

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

Yes, we moved to do GWP as we are now in line with everybody else. It doesn’t change
our reinsurance buying per se, the NWP growth was a bit lower, we’ve been growing the
business that’s reinsured a bit more. So -- and we’ll give at the half year, we’ll give both. So
you can see what’s been going on. But there’s nothing -- there’s no change to the nature
or the structure of our reinsurance program just to the volume. So we’ve obviously
reinsured a bit more on the corporate and the GTS lines.

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

On the question around fintech, yes, I mean, obviously, the London market and U.K. is
especially buoyant in this area. And we watch with great interest around what the fintechs
are doing, and we’ve seen some really exciting as I can come out of that market. I mean I
would have seen that before I took on this job for a little while with some of those
businesses.
Look, I mean, we have 16 million customers and a massive brand. I think the opportunity
for Aviva is actually working with those fintechs in terms of deploying some of the exciting
Page 7 of 18



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2021-05-27

FINAL

technology and ideas that they have so we’ve been working partnership, and that is
exactly what we’re doing. We’ve got a Chief Innovation Officer, Ben Luckett, who’s been
working with us.
In fact, we’ve just run an innovation challenge internally with the business around how we
can actually get those fintechs working with us better in partnership because we
recognize it’s a big organization. I mean this is similar to most big organizations, we’re
probably not that easy to work with. So we’re definitely working on that. We’ve got some
of our own, of course, with Wealthify, which is a really brilliant business, which is giving
robo advice, and we really see good growth in that business as well and really exciting
opportunities.
So first, we see it as a really brilliant opportunity. We definitely don’t see it as a threat. And
we believe the combination of the brand and some of that innovation to -- could actually
be really exciting for Aviva. On the point around investment in the core business, to just
go back to, I think, what we said in March and what we’ve said before, we’re talking about
modest amounts of investment in the business.

Bloomberg Transcript

We already have GBP 400 million per annum baked into the plan. We’ve talked about that
before, for investment in the business. But what we don’t want to do is start the business,
our investment opportunity where we believe there are growth opportunities, or
opportunities to focus on simplification or automation or digitization of the business.
And what we want to do is make sure that we allow the business to do that. But really, the
focus on the excess capital to just reassure everybody, substantial excess capital will be
around reducing the leverage ratio and returning to shareholders. But we also recognize
this is a business where there may be some capability gaps that we need to fill and that
we don’t want to stop ourselves from doing that.

Operator
Your next question today comes from the line of Ming Zhu of Panmure Gordon.

Q - Ming Zhu

{BIO 17001429 <GO>}

Three questions, please. First, on your annuities and equity release, how come you got no
value of new business, given you’ve written GBP 1 billion volume? And my second question
is on the asset -- your Aviva Investors.
So have you reached that turning point that you will be seeing positive net flows going
forward? And where do you see the growth in this market coming from? And my third
question is on the GI side, the U.K. personal line. What sort of claims installation [ph] are
you having? And sort of pricing and you’ve seen and the outlook?

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

Okay. Jason, do you want to pick up the first and third question?

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

FINAL

Sure. So you’re absolutely right. There was no VNB in the annuities and equity release.
There was a very limited investment into our desired asset classes of illiquids and the way
equity release comes through is more only in the second half. So we maintain returns.
We sort of have a strict return hurdle when we write new business, but the value and the
margin will come through as we move to our desired asset mix in due course. And that will
take through the course of 2021. We would expect that to be reinvested primarily into
illiquid assets, given how tight corporate bond spreads are today.

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

And on the...

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

Aviva Investors?

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

No, no, on the claims point, Jason. Might want to take the detail [ph].

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

Okay. On the -- I didn’t quite catch the question, but the trends in personal lines, we’ll talk
more about at the half year. We’ve seen, obviously, a reduction in Q1 relative to long-term
averages for frequency. And as you would imagine, as I said a moment ago, we have
seen rates reduce. So the actual impacts of that between is positive, but it’s much smaller
than it was in 2020 across that.
In terms of pricing, we’ve seen new business for motor in the first quarter is down 6%.
Renewal has been more resilient than that. Clearly, we have got our eyes on the
forthcoming FCA announcement. But we’ve seen that on the home side, it’s been more
constructive. We’ve seen rate rises going through pretty much across the book through all
channels.

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

And on Aviva Investors, look, Mark was appointed in January, I think that we’ve made a
really good start. Those flows are positive. And we know that, that can, though, be a bit
lumpy to use Jason’s technical term on BPA. But just in terms of the areas of focus, clearly,
ESG underpins everything.
We’ve made some bold statements on that. And Mark and the team are working really
hard on that. There is a focus on real assets, on infrastructure, obviously, helping the BPA
business source illiquid assets. And we have seen the fund performance improving, as
Jason mentioned in his opening. So I would say a good start from Mark and the team, but
clearly, more work to do.

Your next question today comes from the line of Dominic O’Mahony of Exane BNP Paribas.

FINAL

Q - Dominic O’Mahony

{BIO 20307388 <GO>}

Three for me, if that’s all right. So the first one is just on general insurance. I mean, clearly,
a fabulous combined ratio in Q1 and below 95% is very good for the full year. I’m just
thinking about the run rate. And I think if you had 96% in the next 3 quarters, that would
get you to around below 95%.
And then at 96% of the exit rate, you could imagine actually, it could drift higher, bearing
in mind what’s going on with the earn through of motor pricing in the U.K. and Canada, the
elimination of frequency benefits and Jason, as you mentioned, the FCA dual pricing
review. Is that -- I’m wondering whether you pushed back on that, whether there are
offsetting positives that you’d see impacting the sort of the run rate combined ratio in GI.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second question is just on the cost saves. Very pleasing just to hear continued progress
against the target. The target, I think, was set with a bigger group, and I wonder whether
you’d consider further shrinkage of the center to rightsize it for a group that is smaller. Any
comments on that would be helpful.
And then just a final one on -- I want to ask a full question on capital returns. But I’m just
curious about your approach to leverage. Your 30% target, very clear. Is that 30% of sort
of a target? Or I think in the past, you said below 30%. Would it be inefficient to stay at
around 26%, which, I think, Jason, you said, was the pro forma?

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

Yes. Okay. Jason, do you want to pick up 1 and 3, and I’ll pick up that point around cost.

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

Okay. So on -- you’re right on GI. And we’ve been hesitant to be too precise in terms of
our forecast. We did want to indicate that 90.6% isn’t going to be the full year core. And
there are material benefits from weather and frequency in that number. But the
commercial lines is actually performing really well. There’s less going on there.
So there is continued strong growth and strong profitability improvements in commercial
lines. As you rightly point out, one of the reasons for our hesitancy is the forthcoming
pricing review, which will -- it could be out very soon. And we would have some impact in
2021 as everyone positions ahead of the implementation next year. So we are being a
little bit sort of generous in the below 95%, but that’s the sort of direction that we are
moving towards. But there’s nothing we’re seeing that is concerning us other than the
points I just mentioned.
On the leverage ratio, I think you’re right, far below 30% would be inefficient and is sort of
below our tolerance. We might drift down in good times when we are building capital. But

Page 10 of 18



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2021-05-27

FINAL

we wouldn’t want to structurally be a long way below that. It wouldn’t be the right thing to
do. Equally, I’ve said, I’ve had no hesitancy if we needed to go above 30% for the right
reason, if we wanted to raise some debt capital for any form. Clearly, that’s not the topic
or the likelihood in the coming periods, but that’s -- it’s not a cap, but in terms of a range,
just being below that 30% is a comfortable place to be.

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

On the cost savings, this GBP 300 million, obviously, was the target that we set, and that
was for on the bigger group. And what we said in March was that actually we would now
deliver that GBP 300 million from the smaller parameters. So I think we have already
challenged that. But clearly, this is a continuing focus for us, and we are looking at all
areas. We recognize the need to simplify the business, to digitize the business. We’ve
accelerated our property reduction plan, and we talked about that again in March, and we
will look at the center cost. We have to do that.
I think the important point, Dominic, here is that at the end of it, it’s not a static ambition.
And we said we wanted to be at the quartile and across all of our business lines. And so
we would expect that target to continue moving as every other business moves, and we
need to move with that to make sure we don’t pass on any inefficiency to our customers.
So it’s a real, real key area of focus for us constantly.

Your next question today comes from the line of Blair Stewart of Bank of America.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

I’ve got a couple of questions left. Just a word on when you think you’ll be in a position to
talk more definitively on your capital management plans. Is that just simply a case of
waiting for the deals to complete or near completion? Obviously, we’ve got the first half
results in August as the next data point.
And just related to that, when you talk about the various components, you’ve got plenty
of liquidity. We can see today that you’re GBP 6.6 billion above the top end of your capital
range. So when you think about what to do with that, is leverage the constraint? And I just
wonder, Jason, perhaps you can comment. Have you done work on whether further debt
reduction is needed to fulfill your capital management plans?
And then finally, just on the bulk and the annuity side, could you just remind me of your
appetite for bulks? And maybe a word on what needs to fall into place to get the asset
side lined up. I think you’ve said it before, GBP 4 billion to GBP 6 billion of capacity, but I
think that’s the total annuities and equity release, but maybe just clarify that, please.

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

I’ll pick up the first one. Jason can pick up the second here.

FINAL

On timing, that we’ll keep you updated, I think we’ve said very clearly. I’m pretty sure that
this will be a constant question, and we are very conscious of that. I think just to go
through the process, what we need to do is, obviously, complete the deals. We need to
collect the proceeds and then we do need to obtain the regulatory approval for
distribution.
So we will make sure that we go through all of that as quickly as we can do. And
therefore, we can’t really be specific on the timing at the moment. But to just reiterate,
we’re committed to it. We’re focused on it. And the substantial return to shareholders is
top of our priority list. Jason, on liquidity and bulk?

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

Sure. So look, our capital framework I’ll point you back to is the constraints that we’re
using. I think we need to unpick anything that I would say to give further guidance. But
clearly, when we did the debt tender, we are thinking ahead, and we make sure that we
don’t need to do 2 debt tenders.

Bloomberg Transcript

We’ve got some redemptions next year. So we can manage debt in the normal course
under quite a wide range of scenarios. So there’s no -- there’s nothing else really to say on
that. And I gave Dom the answer on how I think about leverage ratio just a moment ago.
In terms of bulk, I mean, again, so just 5 minutes ago, we wrote 6 last year. So that we’ll
be very comfortable running 6 again this year. That’s the bulks on top of that. And clearly,
we want to grow that business. So there is a sound appetite within the organization to
grow the BPA business at the right margin, and obviously, the right level of return.
The asset size has been slower. I think there has been an impact on ability to do -- our
primary illiquid assets come from infrastructure, non-PFI U.K. infrastructure projects, which
have been a bit slower to complete. We have got a nice pipeline, and that’s building up
pretty well into the second half. As is the equity release market, which has also been a bit
slower during the lockdown. So we’d expect that to continue to be supportive to our
investment side.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

So is the GBP 4 billion to GBP 6 billion guidance you’ve given before, is that somewhat
redundant? Now you’re saying that you’ve got ambition to kind of go above the GBP 6
billion. Is that right?

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

I mean we would in the right circumstances. I mean, we clearly want to moderate our
capital usage and our credit intensity of the balance sheet. But the -- last year is not a high
watermark, put it like that.

Your next question today comes from the line of Larissa Van Deventer of Barclays.

FINAL

Q - Larissa Van Deventer

{BIO 21570130 <GO>}

Just a quick question on the retail consumer, please. Protection and Health sales were
down 7% and individual protection sales down 15%. What are your views about the pace
of recovery of the retail consumer? And how do you expect that to translate into margin
over the next 2 to 3 years, please?

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

Yes. I mean, we do expect -- the individual protection market has got some particular
issues, and we traded in it, through it. We’ve been underrepresented. It’s our business
rather than the consumer. We’ve been very underrepresented in the direct market, and
there’s been a bit of a shift to that.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we have addressed that. I think we do expect a materially better volume in IP through
the rest of the year. And we’ve seen some impact, particularly through distribution, which
is we have a higher proportion of real estate agents that we sell-through, and that’s been
more challenging to do during the lockdowns. But we are expecting that to recover.
We have seen -- having said all that, the bright spot through protection has been group
protection, and we’ve seen real tailwinds in companies buying more group life and
income protection for their workforce, and that plays directly to some of our strengths. So
we are expecting recovery. I’ve got no particular insights on it versus the Bank of England
or anyone else, but we do expect a recovery in the second half, and we are anticipating
continued activity and inflows into our business.

Your next question today comes from the line of Steven Haywood of HSBC.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Three questions, if you don’t mind. You’ve mentioned, obviously, that about capital returns
and how you’re putting off any remarks on that, obviously. But I just wanted to look at the
160% to 180% Solvency II ratio target and whether you feel that is appropriate, really, for
the ongoing future. You’ve not been actually below the top of the target for the last 5
years since the Brexit vote in 2016. So is this still an appropriate target to have for the
group?
Second question on your personal U.K. motor lines. Can you talk about what growth in
policyholders you’ve seen in the first quarter of ‘21? And what market share of the price
comparison websites do you have now? You said it doubled, but I don’t know what it
doubled from in the past. And then where would you like your market share of price
comparison websites to go to?

And then finally, just a quick question. Is a large bolt-on M&A or even to transform -- more
transformational M&A part of the agenda for the group?

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thank you. I’ll pick up the third question, and Jason can pick up the first 2 on M&A
appetite.
We’re really focused, Steven, on delivering our new strategy, and you can see that we’ve
been sort of busy doing this. And we’ve also -- we’ve said we invest in our core markets to
accelerate growth. And we think a lot of that can be done organically, which is our focus,
particularly with the sort of strength in the market positions that we have.
But I think it’s also fair to say there was sort of inorganic activity is not a priority for us. We
are going to be thoughtful about M&A. So particularly where could we enhance our
capabilities or accelerate our strategic developments. We did this when we spoke about
the high net worth acquisition that we did in Q1.
So I would say we are looking at this, but any opportunities for investments are going to -that we consider, whether they’re organic or inorganic actually, would need to meet a
really high bar and enhance -- definitely enhance value for shareholders. So we’re very
conscious of that. So Jason, on the capital return?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

Sure. So the range was established a while ago, it was sort of -- we’re at the bottom of
the range, I think the -- and it’s great that we made from 150% to 160%. We have had too
much debt historically. So when I talk about this, part of the reason that we have been
above the top is because the debt component has been too high.
So that would -- that would -- if you take that off, that would a brought us sort of around
the top of the range. And it is a good range for us to operate in. I think we wanted to
communicate where we’d be comfortable running the company. And we’ve said excess
capital is above the top of the range, just to be clear on that. I don’t think we have much
more to say. Clearly, the nature of the capital of the business is changing as we go
through that, and we’ll continue to refine it. But we feel that, that is about the right place.
In terms of policyholder count in 2021, we’ve got 1% increase in number of policies in the
quarter. So it’s about 2% overall for rating. I’ve talked to order [ph] about 6% on new
business, but renewal being better than that.
On the PCW market share, I would say it’s gone from very low to low. I mean there’s
plenty of upside for us. We still -- I don’t have the numbers, sorry for that, but we’ve got
loads of headroom for us. We only came on to them. This is on the Aviva brand, by the
way. QMH is a different conversation. But there’s plenty of upside, both on motor and
home, for us to keep pushing forward for on that.

share?

Your next question today comes from the line of Andrew Crean of Autonomous.

A - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Could I ask 3 questions, please? Firstly, you talked about the group diversification benefit
being -- going down to GBP 2 billion. Where is it at the end of last year?

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, you talk about total capital generation in the first quarter of GBP 1.1 billion. Could
you split that between operating and markets and tell me what the market effect has
been in the second quarter?
And then thirdly, there’s been quite a lot of change in your top management in terms of
Head of U.K. Life, Head of U.K. General and Aviva Investors. Could you say whether these
were instigated by yourselves or whether you’re reacting to circumstances of your
managers?

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

Okay. I’ll pick up the last point, and Jason can pick up the first two, Andrew.

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

Certainly. On diversification, Andrew, I think I’ve said this in the presentation at the yearend that we had just above GBP 2 billion in the core markets at the end of December.
SCR has fallen because of higher rates. And that diversification has dropped a little bit as
a consequence. I think it’s about GBP 1.95 billion precisely today. So it’s just dropped. It was
a little bit above, it’s now a little bit below. That’s explained by the lower SCR that we are
seeing today.
We’re not giving the OCG or other profit figures. The movement of rates is clearly very
significant in that 1.1, pretty much in line with our sensitivities that we’ve seen, slight
contribution from FX that you might not picked up, but through that. But that’s probably
why we’re slightly better than some of the forecasts that you would have used using the
published sensitivities.

And in the second quarter?

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

FINAL

The second quarter has been reasonably flat. I don’t think there’s material changes to
economics in the second quarter that I can point to.

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

Okay. On your third question about the changes in shop management, I mean, just let me
be very clear on this. I am extremely pleased with the new team that we’ve got in place.
We needed new expertise within the team that were aligned with the strategy and that
were going to drive the business forward. If I look at the team, I think we’ve increased the
capability significantly and the experience of leadership as well as delivery. And I think
that’s really important. So we have to have people who have had other playbooks that
they can bring into play here so that we can get to delivery more quickly.

Bloomberg Transcript

We’ve brought in new roles. So the Brand and Communications Director (sic) [Chief Brand
and Corporate Affairs Officer], Stephen Doherty; as well as Cheryl Toner coming in to
lead the customer and marketing role. She comes in with a strong experience of having
done this before.
And the combination of internal and external appointments with Mark leading the Aviva
Investors team, Rob Barker coming in to lead the Savings and Retirement team. And I feel
very, very pleased with the leadership team that I have around me now. They’re all
committed to the new strategy, and we can move forward. So to be clear, this is Aviva
driving the strategy forward, and we’re very happy.

Your next question today comes from the line of Gordon Aitken of RBC.

A - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Three questions, please. First, if you look at the back book life deals in the U.K. in the last
20 years, and you see that they’ve all ended up either at Phoenix or with you, are your
days of acquiring life back books gone? I mean, there’s obviously -- maybe you want to
comment on the sort of extensive capital and cost synergies. Would that be appealing to
you?
And second sort of related question is, I mean, previous management when sort of asked
what this -- they’ve all -- they indicated a preference for non-life over life, and do you
share this view?
And finally, on bulk volumes, obviously been light in Q1. I mean Q1 was always a seasonally
very light quarter, that sort of seasonality has dropped away from the market in recent
years. Do you think it’s going to return? And maybe just comment on credit spread has
Page 16 of 18



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity

been pretty tight and it’s kind of an irony, isn’t it, that when credit spreads are tight, you
can’t get the uplift in yield. But obviously, it’s a situation that when credit spreads push out
the market, the investor market stresses.

FINAL

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

Yes. Okay. Thanks, Gordon, for those questions. On the first question around back book
life deals. I think it’s important to stress that our strategy is formulated on building the
growth in the areas that we outlined back in March, which is around the savings and
retirement business, health and protection, the commercial lines and personal lines
business. And therefore, I think that answers that question. That is really where we want to
focus our attention going forward. We’ve been pretty clear on that, that hasn’t changed at
all.
On your second question, preference of non-life over life. I think the way that we look at
this is looking at the needs of our customers, where are the trends, where do we see the
development going forward. And we see big growth opportunities in bulks, in savings and
retirement, in the retail and commercial business. And that’s where we’ll be focusing our
attention. And we’ll be looking at where we’ve got capability gaps and looking to fill those
capability gaps, as I mentioned in the answer to my previous question. And Jason, on the
bulk volumes?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

I think Q1, actually, sometimes is actually -- there’s a bit of a spillover from Q4. So certainly
in 2018 and 2020 we had very strong Q1s. But the comparative for us this year is a very
challenging one. This year was softer. We don’t know the market. You might have more
insight as to what has happened across the whole market. We do feel the market is
slower overall, and we think we’ve got roughly our share in the first quarter. We’ll find out
in due course. But we’ve had a decent April, May, and that’s setting us up pretty well for a
good year.

Your last question today comes from the line of Ashik Musaddi of JPMorgan.

A - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

I think my question was just answered. I think what I was trying to understand is your bulk
volumes was a bit lower. Was it just because markets were lower, I mean the entire
market? Or would you say that the spread, as Gordon was saying, because of the tighter
spreads and all, that is why it was a bit lower. So, yes, I think that is more or less what I...

A - Jason Windsor

{BIO 17967688 <GO>}

I think it’s a combination of that. I mean, I’ve just answered the question. We think the
market was lower. It takes the market a little bit of time to adjust to a lower spread
environment and sort of people looking at last month’s prices, not this month’s. So there is
a sort of period of readjustment.

Page 17 of 18



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2021-05-27

We are seeing the pipeline building very healthily across the board. And it’s over GBP 20
billion we’re expecting to come to market between now and the end of the year across
the entire market. So quite a significant pickup. So I think our read is a quieter but not
dead first quarter, with a pickup as we’ve just reported in Q2.

FINAL

Operator
There are no further questions at this time. Amanda, Jason, back to you.

A - Amanda Blanc

{BIO 19138679 <GO>}

Look. Okay. Just -- I guess, just reiterate where we started. Thank you for all of your
questions. And it’s really good to hear.
I mean hopefully when we are together next, we’ll actually be physically together. We sort
of keep our fingers crossed for that.
Just saying overall, a good first quarter. Reshape the portfolio, strengthen the financial
position. The trading performance gives us increasing confidence.
We will continue to build on that and keep coming back to you on the question around
capital returns.
