Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. and welcome to the Storebrand Third Quarterly
call. (Operator Instructions) I will now hand you over to Trond Finn Eriksen to begin
today's conference. Thank you.

Trond Finn Eriksen

{BIO 17132188 <GO>}

Thank you; and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Storebrand's Third
Quarter 2013 conference call. My name is Trond Eriksen. I am head of Investor Relations at
Storebrand.
Together with me I have the Group CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad; the Group CFO, Lars
Loddesol; and Executive Vice-President Guaranteed Pensions, Geir Holmgren.
As you are notiﬁed, the slide presentation will be running on the webcast available on
storebrand.no/ir. The slides are similar to the analyst presentation released this morning.
In the presentation today, Odd Arild will give an overall view of the development in Q3.
After the presentation, the operator will pass the questions. To be able to the questions -to ask questions, you will need to dial in to the conference call. I will now leave the word
to Storebrand's CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad.

FINAL

Thank you, Trond Finn. Welcome to the conference call. Let's start with the highlights of
the quarter on slide number 2.
Our quarterly results are NOK810 million in Third Quarter, and NOK1,880 million year to
date. With these numbers, this is one of the strongest quarter results in the Company's
history, both this quarter and year to date, and we continue to observe the trends from
the precious quarters.
It's a strong top line growth. Fee and administration income is up 10% year to date. The
insurance premiums are up 15% year to date.
At the same time, we see the eﬀects of our cost measures through a 2% reduction in
nominal costs compared to the same period last year.
Our unit linked reserves are growing signiﬁcantly. From the same period last year, the
results are up 30%. Our deﬁned beneﬁt customers have also received the (restaurant)
return so far this year. Our standard portfolio with a 50% (post name shares) has so far a
10.8% return.

Bloomberg Transcript

And this is in the very strong contrast to the guaranteed paid-up policies that with the
current regulatory environment are invested primarily in the ﬁxed income instruments and
have yield 2.7% year to date.
A new law proposal on occupational pensions was presented in the Third Quarter, and I
will return later on with our evaluation of this new framework.
The solvency level is strengthened through the quarter to 178% in a Solvency I ratio. And
year to date, about NOK9 billion of guaranteed funds have been moved out of the
balance sheet.
If we then move to slide number 3 and look closer into the diﬀerent lines of business
results, we see that the quarter results for the Group are approximately NOK150 million
higher than expected in the markets. Overall, we see that analysts' predictions are
accurate and very on-target when it comes to savings and insurance, but there is a
diﬀerence within guaranteed pension; and there is in general three main areas where we
see the diﬀerence.
At ﬁrst, now we are in a position where all (sub-portfolios) within SPP when it comes to
deﬁned beneﬁts have reached the consolidation level, and this means that they in this
quarter have an extra NOK25 million in result from indexation fees. And it will also add
another NOK8 million quarter by quarter going forward, everything equal.
The risk result in Sweden is strong for the quarter, and it's about NOK40 million higher
than in the previous quarters. This represents an accrual eﬀect, and the risk result year to
Page 2 of 15

date represents our normal risk result as of Third Quarter.

FINAL

The negative risk result in paid-up policies portfolio in Norway is now switched into a
positive result, and that means a NOK40 million extra result on risk results this quarter.
And this adds up more or less to around NOK100 million that was very diﬃcult, of course,
for the analysts to see in the numbers. On top of that, we see also that our cost control is
strong and somewhat stronger than expected in the market.
If we then move to slide number 4, this is a well-known picture to you. It's an overview,
overall strategic response. And I will also this quarter use a couple of minutes to discuss
the diﬀerent measures taking this quarter when it comes to move the Company in the
strategic direction.
We have divided our strategic response into two categories; actions to manage the
balance sheet on the left-hand side, and action to further develop the business into the
non-guaranteed future. It means an active management of our guaranteed business, as
well as proactive measures to strengthen our position in the occupational pension market;
and through this position, actively develop retail markets through more workspace
distribution of our products.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we then move into the next slide, slide number 5, we see some (of our) balance sheet
activities. Firstly, let's look at the complete measures to adjust the business to new capital
requirements.
The risk adjustments have continued into the quarter, primarily through the continued
build-up of the bond portfolio at amortized cost, and through reduction of the real estate
exposure.
On the bottom right-hand side, we see the cost program is continuing to develop slightly
better than the plan, and we are conﬁdent that by the end of 2014, we will have realized
the NOK400 million in cost reduction; and of course, in our type of business, the most
important element to make sure that we are reducing cost is to have reduction of the
number of employees in the Company.
Within product optimization, we have implemented price increase in the guaranteed
portfolios. That continues into 2014, and particularly for our public sector pension
products. And we will revert to public sector on the next slide.
We have also sold SPP Pension Service to KPA in Sweden, and booked a result of NOK55
million out of that transaction in the Third Quarter. And as informed later on, the total
result eﬀect will be approximately NOK100 million, and the rest will be booked within First
Quarter -- in First Quarter 2014.
We have also according to the plan transferred guaranteed reserves out, and we see that
in average we have transferred NOK1 billion a quarter during this year. We also see that
volumes vary somewhat going forward, and we expect that to continue, and especially
Page 3 of 15



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2013-10-30

due to the public sector transformation that will have a new peak in the First Quarter of
2014.

FINAL

If we then move to slide number 6, we can look somewhat closer into the public sector. As
we have previously announced, Storebrand withdraw from the DB public pension market
due to low proﬁtability under the future Solvency II regime, and due to low competition in
the market.
We moved approximately NOK6 billion out of the balance sheet in 2013, and we expect
the remaining reserves to be moved out during 2014 and 2015. The portfolio will see a
25% to 30% price increase also into 2014.
At the same time, we are succeeding with our pension fund services to the public sector.
A good example; we recently won the bid as provider for the administration and system
support for 56,000 employees within the public health provider area for (east) region in
Norway. The asset management contract for this provider is now up for competition and
we are, of course, following that very closely.
If we then move from slide six to slide 8, I will give overview of the legal framework for
Norwegian occupational pensions as it stands now.

Bloomberg Transcript

On October 4, the Minister of Finance proposed a legal framework for new occupational
products, with savings rates up to 25%. This is the so-called new hybrid product.
In addition, the deﬁned beneﬁt product seems to continue to exist for some time going
forward. This means that we are looking at three diﬀerent products with three diﬀerent
paid-up policies for pension certiﬁcate solutions going forward.
From our perspective, three further measures is very important to be taken. First of all, we
expect to see that the maximum savings rate within the EC schemes will be increased to
the same level that we see for the new hybrid product; and we expect that to come in
place at the same time as the new hybrid product enters into the market.
Secondly, the paid-up policies with the investment choice needs to be introduced so that
the customer can choose better asset management solutions than they see today.
And the third clariﬁcation we are waiting on is the rules for guaranteed paid-up policies to
be better ﬁt to Solvency II, and give somewhat increased ﬂexibility in terms of asset
management. So this ends my brief comments on the Third Quarter results.

FINAL

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

I have three questions, please, if I may. The ﬁrst one was on the risk result, and when I ﬁrst
looked at it this morning, I have to admit my initial impression was that that was probably
almost entirely one-oﬀ.
But what you said at the start of the call seemed to imply something slightly diﬀerent and
that the Swedish result was at least sustainable. Could you just clarify perhaps on how
much of what we've seen this quarter is improvement in the underlying, and how much
you think is fully one-oﬀ?

Bloomberg Transcript

The second thing was just on the conversion out of guarantees, and I'm just wondering,
given some of the regulatory delays that are inevitable post general election and with
markets going slightly better as well, from a consumer's point of view, there's probably
greater incentives now to take things into their own hands and think, well, I'd rather
beneﬁt from some of these market movements than be stuck in a low guarantee. I'm just
wondering whether any of those factors, whether you're seeing any of those factors
actually come through in the marketplace.
And third one you may well not be able to comment on, and I appreciate it's very early to
start thinking about dividends, but given you said before quite rightly that it's not a
normal position for Storebrand to be in not to pay a dividend, I'm wondering if there's
anything particularly on the horizon at the moment that concerns you or that would make
you more cautious than otherwise, than we might expect otherwise. Thank you very much.

A - Lars Aa Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Peter, this is Lars. I'll try and answer your ﬁrst question, the risk result in Sweden.
Due to a reorganization of the Swedish legal structure, we were unable to get an accurate
result estimation in the ﬁrst and Second Quarter, so we made a model-based result
equation. This quarter, the legal framework has been put in place, and we have a normal
risk estimate; and the risk estimate is year to date.
Therefore, what we see now is that the result, as we booked it in the ﬁrst and Second
Quarter, were on the conservative side, on the low side, and that the best estimate for the
future is one-third of the results we have year to date; i.e., the results year to date are
sustainable from our point of view for Sweden.
When it comes to Norway, it's the paid-up policies booked that had good risk results,
both from disability and mortality in the Third Quarter.

FINAL

We would usually see some ﬂuctuations from quarter to quarter in these results, but the
fact that the results were negative in the ﬁrst and Second Quarter, and positive in the
Third Quarter, gives the eﬀect that while usually a positive result will go 50/50 to
policyholders and shareholders, since we had a year-to-date result which was negative,
the whole positive result of the Third Quarter went into the result to owners.
Therefore, the result development is as you would expect. It goes a little bit up and down
per quarter. It's positive in the Third Quarter. But the result eﬀect to the owners is twice as
high as it usually would be. When we had a NOK45 million positive result, we'd usually
see NOK22.5 million to the owner and NOK22.5 million to customers, while all of the
results went to owners because of the negative accrued results in the beginning of (it).
When it comes to market development regarding guarantees, I would say that ﬁrst of all, I
think the corporate markets are a bit waiting for the ﬁnalization of the products when it
comes to not at least the increased savings rate for deﬁned contribution products in
Norway.
So we are seeing -- it's not a very large transfer in the market. As it stands today, it's quite
a waiting situation in the corporate market. Of course, increased interest rates and a
strong market gives incentives for moving from guaranteed to non-guaranteed also on an
individual basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

But so far now, there has been a (law) proposal of possibilities from moving from
guaranteed paid-up policies to investment choice unit linked based paid-up policies, but
that is not put forward with the ﬁnal regulations so far.
So there is not an opening today for a large part of the portfolio to do that movement,
and we are expecting that to happen and are waiting for that to happen. And I suppose
that will be a very positive situation for the market and for our opportunities to move from
guaranteed to non-guaranteed going forward.
And that also has some bearings on your questions on dividends. I've always said that it's
not normal situation not to pay dividends. But I also said when I introduced this program
last year that this is a situation where our focus is to manage quite a large transformation
of the balance sheet without raising new equity capital; and that is still the main target for
this operation.
And as the top line is coming through, cost reductions are coming through, of course, a
lot of positive elements are coming in our way, but there is still some regulatory
uncertainty around how we really are able to attract non-guarantees from the paid-up
policies, the opening of paid-up policies, conversion into paid-up policies without
guarantees.
But most important, the ﬁnal regulations and the starting point are really the (longevity)
reservation where we said very clearly last year that it's a special situation in 2012, and also
special situation in 2013 before we enter into a very strict and clear framework for

Page 6 of 15



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2013-10-30

reservation in 2014 and ﬁve years going forward. So that is still the story that I put forward
when it comes to dividends.

Thank you very much.

Q - David Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Just wanted to check; in terms of the time horizon for further clarity on the transition rules,
could you just give us a quick update on when we might expect to hear further news on
that?
And a follow-up question to Peter's earlier question on the conversion from guaranteed to
unit linked; and I was just wondering, in terms of the voluntary conversion that's been
happening, how has that been tracking relative to what your guidance had been
previously, your expectations had been previously?.. I'm just wondering if you could give
us a quick update on that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then ﬁnally, you've increased the prices on the public DB plans quite heftily. I was
wondering, could you give us an idea of what the average increase is on the private plans,
or planned increase for the private plans in 2014? Thank you.

A - Lars Aa Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Yes, I'll start oﬀ with some of the questions and ask my colleagues to help me if I can't
remember everything.
First of all, what we have seen so far for the portfolios open for conversion, that is both in
Sweden and in Norway, we feel we have seen a good progress and success compared to
our plans when it looks at these portfolios that have been open for transfer. But that is also
portfolios that have a very clear value proposition, as we can move them from the
guaranteed into good product solutions that is an active solution that they can move into.
So so far it's positive but, of course, it's the large bulks of paid-up policies and the
transition of paid-up policies into investment choice that really will move the guaranteed
from non-guaranteed -- from guarantees to non-guarantees.
So good progress and good results so far, but the real market is not still out there when it
comes to (general movements).
When it comes to public sector, we had NOK24 billion that we expect actually to be
moved out of guarantees within two years, whereas around NOK6 billion has already

FINAL

transferred in 2012, and the rest will be split out in 2014 and 2015. And we do strong, as
you understand, the price increases also in this portfolio.
When it comes to the rest of the guaranteed portfolio, the DB portfolio as such, on the top
level I would say that we continue very much the pricing levels we have seen in 2013 into
2014. That can, of course, give eﬀects on individual customers positive or negative
compared year to year. But overall, it's the same level of pricing we are seeing into 2014
compared to what we have seen in 2013. Then it was a question about --? The ﬁrst
question was about --?

Q - David Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Sorry. Just the time horizon for further clarity on paid-up policies and the transition rules
around them.

A - Lars Aa Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Yes. That is always very diﬃcult, of course, to answer. The former government put a lot of
pressure by putting out the new framework for the hybrid products, and they said a
timeframe for putting this into the market from January 1, 2013 -- 2014, sorry.

Bloomberg Transcript

And they also said that their clarity around the savings rate in DC should be also put
forward at the same time; and also, comments on paid-up policies for investment choice
at the same time, January 1, 2013 (sic).
But then, of course, there's a new government in place now, and they have to adapt this
timeframe, and I think it's very hard for us to give any estimates on that as we speak.

Q - David Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Blair Stewart, Merrill Lynch.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

I've got a couple of questions. The ﬁrst one is you plan to make a decision on the
longevity reserve building in the Fourth Quarter.
I just wonder if you can give some clarity on what your thinking is at this point in time
given the market value adjustment reserve that you've been building up. And would that
change in any way the expectation of the -- I think it's NOK230 million per annum cost
coming through from 2014? That's the ﬁrst question.
The second question is you talk about it being important to have a level playing ﬁeld in
terms of contributions into the new product -- sorry, into the deﬁned contribution product
Page 8 of 15

FINAL

compared to the new hybrid product. I can see why that's important to you. But I just
wonder; is there anything you can say on the expected proﬁtability of the new hybrid
product versus the existing deﬁned contribution product, just to try and asses why that's
important to you?
And thirdly, just a point of clariﬁcation really, just relating back to the last question. Could
you just remind me why it was important for you to increase the price of the public DB
book, but you're quite happy with just maintaining the price on the non-public DB feebased book? Thank you.

A - Lars Aa Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Yes, DC hybrid. Well in my view -- well, the hybrid product can vary a lot. It's a quite broad
(law). It gives opportunities to put products forward that are in one direction very close to
today's DC products, and on the other end of the scale, you can put forward a lot of
guarantee structures in it as well. That makes it quite close to today's DB products.
We are in discussions with our clients these days to look if this is products that they really
like to see, and if this is necessary in the market and what kind of variances of this product
is necessary in the market when we have the framework of the DC products and the DB
products in the market already.

Bloomberg Transcript

And in that respect, I think it's important to say that if there is higher savings rate in the
hybrid product compared to the DC product, then of course, it might be a more
interesting product also in the market.
But if there is, as it should be, the same savings rate in the hybrid products, that might
then be a more a situation where we will see growth in DC product going forward and
more or less a run-oﬀ period that can take some time when it comes to the DB product
going forward.
When it comes to proﬁtability, then again, it depends very much on how you create the
hybrid product. But in the normal situation where you create the hybrid product that is
very close to today's DC products you will see, I suppose, very much the same pricing
sometimes in that product compared to the DC as such.
Pricing elements in public sector. Well of course, as we are building down our setup
within public sector, we will be out of that market within a couple of years, we like to
reduce our spending, both when it comes to manning and systems in that area.
And we have a lot of discussions with our clients to make that transition as smooth as
possible. But we also, of course, do price sales and (things) to make this also easier for
our customers in the public sector to make this choice.
When it comes to DB in the private sector, if we have a massive transfer out of DB into DC
today, you will have seen a build-up of paid-up policies in the balance sheet. So it's more
a balancing act, I would say about when it comes to the pricing elements in the private
Page 9 of 15



Company Name: Storebrand ASA

Date: 2013-10-30

FINAL

sector to make sure that we have the right incentives for our clients and that we're
balancing also how much transformation into paid-up policies we see and how that is
happening and when that is happening.
It's also, of course, a situation where we have seen some increase in the markets, stronger
markets, and some (more) uplift in the rates in the market when it comes to the bond
rates, and that in itself should have led to somewhat lower prices in the market. So by
doing stable pricing here, it's more or less a positive element into our balance sheet and
our result generation. Geir, do you like to comment on longevity reserves?

A - Geir Holmgren

{BIO 17639172 <GO>}

Yes. If you look at the status for longevity reserving, the status is that we have the
provision for new mortality tables. It's at the moment NOK4.3 billion. In addition, the
market value adjustment is NOK1.7 billion, almost NOK1.8 billion.
And it's fair say that the (US dollar with the FSA) both Storebrand, you have, and all the
large companies in Norway, during the next month to actually ﬁnalize what kind of
reservation plan we should have and implement during the next ﬁve years, which is the
reservation period for ﬁnalizing or ﬁlling the gap for the new mortality tables reservation.
So it's too early to say what kind of rules we will have and what we will do by year end to
meet that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Do you think that --? Just as a general point, do you think if you increased the longevity
reserve by utilizing some of the market value adjustment reserve, say NOK1 billion, then
that there would be NOK1 billion taken oﬀ the ultimate bill for shareholders, or is that too
simplistic?

A - Geir Holmgren

{BIO 17639172 <GO>}

That is too simplistic. I think what we have to see is what is needed to put forward on a
yearly basis these ﬁve years. The good thing is that we have already reserved quite a lot
that builds a buﬀer into the reservation period. And I also view the market value
adjustment reserve as a buﬀer that can be utilized when needed here to also build up the
longevity reservation needed that year.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

So is the guidance still for NOK230 million per annum from 2014 for ﬁve years? Is that still
the guidance?

A - Geir Holmgren

{BIO 17639172 <GO>}

Of course, it's a lot of elements that is moving in this plan altogether, but that is the
number of we forward in the early stage, and I don't see any reason to change it as we
speak.

Operator
Gianandrea Roberti, Carnegie.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon, from me as well. I would like to focus a second on the savings
segment. Basically, my question is that if you are happy with the proﬁtability, particularly
of the two unit linked in Norway and Sweden, and if you can elaborate a bit more.
I have asked this thing before, but when I look at the proﬁtability here of these two
businesses, it seems like in Norway, if I just take the result of the Third Quarter versus the
average reserve, I have a 9 bps margin, while in Sweden it is 6 bps.

Bloomberg Transcript

And I remember there is something about the diﬀerent distribution setup that explains
why Norway is more proﬁtable than Sweden, but it would be great if you can just refresh
my mind.
And secondly, I've also noticed that the reserves growth in Sweden has been very strong
in this quarter, and year to date, it's actually quite a bit above the reserve growth that you
had in Norway. And if you can just elaborate on that as well. Thanks a lot.

A - Trond Finn Eriksen

{BIO 17132188 <GO>}

When it comes to the strong growth in reserves that --in Sweden that is, it could be
connected to the exchange rate. The Swedish krona has strengthened quite a lot towards
Norwegian kroner. And although there have been a good underlying development, also if
you mention local currency, that growth becomes stronger when you translate it into
Norwegian kroner.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Right.

A - Lars Aa Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

On proﬁtability, Gianandrea, there is a lag in the proﬁtability to these products. In Norway,
the portfolio is still very young. It really only took oﬀ in 2006 with mandatory occupational
pension. And that's why you see the enormously strong, improved -- increase in assets
under management.

Page 11 of 15



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2013-10-30

As you see an increase in reserves, there is a -- the proﬁtability comes behind the growth
in reserves. And also, this is very much a scalable business, so the marginal improvement
in proﬁtability is much higher than the average improvement in proﬁtability.

FINAL

So we are quite happy to see this very strong growth, and it will ensure an increased
proﬁtability in this going forward.
The Swedish portfolio is more mature and the market operates quite diﬀerently in terms
of how you pay brokers, etc., in the Swedish market. So I don't think the two countries can
be all that (accurately) compared. So I don't know if you can be more speciﬁc in your
question and maybe we can answer it so.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

No. That's ﬁne. If I can just go back to Trond's comment. Is it that perhaps you've written in
the text and I missed it, but, is it possible to split out when I look at the reserve growth for
the SPP, or for the Swedish business in unit linked, what's the currency eﬀect and what's
the underlying?

A - Trond Finn Eriksen

{BIO 17132188 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That should be doable by ﬁnding -- in the supplementary information package we are
giving you the conversation rate that will be used for the diﬀerent timeframes, so it should
be quite easy to eliminate the data that eﬀects.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

All right. Thanks.

Q - Daniel Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Just two questions from my side, ﬁrstly on cost cutting. You continue to deliver ahead of
schedule on this. Just wondering, going forward, how sustainable this pace is.
And secondly, within the insurance business, the P&C, you made a comment in the report
about increasing competition within the segment despite a very strong premium growth
year on year. If you could just elaborate on that and comment whether that's
(incrementally new).

A - Geir Holmgren

{BIO 17639172 <GO>}

Start with the cost cutting. We have very clear targets and very clear also measures to
meet the NOK400 million program that we'll have at the end of 2014 as the due date.

FINAL

And when I look at this diﬀerent measures that are taken (and indeed the
implementation), I feel very conﬁdent that we will meet this NOK400 million target at the
end of 2014.
And as you know, it's very much reduction in manning that is going on, and that we have
a very clear process going forward to make sure we'll continue. But there's also elements
around new IT agreements and so on that are already being negotiated and will take
eﬀect from First Quarter in 2014 and going forward. So it's quite clear measures that will
give eﬀect and bring us up to the NOK400 million all together.

And as we've said all along, this is not the end of the program; this is the beginning of a
continuous travel towards lower costs and more eﬃciency in the business.

A - Geir Holmgren

{BIO 17639172 <GO>}

Absolutely. The NOK400 million is just a number and a timeframe. This will continue in
2016 and -- 2015, 2016 and 2017, of course.

Now we have to also comment on P&C.

A - Lars Aa Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Yes. We showed a graph showing that the large operators in the Norwegian market are
losing market share and the new companies, the small companies, are increasing their
market shares.
Our platform is a digital platform which is eﬃcient, cost eﬃcient and distribution eﬃcient
in these markets, and we expect to continue to have a strong growth within our business.
But I was alluding to in the presentation earlier today that one is wondering how long the
large operators can continue to lose market shares. But that's an open question and we
don't see increased competition as of right now. There are more operators and all of them
are making good proﬁts in this market.

Q - Daniel Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

FINAL

Thanks for the opportunity for a follow-up, just on that same slide, actually. I was just
looking there are the numbers for your -- you've shown strong growth across the whole
insurance division. But within -- looking speciﬁcally within health and group life, I note that
that's about 5% up on a year ago.
I can't remember if it was this last Capital Markets Day that you held or the one before
where I think you were talking about that markets growing at 20% per annum, and I'm just
wondering whether there's been any change to that, or whether we should expect a
continuation of that sort of growth rate going forward; or what your view is on the growth
of that business. Thanks a lot.

A - Lars Aa Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

This is a combination of health and group life, and the strong -- the growth within the
health business is stronger than it is within group life and (workers' comp).

A - Geir Holmgren

{BIO 17639172 <GO>}

So Peter, what Lars is saying is that if you look at the health insurance market, isolate it, I
think it is fair to say that you see very strong growth ﬁgures, although group life is not a
growing market (at the same time).
