Greetings and welcome to the Markel Corporation Second Quarter 2014 Earnings
Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-andanswer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being
recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Tom Gayner, President and
Chief Investment Officer for Markel Corporation. Thank you. Mr. Gayner, you may begin.

Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Thank you so much. Morning and welcome to the Markel Corporation second quarter
conference call. We're glad that you're with us and we look forward discussing our results
from the first half of 2014, as well as our thoughts about the business.
Joining me this morning is Anne Waleski, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review the
overall financial results for the corporation. Mike Crowley is unable to be with us this
morning, so my Co-President, Richie Whitt, will cover all of the insurance operations. Then
I'll return to discuss our investments and Markel Ventures' activities.
Before we get started with the business of the call, we'll proceed with the incantation
known as the Safe Harbor statement. During our call today, we may make forward-looking
statements. Additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements is included under the

Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

FINAL

We may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in the call today. You may find a
reconciliation of GAAP of these measures in the Form 10-Q.
With that, let me turn it over to Anne.

Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid first half of the year. I think
the numbers speak for themselves, so I'll jump right into the results.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our total operating revenues grew 35% to $2.5 billion in 2014, compared to $1.9 billion in
the first half of 2013. The increase is due to the inclusion of six months of underwriting
revenues from legacy Alterra product offerings in 2014, higher revenue from the Hagerty
business, and higher investment income due to our larger investment portfolio. Also
contributing to the increase, other revenues were up 15%, $380 million from $330 million
last year, primarily due to revenue growth within Markel Ventures.
Moving into the underwriting results, gross written premiums were $2.7 billion for the first
half of 2014, compared to $1.8 billion in 2013, an increase of 47% due to including six
months of premiums from legacy Alterra products in 2014 versus two months of legacy
Alterra premium in 2013. Net written premiums were $2.2 billion in the first six months of
2014, up 40% from the prior year and earned premiums increased 42% to $1.9 billion for
the same reasons I just mentioned.
Net retention was down in 2014 at 82% compared to 86% in 2013. The decrease, which is
in line with our expectations, is primarily due to higher use of reinsurance on certain
insurance products previously underwritten by Alterra.
Our consolidated combined ratio for the first six months was 98% for both 2014 and 2013.
However, as a reminder, the 2013 combined ratio included transaction and other
acquisition-related costs of approximately $62 million or almost 5 points related to the
acquisition of Alterra.
The combined ratio in 2013 also included approximately $25 million or 2 points of
catastrophe losses. Excluding the impact of catastrophes in transaction and acquisitionrelated cost from the 2013 combined ratio, the combined ratio for 2014 increased 6
points compared to last year. The increase was primarily due to less favorable
developments on prior year loss reserves in 2014 compared to 2013.
Less favorable development of prior year loss reserves is primarily attributable to our U.S.
Insurance segment, due in part to adverse developments on our architects and engineers
and brokerage, excess and umbrella product line.

FINAL

Additionally, prior year losses for the six months ended June 30, 2014, include $27 million
of unfavorable development on asbestos and environmental exposures within our Other
Insurance Discontinued Lines segment. There was no comparable unfavorable
development during the six month ended June 30, 2013.
The consolidated combined ratio for the first six months of 2014 included approximately
$167 million of favorable development on prior year loss reserves, compared to $204
million of favorable development for the same period in 2013. The benefit of the
favorable development on prior year loss reserves had less of an impact on the
combined ratio in 2014 than in 2013 due to higher earned premium volume in 2014.
I'll take a minute now and discuss our asbestos and environmental reserve review, which
we completed in the second quarter for 2014. Typically, we complete an annual review of
asbestos and environmental exposures during the third quarter of the year unless
circumstances suggest an earlier review is appropriate. This year, we saw unexpected
activity on a small number of claims early in the year, which we believe warranted
accelerating our annual review. During this year's review, we increased our expectation of
the severity of the outcome of certain claims subject to litigation and as a result increased
prior year loss reserves by $27 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

During our 2013 annual review, which was completed during the third quarter of last year,
our expectation of the severity of the outcome of claims known at such time also
increased. As a result, prior year loss reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures
were increased by $28 million during the third quarter of 2013.
The need to increase asbestos and environmental losses in each of the past three years
demonstrates that these reserves are subject to significant uncertainty and volatility
resulting from an unpredictable and unfavorable legal climate.
Excluding the impact of transaction and acquisition-related costs from 2013, the decrease
in the consolidated expense ratio in the first half of 2014 was driven by higher earned
premiums in each of our ongoing operating segments compared to a year ago.
Now, I'll talk about the results of Markel Ventures. During the first six months of 2014,
revenues from Markel Ventures were $355 million compared to $314 million a year ago.
Net income to shareholders from Markel Ventures was just over $5 million in 2014,
compared to $10.5 million for the same period in 2013. EBITDA was $35 million in 2014,
compared to $40 million in 2013.
For the six months ended June 30, 2014, higher revenues attributable to our acquisition
of Eagle Construction were partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our
manufacturing operations as a result of fewer shipments and orders in the first half of
2014 compared to 2013.
Net income to shareholders and EBITDA from our Markel Ventures operations decreased
for the first six months of 2014 compared to the same period of 2013, primarily due to

Page 3 of 16

Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2014-08-07

FINAL

less favorable results in our manufacturing operations partially offset by favorable impact
from our acquisition of Eagle Construction.
Turning to our investment results, investment income was $179 million for the first half of
2014, compared to $143 million in the same period last year. Net investment income for
2014 was net of $33 million in amortization expense from adjusting Alterra's fixed maturity
securities to a new amortized cost basis at the acquisition date. The benefit of holding a
larger portfolio was partially offset by lower yields.
Net realized investment gains for the period were $26 million compared to $34 million a
year ago. Included in net realized gains were $1 million of other than temporary
impairments as compared to $4.6 million in 2013.
Looking at our total results for the year, our projected effective tax rate was 24% in the
first half of 2014 compared to 28% a year ago. The decrease in the effective tax rate in
2014 is due to anticipating a larger tax benefit related to tax exempt investment income in
2014 as compared to 2013.

Bloomberg Transcript

We reported net income to shareholders of $128 million in the first half of 2014, compared
to $117 million a year ago. Comprehensive income was $481 million for the first six months
of 2014, compared to $109 million a year ago. And as a result, book value per share as at
the end of June 2014 was $511.28, an increase of 7% since the end of 2013.
Finally, I'll make a couple comments about cash flows and the balance sheet. Net cash
provided by operating activities was $237 million for the first six months of 2014,
compared to $240 million for the same period of 2013. The decrease is due to higher tax
payments for our international operations partially offset by higher cash flows from
underwriting and investing activities due to the inclusion of Alterra.
With that, I'll turn it over to Richie to talk about the Insurance operations.

Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Thanks, Anne. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to talk about our U.S. International
Insurance and Reinsurance segments today. As discussed last quarter, the U.S. Insurance
segment comprises all direct business and facultative places written on our U.S. insurance
companies and includes all of the underwriting results of our Wholesale and Specialty
divisions as well as certain products written by our Global Insurance division.
Year-to-date gross written premiums in the U.S. Insurance segment have increased 19%
over the prior year. The increase was due in large part to Alterra lines of business that are
now included in this segment. Excluding these lines, premium volume is up approximately
5% mainly driven by higher volume from the Hagerty business, which was new in 2013, in
addition to growth in our casualty environmental and other lines, which more than offset
decreases in our brokerage property writings.

FINAL

The combined ratio for the first six months of 2014 was 98% compared to 92% in 2013. As
Anne said, the increase in the segment's combined ratio was driven by less favorable
development on prior accident year loss reserves, due in part to adverse development in
the architects and engineers and excess and umbrella lines of business. Partially offsetting
this impact was a lower year-over-year expense ratio. The improvement in expense ratio
was primarily due to higher earned premiums from including the legacy Alterra products
as well as the Hagerty product lines in 2014 versus 2013.
Market conditions remain competitive for the Wholesale and Specialty divisions. However,
we continue to achieve rate increases during the second quarter in the 2% to 2% range,
which was actually slightly up from the first quarter.
Market conditions in the Global Insurance division remain extremely challenging with rate
decreases in most classes. Property business and large casualty accounts are the most
competitive and are showing the largest rate decreases in our Global Insurance division.

Bloomberg Transcript

Both our Wholesale and Specialty divisions continue to work to reduce their overall
producer base allowing our underwriters and staff to focus on those producers that are
giving us the best opportunities to write profitable business. In a competitive market such
as this, it's important to quote our best opportunities and not spend time practice
quoting.
Moving on to International Insurance, the segment includes all direct and facultative
business written on our non-U.S. insurance companies and comprises the insurance
underwriting results of our Markel International division, as well as that portion of our
Global Insurance division underwriting results written on our non-U.S. insurance companies.
During the first half of 2014, gross written premiums in the International Insurance
segment increased 20% to $653 million and the combined ratio improved 5 points
coming in at 93%. The increase in premium writings is primarily due to the Global
Insurance division, which was created after our acquisition of Alterra and contributed six
months of business in 2014, compared to the two months that were contributed in 2013.
The improvement in the segment's combined ratio was driven by 6-point improvement in
the expense ratio and a lower current accident year loss ratio, partially offset by less
favorable development of prior accident year loss reserves.
As a reminder, last year's expense ratio for the first six months included approximately 3
points of costs associated with the Alterra acquisition. Additionally, the 2014 expense ratio
was favorably impacted by higher earned premiums from the Global Insurance line of
business, which carries a lower expense ratio due to lower acquisition costs.
The impact of higher earned premiums from the Global Insurance division, however, had
and unfavorable impact on our current accident year loss ratio since the Global Insurance
product offerings generally have a higher attritional loss ratio than other products in the
International segment.

FINAL

To finish up, I'd like to discuss the results of our Reinsurance segment, which includes all
treaty reinsurance programs written across our company either by our Global Reinsurance
division or the Markel International division. Gross written premiums for this segment were
$793 million for the first six months of 2014, which was up from $241 million a year ago.
The increase in premium writings was primarily due, again, to including six months of
writings of products previously written by Alterra in 2014, compared to only two months of
writings included in our 2013 results.
The combined ratio for the segment for the first six months was 97% compared to 118%
last year. Last year's combined ratio included approximately 12 points of catastrophe
losses. There's really no significant catastrophe losses in this year's results and
approximately 19 points of costs associated with the acquisition of Alterra. Excluding these
two items, the increase in the segment's combined ratio in 2014 is due to higher
contributions of premium from products previously written by Alterra.
Alterra's reinsurance portfolio included a significant portion of casualty reinsurance while
the legacy Markel portfolio was largely property reinsurance. Casualty reinsurance by its
nature is inherently more volatile and is a long tail product and as such the impact of
applying Markel's more conservative loss reserving philosophy had a more significant
impact on 2014 compared to the 2013 numbers.

Bloomberg Transcript

Reinsurance market conditions are without a doubt the most challenging of any areas of
the insurance marketplace. Pricing is down in most reinsurance lines of business and this is
clearly being led by property reinsurance where rates are down anywhere from 10% to
30% in some cases.
Summing up all the results of Markel's insurance operations, we had a good start to the
year of good first half of the year. Despite competitive market conditions, we believe the
Markel brand, our strong balance sheet and more meaningful market position has
produced and will continue to produce additional profitable underwriting opportunities for
Markel.
At this point, I'll turn it over to Tom.

Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Thank you, Richie. As you've noted before, one of the great things about Markel is that
we've got several methods to build the value of this company for you as our
shareholders. Insurance, investments, our industrial and service businesses and capital
management activities all work together to produce comprehensive income and value for
you.
As is usually the case, not every cylinder in the engine of Markel would be firing at the
same rate. The good news is that with our multiple cylinders the engine keeps moving the
car down the road at a pretty good rate of speed.

FINAL

Specifically, as Anne noted earlier, that shows up on the speedometer as comprehensive
income of about $480 million to the first half, an increase of 7.2% in the book value per
share. The longer-term and more meaningful rolling five-year rate of return of compound
annual growth rate of book value per share continues to be in teens and was 13% as of
June 30.
During the first half of 2014, we enjoyed excellent returns in our investment activities. The
total return from the portfolio was 4.6% with equities up 8.6% and fixed income up 3.5%.
Both of these measurements are more than satisfactory on an absolute and relative basis
and I'd be happy to sign up for them indefinitely into the future.
Sadly, that option is not available, so we'll continue to come to work every day and make
the best decisions we know how to make to produce good results going forward. That's
what we've done for a long time and I'm confident that our time-tested investment
discipline will continue to work well for you as our shareholders.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'm also happy to report to you that the recasting of the investment portfolio we picked
up in the Alterra acquisition is largely complete. We've reset the fixed income portfolio,
largely eliminated the high cost alternative investment activities and continued the
process of building up the equity investment in keeping with our traditional investment
discipline.
As of June 30, equities represented 51% of shareholders' equity, up from 48% at year
end, and we continued to methodically build the equity portfolio. We've enjoyed a roughly
700 basis point addition to our total returns when we allocate money to equities
compared to fixed income over the last 25 years. We'll look to continue to maximize the
amount of equity exposure that we can given our comprehensive view of the state of our
business, our balance sheet positions and the opportunities we see.
Turning to Markel Ventures, we picked up some steam in the second quarter after a slow
start in the first part of the year. Revenues rose 13% from $313 million to $354 million.
More importantly, our share of EBITDA from the Markel Ventures operations was $35.1
million, a decline of 13% from the $40.3 million we earned in the first half of 2013.
For the second quarter, EBITDA was flat at $21 million versus $21 million a year ago. As we
stated before, the manufacturing operations within our ventures group are lumpy
businesses where big orders come irregularly and make a big difference on the bottom
line.
The first half of 2013 was a particularly robust period and the first half of 2014 was a bit
light. Fortunately, we picked up steam in the second quarter compared to the first. The
order books are in pretty good shape and I'm optimistic about the balance of the year.
Also, I'm pleased to announce that after the quarter ended we completed the acquisition
of Cottrell, the leading manufacturer of car haulers. The initial consideration for Cottrell
was $130 million and this is the largest transaction yet for Markel Ventures.

Page 7 of 16



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2014-08-07

FINAL

With the addition of Cottrell, the run rate for the Markel Ventures companies now rounds
to $1 billion. I continue to expect double-digit EBITDA profitability from the group, and this
is becoming a more meaningful contributor to the earnings and the value of Markel.
We continue to see and review a meaningful number of opportunities at Markel Ventures.
We're picky about choosing our partners and we've got the alternative of publicly-traded
equity securities, privately held businesses and our own stock as daily choices for how we
allocate capital.
To sum it up, those of us sitting around this table have two jobs. One, we've got to run
our existing businesses to the best of our ability and earn good returns on the capital.
Second, we've got to make good capital allocation decisions with the money we make
from doing job one. I'm pleased to report that we're producing good results for you on
both fronts and we look forward to the challenge of continuing to do so.
With that, we're delighted to take your questions. So, Doug, if you'd open it up.

Q&A

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we'll be conducting a question-and-answer
session Our first question comes from the line of Mark Hughes from SunTrust. Please
proceed with your question.

Q - Robert Miller Myers

{BIO 1857793 <GO>}

Hey. Good morning, everyone. This is Rob Myers on for Mark Hughes. Two questions.
One, this dip in favorable prior year loss development we saw in the quarter -- is that kind
of a blip or is that something we should expect to continue going forward?

A - Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Mark (sic) [Rob] (22:51), I think we've said in years past that the history does not dictate
the future, particularly in this arena. So creating an expectation around prior year reserves
based on history is not something we've typically encouraged.
That said, what we would expect for this year is something that will probably be slightly
less than last year but not dramatically less. So I think some of the adverse development
that you saw this quarter we're hoping that we have taken care of this quarter and won't
repeat.

Q - Robert Miller Myers

{BIO 1857793 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. And then lastly just I was wondering if you guys had
an update on pricing competition, loss trends in the med mal and workers' comp space?

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

FINAL

This is Richie, Rob. In terms of med mal, it's still a pretty tough market right now. Just
looking at our most recent rate monitoring, we're slugging it out and getting a couple
percentage points of price increase on that business, but it's incredibly competitive.
In terms of workers' comp, you know, that's probably the strongest part of the market
and I didn't mention that in my comments, but in workers' comp we're sort of probably
mid single digits in terms of increases on workers' comp business and in California that
could be significantly more depending on the class and depending on geography in
California. So those two markets are on sort of the better end of the scale of where
various products are in the industry.

Q - Robert Miller Myers

{BIO 1857793 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much for taking my questions.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Please proceed with your question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. A couple of questions. I guess, the first one is on the Reinsurance
segment. You guys have been very upfront about moving the old Alterra business onto
your reserving methodology and that puts some near-term upward pressure on loss
ratios. I've seen that with past deals, so it's not surprising.
I guess looking forward in that business, maybe we have two potential opposing forces.
One is the market conditions all else being equal would suggest lost ratios get worse. At
the same time, as you kind of have already moved this business or at some point will have
moved this business into your own reserving methodology, you'd expect to see some
improvement down the line. My question is, do you think you can hold those margins flat
or will the pricing dynamics kind of overwhelm whatever changes you're making on the
reserve side?

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Jay, obviously, Reinsurance is incredibly competitive right now. To the extent we're still
writing accounts, we believe the pricing supports the margins we want to produce on the
business. And honestly, at this point, I'm not particularly – I'm pleased with the business
we've put on the books this year.
The big question to me is, what's going to happen next year, you know, January 1 and
forward, if people are looking for price concessions next year, I'm not sure that it's there.
You know, I think this market should be quite honestly at the bottom if people are being
disciplined about what they are doing.

Page 9 of 16

FINAL

So I feel very good about the business we put on the books this year. I feel good about
what we believe the margins are going to be. As you say, we've been putting Markel's
sort of level of conservatism and margin of safety on the reserve. So I feel good about
everything this year. The unknowable is where does the market go from here. I believe,
we, reinsurers, have given all we can give. It'll be interesting to see what the competition
is willing to do as we go into 2015.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Let's hope you find some sort of floor. The other question I had was regarding the
comment about I guess culling to some extent the producer base within wholesale and
specialty. What's the outcome of that? I mean, should we expect because of that action
top line growth to slow down?

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No. You know, when we've – you're always managing your producer base and you're
always trying to – it's sort of the 80%-20% rule that's interesting. The top 20% of your
producers probably give you 80% of your business and then you've got to decide what
the rest of that group do they have potential to move into that other group or do you
need to move on and spend your time elsewhere. So you're always managing your
producer base.
In the past, what we've seen is, when we focus more on the people who truly are
producing the business for us, volume goes up. We don't tend to take a step back. We
tend to continue to move forward, and, in fact, we're seeing when you back out what's
happening on the property book where pricing – where we've had to reduce because of
pricing, we're up in most of the other lines of business in wholesale and in the lines where
we're not in some sort of pricing action on Specialty. Again, we're seeing decent growth.
So, no, I think it's just a healthy thing that we're always doing and I think we'll continue to
see modest growth as we go forward.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

Nothing at all worth highlighting.

A - Richard R. Whitt

Nothing that we – you have a threshold for a named catastrophe, Mark, and really we did
not have anything that would have hit the threshold for any of the named cats. So it was a
very quite first half of the year. It's not to say we didn't have some attritional losses, we
certainly did, but nothing that rose to a level of significance.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. A question for Tom. It's just a not being able to hear and write quickly enough
question. In the context of Markel Ventures, you said that something is now at $1 billion

The revenue line going forward of the entire Markel Ventures group.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Got it. Thank you. And my last question, now that you've had Alterra for a full year, the
amount of premium that you retained from that franchise, how does that compare
relative to your very initial expectations? From my perspective it seems like relatively more
premium was retained than maybe was initially expected, but I'd be interested in your
thoughts?

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Mark, this is Richie. Yeah, I'd agree with you. I would say we've retained more of the
premium than we would have expected initially. I think, if you look at our 10-Q, we have a
pro forma gross written premium numbers in there for the quarter and year-to-date. And I
think actually in the quarter we were ahead of that pro forma number and for the six
months we were basically flat to that number, which some of that is growth in legacy
Markel products, but I have been very pleased with the amount of the premium we've
held onto from the acquired products of Alterra.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Would you say that the underlying quality of the book has been better than initial
expectations or it's just the way the market conditions have developed allowed you to
retain perhaps more than you might would have initially judged?

A - Richard R. Whitt

Company N ame: M arkel Corp

FINAL

I think the quality has been about what we thought when we went into the deal. I think the
most important thing in any acquisition, and I think I've said this before on the calls is being
able to keep the talent, keep the people, and we have done a very nice job there. The
people have stayed. And I think – I contribute [sic] the success we've had to the fact that
the talent has stayed with us. I think the quality of the business is about what we assumed.

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Mark, I'd add one point to that and that is the marketplace acceptance of Markel, which is
a bigger balance sheet that has the talent that Richie spoke of, that has gone well. We
didn't exactly know how to put pencil and paper that going into it, but we certainly believe
that the combined entity will be more attractive as an insurance partner for the world, and
that's proving to be the case.

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Yeah. That's a really good point that Tom makes. People like to talk about synergies in
acquisitions and we try to stay away from those words. But it is fair to say we've seen a
number of large accounts, particularly on the Reinsurance side and in the Global Insurance
side, where the Markel brand and the balance sheet strength and the relationships that
Markel has throughout the industry have made a difference in terms of business coming
to us. So clearly that has happened.

Our next question comes from the line of Charles Gold from Scott & Stringfellow. Please
proceed with your question.

Q - Charles Gold

{BIO 17653874 <GO>}

Tom, hoping you would go through an exercise with me and get out the back of an
envelope, and it's a Markel Venture question. Now that the run rate and revenue is $1
billion, looking at 2015, let's say, if the – and also factoring in that the metrics you were
looking at when you bought companies was roughly six to seven times EBITDA.
So the assumptions I would use on the back of my envelope would be, next year's
revenue sans an acquisition, $1.1 billion, that the companies that we bought may not have
lived up to the six or seven times EBITDA, so I used eight times. So I multiplied the $1.1
billion times 12.5 and get $137.5 million of EBITDA, and I bring half of that to the bottom
line in net income, and get just under $5 a share in earnings on an annual basis. Is that in
the right ballpark or am I thinking incorrect?

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

It was so pleasant I think I'll go home and say 2015 is done.

FINAL

Your back of the envelope thought process is directionally correct. The thing that we can't
take for granted (35:08), these things are always easier to say than they are to do. So
there will be immense amount of work to make that happen, but those rough, rough back
of the envelope calculations are directionally correct from my respect.

Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Please proceed with your question.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yes. I guess, first just maybe a follow-up on Markel Ventures. I'm looking at – this is a
simple calculation -- just the margin on the non-manufacturing businesses and they went
down fairly dramatically from first half 2013 to first half 2014. And I don't know if that's a
business mix issue, some of the different businesses, but I'm wondering if there's a
reason why they went down so much.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Right. On the non-manufacturing margins, I don't have – directionally what would be
happening is probably the biggest swing is in our healthcare area and there are two
things going on there. One, the immense changes that are happening in the healthcare
area have proven to be tougher challenges than what I would have expected to begin
with. We're addressing them, we're making the best we can of it, but let's just say that
that has been more of a challenge than what I expected.
Secondly, within the healthcare, there are things that we're doing where we're funding
and we have our foot on the gas to grow rather quickly and we're expensing new office
openings, something this is specifically in the realm of PartnerMD and incurring front-end
expense that we think produces wonderful returns on investment, but we're spending
that money right now.
And realistically, I would tell you that it's this time next year before you start to see
whether those initiatives are indeed bearing the fruit that we expect from them. And the
bottom line – just like in the Insurance business, either they will be bearing the fruit that we
expect or we'll stop doing it, one or the other.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Got it. And then maybe a question on the reserve. So the adverse development in the
architect and engineer's book and the – sounds like the excess and umbrella lines. What
were some of the key underlying trends that you were seeing that drove that change?

Page 13 of 16

Was this a severity issue and were there any – so one, what were the trends? And two,
were there any particular classes of business within the excess and umbrella area?

FINAL

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

In terms of – I'll start with architect. It's a relatively small line of business for us and I think if
you were to go around look at the industry, everybody's been struggling a little bit about
architects. Probably since 2008, with the credit crisis architects, and engineers got pulled
into a lot of new and different ways of seeking recovery post 2008.
So it's been one we've been chasing a little bit. The bottom line is we'll either get it right
or we're going to write a whole loss less architects and starting -- we don't write a whole
lot to start with, but it could be a whole lot less if we don't feel like we're getting the right
rate for it.
On access and umbrella, that class has been a terrific class for quite a while. We've seen a
little bit of early development recently and we've probably seen some auto losses which
is not surprising. We tend to see some heavy auto in excess and umbrella, but we've seen
a little bit of auto losses and we've seen a little bit of early losses. The team, again, is on
top of it and we're making some changes to address it and, again, we'll either get it
straight or premium volume will decrease.

Our next question comes from the line of David West from Davenport. Please proceed
with your question.

Q - David M. West

{BIO 1838548 <GO>}

Good morning. In the other revenue, other expense tables on the insurance side, you
have your MG&A operations and then the line item life and annuity and I thought most of
the Alterra life and annuity was in discontinued operations. Can you dig down and tell me
what that life and annuity line is associated with?

A - Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

David, it is in discontinued. And it is related to the Alterra discontinued Life and annuity
book. It's just not underwriting.

Q - David M. West

{BIO 1838548 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay.

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Right. Right. And I guess on the revenue side – I don't have the schedule in front of me.
The revenue side would just be some small premium adjustment. I think it's a relatively
small number that that could go – it will be a few thousand dollars each quarter. They're all
with their constantly adjusting premium. And then on the expense side that's just the
amortization, the accretion of the discount on those life and annuity reserves. So that'll be
a feature that shows up from now for the next 50 years on a decreasing basis.

Q - David M. West

{BIO 1838548 <GO>}

Okay. Decreasing basis. That's encouraging.

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Right, right. Just as that amortizes off.
