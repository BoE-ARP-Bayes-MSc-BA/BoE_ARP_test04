Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. This is Gianandrea Roberti. I'm Head of Investor Relations at
Tryg. We published our results earlier on this morning, the ﬁrst quarter result, and I have
here with me, CEO
Morten Hübbe; and CFO, Tor Lønnum. So, after a few words, over to you, Morten.

Morten Hübbe
Thank you, Gian. And we turn to slide number three where we reported satisfactory
results, clearly impacted by low investment return. We've seen improved technical results,
which is up some 30% year-on-year. But bear in mind that is clearly positively impacted by
low level of weather claims, low level of large claims and higher run-oﬀs. And we do see
underlying a higher claims level, particularly in travel and property, which is the
continuation of the challenges we saw in those areas in 2015.
The premium is in line with ﬁrst quarter last year. We see a positive trend that our largest
segment, Private, has a positive top line development of some 0.8% in both Denmark and
Norway. We have a strong solvency position at 212 or 199, if we adjust for the Skandia
child insurance portfolio, which we expect to enter our portfolio in the third quarter this
year.

FINAL

On slide number four, we show that the net promoter score has improved to 21 from 16
year-on-year, which is slightly lower than 22 at year-end. But in general, we should expect
some volatility in this KPI. Customers with three or more products is slightly higher at
56.8% against 56.5% year-on-year, and the increase is positive because there's a strong
correlation between the number of products per customer and retention rate, and
particularly in Private lines, Denmark, we see an increase of positive trend in three-plus
customers. We also see the highest retention rate in four years in Q1.
At the Group level, we see retention rate of 88.1%, which is unchanged from ﬁrst quarter
last year, but split between a positive development particularly in Private lines, Denmark,
and then a negative development in Commercial.
And over to you, Tor.

Tor Magne Lønnum
Thank you, Morten. Good morning, everyone. I suggest that we move to slide number six
and with the headline, eﬃciency program. So, the eﬃciency program continued to make
progress according to plan. We have quarterly savings of DKK 45 million, whereof DKK 15
million is related to costs and DKK 30 million related to claims.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we look at the initiatives that has yielded the savings, we will, in particular, sort of
highlight the outsourcing initiatives related to accounting also in the IT department. We
have tightened the routines around recourse payments in claims. And we've also
introduced a new process related to damaged cars.
If we move to slide number seven and look at in more detail on the expense ratio, we see
that the cost ratio has been reduced to 15.1% this quarter, which is down 0.5 percentage
points from the same quarter last year. And keep in mind that Q1 cost ratio tends to be
slightly elevated compared to the other quarters of the year. In terms of key parameters,
you see that the nominal expenses are down and also that the FTEs continue to decline.
And at the end of Q1, we are at 3,333 FTEs. So, continuous decline as I said.
Moving to slide number nine, there is a drop in top line based on ﬁxed currencies, 0.5%.
You'll have seen that the nominal drop is signiﬁcantly higher. But that is of course due to
the drop in the Norwegian krone, the weakening of the Norwegian krone.
Premium growth of 0.8% in Private lines compared to 0.3% last year. Despite declining
average price in motor, we think it's actually okay. The Commercial and Corporate are
impacted by the Norwegian economy. You've seen in the comments that we have lost a
couple of Corporate customers, which of course impact, in particular, sort of the top line
in Corporate.
In terms of expectations going forward, you'll all remember that we said we have 0% to
2% premium growth guidance for the full-year 2016. We maintain that outlook, but it
probably will be in the lower part of the guidance. So, that's important to know. It's also
mentioned in the report.

FINAL

If we moved to slide number 10, you can see that we have an improved technical result in
all areas except Sweden. As Morten already mentioned, there is signiﬁcantly lower impact
of large and weather-related claims this quarter, and it is combined with somewhat higher
runoﬀ which is something that I will address a bit later.
If you look at slide number 11, you can see that the average prices in DK continue to
decline somewhat for both motor and house; however, at the lower level than what you
saw in Q4, so slightly improved in that sense.
Average prices in Norway are somewhat higher for both products, increasing trend in
motor, slightly decreasing trend in house. We do expect to see improved development in
both countries going forward, as the price increases will start to ﬂow into the numbers.
And I think it's fair to say that if you look at one of the slides that Morten commented on
initially, you'll see that we are in the process of converting house products in Norway – no
sorry, I mean Denmark. And in particular, that conversion will have signiﬁcant impact in
terms of the pricing for the house products. So albeit a continued decline in average
prices, we do think that that trend will turn later in the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then you can see on the slide also that we have new information on the slide about
the average prices. Thanks to Gian, who thought that would enlighten you even further.
So, at least it should give you a quick view on where we are in terms of average pricing.
If we move on to slide number 12, you can see that we have a very good development in
Private DK, actually reaching 90% in the retention level which is very good. Keep in mind
that that may be somewhat impacted going forward due to some of the price increases
that we are – and the conversions that I mentioned, which is going on in the Danish
portfolio.
On the other hand, you also know that there is a bonus distribution which will take place
June 1 this year. So, that should mitigate some of the eﬀect. We have a stable retention
development in Norway for both customer segment, and then as you can see, we have a
fall in Commercial DK, which is primarily due to price increases introduced in the
portfolio.
If we move to slide number 14, you can see that the underlying claims ratio actually
increased by 2%, 2.1% overall. However, I would really highlight the fact that we do see a
deterioration in the underlying for Private with 0.9%. And if you look at Q4 2015, that was
at the same level. So, the underlying deterioration is stable. And as I've already
highlighted, based on the measures introduced in the portfolio, we do expect to see a
gradual improvement in numbers from Q3 onwards. It will probably have limited eﬀect in
Q2, but that, as I say, from Q3 and onwards, it should have an improved – it should see an
improvement. And I'll just repeat what we said after Q4 that there is about 3% price
increase across the portfolio.
If we move to slide number 15, you can see again here, we have a very low impact from
large claims and weather-related claims. And it's actually a total reduction of more than
Page 3 of 18

FINAL

DKK 200 million on the technical results. Run-oﬀ slightly higher at 8.6%, but keep in mind
that that's driven by the change in discount curve and the fact that we had made
reservations for that change. Also bear in mind that the running discount rate is
signiﬁcantly lower and, of course, will have some impact on future earnings.
If we move to slide number 17 and look at the investment proﬁt, there was an overall
investment return of DKK 17 million. It has been a very volatile quarter as I'm sure you're all
aware of. Equities is slightly lower. We do have a slight – have had a slightly lower
exposure in equities at the beginning of the year, which of course, has been favorable. As
you can see from this slide, we have a very low exposure to energy at 7%. You can also see
that bonds performed slightly better than benchmark. And equities also slightly better
than the benchmark, albeit negative. Emerging market debt and high yield slightly
weaker than benchmark.
If we move to slide number 18 and talk a bit more about the capital position. As Morten
mentioned initially, we have a solvency ratio at 212%; 199% after the acquisition of Skandia
child insurance, which is actually very strong. You see that it's signiﬁcantly impacted by the
deferred taxes, which has lowered the SCR requirement. You can also see that our own
funds have increased due to the inclusion of future proﬁts and Q1 proﬁt. And that's the
main drivers.

Bloomberg Transcript

If you go to slide number 19, you can see that we have ﬁnally received conﬁrmation about
the Natural Perils Pool in Norway, which of course is very positive. We highlighted in Q4
that FSA has stated a minimum 125% minimum threshold for the solvency ratio, which of
course we're well above.
You have noted that FSA approved the 2016 buyback, but also stated that the buyback
will have to be deducted in full at the date of the approval, which will have an impact on
the solvency margin in Q2. But keep in mind that we are en route to issuing new
subordinated debt of about DKK 800 million in Q2. And all other things equal, that
should more or less mitigate the eﬀect from the buyback deduction.
If you move to slide number 20, we have tried to show the solvency ratio sensitivities. As
you can see, it is very low albeit the spread risk is the most important. But I'd just say that
the risks related to the investment portfolio is very low, and that's really what we're trying
to demonstrate in this slide.
And with that, I think I'll leave it back to you, Morten.

Morten Hübbe
Thank you, Tor. On slide 21, we show a headline that we call growth products, and I think
it's extremely important to bear in mind that growth is not a priority for us as a company.
But we thought that since motor insurance will gradually become a slightly smaller
business, it's important for us and for you to be able to see which products and areas
gradually takes over, and we would try to make that more transparent for you in the
process.

FINAL

On this slide, we focus on extended warranty insurance for electronics, pet insurance and
child insurance. And in these three areas, we have examples of focusing on organic
growth, and also the acquired businesses. Basically to broaden the number of products
per customer, because we know that will enhance the customer lifetime – the customer
lifetime value. And through that, gradually begin to substitute a slightly smaller motor
book with both these products and additional new products.
On slide 22. We reiterate our ﬁnancial targets for 2017, and ROE at or above 21%, the
combined ratio at or below 87%, and an expense ratio at or below 14%.
Clearly, it's extremely important that we have initiated price adjustments, as Tor
mentioned, of 3% this year with a distinct focus on travel and property where the
increases are higher. Clearly, it take some time before they're fully implemented, we will
start to see the impact towards the autumn of this year, and also full impact next year. But
clearly making sure that we turn the trend of improving pricing at a higher level than
underlying claims inﬂation.
As Tor mentioned, we still expect top line growth in the lower-end of the range, 0% to 2%,
mainly based on the pricing initiatives we just talked about, but also the inclusion of
Skandia expected from the third quarter will impact that number.

Bloomberg Transcript

Gradually, we will start to see some impact from the membership bonus scheme which
will be paid out in June, 8% of last year's premium, but expectedly, it will take a while
before we see the full impact from that.
And then ﬁnally on slide 23, our new favorite quote on dividend. Clearly, payout is
extremely important for our business model. It's very important that we show robust
earnings capability also in the quarter where investment markets are extremely volatile.
It's extremely important that we make sure that the price adjustments we do this year are
large enough to more than oﬀset inﬂation. So, we continue our eﬃciency measures. And
then our strong solvency ratio, together with our swap debt insurance gives us a strong
ability to continue a strong development in our payouts.
I think with that, we will turn it over to your questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. And our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Jakob Brink from ABG. Please go
ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi, it's Jakob from ABG. Thanks for taking the questions. I have three questions,
please. The ﬁrst one is about Norwegian growth. I know, you already touched brieﬂy upon
it, but looks like in also local currency; it's been quite a negative development year-onPage 5 of 18

FINAL

year. I think after Q4, Morten, you stated that you believe the Norwegian market would
see positive growth in 2016. Is that still the case or have you seen any material change?
Then second question is regarding run-oﬀ gains. I think typically or historically, there has
been a fairly high correlation between high – large claims and your run-oﬀ gains. This
quarter, you have fairly low large claims, but very high run-oﬀ gains. Have you seen any
change or could you please just conﬁrm that you are actually now reserving for 20% or
best estimate plus 7% as you used to do, i.e., we should have 3% run-oﬀ gains over time
or have you actually increased your buﬀers, so, that we should see higher run-oﬀ gains
over time? I admit, I'm a bit surprised about the quite high level?
And then ﬁnally, I think Tor you said, you had some details about what we should think
about the Private and – in Private underlying claims ratio in Denmark and Norway. I'm not
quite sure I understood what the point was. That was – those are the three questions,
please?

A - Morten Hübbe

Bloomberg Transcript

I think if I start with the ﬁrst question, you can continue, Tor. You're right, Jakob, that for
the market as such, we expect positive top line development for Norway. But what we are
seeing is that, in particular is the Corporate and Commercial segment in Norway, it's
under more pressure.
We've seen one of our largest Corporate customers in Norway go bankrupt, which has
impacted our numbers, and we've seen a couple of larger accounts leave our books,
where clearly that is a matter of more pressure on macro, and our clear view that for us,
top line is not a priority in Corporate, and we'd rather live with a slightly smaller top line,
and then have a positive development in the bottom line.
When it comes to Commercial business in Norway, our sales is currently a bit too weak.
And to be honest, the retention rate is a bit too weak as well. And I would argue that if we
look across the mature businesses in Denmark and Norway, Commercial lines, Norway is
where we are the least professional, and where we will need to improve the most.
We have replaced our Head of Commercial during this winter, and we've moved the
number of our stronger managers from Corporate and Private to Commercial Norway to
strengthen our team. But I think it will take a couple of years before Commercial Norway is
where it ought to be.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yeah. Just to – it's all right. I'll just supplement Morten on what was said in Q4, Jakob. And
I think, it's fair to say that, Morten's comments was really related to the Private segment,
where we still expect to see somewhat positive development. I think we also said very
clearly that for – the Norwegian top line was clearly the area where we had the lowest
visibility going forward, and where we were relatively uncertain as to how it would
develop. So, I'd argue that, at least to a certain extent this is what we're expecting – what
we're seeing is in line with what we – with the comments we made.

FINAL

Now, in terms of the run-oﬀ gains that you highlighted. Yes. You should – you are right that
Q1 is at an elevated level, and we have tried to formulate it relatively subtle, I'd say in the
report. But the point is that, in 2012, there was a change – we had a forced change in the
discount curve, and that had a positive impact in terms of the investment income.
Now, in order to, we always knew that, that would be reversed at some point in time. And
we have seen that it has been reversed here in Q1 2016, and for that we made additional
reservation, and that's really – let's call it, the one-oﬀ eﬀect related to run-oﬀ releases this
quarter. So, to your question, we feel that our reserves are at the very – are very strong,
nothing has changed in that sense.
The reserving practice is still aiming for the 2.5% to 3% run rate over time. But as you
know, we have said that, it will be at an elevated level until – at least until the end of 2017,
and that still stands, but there is an extraordinary element here in Q1, which will not be
then repeated.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, in terms of the underlying claims, and I'm sorry if I wasn't making any sense in terms
of the statements I made. What I was trying to say is that, yes there is an underlying
deterioration of 2.1% if you look at the overall numbers. But keep in mind that typically the
underlying will be a bit more volatile when it comes to Corporate and the Commercial
lines.
And so, we think that it's really important to focus on the underlying in terms of the Private
lines. And you can see in Private lines that there is a deterioration of 0.9%, which is more
or less similar to what you saw in Q4. And my point was – simply that based on the price
increases that we have highlighted a couple of times, and based on when they will start to
have eﬀects in the numbers, you should see an improvement from Q3 and onwards. I
don't – just correct me, Jakob, if it's not precise enough in terms of the question.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

No, that was a good. Thank you. But just a follow-up on that, it's – I mean, so based on
what you're saying is that, in Q2 this year, we should most likely be seeing less than a 90
basis points increase year-on-year, and then you say positive in Q3 and onwards?

A - Morten Hübbe
I think we are likely to see continued deterioration in Q2, but the exact estimate is really
diﬃcult to give you.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Yeah, sure. Okay. That was it. Many thanks.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Asbjørn Mørk from Carnegie. Please
go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk

FINAL

Yes. Good morning. Asbjørn from Carnegie here. I have two questions. The ﬁrst relating
to your cost ratio. If you look at your acquisition costs, they're down 7% year-over-year,
seems to be explaining around 0.9% on the cost ratio. Of course, lower sales will beneﬁt
you there.
I was just thinking, looking ahead, it seems like, Morten, you were mentioning that you
were scaling up in Norway, and that retention is not what they ought to be. So, is there
any, you can say, future headwinds from the acquisition cost, and therefore should we see
a deterioration on the cost ratio from that? That was my ﬁrst question, of course, relating
to the 14% open low cost ratio target that you have.
The second thing on your capital side, the Solvency II ratio of 199%, and then you, of
course, said that you're going to start the buyback and included the Q2 capital, so you're
going to be – maybe slightly below that in Q2. How should we look at this? I know you
don't want to give us an exact number, but it used to be at around 150%, and of course
now you're including future proﬁts, and some tax assets.
So, if we do the like-for-like comparison here, is that something that you take into
consideration when you're looking at your capital ratio that maybe is a little bit more of
what you call ﬂuﬀy money now than it used to be? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hübbe
If I take your ﬁrst question, Asbjørn, what we see on the distribution side is that, in our
main areas in Private and Commercial, total sales is actually slightly higher than last year.
But what we do see is a potential to work with eﬃciency of our distribution model.
If you look at the past three years, clearly, the number one driver of cost reductions has
been the staﬀ area. Number two has been claims and distribution, and the business has
really been a distant third. So, in our view, when we look at the coming years, we should
continue to focus on staﬀ, and particularly, claims. But also we see much more potential in
working with the eﬃciency of our distribution. So, we don't expect headwinds from
distribution, rather, we see a potential in that area.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
And just to supplement Morten on that, there is absolutely no changes in terms of the
low-14%, target. So, in our mind, Q1 is a step in the right direction. And then, good
morning to you, Asbjørn, in terms of the capital question, I think it's really diﬃcult to
elaborate on your question. I think if you go back to Q4, there was a lot of tension, I'd say,
related to whether or not it would be a buyback program for 2016.
And what we have clearly demonstrated is that, even with the buyback program in 2016,
and even with the signiﬁcant – and as you know, stable dividend, the capital situation is
actually very strong. And I'd argue that we feel that our capital position is comfortable.
Clearly, you're right in the sense that there is slightly more volatility related to some of the

Page 8 of 18



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2016-04-12

elements that have been included both in terms of own funds and what has been
deducted in terms of the SCR.

FINAL

But I mean that's also taken into consideration when the FSA has stated the 125% target.
So, I think I'll just leave it with the statement that we are in a very comfortable capital
position.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
That was very clear. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christian Hede from Nordea. Please
go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. This is Christian from Nordea in Copenhagen. I may have two more questions, and I
guess it's more or less like one question. But wondering if you'd give us more information
about the price increases and how you think about that.
I guess, (29:03) in Denmark, for example, are you going to combine it in any way with the
bonus payment from TryghedsGruppen so that it's easier to, so to speak, follow-through
for clients, and then how do you see the situation in Norway? And also on the bonus
scheme, are you going to do any advertisement campaign? I think you mentioned that
before. Is that going to be just in the coming weeks, just before the payout or how do you
see that? Thank you.

A - Morten Hübbe
Well, good morning to you as well, Christian. Clearly, what we see with the price increases
is, ﬁrst of all, two diﬀerent areas. Clearly, travel has its own category with increases that are
very substantial, which is also required. And I think everyone in the industry has the same
challenge. When it comes to most of the other areas, the price increases are smaller than
in travel.
What we generally do is that we combine it with the conversion of our existing products
to our new products. And in many ways, we see a slight price adjustment in that process.
But also, we oﬀer new add-on coverages to customers, which has a positive impact both
to top line but also to our margin. And in most areas, we see a very strong reception from
our customers to accept these new add-on coverages and to pay the slight price
adjustments. So, both pull in the right direction as we see it.
And then, of course, as you mentioned that we're now communicating the bonus of 8% of
last year's premium, of course, helps the total equation and the total attractiveness of our
oﬀering. When it comes to advertising, we actually tested it few months ago that, 85% of
our Danish customers did not know that a bonus was coming.

Page 9 of 18

Date: 2016-04-12

FINAL

And we're starting here in April continuing in May and June to advertise signiﬁcantly that
the bonus scheme is starting. And we expect the 85% – more than 80% to drop
signiﬁcantly, and we expect customers to take this positively. And expectation would be
that the Corporate and Commercial market reacts more rapidly than the Private markets,
but generally, we expect a positive reaction.
When it comes to Norway, we see that our ability to carry out price increases is good.
There's still an exception in the Norwegian market that inﬂation is fairly high compared to
the rest of Europe, and therefore, the price increases can be carried out.
But we do see that in the Commercial segment and in the Corporate segment, the
negative development macro-wise is pushing people to lay-oﬀ staﬀ, have less lorries to
insure and to be tougher on pushing and negotiating on pricing. So, that is a slight
negative on the Norwegian development, but we are able to carry out price increases as
planned.

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

Thank you. And did I understand it correctly, Morten, that you're not going to combine
the bonus and the price increases. I'm sure it's not going to be one letter with two pages,
one saying, hey, you get money and the second one saying, no we take them again?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hübbe
They hit the market at roughly the same time. But of course, they are diﬀerent
communication tasks. But I think, all-in-all, the fact that they hit the market in the same
time gives a – I think the reception we're looking for, but I think it's also fair to say,
particularly in Private lines, Denmark that, even before the bonus communication, the
acceptance rates of the price adjustments has been very high.
And we see the highest customer retention rate in Private lines Denmark for four years,
even including that we've started communicating price adjustments. So, I think the core
business model handles the price adjustments well, and then the bonus payments can
give some added positive reception, hopefully.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question...

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Christian – I'll just make one more comment to Christian's question and that is, you
probably remember that we have sort of given you updates in terms of what's happening
with the motor product – and the new motor product in Denmark. And we actually
continue to see a positive trend in terms of the average premium for the new motor
product as well.

Page 10 of 18

Date: 2016-04-12

So in addition to the price increases that Morten already mentioned, we also see a
positive on the new motor product here in Denmark. So, that's really why we choose. As I
said earlier, we do think that we should be to move into a better development for the
underlying in Private going forward.

FINAL

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

Thank you, Tor, and do you have any numbers on that? I think you mentioned, at some
point it's 46% (34:31) higher on average than the old premiums. Do you still have an
update on that?

A - Morten Hübbe
It's actually slightly higher, now.

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of In-Yong Hwang from Goldman
Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you very much. So, two questions from me. Firstly, again, the price
increases, could you just give us a bit more detail about what is happening in the market?
Are the competitors kind of responding by just following you as the market leader, and
increasing the prices as well, or are they trying to win market share obviously by kind of
staying put?
And secondly, on Sweden, the underlying claims ratio, it's always (35:15) quite a lot there,
and I think there was some problems to do with the extended warranty insurance, which I
think you highlighted also, the growth area. So is that a market problem and how big is
this back in the Swedish portfolio? Could you just give a bit more detail about, what's
going on in that market, please? Thank you.

A - Morten Hübbe
Well, I think, In-Yong, on the price increase question, it's probably a bit early to tell what
the competitors are doing. I think in Norway, it's fairly clear that our competitors are
generally following the same trend. So, I think that is working out as planned. I think in
Denmark, the companies are still, to some extent, considering how much they do on
travel insurance, but I think everyone has the same need.
I think on the smaller products or on the smaller adjustments on the rest of the products,
we see some variation in the strategy between the companies. But we haven't seen
enough variations to sort of impact our retention rate. So, again, that plays out so far as

expected, but I think we need to move further into 2016 before we truly know the Danish
competitors' response.
When it comes to the underlying claims development in Sweden, ﬁrst of all, bear in mind
that it's still a very small portfolio, so volatility is much higher. But it's correct that in
extended warranty, we have seen that particularly the iPhone claims have been increasing
and we've been working to replace the repair solutions and the solutions to replace
phones and to do both at a lower cost. And both are needed to push the margin levels of
extended warranty to where we expect them to be. And every time there's a newer
iPhone version, the temptation to get a new one tends to increase. So, we need to
manage that quite forcefully to avoid higher claims. But generally when we look across
the board of the extended warranty, the margins are very strong, and we're very pleased
with that.

Good morning. I'll just supplement to Morten slightly. If you go back to the question
about price increases, what we do monitor, of course, on a monthly, weekly basis is the
switching ratio between the various competitors, and there is absolutely no challenge in
that area at the moment, at least not, if you can look at the larger competitors.
Also keep in mind that as Morten highlighted earlier, when you look at the price increases
introduced in the market, there is a – most of the price increases are at a relatively low
percentage, i.e., 2% to 4% which is what the customer will perceive. But then there is also,
as Morten highlighted earlier, an additional product built into the conversion or into the
renewal. So, the actual price increase on our hand will be signiﬁcantly higher than what is
perceived to be the price increase by the customer.
So, we are actually relatively optimistic in that sense.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vinit Maholtra from Mediobanca.
Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Hi there. Good morning. Thank you. Just – sorry to bother you again on the underlying
claims trend which is somewhat stubborn and as you said, expected. But I just wanted to
check, Morten, last quarter, you had commented on this soft dynamics of how people
don't really mind 2% to 4% that you mentioned, but they do mind 8%. Just my question is,
is this stubbornness of this 2% worsening of underlying claims, is it causing you to change
a bit the mix of the price increases between what you had thought at 4Q and what you are
thinking about at 1Q? Is there any change? I know the outcome, the total level you've still
conﬁrmed 3%. But is there any change? That's ﬁrst question.

Second question is, just on the Solvency II progression, I noticed as well though,
obviously, that the future proﬁt is a bit higher than it was assumed, last time you reported
this data, was DKK 600 million, is now DKK 750 million, like, is this just an unwinding
eﬀect? And the reason I ask you is I am just trying to square, well, obviously, claims is sort
of stuck at 2% worsening and likely to be next two quarter even or maybe next quarter
even. Just to what drives this future proﬁt tick up, please? Thank you.

A - Morten Hübbe
And good morning to you as well, Vinit, if I take the ﬁrst question, you're correct that
there's an underlying negative on claims of 2% the ﬁrst quarter, and as Tor has said,
volatility from Corporate And Commercial and our main focus is really the underlying of
0.9 negative on the claims in Private lines. And you ask whether that leads us to change
the mix of our pricing changes, the answer is no. You have to bear in mind that it takes 12
months for you to get to the renewals date of all customers and through that the price
change. And then it takes another 12 months to earn the actual higher price in terms of
accounts.
So, the only thing you could argue is that, ideally, our reactions to that should have been
faster during 2015 where we underestimated the inﬂation a bit. I think that's why in the
fourth quarter, we talked about the traditional challenge that the insurance industry gets
behind the curve when inﬂation picks up, because you do have this time lag. But actually,
when we look at the inﬂation and we look at the initiatives we've taken on pricing, we're
quite comfortable that that takes us to above claims inﬂation. But we know that it takes a
while to earn the premium and that's why we mentioned that we will be towards Q3, Q4,
and into next year, when we see the impacts of the higher pricing. And we will still have
some challenges from this question during Q2. But generally, there's a good visibility that
the initiatives we'd take are the right ones compared to the underlying inﬂation.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. Very assuring. Thank you.

A - Morten Hübbe
And on Solvency II.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yeah. No, you're right. Good morning, Vinit.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Hi.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
You're right. We did actually increase the inclusion of future proﬁts slightly. And I think to
make it simple, it's fair to say that we were a bit conservative in our ﬁrst estimate. So, it's

Page 13 of 18

really the approach that – I'd still say that we are on the conservative end, but perhaps not
as conservative as the ﬁrst estimate.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

FINAL

Sure.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
So, we have updated is slightly, but feel very comfortable with the amount used.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

And, Tor...

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
We are planning – as you know, the future proﬁt is really a function of the premium
reserve. So it will – it should, all other things equal, vary throughout the year, but we have
chosen to sort of stay at a ﬂat level and, as I say, at a relatively conservative level. So, feel
very comfortable with that amount.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Sure. And could you just comment please at also on that miscellaneous ﬁgure there on
that slide, which is obviously the large items since we (43:41) activation because previously
loss-making business is now proﬁtable or what's happening there? If you could add a
comment, please.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Is the question related to the SCR or related to the own funds?

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

To the own funds. I think in that slide, there is a – I'm just getting to the slide – there is a
number of DKK 267 million on slide number 18. And in the comment, it is mentioned that
it's diﬀerence of goodwill valuation, also DTAs, on the own funds, just to be clear, not
deferred tax in the required. But is there anything to note there or it's just a model
rehash?

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
It's just a model update...

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
...and I'd say very minor change.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

Sure. Sure. Thanks. (44:42) because higher proﬁts and mix (44:43), higher miscellaneous
is almost DKK 400 million, DKK 500 million. So it makes a little bit diﬀerence to the
excess. But that's ﬁne. All right. Thanks very much. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Per Grønborg from Danske Bank.
Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Per Grønborg
Yes. Good morning. It's Per from Danske. Two remaining questions from my side. The ﬁrst,
workers' compensation, the big renewal is January 1. How much of your negative growth
is due to lower volumes in workers' compensation? Should you take that one ﬁrst?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hübbe
I don't think we've published any numbers on that. But I think the...

Q - Per Grønborg
That's the reason I'm asking.

A - Morten Hübbe
Sorry? That's why you're asking. I think that the overall comment we can give, Per, is that
we're not seeing any signiﬁcant change in the trend in workers' comp in Denmark. We
actually see that Corporate Denmark has a positive top line in Q1 and we've seen sort of
quite stable renewal season in general in Commercial and Corporate Denmark in Q1. So
workers' comp there, it's not our favorite product, it's always a slight challenge. The
capital requirement is high, et cetera. But no real change in Denmark.
I would say in Norway, we have seen some tougher competition on the personal lines
including workers' comp. And bear in mind that personal lines is a higher part of the total
premium in Commercial and Corporate Norway. I don't think we've put any numbers on
how much the reduction is, but in general, workers' comp is like 40% of Commercial and
Corporate premium in Norway and competition has been tougher.

Okay. My second question is basically only a clariﬁcation. You write on page ﬁve that the
new discounting curve had impacted your capital position by DKK 187 million. Just to be
sure, this had no P&L impact, didn't have any equity impact. Was this solely something
that happened in the solvency numbers?

It happened in the solvency numbers.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi there. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just two left. Firstly, sorry to
return back to the sort of pricing and claims inﬂation dynamic, but I understand that
pricing takes some time to put through and then there's a lag eﬀect. But I wondered if
there was anything that you could do on the claims inﬂation side to help yourselves more
quickly. I mean, I remember in our meeting after Q4, you guys mentioned that, for
example, on home claims inﬂation that there are enhanced processes and controls that
you could put through, which should help like not letting the plumbers assess and ﬁx the
damage themselves and just putting some more sort of control around that. So, I wonder
if there are any areas that you're exploring and if that could be of any help.
And secondly, on the sort of customer and customer targets, so you got your NPS target
which you're largely there, that the customers with over three products and the retention
rates. I mean, on the 2017 target levels there, I mean, these are looking a bit stretched
now, because we're not just seeing the momentum on the customers with over three
products or the retention rate. I mean, are you still conﬁdent that you can hit those
targets, given that so far we haven't seen the sort of translation from NPS to – with higher
retentions and higher cross-sell? Thanks.

A - Morten Hübbe
Good morning to you as well and thanks for two good questions. I think you're
completely right on the fact that we can improve the claims management and through
that actually massage down the claims inﬂation faster than just waiting for the price
increases. In the organizational change we've made January 1, we've taken our – one of
our stronger people in ﬁnance and moved to be head of Claims Denmark. We've also
taken a more ﬁnancial person from product in Norway and moved into becoming the
head of claims, and one of their major tasks is clearly to spot areas where we can improve
our claims control measures.

FINAL

I think we've been very well developed in claims purchasing measures, but clearly we can
improve further in claims control measures. And one of them is the one you alluded to
where already now we have employed the extra claims assessors on plumbing, where
we're starting to see the ﬁrst early, early trends that the new plumbing claims become less
expensive than the old one, and that this new control measure is starting to have an
impact.
Bear in mind, it's very early days, so don't want to sort of over-exaggerate that. But clearly
that's just one example. We have a large number of items on the list of improved control
measures. We have increased the focus on fraud, which is starting to pay oﬀ. And we have
in a number of areas increased the focus on claims control. We'll be happy to talk more
about that during the next year or so, because it's really something that we have started
only this winter, so it's still quite early days.

Bloomberg Transcript

And when it comes to your three-plus question, I guess there's no doubt that the threeplus as such has increased more slowly than we have targeted. We're seeing now a
stronger improvement in the Danish thee-plus numbers and a stronger challenge with the
Norwegian three-plus numbers that has actually deteriorated. And we are currently
working on various initiatives to push that number further upwards. We have no doubt
that the current trend in Denmark is going to increase. But we also have no doubt that we
need to push it higher to reach our 2017 numbers.
When it comes to Norway, the challenge is that our motor distribution through car
dealers, we have too many customers in that segment that has only one product. We have
just, January 1, integrated that business into the general private lines business. We have
replaced the manager and we have put in place a program to cross-sell to these
customers, because that is a requirement to get the general three-plus number in Norway
high enough. So, as you can see here, we have a lot of activities in that area. And you're
completely right, that from a timeline point of view, we need to push those harder to
reach the 2017, three-plus target.
