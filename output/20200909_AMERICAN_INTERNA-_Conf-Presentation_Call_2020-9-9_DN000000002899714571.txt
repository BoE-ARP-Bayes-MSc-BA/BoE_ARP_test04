(starts abruptly) I think one positive thing though is that the foundational work that AIG has
done over the last couple of years, is a great positioning. I think a lot of carriers can make
a similar claim of being positioned, but both in a relative and in absolute sense, I think
we're in a much better positioning, especially with this current market environment and
the economic environment.
So, given that as a backdrop, our liquidity position is strong, our capital position is strong,
our commercial lines book, particularly in North America, has been largely re-underwritten,
it has got multiple bites at the apple. I'm sure we may get in something like that a little bit
more later. The lot -- there is continuing hardening in the market and it comes in many
forms, price is most obvious, but there's other ways to improve books, and that's
continuing. We derisk the CAT exposure, and you've heard Peter Zaffino talking about that
quite a bit. Through underwriting and also increasing our aggregate reinsurance coverage,
we created Syndicate 2019, to deal with that spike on the personal line side, on the high
net worth and as a result, the growth in that limit profile is radically different, than it was
before, across many lines including casualty.
We've really managed our product offerings and the hedging programs in Life and
Retirement side, mitigating the impact of the low interest rates, the volatile markets and
the impact on reserves and capital, it's consequent to that. COVID though, continues to
impact industry results. But there has also been a number of events this quarter, that's
really been, I think to your earlier point, pretty noisy, certainly a lot of hurricanes, there's
been typhoons, we've had a route explosion, not that that's a CAT. But it's large
unexpected risk event, wildfires that are still ongoing, COVID that's still ongoing, civil
unrest is still ongoing. Even the Iowa derecho, which I have to confess, I have to go back
and look at it, as to sort of where I pronounce every day, by the way. So I needed to get
up to speed on that.
But all of these things aggregate and low interest rate environment, that make it more
difficult and make things more price sensitive, in a correction type of sense. So, but I think
Page 1 of 14

it's safe to say, with all of that, it's still September 9th, so the quarter is not even over yet.
So, it's really hard to get a big year for how the quarter but look on CATs given that we
still have quite a ways to go, and CAT season in the Atlantic Basin doesn't even end until
basically Halloween, probably appropriately so. But, as a result of that, that we want to
remind you that on the reinsurance side, in addition to our current covers, we have
material aggregate protection, as well, and we even bought an additional 500 million of
that, to help with that regard earlier this year, before reinsurance market started to
harden. So -- but I think just broadly, we're confident in the team. We're confident in the
business profile that we now have, and with the balance sheet. So, without taking any
more time on overall comments, let me turn it back over to you, and let's kick off the chat.

Analyst
Okay, fantastic. Certainly people want to hear more of you, than they do from me. I mean
it's always true. So, let me kick off with one point that you made. You did spend a lot of
time talking about adjusting risk selection and limits management, over the past couple of
years. And I look at that as A or V, primary focus on the P&C side. I was hoping you could
update us on where you are in that process and how much of that AIG specific effort
needs to continue, and how does the fact that we're in a changing pricing environment,
impact that strategy?

Bloomberg Transcript

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, I think you're right. I think Peter spend a fair amount of time on the earnings
call, going into a lot of detail on that. Because there was a lot of lift that needed to
happen. And it was done in a kind of a compounded way. When you talk to some of the
underwriting executive management, you find out that you've got multiple bites at the
apple. Some are getting to the second bite, some are getting into the third bite at the
apple. Some getting no bites, because we identified poor risks and got them out.
So I'd say the first round, i'll just put this in context, I'd say the first round dealt more with
limits management in a purported reduction sense, price hardening and really weeding
out underperforming areas and accounts. And the second bite probably was a lot more
with, little bit compression in concert with the past deductible movement up, not just
capacity shrinkage, a lot more T and C, being Terms and Conditions, being involved and
implemented.
And for those who are getting a third bite of the apple, you've got not only rate on rate,
but rate on rate on rate. And so, I think we're pretty good positioned. I think we're pretty
far along. We're comfortable with the portfolio as a result of all those bites at the apple.
And I think one of the last things that we really had to do was the concentration risk
associated with PCG high net worth, which we have now had a solution for.
So the short answer is, we're pretty comfortable with the portfolio as it is. And then the
second part of your question was with regard to the hardening. That's just allows that to
be implemented on a continuing basis.

FINAL

Analyst
Okay, thank you. Another strategic question, earlier in the year, which now seems like
centuries ago, there was a comment that we saw hardening primary insurance market and
hardening retro market, without much happening in reinsurance, and my sense is that
reinsurance is catching up. I was hoping you could comment on, one, does that match
what you're seeing and two, maybe more broadly, how should investors think about
Validus Re in the context of AIG?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Well, first, let me just reiterate the first point, which is the rate increases were continuing
to occur at an increasing rate, and so on the primary side that's what we continue to see
and we really haven't seen anything sway back, when we looked into early 3Q. With
Validus, I think Peter may have commented on this as well, but with Validus they've also -they grew their volume on non-property spaces last quarter pretty significantly, but they
continue to have the de-risk property view that we had across the Board.
So, I think they reduced their volatility as a result, and they saw areas of growth, and as
the reinsurance market hardens, that Validus is in a position to really capitalize on. If the
trade-off is correct between risk and exposure, then even the property aspect could
probably inch up, but they are very well positioned to capitalize on every line of business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Sabra Purtill

{BIO 1764408 <GO>}

Yeah. And just to add on that, Peter had commented on the earnings call that Validus Re
net written premiums were up about 39% and in terms of all lines combined, the rates
were up about 16%. So, clearly they are growing in this market opportunity.

Analyst
Okay. And it's important for us to understand that again, you've had a lot of success in
implementing this volatility reduction structure and the rate environment may actually now
allow that to increase respectively.

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Yes.

Sabra Purtill

{BIO 1764408 <GO>}

And that's one of the things that why we pointed to, because I think one of the challenges
that we have sometimes is when people look at AIG, they look at general Insurance in
total, they don't drill down into North American commercial lines or just commercial lines
and total versus personal lines and we got a fair amount of criticism earlier in the year and
late last year about how our topline was not growing as much. And as you'll note, in
commercial lines, in North America commercial lines last quarter, net written was up about
7%, because with the repricing and the re-underwriting that Mark talked about, being
Page 3 of 14



Company N ame: American I nternational Group I nc
Company Ticker: AI G US Equity
Date: 2020-09-09

significantly through the last couple of years, now we're in a market where we feel
comfortable growing and obviously are getting rate. You have to look at it drilling down
into the four different segments we give you, because personal lines on the other hand,
as you know is a completely different market rate story than commercial lines.

FINAL

Analyst
No, absolutely. And that's helpful. I do have one question coming in asking about your
thoughts for growth going forward. You grew during one of the challenging economic
periods. So I think that's a positive sign. But, is there anything you can share in terms of
growth expectations back half of 2020 looking forward?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, I think in a directional sense, I think it's pretty clear that, there is margin expansion, to
add to Sabra's comments, I think is a nice intro into the fact that all rates and margin
expansion are not equal, either by line or by geography. So I think, it's fair to say that
North American commercial, in a rank order, North American commercial should see the
best gain probably followed by international commercial with personal lines, underneath
that, for all the reasons we know, LIBOR heavily regulated tougher to get larger increases
more muted.
We are, especially with North American commercial, it's not as a retail-driven. There's a lot
of wholesale non-admitted business as well. And you've got much more freedom of
written form in that environment. So I think there's quite a few areas, which we are in for
two reasons, Pivoting, the book has been re-positioned, the market is very supportive and
because the book has been re-positioned, we are now less reinsurance dependent, than
we may have been in the past. Reinsurance was very valuable by all the partners that
came on board with us, and you're always going to need that for catastrophe risks and
vertical shock and that kind of thing.
But the -- I agree with you. The market is hardening on the reinsurance side, and we have
Validus to take advantage of that, but from a reinsurance purchasing point of view, it's
going to be negotiations that are going to be probably pretty complex, they are in their
environment, as you said they lagged on rate and so but, we're in a position now that if
the reinsurance terms and conditions of pricing, we think are too stiff, we're much more
comfortable taking that.

Sabra Purtill

{BIO 1764408 <GO>}

I would just add to that, in terms of the book itself, you got to keep in mind the
components that drive growth. You've got retention on your existing book, which as we
were repricing and re-underwriting obviously, the retention was lower. Peter commented
that retention is up like 4, and 5 points compared to where it had been a year ago.
Secondly, there's new business, and Peter also commented on the call that new business
volumes are actually kind of light in the second quarter because of this -- just the

Page 4 of 14

FINAL

disruption that we're seeing, right, sales were low at Eleanor as well, but now the people
have adapted to this new environment, and we would hope and expect to see higher
volumes of new business as well.
And then of course as we've all been talking about there is rate. So from that perspective,
we would hope and expect that we're going to continue to maintain strong retention, rate
will go where rate goes, and as a market leader in many areas, we would hope to see
stronger new business as well.

Analyst
Excellent. Thanks. There was one comment that Mark made on the conference call, got a
lot of attention. And frankly, I was surprised how surprising, it was. And that's with regard
to loss trend volatility when we go through a, I call it once in a century event. I was hoping
you could flush out what you're seeing with loss trends and how comfortable you are, that
even maybe some of the more pessimistic scenarios are reflected in pricing and in
reserving.

Bloomberg Transcript

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Okay. Well, I was a little surprised too, quite frankly, because I thought some of my theme
was pretty consistent with what I've said in the past. I think, which I'm happy to go over,
and directly answer your question, I think it may have been, because it was in the context
of margin expansion as opposed to pure loss trend, and I think I made the comment that
if -- Peter talked about a 16% increase globally and it was 21% in North America, lesser
internationally and no one thinks is 21% loss trend. Right. So therefore there is margin
expansion in that sector.
So I think maybe they've got some of it, but you do have a lot of other forces, some of
which I think are really compounded now by COVID. I mean you always had the litigation
funding aspects, you've got some runway verdicts and so forth, but there still few and far,
that wasn't a panacea at that point, but with COVID, you've got now dockets in court
rooms that are really backed up. It's difficult to really get those things through.
So in some cases, it's going to be, especially on the GL side, or GL products side, I think
there is a real argument that, that's not a claim reduction, that's a claim deferral, and that
will manifest, it's just going to be a longer time of realization perhaps on some of those.
Certain lines like comp, it will become more self-evident, but AIG's comp book is largely
the three line large deals, so it's large deductible. So it's insurance money more than it's
AIG's money, right, involved with this inside of deductible. But one advantage, because
you expect to see with people off the streets, that from an auto perspective, it certainly
would be a smaller exposure.
But AIG has really shrunk its auto book pretty dramatically and I'm glad to say, in the
trucking space, because with trucking you pretty much got to take it all in, right, it's -- you
can't cherry pick and exposure here. There you take all those so depends on the size.
Where a smaller insurance, you got a much different choice, on what you're doing. So

Page 5 of 14

FINAL

you've got that. I mean, you've got the upcoming elections. I mean, that always -- with
Supreme Court's and the public court's designees and so forth is always changed. And
the -- I would say even the civil unrest aspects could find itself on personal and some
commercial lines, creating different exposures and emergences audits. So it's -- I think my
comment was mostly around the increased volatility of the loss trend, as opposed to loss
trend itself.
But for clarity, is there a margin expansion in North American commercial? Yes.

Analyst
Okay. And I think that's probably the bottom line of what people are looking for, and it
sounds like you're comfortable with that on both the rate and reserve side.

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Yes.

Analyst

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Another issue that emerged in second quarter was the impact of a much smaller
book of travel insurance within North American personal and I think that was more just the
mix of loss and expense as opposed to anything sort of fundamental with profitability. I
was hoping you could update us on how that market in terms of demand and how the
market for event cancellations has been evolving over the course of 2020?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Okay. (inaudible) start off that one.

Sabra Purtill

{BIO 1764408 <GO>}

Sure. So to start with our travel book which is in personal lines in both North America and
International, although the bulk of that is North America. It's about a $1.3 billion book, and
clearly when COVID emerged and flight restrictions and travel restrictions went into place,
people aren't buying plane tickets, so they weren't buying the travel insurance and as we
talked about in the first quarter, we had a -- I think it was about $86 million of our loss
picks for the first quarter were related to travel.
But when we have a commission sharing a range with that a profit-sharing arrangement,
so that as we -- people start traveling and buying tickets again, we will actually recoup
some of that through lower commission rate. But as you pointed out, the travel book is a
relatively low loss ratio, high expense ratio book of business. So, lacking the premium in
that, in the second quarter, combined with the fact that we obviously still have employees
in the travel business who claims customer service, and finance and the rest, it really kind
of made the North American Personal Lines ratios quite strange compared to prior years.
And then when you added the Syndicate 2019 on top of it, it was unusual.
Page 6 of 14



FINAL

Company N ame: American I nternational Group I nc
Company Ticker: AI G US Equity
Date: 2020-09-09

We continue to be a market leader in that business and we would expect, as 2021 comes
along, that we'll be again, people will be buying it, and frankly, I think the type of the
product that people buy will be a lot different going forward, in part because you've had
this experience that we've all gone through, right and so probably there'll be higher
utilization, but by the same token, you do have some airlines, for instance, United has
permanently waived change in cancellation fees. So, I think people might be more likely
buying in and -- hotels and car rentals and things like that. The other thing I would just note
and then on the event cancellation, so as the event cancellations book is largely written
through Talbot in our international portfolio and its commercial lines.
Obviously, and Mark can comment on this with his actual real background, then we have
taken reserves for those events that we have had known cancellations and there are
some events that were postponed, like the Kentucky Derby, which ran this week and-or
the Olympics, which were pushed to 2021. So we still have exposure to the extent there is
additional cancellations, but as far as the product right now, as you can imagine, given the
uncertainty, first of all, people just aren't scheduling events. And then secondly, it's kind of
hard to price and underwrite in this very unusual environment for event cancellation. But
the events cancellation in the travel book, combined with the business interruption, where
we have what I would call affirmative, contagious disease coverage, that's about 70% of
the reserves that we've taken for COVID.

Bloomberg Transcript

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

I wouldn't add much more to that really, I think it's important to realize that distribution is
inventive and innovative, so as airline travel is dropped off, lets say European travel,
they've pivoted towards having Western RV Park visits and things like that. So they're just
shifting to a different items. So the indications of course is that generally there was more
travel, incrementally more travel in July and August, and we're really a derivative product
travel itself. So there's put about a little uplift on that.
And on event cancellation, you also have not appearance. So you could have a broader
event. It's not just an events or a rock group, it could be a series of performers and there
could be a non-appearance by one of them, where it goes on, but it's still impactful. But,
so you have that covered. Still, but that's not similar, people don't want to take the risk of
going through all that event creation and being on the hook.

Analyst
Okay, thank you. The next question is both internal and external, and it's with regards to
changing work environments. So, that has implications, I think both for potential loss is
people aren't shopping. You don't have the slip and falls, you don't have workers
compensation claim frequency, how does a Company like AIG anticipate a changing set of
exposures in pricing and in underwriting, and then internally, obviously there is AIG-200
ongoing right now. And I've actually this has ramifications for that as well. So I was hoping
you could talk about those two sides of this COVID induced phenomenon?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Page 7 of 14



FINAL

Company N ame: American I nternational Group I nc
Company Ticker: AI G US Equity
Date: 2020-09-09

Well, let me just start that. I'll start with the insurance evaluation on it. Clearly, if there is
fewer companies that need insurance, that's impactful and the ones that continue to
need it, if their exposure drops that's impactful, meaning negatively impactful. But and
therefore the exposure base itself may not necessarily be proportional to the risk
anymore. I think the classic example, let's say pre-COVID is why you cant get quarterly
CAT covers. Right. So that would be too concentrated the CAT is over the course of the
year and you just can't buy a 3Q CAT cover, because it also it's disproportionate. So I think
-- I think from that respect, you get that kind of the impact, but. So what do you got to do,
you got to be very careful as to what the exposures are, have there been divestitures in
that, does sales and workers comp of payroll, are they matching up with each other.
You could wind up having some of the distribution force trying to help their customers,
take the low end of the exposures and therefore you're setting yourself up for additional
premium on audit and things of that nature. So you don't want to have a disproportionate
out of your book, subject to annualize being audit bring in as opposed to the (inaudible).
So, but overall, it's the insurance side, it's fewer exposure units and perhaps different
lower exposures within those exposure units, coupled with the measurement exposure
itself being appropriate it. So it's really, there is certain coverages or certain industries that
you can tag, hotels for example and others that you can tag as going to be down for a
while, but on the line-by-line, account-by-account basis, they are the things you have you
focus on.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, I would say pretty everything to add before we put it to actually the inside as
opposed to the outside.

Sabra Purtill

{BIO 1764408 <GO>}

Ideally, I want to add is just a reminder that obviously we within AIGRM, the AIG Risk
Management book of business, a lot of that experience change is going to be in the
working layer of the policyholder as opposed to the excess layers, which is where we
would attach.

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Right and I think we said the average deductible attachment, is our comp GL Auto, three
line deals, it's averaging north of a million. As so you're going to eliminate a lot down
there. If it was softer markedly at $100,000, $200,000, it's a different story. But this
eliminates a lot of frequency and a fair amount of severity at those levels as well. On the
inside, just take AIG, for example, we are targeting a January 1st to in a lot of countries,
right, and a lot of different offices. So, it's not an absolute rule. But it's not a bright line, it's
a line of demarcation, but with -- we made that call a while ago. But with all the increasing
unknowns. So If kids are going back to school, there you see in, for us, all the
aggregations, whether it's college or just other events that happen that could possibly
reopen things again.
So, others are doing similar things. So If they are not reopening their offices, that can also
lead to your first question about the insurable exposures, but it could just change the level
of the recovery, putting on your stress assumptions, but from an AIG-200 perspective, we
Page 8 of 14



Company N ame: American I nternational Group I nc
Company Ticker: AI G US Equity
Date: 2020-09-09

actually got some benefits because people are traveling, that everyone's really available
for group meetings. So we're actually getting more done in that respect, as opposed to
less done in that respect.

FINAL

Sabra, anything you want to add?

Sabra Purtill

{BIO 1764408 <GO>}

I would just add and that we commented in the second call, I mean the priority as some of
the programs and the progress that we've made under AIG-200 is a little different than
what we thought it was going to be at the start of the year. But we do remain on track,
both from the expense realization as well as the project perspective, it's a three-year
program. Right? So we've still got some time to go.

Analyst
But it sounds, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like you've had the
opportunity to move ahead with some of the things, because you've had more time to
discuss them.

Bloomberg Transcript

Sabra Purtill

{BIO 1764408 <GO>}

Yeah. An example would be on our commercial underwriting platform, because, as Mark
said, people are available to work on the projects. We aren't traveling, there is -- we're
not doing client entertainment and things like that, that people are available and focused
on getting their technology platform pulled together and making very good progress on
that, faster than we expected.

Analyst
Okay. We've had a question come in and I can guarantee it's not the first time that you've
heard this question, but it clearly comes up a lot. And that is, with regard to both, the
financial and strategic benefits of keeping Life and Property & Casualty under one
umbrella, instead of having multiple companies. Can you give us an update on, well, I
guess, does your thinking on that change over time and how you are thinking about it
now?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Both Brian said, that's something that is a primary responsibility of a CEO and the senior
team with the Board. Those things are constantly reviewed and on the landscape of
competing alternatives of what things you can do. But, let's not forget, it's still have
although tax rate was 21 right, from 35. So it's shrunk the size a bit. It's still meaningful, is
about 8.6, I think at quarter end. Between the NOLs and foreign tax credits. There still
meaningful as is the capital diversification benefits that you get.

Page 9 of 14

FINAL

And there's other aspects to, but just because they shrunk, doesn't mean they are not so
material and depending on who wins, you read some of the platforms at rate goes back
to 28%, that kind of takes half of that back. That was cut prior. So it's a continual topic, of
course, but I just don't want people to underplay the material impact of the items I just
referenced.

Analyst
Right. The way you're discussing at those, I understand correctly, more on the financial
side and strategic side, is that a fair read?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

No, it would be, you got to look at more than one lens, on those things. And so multiple
lenses would be used.

Analyst
Okay. I guess, the related capital question or maybe I am trying too hard for natural side
where it doesn't exist, but can you give us, impact on capital management opportunities,
whether that's share repurchases, M&A opportunities or more broadly.

Bloomberg Transcript

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Well, I think lets make a couple of observations first, right. As I said up, I'll ask Sabra to
also, churn in on that. So, prior to COVID, we made three comments that, debt leverage
reduction was one of our key or higher level key priorities, and in the face of COVID what
have we done. We initially took a partial drawdown on our revolver in a liquidity and capital
risk management framework.
We've repaid debt fully, as we've disclosed, and we went to the capital markets as both a
better economic time period to do it, but also to get in advance, we could return that
revolver money and pre-fund a fair amount of debt maturities to go through the early part
of next year by $2.8 billion, which go through early part of next year.
So view it as a temporary meaningful, still unknown corporate risk management approach,
overall. So, the consequence of that is to have your debt and coverage change, but
there's going to be natural improvement on that as the maturing securities run through.
And that will take the leverage back to a much more manageable period of time, which
would then open the door to other capital management options. So, I think, after all I'm
trying to do is, similar to your segue, is to say what was the priority and how has that
changed. And why did the change. It was for that reason, but it will also naturally reduce
over time and then make that not as a key concern because it won't be viewed really as a
debt leverage outlier.

Thank you.

FINAL

Sabra Purtill

{BIO 1764408 <GO>}

And I would just. I would just add to that, because you did ask especially about M&A.
Obviously with our stock price trading where it is, the most attractive opportunities we
see for capital deployment, are first organically within the commercial lines book, because
of everything we've been talking about in terms of the pricing momentum and expected
improvement in the margins in that book of business. And then secondly, obviously, share
repurchase, so M&A is not something that's a priority for us at this point in time. I know
that there are some transactions out there, and notably like all states transaction, but for
us, we're really focused on organic growth opportunities, and as Mark mentioned, in
managing the balance sheet, relative to our leverage ratios right now.

Analyst
Okay, that's helpful, and yes, certainly there are, I mean I'm sure you're getting no
shortage of people encouraging some sort of several purchase, obviously when your
confidence in the economic environment allows it. Another obvious use of cash is on the
investment portfolio and here, this is a multi-faceted question. How does the strategy
evolve, when you've got, you've got lower interest rates, you got other opportunities and
challenges in the investment arena. How do we take all of that, all of those inputs and
understand how the investment approach is staying the same or changing.

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Well, I think you saw in the deck that IR put together, for the second quarter and fixed
income quarter-over-quarter, roughly a 40 dip drop off quarter-over-quarter fixed income,
which is in automation of things. So you're going to get compression and that's going to
hit NII across the Board. That's going to hit LLR which is a spread business right. So it's
clear that there's a lot of places where that could hit.
On the GI side, for example, first off, remember, the durations and the volatility are
radically different in rough numbers you could -- you got about a 3.5 year duration on the
GI side meet their peers on the LLR side, but the volatility characteristics are also a
radically different. Right. You can have massive CAT call and other aspects of the property
casualty side and a lot of risk losses where things are more long term, the variability is not
as great on the Life and Retirement side at any given quarter or any given calendar year.
So you need longer dated assets. We have other issues because of variable annuity
guarantees and things like that that you have to manage around. Whereas GI, you have to
have it, you're trying to maximize yield, but you can't do it in a silly way, because you got
to have a highly liquid assets on the regulatory framework on that. So going into a planting
season is what is your mix of business, what is the volatility current characteristics.
Therefore the predictable aspects of those cash flows on both sides of the house are
going out the door and given we have $350 billion, and that's for assets. So it's -- First,
you got to think about what's the scale that we have to buy, you can't go out and try to
get 20% of an asset class market as an extreme example is good luck on something like
that. But you're also doing it with a nicer tax efficiency and capital efficiency, so you're

trying to get a good enough spread that you also minimize the capital allocated to the
investment function the rectification credits that you get there.
So it's, there is a lot that goes on, but I think it's -- it would be naive to say anything, but
there is increased pressure on, as we stay into this continued low rated environment by
it's increased pressure. So what's that do on the other end, that's another sustaining clear
force towards on the PC side anyway by keeping rates strong and maintaining that
because that's going to be made up somewhere, and that's where it has to be better.

Analyst
Okay. I've got a related question to this and I was hoping you could share with us your
thoughts on earnings visibility going forward, because we've got the interest rate
pressure, we've got the rental improvement on underwriting results within P&C, we've
got pressure in Life and Retirement, can you couple all that together for us in terms of
earnings visibility?

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Yeah, I still think COVID's so far is such a screwball, that we're not going to really have a
lot of visibility. I still feel the same way I did in March on that. I still think there's going to be
increased government programs, that's going to possibly change the dynamics, on what it
supports and what it may not support, in terms of keeping assets strong and so forth. And
we don't know what the tax rate is going to have a liquidity. I think it's going to have to try
to taxes up right, if we keep doing that would change it. So I think really the
straightforward answer to your question is, 2021 is going to be where we should have
some increased visibility, but it's not the latter half of this year.

Analyst
Okay, thank you. We're one of the issues with the third quarter of an actuarial assumption
review. Can you update us on current long-term interest rate assumptions? And how on
the outside, we should think about the updating process?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Okay. Well, the current 10-year assumption was 3.5%. And that's last year when you
actually lowered to 3.5%, I think on those that disclose it was pretty much down the
middle. It was some higher, some lower than that. I think a couple of our -- our peers have
come out and one lowered it from 3.75% to 3.25% I believe, and another ones in the 2%s.
We have a really good internal process on that. The process is going to be the same, it's
not like we're radically changing the process, the governance is good, it is a robust
process around reviews of outside eyes, whether it'd be ERM or other other constituents
inside the company and outside the company. I'm taking a look at those assumptions. So I
don't have the details for you. That will be on our call that will have it, but I think it's fair to
say that it will wind up being that at least that plug which is the 10-year that everyone
focuses on, which is only a piece of the action, right, the spreads -- and mean reversion of

that over time of that whatever you target at, what's it going to be in 5 years, 10 years, 15
years and so forth. So I think it's safe to say it's going to be lower than what we have now.

Sabra Purtill

{BIO 1764408 <GO>}

Yeah. And just to add recall. It's all assumption. So it's policyholder behavior, lapse
behavior, expenses and the rest. And as you know, a lot of this will with LDTI coming along
in 2022 and 2023, it's all going to change again. So, but it is a soup to nuts kind of
evaluation of the performance underlying the contracts and, as you know, our portfolio is
mostly annuity based, there is a life portfolio as well, where we look at mortality
assumptions. Although we have talked about how although COVID has elevated mortality,
it's not significantly different than pricing assumptions with respect to mortality.
And then with respect to lapse assumptions, in a low interest rate environment, the lapse
performance on fixed annuities and fixed index actually improved, which lengthens the
duration and give a longer recovery period to obviously make the spreads on that. So, it is
like I said not, this is an excessive amount of focus on the interest rate assumptions. I
think, and we'll be talking about all of those when we report third quarter earnings.

Analyst

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. So it's certainly very complex. So, thank you. So we've got about a minute left. And I
was just going to ask both Mark and Sabra for closing comments, in terms of maybe what,
this will be my opinion, I trust you shared, what the market is missing with regard to AIG
and its intrinsic value?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

That's a great question. That's a great question. I would say that the -- although, I believe
it's acknowledged that the general insurance turnaround has been complex and a steep
incline to pull off, we have pulled that off. And I think more than anything else, the engine
inside that has not really been appreciated by the marketplace. Yes, I'll keep it (inaudible).

Sabra Purtill

{BIO 1764408 <GO>}

And I'll say that I think that and look, we understand the Life and Retirement business is
not a particularly well valued by the market at this point in time, but we do have a very
strong balanced conservative portfolio of Life and Retirement products. It is more
Retirement than it is Life. And we have, as you know, a very strong group retirement
business with VALIC, diversification among the products, we have no legacy exposure to
long-term care. We don't have legacy exposure to what I would call the nuclear arms race
variable annuity-type products.
So, we have a very strong stable portfolio that has generated significant income over
time. And it will, perhaps because people are focused on the GI turnaround and perhaps
because we don't do a good enough job explaining that to people. I do think that the
valuation that's being put on our Life and Retirement business isn't reflective of their cash
flows or returns.

I put an applaud for three hour conference call with every earnings, but I'm not sure that,
that is actually practical. Mark and Sabra, thank you. This was very informative. Very helpful.
And thank you very much for your time and look forward to speaking with you again soon.
