Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you for joining us this morning. Last quarter, I shared that I had never been more
excited about the future of the Hartford. Our second quarter results support that
optimism. All the components of our strategy are coming together to deliver growth,
margin expansion and operating efficiencies.
In the second quarter, we reported core earnings of $836 million or $2.33 per diluted
share. 8% growth in year-over-year diluted book value per share, excluding ALCI, and a
trailing 12 month core earnings ROE of 13.1%. In addition, we returned $694 million to
shareholders in the quarter from share repurchases and common dividends. The
upstanding financial performance of the Hartford reflects strong execution and success of
our strategy to focus on high return businesses where we have market leadership and
sustainable competitive advantages. You can have a growth as measured by GDP
reached a record level in the second quarter. And while moderation is expected, the
overall trend will remain elevated through 2021. This economic expansion will grow the
premium base of our employment-centric businesses and other lines as they benefit from
job creation, a new business formations.
Meanwhile, we are closely monitoring the recent elevated inflation data and remain
confident that our loss ratio assumptions are sufficient against this backdrop in 2021. At
the same time, we are considering pricing actions as we gauge inflation trends going
forward.
Finally, our investment portfolio is well-diversified and positioned for the evolving
macroeconomic environment. As we entered the second half of '21, while watching
developments with COVID-19 inflation, I am very confident that the Hartford franchise has
never been better positioned to continue to generate industry-leading returns and
enhance value for all our stakeholders.
Let me now make some high-level comments about the results within the business. In
Property and Casually, improved results were driven by higher investment income and a
very strong contribution from Commercial Lines with double-digit top line growth,
underlying margin expansion and reduce COVID impact.
For nearly 40 years, we have been a leader in the small commercial market and have
consistently generated highly profitable margins. Results continue to be exceptional. Our

FINAL

differentiated products in digital capabilities are driving a superior customer experience,
which contributes a higher written premium levels as we capture more profitable market
share. For the second consecutive quarter, our next-gen Spectrum, new sales reached
record levels.
In middle and large commercial, our team has done a tremendous job improving margins,
while growing the top line as demonstrated by new sales and written premium levels. As
the country invest in new infrastructure over the next decade, our specialized verticals are
well-positioned as they go-to-market for risk products and services.
In global specialty, we are growing and targeted lines that provide very attractive riskadjusted returns. Cross-selling within the Hartford's retail distribution has been very
successful in the feedback from our distribution partners has been exceptional regarding
product breadth and teamwork. As Doug will discuss further, we expect to exceed our
cross-sell targets a year ahead of plans.
I am extremely pleased with what the team has accomplished in a short period of time,
since the strategic transaction of Navigators closed. The timing was ideal given the growth
in this market segment and the robust pricing environment.

Bloomberg Transcript

Just two years ago, this business was generating combined ratios above a 110%. We
thoughtfully developed a plan to improve the financial performance, and the results are
self-evident, and we believe there is more improvement to come. We have nearly $2.5
billion of annual premium and global specialty, and I am very optimistic about the future as
we realized the full potential of the products and capabilities of this business.
Across Commercial Lines, our technology investments have improved the speed and
effectiveness of the underwriting process. We continue to further leverage data and
analytics to make more informed underwriting decisions, and respond to the needs of our
distribution partners and our customers. Overall, our Commercial Lines' businesses are
well-positioned to compete and win in the marketplace.
Turning to Personal Lines, we are the fifth largest direct writer of personal auto through
our partnership with AARP, one of the largest affinity groups in America. Over the next
decade, this mature market demographic is estimated to grow 3x as fast as the rest of
the U.S. population.
To capitalize on this growing segment, we are modernizing our products in both home
and auto, and further enhancing our already strong digital capabilities. This transformation
(Technical Difficulties)
Turning to group benefits. I would like to briefly comment on the bankruptcy of the Boy
Scouts. Earlier this month, the Boy Scouts filed an amended plan which included a request
to be released from its settlement agreement with the Hartford. We are vigorously
contesting this request and have filed strong opposition with the bankruptcy court. That
said, we consistent with our policy regarding active litigation, I am not going to comment
further on this matter.

FINAL

Turning to group benefits, we posted solid results for the quarter driven by excellent
investment returns as well as continued favorable group's disability trends sponsored by
elevated excess mortality.
Higher year-over-year earned premiums, excluding by ops reflect expanding payrolls as
well as new sales and strong persistency. The group life industry has been impacted by
excess mortality over the past five quarters. During the second quarter, our excess
mortality losses have dropped significantly versus the first quarter. U.S. COVID-19 deaths
have declined rapidly since peaking in January, but continue to drive elevated mortality in
our book, a business and in across the industry.
Consistent with U.S. trends, the average age of our COVID-19 life claimant has decreased.
Since younger age cohorts tend to carry higher face amounts, the average claim severity
has increased relative to earlier periods in the pandemic. We are optimistic about the
efficacy of vaccines. However, we are closely monitoring variant strains and the slowing
rate of vaccinations, particularly among the younger age cohorts. That said, we do expect
lower excess mortality in the second half of '21, compared to the first half of this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are a top three carrier in the group benefits industry with strong market share, a
diverse product portfolio and capabilities across customer segments from small business
to national accounts. We continue to invest in our technology platform to extend our
service offerings, including digital access for employers and employees to improve the
overall customer experience.
The workplace remains an important access point for many people to obtain desired
protection products, and we see that relationship growing stronger in the years ahead. In
addition, the pandemic created new focus on the products and services we provide. We
are confident that our innovative mindset positions us well to maintain our competitive
advantages and grow in group benefits.
To conclude, we are executing with confidence and precision, our top line is benefiting
from strong macroeconomic tailwinds, margins are expanding with the positive renewal
rate environment, and excess mortality losses are expected to decline. With enhanced on
underwriting capabilities, broad product offerings, and strong distribution partnerships, we
are positioned to grow and capture more profitable market share.
Last quarter we shared our target of a core earnings ROE of 13% to 14% in 2022 and into
2023, driven by top line growth across the businesses, margin improvement, but strong
owned[ph] pricing trends in excess of loss cost, operating efficiencies and proactive and
prudent capital management. I am optimistic and confident we will continue to deliver on
our financial objectives and enhance value for all stakeholders.
Now, I'll turn it over to Beth.

FINAL

Thank you, Chris. Overall, we are very pleased with the results for the quarter and our
progress on our priorities to enhance value creation for shareholders. Second core
earnings were $836 million or $2.33 per diluted share, and up 91% from last year. We had
strong performance across all our businesses, excellent investment results and
significantly lower COVID losses as compared to the prior year period.
In P&C, the combined ratio of 88.5% improved 8.4 points from the second quarter of
2020, including improvements in both the loss and expense ratios. The expense ratio in
the quarter improved by 220 basis points to 31%, reflecting earned premium growth as
well as cost savings from Hartford Next, and a lower provision for doubtful accounts.
In Commercial Lines, we produced an excellent underlying combined ratio of 89.4%, which
included ex COVID loss ratio improvement in middle and large commercial and in global
specialty, and expense ratio improvement across all businesses. Result in Commercial
Lines also improved year-over-year due to lower direct COVID losses of $3 million,
compared to $213 million or 9.9 points in second quarter 2020.

Bloomberg Transcript

Written premium was up 15% with growth in all lines of business including the effect of
higher audit and endorsement premiums reflecting the economic rebound. Personal Lines
generated an underwriting gain of $96 million, and an underlying combined ratio was
88.2%. Results were down from second quarter 2020, as last year benefited from
significantly lower auto frequency due to the pandemic.
Across Property and Casualty, catastrophes were a $128 million in the quarter, a $120
million lower than second quarter 2020, which included a $110 million for civil unrest. P&C
prior accident year reserve development within quarter earnings was a net favorable $188
million, including an $82 million reduction in catastrophe reserve as well as decreases in
workers' compensation, personal auto liability, package business and bond. This
compared to $322 million of net favorable reserve development in second quarter 2020,
which included a $400 million decrease in catastrophe reserves including the subrogation
benefit from PG&E.
In second quarter of 2021, we seeded an additional $39 million of unfavorable Navigators
reserve development to the adverse development cover primarily related to U.S. financial
lines. Although, these losses are economically seeded, the reserve development resulted
in a deferred gain representing a charge against net income in the quarter.
Group benefits core earnings were a $149 million, up 46% over prior year. Earnings for the
quarter reflect strong investment results, the lessening effect of excess mortality related
to COVID-19 and an increase in fully insured ongoing premium as our customers emerge
from the pandemic.
Sales were nearly $100 million in the quarter, and we experienced a continuation of strong
persistency at 91.1%. All cause excess mortality in the quarter was $25 million, which
includes $88 million for second quarter death dates, offset by $63 million a favorable
development for prior period excess mortality estimates predominantly related to the
first quarter.

FINAL

Through the first six months of the year, our results include excess mortality of $210
million. As Chris mentioned, although, we were encouraged by the trend of declining
excess mortality from first quarter to second quarter, we continue to watch a variety of
factors, including vaccination rates and the impact of variance. While uncertainty remains,
we would expect excess mortality trends in the second half of 2021 to improve
significantly.
Disability loss terms for the quarter remain favorable, though up slightly from the prior
year quarter. The disability loss ratio for the quarter was 64.2%, up 1.6 points as the prior
year benefited from favorable short-term disability claim frequency due to the deferral of
elective medical procedures at the beginning of the pandemic. Long-term disability claim
incidence was favorable to prior year, and claim recoveries, although down from the prior
year remain strong.

At Hereford Funds, core earnings for the quarter were $51 million, compared with $33
million for the prior year period, reflecting the impact of daily average increasing 36%.
Mutual fund net flows were very strong at $2.4 billion of net inflows for the quarter. The
corporate core loss was higher at $52 million in second quarter 2021, compared to a loss
of $6 million in the prior year quarter, due to income from our investment in Talcott in the
second quarter of 2020 of $68 million before tax.
On June 30th, 2021, we received $217 million from the sale of our ownership interest in
Talcott, resulting in a realized capital gain of $46 million before tax in the quarter. As a
reminder, within core earnings of corporate category primarily includes interest expense
on debt and investment management fees and expenses related to managing third-party
business including management of the invested assets of Talcott.
Turning to investments. Net investment income was $581 million for the quarter, up 71%
from the prior year quarter benefiting from very strong annualized limited partnership
returns of 33%, driven by higher valuations and sales of underlying investments within
private equity funds. The total annualized portfolio yield excluding limited partnerships
was 3.1% before tax, compared to 3.4% in the second quarter of 2020.
The portfolio credit quality remains strong with no credit losses on fixed maturities in the
quarter and $10 million gain from the partial reduction of the valuation allowance for credit
losses on mortgage loans due to improved economic scenarios.
Net unrealized gains on fix maturities before tax were $2.8 million at June 30th, up from
$2.3 billion at March 31st, due to lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads. Improving
operating efficiencies and a lower expense ratio from Hartford Next have been a
contributor to margin expansion. The program delivered a $195 million in pretax expense
savings in the six months ended June 30th, 2021, compared to the six month period in
2019. We continue to expect full-year pretax savings of approximately $540 million in
2022, and $625 million in 2023. Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI rose 8%
since June 30th, 2020 to $49.01, and our trailing 12 month core earnings ROE was 13.1%.

FINAL

During the quarter, the Hartford returned $694 million to shareholders, including $558
million of share repurchases and $126 million in common dividends paid. For the six month
period, we returned $933 million, with $691 million of share repurchases and $242 million
in common dividends paid.
From July 1st to July 27th, we repurchased 1.9 million shares for a $160 million. The remains
$1.7 billion available under our $2.5 billion authorization through 2022. Resources of holding
company as of June 30th, included a totaled of $1.7 billion in cash and investments.
During the quarter, we received $337 million in dividends from subsidiaries, and expect
approximately $725 million to $900 million over the second half of 2021. All in all, we had
very strong results for second quarter which puts us well on our way to achieving the
financial goals we shared with you in April.
I will now turn the call over to Doug.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Beth, and good morning, everyone. Six months into the year, I couldn't be
prouder of our performance. Within Property and Casually were meeting or exceeding
expectations on nearly all our key financial metrics.
In the second quarter, Property and Casualty producing outstanding underlying combined
ratio of 89.2%, premium growth accelerated and commercial pricing remain (Technical
Difficulties) yield on bindable businesses particularly strong and the efficiency leverage is
equally important. The sophistication of our proprietary pricing model gives us confidence
in the quality of our bindable business and is reflected in small commercials underlying
profitability.
Middle and large commercial accelerated into the second quarter producing superior
written premium growth of 20%. Middle Market new business of a $147 million, up 48%
was at its highest level in two years. I'm particularly pleased we achieved this result, while
maintaining underwriting discipline as measured by our pricing metrics and risk scores.
Policy retention in Middle Market increased 4 points to 82%, while maintaining disciplined
risk by risk underwriting decisions using our increasingly refined segmentation tools. Like
small commercial, increased payroll and rising wages contributed to the second quarter
middle and large commercial written premium growth of 20%.
Global Specialty produced another strong quarter with written premium growth of 16%.
New business growth of 27% was equally impressive and retention is up significantly from
prior year. In the quarter, the breadth of our written premium growth was led by 25% in
wholesale, and 18% in U.S. financial lines. Global reinsurance also had an excellent quarter
with written premium growth of 26%.

FINAL

As I've mentioned previously, cross-sell activities are an important component of our
growth strategy. During the quarter, cross-sell new business premium between Global
Specialty and Middle Market was $28 million or 11% of related new business sold by these
segments. Since the Navigators acquisition, this effort has delivered $185 million in new
business and is on pace to eclipse our initial goal of $200 million a year early.
We now have close to 2,500 accounts with policies that record premium in both Middle
Market and Global Specialty. We're also particularly encouraged by the success of our
industry specialization strategy, built both organically and through the Navigators
acquisition. For example, the acquired retail excess and U.S. financial lines are significant
contributors to our cross-sell execution. The combined new business growth from these
two lines has increased more than 50% since the acquisition. After years of development,
we view our product breath as a competitive strength.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's move onto pricing metrics. U.S. standard lines and Global Specialty commercial
pricing, excluding workers' compensation was 9.2% in the quarter. Middle Market ex
workers' compensation -- of 8.2, although down 1.1 points continue to -- loss cross trend
and reflect improved profitability performance. In workers' compensation, renewal pricing
was 1% in the quarter. A key indicator of future pricing, including the impact of the 2020
pandemic trends on 2022 (Inaudible) filings. We will be closely monitoring these filing in
the coming months on (Inaudible) database. Global Specialty renewal written price
remained strong and the U.S. at 11% and international at 24%. All in, I'm very pleased with
our pricing this quarter.
Turning to commercial loss trends. The second quarter current accident loss ratio was
largely in line with expectations. We are intensely watching inflation, and have been
particularly dialed into recent building repair costs and rising wage trends. Within large
commercial property, small commercial recorded a few large fire losses in the quarter.
And in Global Specialty international, we incurred a large offshore energy loss, both were
within a normal range of expected volatility.
Overall, Middle Market property loss ratios were slightly favorable to expectations in the
quarter. Favorable claim frequency was partially offset by an increase in severity related to
labor and material costs. While we believe property severity trends may be slightly
elevated for the rest of the year, we remain confident in our initial full-year Middle Market
property loss ratio expectation.
Shifting to workers' compensation, the economic recovery is driving wage growth for our
worker population. This wage growth translate -- translates into higher premiums and
wage replacement benefits. Generally speaking, the net impact is a minor improvement in
the workers' compensation loss ratio.
Combining earned pricing and lost trends, I'm pleased with the continued strong current
accident year performance. In the quarter, the Commercial Lines underlying ex-COVID
loss ratio was 57%, 1.3 points better than Q2 of last year.

FINAL

Let's now turn to Personal Lines. As expected, the second quarter underlying combined
ratio grew 7.5 points to 88.2%. Auto frequency is elevating with increasing vehicle trips and
miles traveled, but our book is still favorable to pre-pandemic levels.
As expected, home losses were higher versus a very strong prior year. Overall, we have
favorable claims frequency in the quarter which is offset by higher claim severity, driven by
modestly higher than expected large ex-CAT fire losses and a provision for elevated
building material and labor costs.
Written premium declined 5% after adjusting for both the second quarter 2020 extended
billing grace period and the $81 million refund. According to JV power auto shopping rates
amongst the 50 plus 8 segments are down approximately 5% from third quarter 2020,
when they first initiated the survey. Persistency of the shopping trend may contain a
pressure new business growth for our customer base. However, increased marketing
spend in the quarter drove June new business premium above expectations and policy
retention was up 1 point as compared to prior year.

Bloomberg Transcript

We're also encouraged by the early results from the launch of our new contemporary
Personal Lines auto and home product Prevail. Through the second quarter, yieldm
average issued premium and policy counts all met our exceeded expectations. Both
products are now available in Arizona and Illinois. Seven additional states along with
advanced capabilities will be online by year-end, and we've remain confident in our longterm growth plan for Personal Lines.
Before turning the call back to Susan for questions-and-answers, let me conclude.
Property and Casualty achieved another outstanding quarter. Our top line out performed
providing confidence, we will achieve our Commercial Lines 4% to 5% multiyear CAGR
guidance. Strong pricing is earning into the book driving lower current accident loss ratios
and the expense ratio continues to benefit from our ongoing Hartford Next initiatives. We
are seeing the positive results of our multiyear roadmap with deeper and broader
products, improved risk selection and outstanding execution. I'm thrilled with our
continued progress and look forward to updating you in 90 days.
Let me now turn the call back over to Susan.

Thank you, Susan. Our first question comes from Greg Peters from Raymond James.
Greg, your line will be open now, if you would like to ask your question.

Q - Gregory Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

FINAL

Can everyone hear me?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yes, we can, Greg. Welcome. Greg. Can you hear us?

Q - Gregory Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Yeah, I can hear you. Sorry about that. I don't know what was going on. Good morning. The
first question is the outlook for growth in commercial lines. You provided a lot of detail
around pricing and retention and the new business successes you've had and the
different areas in commercial lines. But Chris, I think in your comments, you said growth -you said moderation is expected. So, I guess I'm trying to reconcile, what was a really
strong second quarter and a positive outlook with those comments.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah. I think the context of that Greg was in relation to GDP. So, I was speaking that GDP is
running, what, 8%, 9%, probably 9% here and that I do expect some moderation and I'll
call it the macro numbers. But as Doug said in his comments, and I'll let him also comment
here is that we're still very bullish on our ability to grow in that 4% to 5% compounded
written premium growth over the outlook period through 2022. So, we're not backing off
from that and in fact, we're probably even a little bit more bullish as we sit here today
than we were 90 days ago. But Doug, what would you add?

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

I would just add, Greg that when you look at small and I'll do small and middle separate,
we had nice PYD[ph] growth in the small segments, so 2.5 to 3 3 points of PYD growth
quarter-to-quarter, we've been on a positive pricing trend for a couple of months. What
we had the benefit of in the quarters a little extra win behind us relative to auto premium.
So, that's driving inside the 11 several extra points are boost, but I don't want to -- I don't
want to minimize that all the (inaudible) and the pricing movement and the new business
success we're seeing in small.
And then on the middle front, probably have a little bit more boost from auto premium.
So, the 20 is a bit outsize relative to longer-term expectations, but still terrific new
business quarter, pricing is strong, we expect pricing trends to remain solid and strong.
And so, I'm bullish about where we're headed going forward, I just would point out that
we had a -- compared to second quarter 2020 that probably won't repeat itself in Q3 and
Q4.

FINAL

That makes sense. I guess my follow-up question would be in the personal lines business.
Obviously, inflation is high on everyone's list. The courts are opening -- reopening, there's
cost pressure and then there's the added pressure from increasing miles frequency. And I
was just wondering if you can comment in the context of your second quarter results?
What are you seeing a sequential deterioration in some of these buckets as you move
through the quarter so that when we get to the third quarter, we might see some
continual erosion as a result of some of the factors I mentioned?

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

So, specifically to personalize what I've shared in my comments and I can elaborate a little
bit more here is that our auto book is seeing increased miles driven but not yet at preCOVID, pre-pandemic levels, right? So, we're still slightly better than we were in 2019. As
we look through the COVID period, we are conscious of repair costs, we're conscious of
all of the dynamics that go into our cost of goods sold, and we think we've made
appropriate provisions in our recording of reserves for second quarter. But yes, we are
watching that intensely relative to inflation pressures.

Bloomberg Transcript

Relative to homeowners, I gave a comment that we also made applicable provisions for
labor and material costs. We saw some of those spike earlier in the year, particularly in the
early part of the second quarter into the mid-second quarter. As we listen to inflationary
expectations, we expect some of those trends will be with us into the third quarter, fourth
quarter. But I think that given our trends, our expectations here haven't changed materially
and we're on top of our selections. And I think we're in good shape as we move into Q3.

Q - Gregory Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

This is a follow-up on that, Doug. When we talk about homeowners a lot of the premium
levels are set off of replacement cost. Is this --did the inflationary pressures are causing
you to go back and reset what the replacement costs are for your existing in-force or
maybe you can walk me through how you approach that?

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Yes, we have an estimator that deals with replacement costs. And we now, on a state-bystate basis, are going back resetting that, filling that into our pricing going forward. So, the
book does work 60, 90 days in advance but we have been working on those discussions
since earlier part of the summer and these spikes are not going to go away. So, yes, we
are moving insured to value adjustments across our homeowners' basic policies.

Q - Gregory Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Got it. Thank you for the answers.

FINAL

Hi, good morning. I just had a question for Doug on the commercial lines, underlying loss
ratio ex-CAT. Solid improvement in the quarter, the 1.3 points kind of slowed a bit versus
the level of improvement we saw last quarter, which was over two points. I guess, could
you sort of walk through why -- obviously, still impressive margin improvement, but why it
decelerated? And how you're feeling about reaching the 2 points of underlying loss ratio
improvement target for 2021?

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Yeah. So, it's a consistent favorable direction moves on loss ratio. I did mention a couple
of areas where we had volatility and property. So, if you think about small commercial and

Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up question on personal lines.
So, good to see some of the initiatives here. I'm just kind of looking at the PYD growth
and I don't think we've seen PYD growth in the last five or six years. I guess I'm wondering
if you can share with us some milestones you have for growth and things that we can
track? And maybe how you're thinking about potential alternatives for that business if
some of the growth initiatives don't translate to higher growth?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Yeah. So, why don't I start and then Chris and Beth however you want to come over the
top. I'll start by saying that we had concluded several years back that we had to go
through a major upgrade of our contemporary product, right. So, that is now just dropping
it to marketplace. The early signs are positive as expected. The reason we move with two
states is we wanted to test the ability to states before we drop the next run. So, in terms
of major milestones by year-end and additional seven states as I talked about. And then
by the end of '22, we'll be in all-state. So, pretty aggressive next 15 months rollout
program.
We will watch state-by-state to make corrections as we go forward. But we're very excited
about the components. We have basically rebuilt every bit of this chassis from the product
to the way it's delivered to the digital capabilities to be serviced. We think we've listened
hard to our customers, which primarily are in that plus 50 sets. They have helped us
design that. Again, the early reaction and results are positive. So, long way to go, but we
think this leads us to attract profitable growth. We've shared those expectations and I sit
here today and don't feel any different about a long-term path. Beth or Chris?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah. I think you summarized it well. David, I think strategically, we're giving ourselves at
least a couple of years after we're fully rolled out in all 50 states to really make an
assessment. Can we compete with our differentiated product offerings? Our hypothesis
going in is yes. We have a strong brand in personal lines, we have a wonderful

endorsement from AARP, we have unique features, and how we service those market
segment. It's a demographic that's growing. As I said in my commentary, we have a new
10-year contract with AARP that really modernizes the whole relationship and how we go
to market. So, I think it's an investment work we're making. Obviously, that's why we did
what we did, but I think the -- post '22 when we're really more proactive, Doug, in all 50
states would be the ultimate time period to watch our PYD count start to grow.

Our next question comes from Gary Ransom from Dowling & Partners. Gary, your line will
be open now if you'd like to proceed with your question.

Q - Gary Ransom

{BIO 3446828 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. Regarding the gap between rate and loss trend, I wanted to ask not
so much about the size of the gap, but where we are in the cycle of that gap? And looking
at small middle specialty separately, how many years do you think we're into the period
where rates has been ahead of loss trend? I realize it might be a better answer.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Good morning, Gary. I actually do think about the answer by segment. And I think that
small commercial pricing curve is very different, at least it is different in our book of
business. We've had an extended period of outstanding return. So the rate need has not
been as clear there. We basically have been rate adequate for an extended period. We
want to stay upward trend but we're in a much more moderated cycle and small.
The other side of the coin will be to flip into some of these specialty areas that have had
significant rate need. And I would call that we're entering to May Q9 Q10 of that, this really
started picking up pace in the second quarter of 2019. And it had some positivity before
that, but really 8 very strong quarters from my opinion and areas that drastically needed
that and we've talked quite at length about some of those drivers of that.
And then in the middle are middle-market where you have the cross-section of auto GL
property. Each of those lines has a real story. We've had, as an industry, very disappointing
property results over an extended period, and weather has been a part of it. And so in
our other dynamics, we've had a commercial auto loss ratio in the industry that has been
very stubborn.
So, those lines also have been on seven, eight quarters of positive rate movement. I think
there's still more work to be done in that middle-market area. And I don't think that's a
hate comment. I think that's a market comment. I can only see what I can see. But -- so, I'll
answer your question in three ways. I still think this market has some legs. And as we look
at our book, yes, we are much more rate adequate in general across segments of our

Page 13 of 18

book, but we also have smaller segments that need some work and we intend to get
after that work as we move through the latter half of 2021.

FINAL

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Gary, you of all people know given your views and writings, the impacted prickling casualty
lines of social inflation is real. So, as we've talked internally, we need to continue to push
for more rate, just knowing that the long-term trends have not been in our favor whether
it be in courts or whether it be in financial lines, whether it be in other casualty related
exposures. And then you can't forget the (Technical Difficulty) 10-years at one point
(Technical Difficulty)

Q - Gary Ransom

{BIO 3446828 <GO>}

(Technical Difficulty) Ask a question on a different topic in group, where you showed the
excess mortality. And if I put back the -- the excess mortality that you said developed from
Q1, I can revise the trend to about $125 million roughly in Q1 as access excess going to $88
in Q2. And I look at the CDC data, it looks like it's just falling off a lot more than that. And
maybe that's apples, not apples and apples. But can you comment about what's going on
there? Your decline -- you're not really seeing that as much decline there?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah. In the dollars, I would say you're right. I mean if you look at it from dollars, but if you
are tracking that, which I know you are like we are, I mean the drop is significant. It's -from its peak, I calculated down close to seeing 75%. What I said in my commentary, Gary,
is at severity is up. So, if you look at the number of death claims, the average amounts
that we're paying, it's up from the beginning of the pandemic fairly significantly and it's up
from the second quarter.
I would say we probably had 8 or 9 large losses above $1 million this quarter when
anyone, -- excuse me, we probably had more than that was just in June, so we probably
had 15 or 20 large losses, when you really expect for a month to put it all together, and
when the younger folks mortalities increased significantly, working-age, they tend to
(Technical Difficulty) feel a lessening impact of excess mortality in the second half of the
year.

A - Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

The only thing I'd add to that to, Gary, if you're looking at COVID deaths, just remind you
that when we talk about excess mortality, it's all in excess, it's not just deaths that have a
cause of debt that says COVID. And so when we look through our numbers, part of the
reason for the -- large part of the revision for first quarter is that excess non-COVID came
in much more favorably than we had anticipated.
Our COVID losses came in a little bit better as well, but that was driving the revision. And
when we provided our provision for second quarter, we're assuming some of that excess
mortality that we anticipated in first quarter would be there. So, when you look through it,
the COVID losses that are truly COVID as COVID are coming down, it's that excess piece,
which as you know has been hard to predict, so it's not just for us.

That's a great point, Beth. Thank you for the clarification. The theory could be, Gary, that
we just had less flu deaths than we know seasonally sort of expected in the numbers, but
clearly, there was a first quarter benefit for all other excess mortality outside of COVID.

Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse, your line will be

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning. My first question, I want to go back, Chris, to some of your
opening comments. You mentioned recent elevated inflation data, but that you also got
your loss ratio assumptions were sufficient against this, but then you guys did mention
considering taking pricing action. So, if you're considering taking pricing actions, wouldn't
that imply that inflation might be running higher than you expected? And I know we
touched on this a little bit during the call (Technical Difficulty) in terms of impacting your
profitability.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yes. (Technical Difficulty) issue in terms of value replacement what it will cost to repair
facilities, buildings, etc. with what we're feeling through the cost of goods sold.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

(Technical Difficulty) Everything is still in line with your expectations?

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

As we think it's been well-chronicled auto (Technical Difficulty) we've had better frequency
patterns that has -- have offset some of these severity dynamics. But we are very tuned in
to what the inflation curve is going to look like on labor and material for all of our lines and
think we're in a good spot, but we're -- can't sit here today, and say we know exactly how
the fourth quarter will drop here. It's going to take us several quarters to figure that out as
data comes in.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. And then my second question. You guys are running ahead of pace relative
to the buyback plan you outlined for this year and some of the dividend figures you've
provided from the subspace I think are a little bit higher than you had expected. So, is
there a chance you could come in above the one size for this year, just depending upon
what your stock is, if you guys look to take advantage could more the buyback program
potentially be front-loaded?

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah, I'm glad you noticed that, Elyse. We have been as I said, in my comments, proactive
and prudent in managing our capital. So, a lot of things are possible, but we're basically six
months into our two-year buyback program. I still think buying back $2.5 billion is, again,
the right action to manage our excess capital. And from any one quarter or any one
period of time, there could be acceleration or deceleration depending on what we're
seeing happening in the marketplace. But Beth, what would you say?

A - Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Yes. I think you characterized that well, I think on the dividends on, Elyse. The range we
tightened primarily as it relates to P&C, so we had said that we expected $900 million to
$1 billion -- $1.1 billion and now we're at a $1 billion to $1.1 billion, so trending on the high
side. But that's not a significant change there. And I think we're on a good pace we had
said when we announced the increase in the program in April that we weren't intending to
do it radically over the period and I think that the actions we've taken have shown that, so
that's all I would add.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Our next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Brian, your line will be open if
you'd like to pursue your question now.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. Couple of them here. First, just want to get a little bit on workers comp,
Chris and Doug. Doug, I know you've mentioned that you're looking at a loss cost filing
here for 2022, and kind of as a key determinant to what pricing look out for workers
comp. Any early indications what those are going to look like? (inaudible) saying with
respect to that what can we expect potentially here for workers comp pricing going
forward?

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Brian, it is extremely early, but the next 30 days we jump into that season. So, I think,
maybe one, maybe two states have hit in the last couple of days, but I don't have them
pulled apart yet. But I do know over the next 30 to 60 days, most of the states will drop.
And how these 2020 year has treated from a COVID perspective both frequency and
then, we've been quite transparent with our workers' comp selections around COVID. The
same is not true for all of our competitors. So, I don't have a great lens into everybody's
reporting actions, but we'll learn more through the MCCI data. And as you know, I think
they handle the bureau lost cost for 47 states. So that is a very big component of this
country's workers comp system.

Great, thanks. And then the second question, I'm just curious, so some good growth in
small commercial. I mean, one of the things that people talk about is that as the economy
reopens, it's really more beneficial over the E&S markets, because new business
formation typically doesn't fall on the standard commercial lines market. Is that a true
statement? Or are we kind of think about things a little bit different way, where you could
really see some nice big growth in new businesses as we continue to see economic
growth?

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Well, economic growth is a good thing for our business. And I would say, that is probably
partially true. I think it's true by sector. So, our pricing algorithms and our underwriting
decision points do look at geography, they look at class, they look at sectors of class. So,
there are new business startups that we're interested in writing[ph] on a retail basis. And
then I would also say there are probably sectors of small commercial that better fit E&S. I
think that it will be a good thing for our economic engine and I'm glad you raised the point
because we saw some of that in the second quarter, which is why we adjusted our auto
premium going forward, but I don't feel like the real labor unlock has occurred yet and I
think that will provide a further spring in the second half of the year.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

But Doug, you would also say that historically in small commercial, we do have E&S
offerings that we provide and that obviously navigators is going to help us expand the
product sets and the class of business that our two business leaders can -- you can
partner on. So, that's been part of the designs just capture more of small business needs
whether it be standard or the U.S. market.

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Absolutely. It's been a growing capability both obviously, in our wholesale sector and
global specialty, but also our small commercial business has a core strategy around
working with wholesalers in that E&S space. I would also add, Brian, to your question,
leadership and the people that run these businesses, so not all new startups are with firsttime managers, right? Some of these new startups are where the experienced managers
that we've known, we've ensured another places, so, the startup number can be a little
misleading. And in general, we look at economic formation as a positive for our business.
