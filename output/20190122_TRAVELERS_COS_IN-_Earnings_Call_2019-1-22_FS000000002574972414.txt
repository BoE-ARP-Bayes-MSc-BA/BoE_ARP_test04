webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on
our website at travelers.com, under the Investors section.
Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, CFO; and our three
segment presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Tom Kunkel, of Bond &
Specialty Insurance who is joining us remotely this morning; and Michael Klein of Personal
Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market
environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared
remarks, and then we will take questions.
Before I turn the call over to Alan, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory
note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking
statements, including as it relates to our discussion of our outlook. The company cautions
investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a
guarantee of future performance.
Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forwardlooking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under
Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings press release and our most recent 10-Q and
10-Ks filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking
statements.

Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP
financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release,
financial supplement, and other materials available in the Investors section on our website.
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.

Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Thank you, Abbe. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we look
back on 2018, we're pleased that we improved returns, grew our business and delivered
strong underlying underwriting profitability and investment results, while returning
significant excess capital to shareholders and taking great care of our customers. Our
results benefited from ongoing strategic initiatives geared toward creating top line
opportunities and improving productivity and efficiency. Of course, our results were also
impacted by a high level of catastrophe losses.
Fourth quarter net income of $621 million or $2.32 per diluted share generated a return on
equity of 10.9%. Core income was $571 million or $2.13 per diluted share, and core return
on equity was 10%. Net and core income were both impacted by almost $500 million of
after-tax cat losses. Our full year core income increased by 19% to $2.4 billion, generating
core return on equity of 10.7%. The fact that we were able to generate this level of profit
and profitability with $1.4 billion in after-tax cat losses speaks to the earnings power of our
franchise.

FINAL

Our consolidated underlying combined ratio for the fourth quarter improved to 91.1%, the
lowest level since the first quarter of 2016, even after the impact on the quarter of a full
year's worth of higher loss estimates in the commercial auto line, driven by bodily injury
severity. Commercial auto has been a challenge for the industry and for us for some time
and our most recent data reflects further deterioration. Greg will address in more detail
what we've seen and how we're responding.
For the full year, our record earned premium of more than $27 billion and productivity and
efficiency initiatives contributed to an after-tax underlying underwriting gain of $1.5 billion,
the highest in more than a decade. Our successful and consistent investment strategy
also contributed to our results.
After-tax net investment income was up 15% for the quarter and 12% for the year. The
underwriting gain in investment income also reflect the benefit of tax reform. These
results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book value
per share by 5% during the year after returning more than $2.1 billion of excess capital to
shareholders, consistent with our longstanding capital management strategy.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to production, we remain very pleased with our performance in the market with
each of our business segments contributing to a 4% increase in net written premium for
the quarter. For the year, we grew net written premiums by 6% to a record $27.7 billion.
Net written premiums in Business Insurance in the quarter increased by nearly $100 million
or 3%, driven by historically high retention and positive renewal premium change. In our
Middle Market business, retention reached a record fourth quarter high of 88%.
We completed the roll-out of our business centers in our Commercial Accounts business
during the year. All eligible renewals in new business are now flowing through these
centers, freeing up our local underwriters to spend more time with our agent and broker
partners. For the year, Commercial Accounts delivered its highest level of new business in
more than a decade.
Renewal premium change in Business Insurance, including pure rate and exposure, was
nearly 5% in the quarter, up over 0.5 point compared to the same period last year and
steady throughout 2018. We achieved positive renewal premium change in all lines. In our
Bond & Specialty business, net written premiums increased by 8% for the quarter, with
continued strong production in both our Management Liability and Surety businesses. In
domestic Management Liability, we achieved record retention and new business for the
full year.
In Personal Insurance, net written premium growth in the quarter was strong at 5% with
both our Agency Auto and Homeowner businesses contributing. Two years ago in 2016,
we had a $4 billion book of Agency Auto business with some profitability challenges.
Today it's a $5 billion business that meets our return expectations, thanks to impressive
execution by the team and an improved environment we got there ahead of schedule.
You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Tom and Michael about our segment results.

Date: 2019-01-22

To wrap it up, despite another year of elevated catastrophe losses, we achieved an 11%
return on equity. That speaks to excellent underwriting execution and management of risk
and reward across a diverse portfolio of businesses, our successful investment strategy
and our active approach to capital management. It also speaks to the dedication and
commitment of our 30,000 employees. With a talented team, competitive advantages
that set us apart and an ambitious innovation agenda along with a very high respect for
our shareholders' capital, we remain very well positioned to continue to deliver leading
results and meaningful shareholder value over time.
And, with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.

Daniel S. Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Thank you, Alan. Core income for the fourth quarter was $571 million, down from $633
million in the prior year quarter and core ROE was 10%, down from 11.1%. The decrease in
both measures from last year's fourth quarter resulted primarily from a higher level of
catastrophe losses and a lower level of favorable prior year reserve development.

Bloomberg Transcript

Underlying results were strong as the consolidated underlying combined ratio of 91.1%,
which excludes the impacts of cats and PYD, improved by 1.3 points from the prior year
quarter. Recall that last year's fourth quarter underlying combined ratio was elevated by
about 0.5 point as a result of tax planning actions taken at that time. Our fourth quarter
results include $610 million of pre-tax cat losses, driven by $453 million from the California
wildfires in November and $158 million from Hurricane Michael in October.
Last year's fourth quarter cat losses of $499 million included favorable development of
$157 million primarily related to the hurricanes from the third quarter of 2017. PYD in the
current quarter, for which I'll provide more details shortly, was net favorable $167 million
pre-tax, down from $293 million in the prior year quarter.
Our pre-tax underlying underwriting gain of $578 million improved by 22% from $472
million in the prior year quarter, as increases in both Bond & Specialty and Personal
Insurance were partially offset by a decrease in Business Insurance, which Greg will
address in his comments. Pre-tax net investment income increased by 5% from the prior
year quarter to $630 million, as increases in fixed income were partially offset by lower
pre-tax returns in our non-fixed income portfolio compared to very strong performance in
the prior year quarter. Fixed income results benefited from the more favorable interest
rate environment and an increase in average invested assets resulting from continued
growth in net written premiums.
After-tax NII increased by 15% to $535 million, benefiting from the lower U.S. corporate
income tax rate. After-tax fixed income NII in the fourth quarter increased by $65 million
compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, and we expect that 2019 fixed income NII will
increase by approximately $20 million to $25 million per quarter compared to the
corresponding periods of 2018, as we project that both the average level of invested
assets and the average yield on the portfolio will be higher.

FINAL

All three segments experienced net favorable prior year reserve development in the
fourth quarter. In Personal Insurance, recent accident years performed better than
expected in the auto book. In Bond & Specialty, we experienced better-than-expected
loss development in the Management Liability book. In Business Insurance, net favorable
PYD of $48 million pre-tax was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in
domestic workers' comp, which was largely offset by unfavorable development in
commercial auto and, to a lesser extent, general liability.
Commercial auto unfavorable PYD in the quarter was $155 million pre-tax, resulting from
elevated severity in recent accident years. In general liability, where the returns remain
attractive, unfavorable PYD in the quarter reflected changes across several accident years
in business units. There is no broad theme, but the largest impact related to a small
number of claims from older years in our runoff book. For the full year, despite the
adverse changes in commercial auto and the third quarter asbestos charge, net favorable
prior year reserve development was $517 million pre-tax.

Bloomberg Transcript

When our combined 2018 Schedule P is filed early in the second quarter, we expect it to
show that excluding asbestos environmental, all accident years across all product lines in
the aggregate and all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate developed
favorably or had minor unfavorable development, except for commercial auto, and as a
result of the change in commercial auto accident year 2017.
Page 19 of the webcast provides information about our January 1 cat treaty renewal. Our
corporate cat aggregate XOL treaty renewed on terms, in line with the expiring treaty
and continues to provide coverage for both single cat events and the aggregation of
losses from multiple cat events. As you all know, the industry has experienced an elevated
level of catastrophe losses in recent years.
In response, we have updated our actuarial models to reflect the actual results of recent
years and to give more weight to recent years when determining our view of normal
expectations. As a result, we have recognized a somewhat higher level of expected
losses on our pricing and underwriting models.
In further recognition of recent weather activity and ongoing uncertainty, for 2019 we have
also added a new catastrophe aggregate XOL treaty, as described on slide 19. This treaty
addresses qualifying PCS-designated events in North America, for which we incur losses
of $5 million or more, providing aggregate coverage of $430 million, part of $500 million
of losses above an aggregate retention of $1.3 billion. Hurricane and earthquake events
have a $250 million per occurrence cap.
We believe this new treaty provides a reasonable level of protection and an appropriate
price. In terms of the accounting, there will be an impact on the underlying combined ratio
in 2019 due to the effect of ceded premiums on total net earned premiums. Since the
majority of any loss recoveries from this treaty will likely benefit our net catastrophe
losses, which are excluded from underlying results, we expect about a 0.5 point impact
on the full year underlying combined ratio, but a minimal impact on the full year total
combined ratio.

Page 5 of 23



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity

FINAL

Because the attachment point is $1.3 billion, we also expect that any recoveries would
likely be recorded in the second half of the year and, accordingly, the impact on the
combined ratio will likely be more pronounced in the early part of 2019. Of course, the
actual effect on our total combined ratio for 2019 will be impacted by the level of PCS
events we experience.
Turning to capital management, operating cash flows for the quarter of $948 million were
again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better-than-target levels and we ended
the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.4 billion. Interest rates
decreased modestly during the fourth quarter and, accordingly, our net unrealized
investment loss narrowed from $447 million after-tax as of September 30 to $113 million
after-tax at year-end.
Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses,
was $87.27 at year-end, 5% higher than at the beginning of the year. We returned $375
million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $170
million and dividends of $205 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

For the year, we returned more than $2.1 billion of capital to our shareholders through
dividends and share repurchases. Consistent with our capital management strategy, that
level of return capital takes into consideration a variety of factors. For example, the
increased level of capital in support of the nearly $2.8 billion of premium growth we have
generated over the last two years, the amount of earnings, and contributions to the
pension plan. And you'll recall that we made a $200 million contribution in September for
tax planning purposes.
And, with that, I'll turn the microphone over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.

Gregory C. Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Thanks, Dan. For the fourth quarter, Business Insurance produced $391 million of segment
income, down from $637 million in the prior year quarter, bringing the full year total to
$1.64 billion, a 2% increase over 2017. Earnings for both the quarter and the year included
the relatively high levels of catastrophe losses that Alan and Dan mentioned, as was the
case in 2017. Earnings for both the quarter and the year were positively impacted by
strong profitability in workers' comp, our biggest product line, as well as higher overall
business volumes that resulted from recent earned premium growth and increased
operating leverage that has reduced our expense ratio.
Earnings were negatively impacted by a fourth quarter after-tax charge of about $195
million or about $245 million on a pre-tax basis related to higher commercial auto bodily
injury loss activity. Of that amount, about $155 million pre-tax reduced net favorable prior
year reserve development. The remaining $90 million pre-tax represents the impact of
the 2018 accident year and incorporates re-estimations for the first three quarters of the
year.

FINAL

The corresponding combined ratio impacts were approximately 6.5 points on the
segment combined ratio for the quarter, and a little more than 1.5 points on the segment
combined ratio for the year. The impacts on the underlying combined ratio from the
adverse auto adjustments were approximately 2.5 points for the quarter and a little more
than 0.5 point for the full year.
As we've discussed with you, in recent years we've reacted to higher commercial auto
losses in different portions of our commercial auto book through various pricing,
underwriting and reserving actions. But during the recent quarter, data emerged that
changed our view of the overall loss environment broadly across our commercial auto
book. We saw more of an increase in the rate of attorney involvement than we had
anticipated and a lengthening in the claim development pattern.
As a consequence, we are experiencing a higher level of bodily injury severity than we
anticipated. Because we believe the factors we are experiencing are environmental, our
primary plan of action going forward will be to push for more rate. As we mentioned in
the past, the auto line is where we've been getting the most rate over the last couple of
years, but we need more of that.

Bloomberg Transcript

It is important to remember that auto is typically part of an account solution for our
Business Insurance customers. We generally provide them with some combination of
workers' comp, property, general liability and/or other coverages. Accordingly, we will use
our extensive data and the analytics capabilities on an account-by-account basis to
improve auto profitability as aligned and as part of the overall profitability of our product
portfolio.
Turning back to the segment results, the underlying combined ratio of 95.4% for the
quarter was 1.5 points higher than in the prior year. The loss ratio was about 3 points
higher than last year, driven by the 2.5 points from auto. The remaining 0.5 point is due to
higher non-weather loss activity in our international businesses with the largest contributor
to that coming from Lloyd's, partially offset by favorable variability in domestic loss activity.
The expense ratio for the quarter improved by 1.5 points, with about half of that
improvement coming from lower expense dollars and the other half coming from higher
premium volumes. As always, there are fluctuations in expenses from quarter to quarter,
so we point to you that the full year expense ratio is a better indication of our run rate. All
in for the year a 95.7% underlying combined ratio, which included large losses which ran
about a point over what we would have viewed as a more normal level.
Turning to top line and production, net written premium growth for the quarter was 3%,
bringing the full year total to $15 billion, almost $700 million or 5% higher than in 2017.
We're pleased with our continued progress with our strategic initiatives and we remain
encouraged with the feedback from our agent and broker partners that were focused on
the right priorities. In terms of domestic production, we achieved strong renewal premium
change of 4.8% in the quarter, with renewal rate change of 1.6%, while retention remained
high at 85%, a reflection of the quality of our book.

FINAL

New business of $488 million was up 3% from a year ago. We're pleased with these
production results and continue to operate at a granular level of executing in our
marketplace strategy to meet our return objectives with a thoughtful balance towards
retaining our best business, improving pricing where it's needed, and pursuing attractive
new business opportunities.
Turning to the individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change and renewal rate
picked up a bit, while retention remained strong at 82%. New business was up 11% over
the prior year quarter, as we continue to leverage our investments in technology and
workflow initiatives.
In Middle Market, renewal premium change was 4.5% with renewal rate change consisted
with last quarter at 1.5%, while retention remained historically high at 88%. As Alan said, a
record for the fourth quarter. New business premiums of $281 million were down a bit
from a strong level in the prior year quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

In our core Commercial Accounts business, where our business and our initiatives are now
fully rolled out, new business was up 17% for the quarter, while full year new business
premiums of $561 million were at the highest level in over a decade. In this business,
we're pleased that the business centers and our strategic investments are having the
intended impact. Submission and quote activity are both up from the prior year, creating
attractive top line opportunities. To sum up, we feel terrific about our execution in the
marketplace and confident about how we're positioned going forward.
Before I turn the call over to Tom to talk about Bond & Specialty results, I want to
comment on our outlook for RPC and the underlying combined ratio since we will not be
filing our 10-K for a few weeks. We expect RPC will remain positive in 2019 and at the
levels broadly consistent with 2018. We expect the underlying combined ratio for the full
year 2019 will be lower than in 2018, which assumes that large losses, primarily in the
property line, returned to lower and more normal levels. Underneath that full year outlook,
we expect the underlying combined ratio improvements to come in the second through
fourth quarters of the year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.

Thomas M. Kunkel

{BIO 16615934 <GO>}

Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty delivered another quarter of strong returns and growth.
Segment income of $220 million nearly doubled from the prior year quarter, due primarily
to higher underlying underwriting income and a higher level of net favorable prior year
development. The improvement in underlying income reflects the impact of a single
surety loss in the prior year quarter and higher business volumes. The underlying
combined ratio was an excellent 78.1%.
Net written premiums for the quarter were up 8%, driven by strong growth in our
Management Liability business and solid Surety production that was up slightly from the
very strong prior year quarter. In our domestic Management Liability business, our focus
Page 8 of 23



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2019-01-22

FINAL

continues to be on retaining our high-quality business and targeting rate where needed,
while pursuing attractive new business opportunities. So, we are pleased that retention
remained very strong at 89% for the quarter with a renewal premium change of 3.9
points.
New business of $53 million was up 8% from the prior year quarter. These results reflect
our extensive competitive advantages and solid marketplace execution. We are a leading
franchise in our specialty markets with long-term customer, agent and broker relationships
across a national footprint.
We've got exceptional talent and specialized industry expertise, extensive data and
advanced analytics. And while we have leading platforms and robust products, we
continue to invest in strategic product, marketing and technology capabilities that will
further extend our competitive advantages. So, Bond & Specialty results were excellent.
We continue to feel great about our growth, returns and the opportunities that our strong
market positions and competitive advantages present for the future.
In terms of our 2019 outlook as compared to 2018, we expect RPC for our domestic
Management Liability business to remain positive and broadly consistent and for the
segment, the underlying combined ratio to be broadly consistent. For Surety, we expect
2019 net written premium to be slightly higher than it was in 2018. Due to the inherent
lumpiness in Surety production, going forward we will no longer be including Surety net
written premium in our outlook disclosure.

Bloomberg Transcript

And now, I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance.

Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance for the quarter,
segment income was $32 million, an improvement of $82 million over the prior year
quarter, and our combined ratio of 102.6% improved 6.1 points. The lower combined ratio
was driven by improved auto results, lower catastrophes and higher net favorable prior
year reserve development.
For the full year, segment income of $297 million and the combined ratio of 100.6% are
also better than the prior year, driven by the same factors I referenced for the quarter.
Net written premium growth for the fourth quarter and full year was 5% and 7%,
respectively. Our premium growth helped us achieve a 30 basis point improvement in our
expense ratio for the full year.
Agency Automobile delivered another impressive quarter with a combined ratio of 95.3%,
down 7.7 points from the prior year quarter, driven primarily by a lower underlying
combined ratio. Underlying margins continued to improve due to earned pricing
exceeding loss trend and frequency remaining better than expected. These factors also
resulted in favorable full year loss adjustments in the quarter that further contributed to a
better loss ratio than we would have expected. The quarter also benefited from higher
net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by higher catastrophes.

FINAL

Recall that the prior year quarter included a benefit from the re-estimation of
catastrophes, including Hurricane Harvey. Our full year combined ratio for Agency
Automobile of 94.2% was 10 points better than the prior year and returns were well within
targets on both an overall and an underlying basis. In light of these improvements, we
continue to moderate renewal premium changes in this line as we seek to balance growth
and profitability.
In Agency Homeowners & Other, the fourth quarter combined ratio of 109.8% improved
by more than 5 points, despite three significant catastrophes, the Camp and Woolsey
wildfires in California and Hurricane Michael. On an underlying basis, the combined ratio
was 72.5% or 2.3 points higher than the prior year quarter, driven by continued elevation in
non-weather-related losses which we noted in the prior quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

The full year combined ratio of 105.6% reflects a second consecutive year of very high
catastrophe losses, which again accounted for approximately 24 points of the combined
ratio. The full year 2018 underlying combined ratio was 81.6%, 4.5 points higher than 2017,
driven by higher levels of non-catastrophe weather and non-weather loss activity.
Consistent with comments we made earlier this year, given this recent catastrophe and a
non-catastrophe loss experience and our assumption that some of this elevated loss
pressure will persist, we continue to implement granular pricing and underwriting actions
to manage our exposure and improve results.
Turning to quarterly production, our Agency Automobile retention remained at a solid
84%, while renewal premium change of 6.3% continued to moderate consistent with our
objectives, and new business was up 2% from the prior year quarter. In Agency
Homeowners & Other, we remain pleased with our momentum. Renewal premium
change was 3.9%, nearly 1 point higher than a year ago. In addition, we delivered 6%
growth in policies in force on strong retention of 86% and a 17% increase in new business.
Turning to our outlook for full year 2019, we expect renewal premium changes for Agency
Automobile to be positive, but lower compared to 2018, while renewal premium changes
for Agency Homeowners & Other should be positive and higher compared to 2018. We
expect the underlying combined ratio to be broadly consistent in Agency Automobile,
Agency Homeowners & Other and for the Personal Insurance segment compared to 2018.
This underlying combined ratio outlook includes the impact of the catastrophe aggregate
reinsurance treaty that Dan mentioned earlier.
In the outlook section of our 10-K, we'll provide some quarterly texture underneath our full
year underlying combined ratio expectations, as quarter-to-quarter comparisons will likely
vary throughout the year. All in for the segment, in light of the improved results in Auto
and the actions we are undertaking in Homeowners, we are pleased with our position and
with the opportunity to profitably grow the business, while continuing to invest in new
capabilities and explore innovative opportunities in an ever-changing marketplace.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.

Thank you, Michael. And with that, we're ready to open up for Q&A.

Q&A

FINAL

Operator
Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your line
is open.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Thank you. First, I wanted to touch base on the California wildfires. Can you give us some
more perspective on how you compare your 2018 exposure to 2017? And whether you
feel that some type of public policy solution needs to be addressed here given the annual
major exposure for the industry?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. Michael, you want to start?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean, I'll start with just sort of the view of the exposure and, Jay, maybe give you a
little bit of a view into – a little more detail underneath what we'd mean when we talk
about granular underwriting and pricing actions in response. So as we look at the
California wildfires, clearly two significant years in a row of losses. I think the discussion
and the debate about the environment is pretty broad and pretty public.
In terms of our response, we look at a handful of things. First, we look at our underwriting
appetite and our view on terms and conditions in the marketplace, and we have taken
actions. We had already taken action in 2017 to begin to restrict our new business
underwriting appetite.
We've implemented further action that'll take effect later on this quarter in 2018 (sic)
[2019] to further restrict that new business underwriting appetite and also to instill new
business underwriting procedures, for example, further inspections around defensible
space, as an example, that will again sort of tighten our new business underwriting
appetite. We've also discussed with the Department of Insurance in California and begun
to implement some non-renewal action in the state of California to address some of the
more significant wildfire exposures in the portfolio.
And we are also in discussions with the Department about a filing to increase prices for
homeowners in California. So, that gives you a little bit of texture underneath our
response to wildfires, in particular, in the Homeowners book.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

That's helpful. Thank you. My second question was on the pace of share buybacks in the
quarter. So if I look back over the past six quarters, the average quarterly buyback is
Page 11 of 23



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2019-01-22

around $385 million, which was much higher than the $170 million in the fourth quarter. So,
I'm just trying to figure out if fourth quarter lower pace of buybacks was due to the
elevated cat losses, or if there's some other factor going on we should take into account
when we project buybacks in the years ahead.

FINAL

A - Daniel S. Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Yeah, Jay, it's Dan. I'll take that. So, really, no change in our underlying philosophy. It's a
consistent approach to capital management. And to look at any one quarter's worth of
buybacks is probably a difficult way to look at it. We think about it more over time.
As you suggested and it would be true, in the fourth quarter, given the magnitude and the
uncertainty related to the California wildfires, we did pull back a little bit on the level of
share repurchase. But if you look at 2018 as a whole, we generated $2.4 billion of core
income. We returned a little bit more than $2.1 billion through dividends and share
buybacks. And remember, we made an additional $200 million contribution to the pension
plan at the end of the third quarter.
So, really, no change there. We're going to look at what level of capital we think we need
to support the business, our projected levels of earnings going forward and the cash
needs that we have for things like the pension plan and react accordingly. So, what we buy
back in shares is going to be an outcome of those things, not really an objective in and of
itself.

Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is
open.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. My first question, just going to the Business Insurance, the underlying
margin outlook for 2019. So if I go through some of your prepared remarks, you guys
pointed to about 1 point of above-normal level of large losses in 2018 with an offset
partially there from that coming back of the additional aggregate reinsurance cover that
you guys are purchasing.
Now, I know that's 50 basis points overall. I'm not sure if you can go into the specific
details within Business Insurance as we think about the margin improvement this coming
year. And then, as you set the margin outlook, are you guys assuming commercial auto
gets better or worse when compared to how you guys ended up booking that business in
accident year 2018?

FINAL

Elyse, good morning, it's Alan. So, let me start and, Greg, you can jump in. So, we try not
to get too quantitative on these outlooks. We try to keep it qualitative. There's a lot of
estimates, a lot of judgments and a lot of things from period to period that are going to
cause volatility. So, we try to give you a order of magnitude and direction.
Having said that, Greg did point out the, essentially, one point of property large losses
that we would expect to return to more normal level. We do expect to address
commercial auto over time, but a significant improvement in that is not otherwise
reflected in the outlook for margins. And the overall impact of the new cat treaty on the BI
underlying is relatively small. So, I think in broad strokes, that gives you sort of the way to
think about the underlying outlook.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then, my second question in terms of thinking about the pricing
outlooks, you guys pointed to fairly stable renewal premium change in 2019. So, when you
think about price versus exposure, can you give us a little bit of color of how you're seeing
potentially thinking of seeing the different components?
And then, in the fourth quarter that's how you kind of annualize really the uptick in rates
that we saw in 2017 following on the record cat losses. Did you see anything different in
the market as we started to annualize some of that price that would lead you to think
maybe the push for price would go one way or the other in 2019?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Between the cat activity, Elyse, and the 01/01 reinsurance renewals, we'll all see together
over time how that pricing plays out. We're not going to get any more granular on the
outlook than what we have in the outlook section that'll be in the 10-K and that Greg
shared.
Overall I would say that about 5 points of price changes is pretty good change. If you look
back at just a history of price change in BI, a plus 5 would be in that historical context
pretty good. And we've seen relatively stable allocation of that between exposure and
rates. And so, we feel pretty good about that overall.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

Q - Michael Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Hey, thanks. First question regards to the expense ratio improvement story, would you say
this will be – is this in its early innings and could this be kind of a multiyear trend? It seems
to have picked up in the second half of the year in terms of the improvement?

FINAL

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Well, what's definitely ongoing for us is the thoughtful and disciplined management of
both productivity and efficiency as a strategic effort and that goes across the entire
company, everything we do. So, you will see more activity from us in that regard.
In terms of how it's going to come through in the numbers, you may or may not see that
in the expense ratio. We've been saying for a while that our objective here is to create
incremental operating leverage and we think that's very helpful to us, but really in the
sense that it gives us a lot of flexibility, we can let that fall to the bottom line in the form of
a low expense ratio, we can take those savings and reinvest it into important strategic
initiatives or we can decide to put it into price without compromising our return objectives.
So, it's definitely an ongoing objective for us across the company. I think Greg gave you a
sense of what a run rate is for BI. And I don't know you want to, Dan?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Daniel S. Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Yeah. And for the enterprise, I'd say similarly. If you look at the full year expense ratio,
that's a pretty good indication of where we're probably heading going forward. It has
improved quite a bit over the last couple of years. I think we've reached a level that we're
more happy with. As Alan said, we'll continue to focus on productivity and efficiency, but I
wouldn't expect to see a continued level of dramatic decrease in the expense ratio from
the levels we're at now.

Q - Michael Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay, great. And my last follow-up question is in regards to workers' comp where margins
remain healthy. If we think about work comp pricing, is that expected to become more or
less of a headwind as 2019 progresses? And then, maybe you could also update us on
loss cost trends in comps? Thanks.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah, workers' comp, it's been under some pricing pressure, but completely rational
given where the profitability of the line has been. We're not going to break out pricing
outlook by line. We give it to you for the segment, but the profitability continues to be
good and generally speaking, we would expect continued pressure in the comp line.
We've got no change in commentary on workers' comp loss trend from what we shared
with you last quarter, which is to say that we – frequency and severity are – those are
selections, those are picks for us that go into loss ratios. And then, data comes in over
time and you look at reported activity over time and you compare that to what your
selections are and decide if there is anything you're seeing that requires you to move off

Page 14 of 23



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The

Thank you, and good morning. My first question on the sort of new aggregate reinsurance
program, so how much your cat loss would be in 2017 and 2018 if this program is applied
retroactively?

A - Daniel S. Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Yeah, Kai, so we looked at modeling what things would look like going back a number of
years and, in particular, over the last two years probably not surprisingly given the
elevated level of cash, we would have seen a full recovery under the treaty in each of the
last two years.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Is that safe to assume like your core loss ratio will be 50 basis point higher given you get
aggregate cover, but your normalized, like, cat loss will be 50 basis point lower going
forward?

A - Daniel S. Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Yeah, I wouldn't say that's an exact offset. I think if you go back to my comments, it's
definitely about 0.5 point on the underlying combined ratio with the mitigating factor on
the overall normal cat expectation to get us back to a pretty de minimis impact on the
combined ratio all in, if we had a normal year of cats which as you know in the last seven
years we haven't.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. In other word, if cats this year come in lighter than your normal, you actually – the
loss combined ratio will be worse than in a normal year.

A - Daniel S. Frey

Okay. Great. My second question on personal line side and your prior guidance for 2019
was improvements in underlying margin in both Homeowners as well as Auto book.
Michael just gave like new guidance 2019 pretty much consistent with 2018. Is that
because 2018 actually improved better than you were previously expected, or you are
reinvesting in the business for growth?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Sure, Kai. It's Michael. I think it's – so it's actually a little bit of both, right? If you think about
Auto, Auto came in better than we expected and so a broadly consistent outlook just
reflects the update of the actual results compared to the outlook.
On the property side, it's a little bit of a change in the outlook. Again, we've been talking
about catastrophes and non-catastrophe, weather and non-weather loss experience and
talking about the fact that we continue to put more weight on more recent periods, as
Dan mentioned. And so, the broadly consistent outlook for property is partly a reflection
of that as well as the impact of the accounting of the new cat agg treaty which, as Dan
just talked about, is a drag on underlying and, in particular, impacts the property line. So,
those are kind of the pieces.

Thanks, and good morning. Maybe just a couple of quick questions for Michael Klein.
Number one, if you go back, I guess, to Alan's opening remarks, it seems like a lot of the
work which was needed in personal auto has been done. And I think the comment was
that we got there ahead of expectations. Maybe just update us on the loss cost trend
environment out there and maybe the trajectory of rate filings.

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Sure, Amit. So, I think loss cost trend fairly consistent with what we've talked about, right?
We see continued severity trend particularly in collision and physical damage, increased
cost to repair vehicles and again many of those dynamics we see as being relatively
consistent with what we would have talked about a quarter ago. There's been some
commentary about a little bit less pressure on bodily injury loss cost trend in the
environment.

Page 16 of 23

FINAL

Again, I think when you put it all together and combine it with our view on frequency, I
would say it's consistent with Alan's comments earlier of we have a pick, we observe
results and we sort of see most of that as variation around the loss cost trend we've
estimated and so don't see a significant change in our loss trend outlook there. In terms
of outlook for price change going forward, again, our RPC outlook for auto is that RPC will
remain positive, but be lower in 2019 than it was in 2018.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

That's helpful. The only other question I had was on the press release on Lyft. And I think
Lyft has 1.4 million or so drivers. And I was curious, if you could just maybe broadly talk
about this opportunity. How we as outsiders should sort of handicap this going forward?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

Yeah. Amit, on Lyft we think it's an exciting opportunity for us to participate in a changing

or the cat treaty that Kai was talking about. Is there a simple way to think about this, kind
Page 17 of 23



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity

of going forward should we kind of assume a $1.3 billion cat load for you guys? Is that kind
of a good way to think about it?

FINAL

A - Daniel S. Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Brian, it's Dan. So, I'll say we don't give earnings guidance and so we won't give guidance
on the specific pieces of the components that go into earnings. You could see historically
we'll disclose from time to time in the proxy what our expected level of catastrophes had
been on sort of a backwards-looking basis.
You should take that number and probably think about it trending up over time for two
reasons. One is we've seen growth in the premium volume and the overall exposure level
in the business. And two, as we mentioned in my comments, a little bit more weight on
recent periods that gives us a bit of an uptick in terms of our view of each dollar of those
premiums that would need to go into cat. But I'm going to avoid giving a specific number.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. Great. And then my second question, I'm just curious, you guys had really good,
strong new business growth in your Select business, small commercial. I'm just curious
does that have any pressure on your underlying loss ratios when you're seeing that type
of new business growth?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gregory C. Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Hey, Brian, this is Greg. Yeah. In the Select business, you can see the 11% new business
growth year-over-year. We feel terrific about that growth. We've been spending quite a
bit of investment in the technology, in the workflow and the product management across
all of the Select business. You can see the quality of the book looks really good with really
strong retentions in the 82%, 83% range. So, we haven't seen any meaningful
deterioration in the underlying based on that new business.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. So, there's really – like in auto, you'll see that tenure impact, you don't get that in
small commercial?

A - Gregory C. Toczydlowski

FINAL

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Hey, thanks. Hi, good morning. First question just for Alan. Looking at the 95.7% underlying
combined ratio in Business Insurance, we factor in some elevated large loss activity, but
then you throw in kind of a normal cat load in the 3 point to 3.5 point range. It feels like
we're running at a normalized level here at like 98%, which is only a 2% underwriting
margin. That doesn't feel like a double-digit ROE. I'm curious if there's a level on the
combined ratio where you'd be looking to kind of hold the line, if there's a place we
should be thinking about where you get a little bit more of a sense of urgency around rate
increases. Thanks.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. Ryan, I'm not going to get into calculating those returns with you. And clearly, there's
been some headwinds in pockets of BI, right? We've talked about the commercial auto.
We've talked about large losses. Greg mentioned today some of the pressure outside
the United States and the largest piece of that coming from Lloyd's. So, there are some
aspects of that in which we would expect improvement over time.

Bloomberg Transcript

And we continue to get the 5 points of rate. So, there are margin opportunities outside of
the pure rate trend dynamic. Again, the BI large losses outside the U.S., commercial auto,
the fixed income NII helps as those rates are where they are and the bond portfolio turns
over. Again, you've heard us talk about expense leverage, that's been pretty good.
And just in terms of earnings dollars, the volume helps as well. So, we're not feeling badly
at all about where the returns are underlying basis and where they're trending. And if you
take a step back and look at the whole company, Ryan, and you could do this math as well
as we do, but if you take out prior year development and you put in whatever you think is
normal for cats, you get a return that's somewhere in the low-double digits.
And given where the 10-year Treasury is today, again, that doesn't feel altogether bad to
us, particularly with some opportunities we would see going forward. And one of the
benefits of having a company this size is you've got a diversified portfolio of businesses.
So, we always feel a sense of urgency around here. There's no question about that. We
are, at the heart of who we are, optimizers and everything is not perfect. We're going to
work with a sense of urgency to optimize it, but there's no sense at all here that there are
problems.

A - Gregory C. Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Ryan, one thing I would add – this is Greg – is when you do that math, keep in mind that
we do have different combined ratio targets depending on what the net investment
income has generated based on those product lines. So, think workers' comp where we
have the largest weight, where we could run a higher combined ratio relative to a shorter
tail line, like property. So, I'd just ask you to keep that in mind also when you do that math.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Understood. And then my follow-up is, I get the commercial auto, the increase was there
just this (00:53:50) more lawyer involvement. But what's not completely clear to me is
Page 19 of 23



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2019-01-22

why that wouldn't translate to some elevated trend in the other liability lines. So just
curious, what gives you guys comfort that the things you're seeing in auto are autospecific and we shouldn't be seeing more broadly in general liability?

FINAL

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. So, Ryan, we certainly watch that carefully, and just to walk you through the lines and
our thinking on it, so you've got GL, think GL large for a second, excess umbrella, and I
would put Management Liability in this group, too. You already have very, very high levels
of representation in those claims. So, that's again already a high percentage, already
pretty active there. On the smaller side, the GL small, we are seeing a little bit more of
the attorney rep, but it doesn't seem to be quite as active as it is in the auto.
And we just speculate that's probably not as attractive of a business opportunity for the
plaintiffs' bar. You've got a much more varied portfolio of claims there, harder to make the
case in many cases. So, it's just not as low-hanging fruit, at least for now. When you get
into the really small, when you see the liability component of CMP, again we have seen
the pressure. This theme, in other words, does cross the liability lines, but to a lesser
degree than we see in auto.

FINAL

Q - Larry Greenberg

{BIO 16478161 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. Thank you. Just on investment income, wondering if there's anything to
say about non-fixed income in the first quarter, given the volatility in equity markets and
fixed income markets in the fourth quarter. And then, just given some of the spread
widening that took place in the fourth quarter, have you done any asset reallocations,
given some of that volatility or what some might view as opportunity?

A - William Herbert Heyman

{BIO 3429455 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, Larry. It's Bill Heyman. Let me take them in reverse order. With respect to the second
question, we haven't really changed our strategy. We regard increased spreads as you
say as opportunity, assuming our credit judgment is good which historically it has been. As
you know, the yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped from 3.06% at the end of the
quarter to about 2.69% at the end of the year. It's back up to about 2.75%.
So, that's been partly compensated for by spread widening. So, we're still pretty
comfortable with what we're seeing out there. In terms of private equity, we occasionally
make internal projections of what we think the portfolio will throw up, and we have been
notoriously inaccurate. We're generally far too pessimistic. I agree that the developments
in public equity markets in the fourth quarter taken alone wouldn't augur well for 2019, but
we've seen similar situations where developments like that have been followed by
perfectly good years. So, your guess is probably as good as ours.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Thanks for allowing me just to sneak one in. Just wanted to go back to Business Insurance
and the underlying combined ratio there. So, I think you said that you had about a 1
percentage point of non-cat large losses in 2018. I think that was roughly the same
number that you had in 2017. So, if I look at the underlying combined ratio, it seems like
there was a little bit of deterioration year-over-year. Maybe if I adjust for the commercial
auto, it's flat to slightly worse. Can you maybe talk about what is driving that this year?

FINAL

Hi, Yaron. This is Greg. Number one, you're correct that we do our best job possible of
trying to normalize our large losses and that's how we price and manage the business
and we were over expectations in 2017. And as I disclosed in my prepared comments, we
were also over our normal expectations for 2018 and that was roughly the 1 point.
The difference and maybe a point to the full year underlying combined ratio where you
can see an 80 basis points difference between the full year 2017 and the full year 2018,
and again in my prepared comments, I mentioned auto driving a little bit more than 0.5
point there. The international business is also driving about a little more than 0.5 point and
that's predominantly driven based on the Lloyd's business. And then, we had, as I
disclosed, some favorable expense activity that offsets some of that. So, those are all the
pieces that get you there.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

So, if you expect the expense ratio to maybe not improve to the same magnitude in 2019
and you still expect some improvement in 2019 for the overall underlying combined ratio,
can you maybe talk about where that improvement will be coming from given the current
loss trends?

A - Gregory C. Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

It's basically that 1 point of large losses.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Okay. Okay. And then, maybe a quick one on the prior year development. It sounds from
the scripted comments that the slowdown in net prior year favorable development was
really driven by an increase in adverse development and not so much by maybe a
decrease in gross favorable development. Is that fair?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Let me just start and then I'll key to Dan. The question almost implied that there's a trend
in prior year development. There is no trend in prior year development. Our obligation at
the end of every quarter is to come up with management's best estimate and we do that.
And then, every quarter we go through the process of reevaluating our reserves and
making adjustments where we feel like we need to. For any given period, the level of
prior year development is just a net of those adjustments to best estimates.

A - Daniel S. Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Yeah. I'd echo that which is why I think we're pretty careful to always characterize it as net
