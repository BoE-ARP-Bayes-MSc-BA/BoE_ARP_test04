Thank you, Linda. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us
today.
Last night, we reported Second Quarter operating income of $50 million, or $0.43 per
diluted share, an annualized operating ROE for the quarter of 3.9%. Our quarterly results
were adversely impacted by very high frequency of unrelated small and mid-size cat and
weather events in the US, Canada, Europe, and Argentina, aggregating to $140 million,
net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums. None of the event losses exceeded $35
million, and our analysis indicates that this is an issue of random frequency. We'll discuss
the quarter's loss experience in more detail.

FINAL

Notwithstanding the headline losses for the quarter, I believe the results should be
viewed in the context of four key factors. The first is that while our portfolio has historical
experienced some volatility, we've been well-compensated for that volatility over time as
evidenced by our superior underwriting metrics.
The second is that this volatility goes both ways. Our First Quarter had extremely low cat
and weather activity in contrast to the higher activity in the Second Quarter, such that our
year-to-date results are actually quite healthy, with a lower year over year combined ratio,
operating income of $2.36 per share, up 19% over the prior year, and annualized
operating ROE of 10.9%. These results are indicative of the ability of our portfolio to
absorb volatility, including that presented by a quarter such as this one.

Bloomberg Transcript

The third point is that excluding the quarter's cat and weather losses, the core
underwriting results were nevertheless quite strong. Both of our segments contributed
solid core underwriting profits, as Joe will discuss later.
Finally, as we've discussed with you on previous occasions, we are committed to
diversifying our portfolio so as to reduce earnings volatility over time and we are making
substantial progress in this area. Both our insurance and reinsurance segments delivered
strong and diversifying premium growth, with consolidated gross premiums written up
20% in the quarter and 17% year-to-date. Fully 80% of the growth this year has come from
the lines other than property, marine, or catastrophe lines. Our accident and health and
agriculture initiatives contributed almost half of the growth this year. Our property, marine,
property reinsurance, and property catastrophe reinsurance premiums written were up
8% year-to-date, much of which was driven by rates, and our various auto PMLs have
been relatively stable. So our diversifying growth initiatives are on track, and we expect
these will deliver our desired reduction and earnings volatility going forward.
Diluted book value per share declined 4.5% during the quarter to $42.67, due to the
predictably material negative impact of the significant rise in rates and widening of credit
spreads that adversely impacted our investment portfolio this quarter. Some of this has
come back in the last few weeks, but as of quarter end, we did take some pain in the
portfolio. We remain committed to intelligent capital management, sustaining our financial
strength, and benefiting our shareholders.
During the quarter, we were active in repurchasing our common shares, $228 million
repurchased in the quarter. So far this year, we have repurchased 8.5 million shares, or
7.2% of the outstanding shares in the beginning of the year.
Importantly, we continue to execute on our strategy goals, bringing on new talent,
expanding our franchise with growth in attractive lines and markets, both existing and
new, as we build a broader more diversified portfolio. Market conditions are stable at
attractive levels, or improving in many of our lines, and we are well-positioned to continue
to take advantage of available opportunities.
I will discuss market conditions in more detail following Joe's remarks. Joe, over to you.

FINAL

Thank you, Albert. Good morning everyone.
The first half of 2013 at AXIS has seen two very different quarters. Our cat and weatherrelated loss experience was extremely light in the First Quarter this year, delivering one of
our strongest quarterly underwriting profits in the last five years. In contrast, as Albert
noted, in this quarter, we experienced a high frequency of natural cat and weather-related
losses impacting our portfolio.
First half results are a better measure of our underwriting portfolio's performance this
year. For the first six months of 2013, we generated underwriting income of $181 million, an
annualized ROE of 14.7%, and an operating ROE of 10.9%. Moving into the details of the
income statement, our Second Quarter gross premiums written increased 20% to more
than $1.2 billion with growth emanating from both of our segments.

Bloomberg Transcript

In our insurance segment, our top line was up $106 million, or 15.7%, reflecting a
continuation of the trends noted in the First Quarter. Significant growth in our accident and
health line contributed almost half of the increase for the quarter. For the year-to-date,
accident and health premiums are up 78%.
In liability, our growth in the US wholesale excess casualty market continued this quarter,
given the significant improvement in the rate environment and selected areas. Growth in
our professional lines business in Europe, Canada, and Australia continued to drive growth
and professional lines overall and an element of renewal timing also contributed but to a
lesser extent. Property premiums were broadly comparable quarter over quarter, as
growth from rate and new business opportunities largely offset continued reduction of
cat-exposed business written through MGAs and a shift of the renewal date for one
significant contract.
In reinsurance our top line was up $99 million or 29.3%. Agriculture contributed half of this
increase, with a significant amount of this year's January 1 US business binding later than
usual. For the year-to-date our agriculture premiums are up $122 million to $135 million.
Outside of our agriculture initiative, remaining growth in reinsurance this quarter was
driven by increased participation in the US excess umbrella market where cedants are
benefiting from a more attractive rate environment.
Our catastrophe premiums also increased, partially driven by expanded relationship with
one cedent in Florida and other new business in the United States. This was partially offset
by the impact of rate reductions and the depreciation of the yen against the US dollar at
the April 1 renewal date.
Our consolidated net premiums written were up 24%, exceeding the growth rate for
gross premiums written. The corresponding two-point reduction in our cedent premium
ratio for the quarter was driven by a number of factors. The most significant factor was
growth in business for which we do not see significant premiums specifically our accident
and health line and our reinsurance segment.

FINAL

Changes in reinsurance purchasing for our insurance segment also contributed. This
included reductions in the quota share session rates for significant portions of our
professional lines and liability books, a reduction in the cost of our property excessive loss
protection, and higher retentions for both property and marine. Our net earned premiums
were up 11% for the quarter, with growth in insurance and reinsurance driven by our
accident and health and agriculture initiatives respectively.
Our Second Quarter consolidated current accident-year loss ratio increased 8.7 points to
72.4%, primarily driven by the high frequency of small and midsize natural cat and weather
related events globally. In insurance, the accident-year loss ratio increased 12.4 points,
with 11.9 points of this attributable to natural cat and weather related losses. We
recognized $90 million or 21.1 points of net losses related to cat and weather, inclusive of
payments to reinstate reinsurance protection.

Bloomberg Transcript

In insurance, these losses primarily emanated from tornados and hailstorms in the US and
flooding in Argentina and Canada. While none of these events significantly impacted
results in isolation, the combined impact was meaningful to the quarter's results.
Comparatively, the Second Quarter of 2012 was impacted by $35 million of net losses
related to Second Quarter US weather events. Adjusting for the impact of these cat and
weather items the accident-year loss ratio was relatively flat, with a higher level of risk
losses in the quarter offsetting favorable impacts of rate.
For the first half of 2013, the current accident-year loss ratio for insurance is 68.0%, up
only slightly from 66.7% for the comparable period in 2012. Adjusting for the impact of cat
and weather related losses the accident-year loss ratio for insurance was down 3.5 points
as rate, mix, and experience benefited the ratio.
The Second Quarter current accident year loss ratio for our reinsurance segment was up
5.8 points to 66.3%. We recognized $50 million of natural cat and weather related losses
net of reinstatements, primarily related to European and Canadian flooding. This
contributed 9.7 points to the accident-year loss ratio, whereas the 2012 net losses related
to Second Quarter US weather activity contributed 4.2 points. Adjusting for the impact of
cat and weather related losses, the Second Quarter ratios were comparable, as higher
loss ratios book for agriculture offset improvement in rate and experience. Adjusting for
the impact of cat and weather items for the first half of the year, the current accident-year
loss ratio for reinsurance improved by 1.6 points to 56.3%.
In the quarter our results continued to benefit from net favorable development which
aggregated $42 million. Short tail classes in both segments contributed $32 million of this
balance primarily reflecting better than expected loss emergence. In addition, we
continue to give weight to actuarial methods that reflect our favorable experience for
liability reinsurance business, a process that commenced last quarter. This contributed a
further $22 million of favorable development for the quarter, primarily related to the 2004
through 2007 accident years.
We strengthened our reserves for professional liability insurance lines by $14 million this
quarter. This action was driven by recent developments on certain global financial credit

FINAL

crisis claims and was partially offset by the recognition of favorable experience for
professional lines business not impacted by the global financial crisis. We've historically
taken a cautious approach with respect to the 2007 through 2009 accident years affected
by the global financial crisis, given that development patterns are expected to differ
significantly from other years. We've been carefully monitoring both market trends and
individual case developments in the quarters and years that followed and it was the latter
that drove us to strengthen our reserves this quarter.
Consistent with our historical practice, we reacted swiftly to unfavorable claim emergence
for certain underlying reserve classes while exercising a degree of caution while realizing
the impact of favorable experience. We are very comfortable with our overall reserve
position for quarter-end for professional lines insurance with $1.1 billion for IBNR for all
years, of which $234 million is related to years impacted by the global financial crisis.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our G&A expense ratio decreased 3.1 points relative to last year. This is primarily due to
the $34 million of costs associated with our senior leadership transition embedded in G&A
last year. Adjusting for the transition costs last year, the increase in G&A of 80 basis points
was primarily driven by increased staffing and office costs attributable to the continued
expansion of our global platform over the past year, as well as timing issues and certain
one-time expenses.
Turning to the investment portfolio, the total return of our investment portfolio was a
negative 134 basis points in the Second Quarter, primarily reflecting mark to market
adjustments on fixed income securities. This quarter's pretax unrealized loss of $295
million was principally due to changes in valuation for fixed income securities driven by
rising interest rates and widening credit spreads. Net investment income was $83 million
for the quarter, up from the prior year's quarter, $74 million. The most significant driver of
the quarter over quarter increase was our other investment portfolio which contributed
$12 million during this quarter versus a negative $2 million in the prior year.
Net investment income from our fixed maturity portfolios, including cash and investments,
was $76 million for the quarter, down slightly from $78 million in the prior year quarter. The
reinvestment yield in our fixed maturity portfolio increased during the quarter from 1.7% to
2.4% due primarily to the upward shift in US Treasury rates. Cash and invested assets
totaled $14.3 billion June 30th, up from $13.9 billion a year ago.
At June 30, 2013, our fixed maturities weighted average credit rating was unchanged at
AA-. During the quarter, our fixed maturity portfolio duration increased to 3.5 years,
compared with 3.1 years at the beginning of the quarter, and 2.8 years a year ago. The
increase in duration during the quarter is mainly due to the reduction in the anticipated
prepayment speeds on our mortgage-backed security holdings. The strategy for our fixed
maturity portfolio is unchanged and emphasizes spread sectors, the largest being
corporate and US agency mortgage-backed securities.
In order to reduce the impact of rising US Treasury rates, we have increased allocations to
local currency, emerging markets, sovereign date and floating rate CLO debt in recent
quarters. We also incorporated tips into our portfolio to reduce the impact from

FINAL

unexpected increases in inflation and increased our municipal bonds holdings this quarter
due to attractive after-tax returns. Equities and alternatives now account for 11.1% of total
cash and investment assets versus 10.4% a year ago. We expect these investments to
provide attractive returns during periods when our fixed maturity results are suboptimal.
In summary, the investment portfolio performed in line with expectations during the
quarter, and remains comprised of a diversified set of strategies with a focus on
mitigating the negative impact of interest rates on the portfolio. While rising rates and
spread widening adversely impacted our book value this quarter, a theme for the entire
industry, our capital position remains strong. We closed the quarter with common equity
of $4.9 billion and total capital of $6.6 billion. The change in the quarter includes net
income available to common shareholders of $72 million, an after tax mark to market
reduction in our investment portfolio to $267 million, and stock repurchase and dividends
of $257 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

During the quarter, we repurchased 5.1 million common shares for the total of $228
million, leaving us with $409 million of remaining authorization under our reinsurance
program. For the year-to-date we have returned 151% of operating earnings through
share repurchases and dividends, and that's a total of $418 million. If market and financial
conditions remain the same, we continue to anticipate returning close to 100% of our
annual earnings to our shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases,
although we expect to slow our repurchase activity during the Atlantic wind season.
We also issued $225 million of series D preferred shares which pay a 5.5% dividend. We
used a portion of the net proceeds to fund the redemption of the $100 million 7.25%
series 8 preferred shares outstanding. This, in combination with the other preferred
transactions executed over the past 18 months, reduced the weighted average dividend
rate on our preferred equity capital based by 99 basis points to 6.385%.
Our strategic expansion opportunities continue to progress and we remain optimistic
about our prospects. We believe that our diversified global franchise and strong balance
sheet will continue to allow us to take advantage of market opportunities as they emerge.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Albert.

Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you, Joe.
We continue to be positive on market conditions for AXIS. Other than in a few isolated
lines and markets, pricing remains stable or increasing for most of our book. The pace of
improvement, however, has slowed since the First Quarter.
Within our insurance segment, the overall AXIS insurance rate change for the Second
Quarter of 2013 stands at plus 3%, down slightly from 5% last quarter. Rates are
continuing to increase across most classes and geographies other than the same few
notable exceptions. Our US division, which is dominated by our wholesale E&S property

FINAL

and casualty business continues it show the strongest rate improvement. Overall, rate
changes this quarter was plus 6%, down from plus 9% last quarter.
This deceleration of the US is primarily driven by E&S property. This stabilization follows on
nine consecutive quarters of rate increases aggregating to 15%, something rarely seen in
our careers. We expect the accounts with the recent loss activity, winter flood concerns or
accumulation issues within a specific geographic region will continue to see price
increases through another renewal cycle.
Casualty business in the US division, which is primarily E&S umbrella business, continued to
show double-digit rate increases nine quarters after rate increases began. Overall, in the
US, we are continuing to see more challenging risks flow away from standard carriers and
back into the E&S markets, providing us with a greater flow of submission, higher new
business conversion rates and improved retention ratios.

Bloomberg Transcript

In our international division, most classes monitored continue to indicate rate increases.
The average for our London-sourced specialty lines within this division is essentially flat
this quarter, down from plus 4% during the First Quarter. The comparison between
quarters is exaggerated by the marine liability class which showed a large increase in the
First Quarter, and by the large proportion of offshore marine business written in the
Second Quarter which gave up some rates, following a two-year period of good pricing
and the line losses. Once again, aviation and terrorism are stubbornly continuing their
downward trend at a pace consistent with last year's.
After eight consecutive quarters of rate increases that aggregated to an accumulative
19% pricing increase, our global property class written out of London took a breather last
quarter and was essentially flat. The international P&C lines within the international
division, which includes our Canadian and Australian P&C operation, are showing rate
change of plus 1% down from 3% in the First Quarter. In our professional lines division,
overall rate change is plus 1%, down from plus 3% in the First Quarter. Most classes
monitored continue to indicate rate increases but generally at a lower rate than in the First
Quarter.
In the US, price remains more consistent on primary business than in excess layers. Private
company D&O and ancillary lines pricing held firm in the quarter. Outside the, US rate
change remains more patchy with continued good improvement in Australia but financial
institutions and commercial D&O in Canada and Europe are showing declines in the low
single digits.
Moving on to reinsurance, in the most recent midyear renewals, dominated by property
renewals in the US, pricing was under pressure. High-margin Florida accounts experienced
the most significant rate pressure. This pressure falls off from historically high pricing
levels achieved in recent years, levels which served to attract significant additional capital.
From our perspective, much of this business remains attractive, especially as the
increased Southeast exposure improves the capital efficiency and return on risk of our
overall portfolio. We've been focusing on this for some time, and are comfortable that our
portfolio today delivers more attractive expected profitability on a risk-adjusted basis than

Page 8 of 22

FINAL

the portfolio we had a year ago. Our base is a much stronger one from which to navigate
the vagaries of the market.
Non-property renewals have been mixed. Generally, the gradually improving primary
pricing environment I just described is offset to some degree by increasing competition
from reinsurers. This is often manifested in increased ceding commissions. Although we
are seeing increases in those ceding commissions, in most cases, the net result is a net
positive rate to AXIS Re as the underlying rates are increasing at a faster pace than the
ceding commissions.

Bloomberg Transcript

Approximately 14% of AXIS Re's 2012 expiring premium was renewable on July 1. At this
renewal we estimate we wrote about $260 million of premium, about 4% more than the
expiring. Growth and select opportunities and casualty reinsurance offset minor reductions
elsewhere in the portfolio. Within property, reductions and catastrophe writings were
somewhat offset by growth and property per risk and quarter share as well as in
engineering.
I'm confident we're making the most of current market conditions. We believe we've
been successful in growing our business in the most attractive areas and pursuing
diversified growth in select specialty areas across both of our segments. In insurance,
we've improved penetration of the E&S lines with new business production this quarter
doubling relative to the Second Quarter of last year. We've progressed our initiatives in
the renewable energy, design professionals and environmental professional liability, UK
professional indemnity lines, and Australian and Canadian op operations. Of note -- our
accident and health initiative gross written premiums in the first half of this year already
exceed those for the full year of 2012 by 13%.
In AXIS re, following the activity and agriculture reinsurance in the US which marked the
first half of the year, we are now working on expanding those relationships as well as the
upcoming China and India renewals. We're also progressing on our third-party capital
management efforts, and have also begun executing on opportunities to hedge our
reinsurance portfolio at attractive prices.
We believe we are executing on all critical elements of our strategic plan. AXIS's a strong
underwriting performance of the last decade was achieved with a focus on complex
volatile lines. At the core of our strategic plan is to continue to execute well in
underwriting these risks, reducing volatility where we can, but understanding that we have
to accept some quarterly volatility in return for a better annual result in volatility.
Nevertheless, we will look to further mitigate that overall portfolio volatility and to further
enhance overall annual outcomes by diligently executing on select portfolio-accretive
initiatives in less volatile specialty areas.
Our year-to-date annualized operating ROE of approximately 11% is the more appropriate
measure of our performance this year thus far. While this is a good result, it still does not
reflect the full leverage of all the major strategic initiatives in progress at AXIS, and we
remain committed to continuing to deliver top quintile annual results with industry average
annual volatility for the benefit of our shareholders.

Questions And Answers

FINAL

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Charles Sebaski from BMO
Capital Markets.

Q - Charles Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Good morning. A couple of questions.
The first one on capital management activities. I thought I recalled last quarter kind of the
guideposts for repurchases was an earnings-plus concept that I think Joe you said here
you're kind of at an up to earnings. I wonder if there's any change based on growth or
anything else.

A - Joe Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No. Joe, there is no change. You know, we -- we're opportunistic to the same policy that
we had before. Obviously, at this point in time our repurchases are in excess of our
income. We take this a quarter at a time. We'll lay back during the Third Quarter wind
season but take another look at this in the Fourth Quarter of the year.

Q - Charles Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Okay. Then on the insurance division, I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the
volatility and the return aspect. -- the $90 million of cat losses in the quarter, I think, took a
lot of us kind of by surprise given that it seemed to be -- not an above average cat
quarter in general. I was just wondering if we could see if there's anything that's been
changed in the portfolio, if you're either at lower levels on the primary basis or anything
year over year. It just seems the only time you've been at this level of cat losses has been
when there's been major hurricane activity.

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Charles, you're right. It is, in fact, the highest loss quarter in the insurance division since
we've had -- without major activity. But we've looked at this many different ways. And
we've looked at the average number of risk losses that we've had from different sources
over time. And this is truly an exceptional quarter in both the number of events, as well as
the severity of the individual events.
You're right. It wasn't a single event but I think that's also an important part of the
situation. These were a number of smaller claims. The largest one individually being the La
Plata energy loss related to the floods in Argentina. But other than that, it was all small
claims in the single millions mostly.

Page 10 of 22



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2013-07-31

FINAL

It just happened everywhere. It happened in Calgary, it happened all over the US weather,
it happened in Argentina. And I will also say that the number that we've provided includes
a fair amount of IBNR again cumulative amounts of PCS events for a full year.
So I don't know how other individuals are reporting this, but we had 14 different PCS
events in the Second Quarter. And according to our practice, recognizing that very often a
lot of these attritional PCS losses don't get announced in the quarter that it's
experienced, our practice is to set up an amount of PCS-related IBNR to anticipate for the
notices we expect to receive in the next quarter. So it is a large number, but we have not
had any change in our underwriting. In fact, a large number of the accounts where we've
had losses were accounts that we've had for several years that have performed well that
have benefited from improvements in terms and conditions.
Rest assured that we are spending a lot of time looking at this. As of now, our conclusion
is that this is random volatility. But again, we will continue to further analyze this and,
obviously, if there are any lessons to be learned we will be sure to incorporate them in our
planning for 2014.

Q - Charles Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Can you tell us on the insurance side of the business what an ROE profile is that you're
writing to currently, sort of the go forward if there's a benchmark? I realize there's a lot of
different lines, but -

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Oh, my God, there's such a large number of lines. You about I think it's fair to say that if
you look at where we were in the last couple of years at least, you'll find that on a gross
basis, the primary insurance results were about flat with the -- sorry the gross reinsurance
results were about flat with reinsurance. However, over the last couple of years, the
reinsurance charges that we were paying actually were large such that the net results that
had ROE results for our insurance division was modestly lower than the reinsurance.
What we've seen over the last 12 to 18 months or so is a change where the ROE, because
of the fundamental pricing on the insurance side, is improving, and the costs of our
reinsurance coverage is declining, we're actually saying the ROE of our insurance division
improving meaningfully. Now, our overall book is still averaging approximately 10% right
now, ROE. And so I would say that overall, it would be about a 10%, perhaps a little bit
better target ROE for the insurance book.

Q - Charles Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Excellent. Thank you very much.

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

One more comment I want to make is the volatility of that book is the insurance division.
Again is one that we've experienced for the entire duration of our company, and not in
any one year did our insurance division report a combined ratio ne excess of 100.

And the next question will come from Greg Locraft of Morgan Stanley.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning.
I want to do follow upon the pricing versus loss cost situation. I give you -- you were very
forth right, the pricing's decelerated 1Q to 2Q, and what I am wrestling with is how will that
flow in the margins over time? You've shown excellent margin improvement in recent
periods, recent years, how should we be thinking about that as pricing is decelerating
across the board?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think by and large if you're looking at it from most of our lines, certainly the property
lines, the umbrella and excess lines, most lines of business were continuing to see pricing
ahead of trend. The one area where it's clearly not there yet is professional lines. We're
averaging 1% and, obviously, our actuaries are not putting up a 1% loss trend number. That
said, loss trend number we put in our pricing for the last couple of years has as you know
overestimated actual loss trends. But at 1% we would say from an actuarial basis,
professional lines are still lagging and in all our other lines of business are confident we're
at least at loss trend or better.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Okay. So we can still see margin expansion. Great. On professional lines, you all
mentioned the -- the reserve addition. I wanted a little more color on the reserve addition
on professional lines. There's been a lot of growth there. It's the biggest reserve bucket.
Can you maybe help us a bit more on what exactly is recurring in that area, what you're
seeing? It sounds like it needs more rate too.

A - Joe Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Well Albert already commented on the rate, Greg. But let me sum it up this way. First of
all, you know we're an excess writer for the most part in professional lines. We do some
primary but most of our portfolio is excess. We took some action in the Second Quarter
on four credit crisis claims and two noncredit crisis claims which, for the most part, are
now reserved at policy limits. We do not expect this to have a material impact going
forward.
We did disclose there was $14 million of net adverse development in the quarter. That's
actually a combination of $36 million worth of adverse development on credit crisis years
offset by $22 million in favorable development and professional lines on noncredit crisis
years. So $14 million is a net strengthening. But these cases that I'm referring to, these six
Page 12 of 22



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2013-07-31

cases resulted in our decision to take an action. You know we're always conservative in
taking the bad news first, but we don't expect this to continue. If we do, we feel that the
overall strength of our reserves in professional lines will enable us to handle it.

FINAL

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Let me add to that a couple of things. Greg, first of all, you refer to the large base of
premiums, of IBNR and professional lines. And I think we tried to make the point that we
have in excess of $1.1 billion in IBR and we're very comfortable with that, and it was only
with regard to a couple of cases we want to do increase but we in fact released reserves
in other non-global crisis years. So we are remaining very comfortable with the totality of
our professional lines book and when we get one or two bad cases, we will take that.
Greg, you also made reference to the growth in recent years. I think that that's what
commenting on. If you look at where we've been, historically, this company had a large
exposure in financial institutions. That's one of the areas that we do quite well in. And we
had some US-based D&O and professional liability. Most of the growth, if not all of the
growth that you will have seen in the last three years have been in diversifying lines and in
diversifying countries. We expanded in our European professional liability, we expanded in
Australia, we expanded in Canada. We went down-market, including things like -- design
professionals. We've expanded and diversified the professional liability book. It hasn't
been simply growing in those existing lines where we've been before.

And the next question will come from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Thank you. Just one quick question on the balance sheet.
So it looks like financial leverage is picking up. You raised a bit of debt. You're buying back
stock ahead of earnings, and we have these marks in the portfolio that are hitting the net
equity line. How should we think about the level that you want to maintain in terms of
financial leverage? Are you all baked-in in terms of AOCI? Or did you look at it ex-AOCI,
and how might further marks impact your view? Thanks.

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yes. The general answer to your question is that we try to keep our financial leverage, and
that is debt and preferred stock to total capital at or below 25%. We have crept up in the
Second Quarter. When we did the preferred offering, our leverage was a little bit less
than it is now mainly due to the unrealized depreciation in the portfolio.

Page 13 of 22



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2013-07-31

But we're pretty confident that if interest rates increase at a reasonable rate over the
next couple of years, we can offset any unrealized gains in the portfolio with
improvements in investment income and improvements in operating income.

FINAL

So just coming back to the beginning, where we are is probably pretty -- where we are is
really where we're comfortable being. We'd actually like to bring that down over a period
of time. Does that help?

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Sure. The question -- the outlook for rates is higher. So that makes sense. If your view is
right and moderate change in rates does come true, then that makes sense. But would
that imply if we do see a big rise in interest rates, that you're going to curtail your share,
your capital, deploying your buy back activity in order to kind of manage to that 25 or
below?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I wouldn't say necessarily that would be the case. And again, if you think about the
margins that we'll earn on our underwriting income as well as increased investment
income. And just simply how the markets are reacting. In the last two to three weeks, our
portfolio's come back about $60 million from the unrealized position we were at the end
of the quarter.
So there is some volatility in rates. We wouldn't necessarily curtail our stock repurchase
program. But our overall policy, as we said before, is to basically repurchase shares and
dividends up to 100% of our operating income. So that's really what we're going to stick
to.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

One last thing. Magnitude-wise, you lost about just under $300 million in AOCI in the
quarter and your run rate investment income is about $100 million and change, $80 million
in the quarter this time. I'm just trying -- it's just math.
I'm just trying to understand the math of if you have -- you're being smart and you're
managing to a 25, then should we say well, let's look at where the total capitalization is,
let's look at where the debt is and based on wherever that ends up, I'm not stating a view
on interest rates but I'm just asking like if that happens, and it pushes you above 25,
simply out of your control in terms of what happens in the rate market, how are you going
to perceive that? Is that something you're going to manage towards or are you going to
kind of look at -- you're going to peel the marks out and focus on something else?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

That's a fair question and the way we look at it is in multiple areas.
It's not an absolute hard line that we will stop buying if we hit the 25. But I think there's
two or three areas here. One is we look at our -- we look at our leverage on our GAAP
Page 14 of 22



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2013-07-31

FINAL

balance sheet. But it's not the only kind of leverage that we look at. We look at our
economic capital, we look at our rating agency capital, we look at all of these issues and in
all of these cases we determine the amount of excess that we have. And if the excess
remains constant, then that's something that we need -- gives us some room to acquire.
From a purely economic balance sheets perspective, as you know, the GAAP balance
sheet does not reflect the net present value of the reserves, whereas on an economic
balance sheet, a rise in interest rates reduces the net present value of your liabilities so
the economic equity actually doesn't go down as far as your GAAP equity.
The other thing is that although our leverage quote unquote has increased in -- with the
recent preferred offerings, this is about as good a level of leverage that you can have.
These are perpetual preferreds, and we tend to think of the perpetual preferreds as
having significantly less debt-like criteria and that also goes into the consideration.
So longer term, we believe that 25% is an appropriate level and cap for our leverage but
that doesn't mean that over a short period of time, we've got the kind of adjustments
and volatility and interest rates that we will have, that we will let that be our only
determinant.

And the next question will be from Jay Cohen of Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Thank you. A couple questions. The first is I seem to -- pick up in your commentary, you're
talking about your cedent reinsurance, that you had ceded less in your property business.
Correct me if I'm wrong but the question I would have one reasonable strategy would be
gee if property reinsurance price something getting better shouldn't you be ceding more,
could you just talk about your strategy there.

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

That's a good question. It's the per risk versus the cat.
I think it's fair to say that cat reinsurance is getting cheaper and we are in fact buying more
cat reinsurance. The issue is with regard to the per risk. We've done a fair amount of
analysis around that, and we've determined that we were literally ceding away too much
of our profits and diversification benefits within the lower layers. So we've -- modestly
increased the retentions on the per risk layers. And also on professional lines and casualty
we've reduced the quota shares.

Page 15 of 22

FINAL

But the net of it all is even with the overall net improvement in many lines in reinsurance,
the net of it all is that the changes in the ceded reprogram are anticipated to provide
both, A, higher annual results, and, B, lower annual volatility to the overall portfolio. The
one area where there is the most reduction in costs, which is cat, we have in fact acquired
more reinsurance protection.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

That's really helpful. Second question is, if we look at the Third Quarter, it feels like every
other day there's some catastrophe, man-made typically, with train crashes and other
things. Do you have any sense at this point if there's any major exposures you have for
instance the Canadian train crash seems to be the biggest one out there?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yes. It almost makes you worry it take the train these days. I don't disagree with you.,
obviously, we monitor these, everything that we see today gives us -- we are concluding
given the data that we have today there is nothing material that we've seen happening in
the quarter for us.

And the next question is from Vinay Misquith from Evercore.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. The first question is on the margin improvement year-over-year.
According to your last year results, it was roughly flat. I believe you mentioned some large
one-off loss including cats. If you could help us understand -- so should we be looking at
the first half of the year accident and (inaudible) cat and sort of trending that forward and
assuming that's going to be modestly improving because of rate?

A - Joe Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Yes Vinay, I think that's a good assumption. If you concentrate on the Second Quarter for a
minute, as far as the insurance is concerned, we had about a point impact on a loss ratio
from rate. And as I think we mentioned in the First Quarter call that we expected during
the year to have a 1% to 2% improvement in our accident year ratio other as a result of
rate increases. About half of that has earned through the first half of the year.
However, we did have an increased incidences, as Albert described, of risk losses, which
offset to some extent the benefit that we would have seen coming through rate in the
Page 16 of 22



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2013-07-31

accident year loss ratio. So I think a much better way to look at this is the six months rather
than just the Second Quarter itself.

FINAL

On the reinsurance side, for the most part, the rates that we're achieving are keeping
pace with trend. So really no major change there.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. Second question was on the reserve development. If I understand it
right, you added about $36 million to the professional liability book, so the pro forma
number from this quarter would have been actually about $78 million of favorable, is that
fair to say?

A - Joe Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

That's correct.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. And there's no -- so the reason being because the base of reserve development
has fallen off recently, so I'm just curious as to whether you're seeing something different
now versus the past or is it just because these one-time issues?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Joe Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Yes. As you know, we don't comment about the future relative to reserve development.
But our reinsurance prior year development was really what we've experienced in the
past so there's really been no change there. And as far as insurance is concerned, with
the exception of this professional line situation that we refer to, our prior year
development was more or less where it's been.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

So that's helpful. Then one last question on the net investment income, the income from
fixed majority investments was up 5% quarter over quarter. Just curious what's happening
there. It was about $75 million this quarter. Was it about $70 million last quarter?

A - Joe Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Right. We have an investment in Treasury and inflation-protected securities or TIPS, and
you know that we've got some CPI adjustments that flow through that, so investment
income in those areas fluctuates from quarter to quarter. If you need specifics, we can
give you that but basically that's the overall answer.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

But this quarter is the normalized rate you would think or a bit higher than normal?

A - Joe Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Page 17 of 22



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td

quarter than normal.

Okay. Thank you.

Our next question will come from Meyer Shields of Keefe, Bruyette and Woods.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. If I could turn again to the professional liability -- when you talk about the $22
million of favorable development excluding the credit crisis issues, what asset years are
those from?

A - Joe Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

I believe it was spread out. Just give me a minute and I will -- bear with me here. I'm
looking through a table.

Bloomberg Transcript

So most of the strengthening that I referred to in the credit crisis years came from 2009,
but the beneficial impact really came from actually the years 2007, 2006, 2005, and really
spread out among a number of years. And as well as 2010.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Joe Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

2005, 2006, 2007 and 2010.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, that is helpful. Albert, you talked about more -- how do I characterize it -- lower rate
increases in the number of lines of business. Can you talk about why you think that is
actually going on? Is that new competitors, old competitors being more aggressive or
some other factor?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think in many cases each line of business has its own psychology. I think on the primary
side we have a number of quarters now of increases and it could be that there is a little
bit of satisfaction as we are now. It could be it is just an anomaly of the accounts that we
renewed this quarter. That is particularly the case I would say when we look at the
international book, where depending on the concentration of the line of business that you
are in, the preponderance of the renewals if that book of business is up versus down.

Page 18 of 22



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity

FINAL

As I mentioned in the First Quarter, the international book of business was favorably
affected by significant increases in the marine liability line. Over 20% of our premiums are
renewable in the Second Quarter, in international, in the offshore energy and that has had
a very good pricing and excellent results and so here we started to see some declines in
the result of that.
If I were to say one thing it would be that for most of the lines of business that we are
seeing, the changes are consistent with what we have been observing in terms of A, prior
pricing and B, loss experiences. The one area that is still lagging is in professional lines.
And there again there is a reason for that. The lower layers of professional lines which
have been most affected by claims increases, including M&A litigation and so on and so
forth, those lower layers are in fact seeing healthy price increases.

Bloomberg Transcript

When you get to the excess layers, as Joe mentioned, we are mostly in the excess layers
most of those players have in fact been protected about a lot of the losses. So the loss
experience in a number of the excess layers have been quite good, which goes back to
my comment about how we are feeling comfortable about the overall portfolio and how
the loss trends that we have been pricing in our professional lines in fact haven't really
come out in reported cases. And because of that the pricing improvement is lagging in
the upper layers because the losses haven't shown up in the upper layers. So most of
what we are seeing fundamentally is consistent with loss experiences, loss turns that we
have seen.
Obviously with regard to the reinsurance book, the biggest factor that we have seen is
the substantial increase in capacity afforded by the capital markets, and that has, of
course, reduced the amount of which is available to the reinsurers. Reinsurers have all that
capacity they want to put to use. They are now putting it to use in the catastrophe world,
so many of them are displacing that catastrophe into other lines, which is why we are
seeing increased reinsurance competition in other lines. And as we mentioned to you that
is reflecting itself, or manifesting itself in terms of higher ceding commissions. It is all
consistent with the observations that we have had with regards to prior pricing activity and
prior claims activity.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

The next question is from Brian Meredith of UBS.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Good morning. A couple of just quick questions here. First for Joe. I wondered, Joe, do
you have what the spread is between what your reinvestment rate is, which I know you
gave us, and what is maturing in your investment portfolio to give us a sense of what that
looks like?

Page 19 of 22



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2013-07-31

A - Joe Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. It is, as of June 30, Brian, the book yield is 2.58%. Our yield to maturity, the
reinvestment yield is 2.41%. So while we had some challenges in the past with the
portfolio trending down to lower interest rates, the fact that interest rates have risen and
actually we narrowed that gap pretty considerably.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. Then the second question, Albert, I'm curious. We heard from some other of the
kind of leading property cat reinsurance companies that they took advantage of the
attractive retrocessional rating environment right now of prices to improve their portfolio
returns there. It doesn't look like you guys did that. Any reason why?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

One of the things that I mentioned is that we actually started to hedge our reinsurance
portfolio using IOWs and other transactions of that type. And in addition, we have
acquired protection on our aggregate book, on the annual aggregate excess of loss basis
through a cat bond that we priced just yesterday. So we are definitely looking to manage
our overall cat exposures and volatility.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

So we will see that come through in the Third Quarter?

Next we a question from Amit Kumar of Macquarie.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks. And two quick follow-ups. First of all, just going back to the discussion on
individual risk losses in the insurance segment. Did you disclose what the number was in
the opening remarks what that loss, how much did that add up to?

A - Joe Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Page 20 of 22



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2013-07-31

FINAL

No. We did not disclose it. And let me characterize it by saying that last year we had one
risk loss in excess of $10 million in this period, in the current year we had a couple more.
And really if you go back in our history we never really had a period where we had more
than three so this is an unusual situation. We didn't disclose the exact amount but it had a
small impact on, about a 0.7 impact, on our accident-year end loss ratio in insurance.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. That is actually quite helpful. The only other question I have is just going back to the
discussion on the claims activity on the professional liability bucket. Would it possible to
share what the total bucket of claims related to the credit crisis looks like, so that maybe
we can think about it on a relative basis? And -- related to that is -- did something
specifically change in those four claims in this quarter?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I'm not sure that we can sit here and two through the individual one but I think what I can
say is that for the global credit crisis years we did say that we had $234 million of IBNR
related to that.

Bloomberg Transcript

With regards to what happened this quarter, frankly, there were small number of cases
that took a right turn in terms of moving in a direction opposite of how these cases were
developing in the past, including one in which I think the judgment was overturned on
appeal. There is a fair amount of volatility with regards to global financial crisis cases which
is again why we he have always been slow in taking any action on those years because we
were frankly we were expecting noise of this type.
So the favorable activity that we have seen in those years in the past we absolutely didn't
want to respond to because we felt that sooner or later we would get the occasional
surprise. The surprise has happened here and as Joe mentioned, rather than digging to
the IBNR for these cases, we decided to take action and recognize those through the
income statement and keep our IBNR protected for future development.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}
