FINAL

Thank you, Trond, and thank you all for joining us today. Starting on slide number two.
Storebrand delivers a strong result for both second quarter and the ﬁrst half of 2014, with
750 million in the quarterly result and 1.477 billion for the ﬁrst half. There have been strong
equity markets and reduced interest rates during the ﬁrst half, that has given a good
ﬁnancial result in the company portfolios and for the insurance reserves. It has also led to
a proﬁt sharing result of 188 million in our Swedish operation.
I'm very pleased with the good results, but I'm just as pleased with the increase in buﬀer
capital. The buﬀer capital including longevity reserves has increased by 5.8 billion in the
ﬁrst half, (inaudible) increase in 4.5 billion in the second quarter.
These buﬀers are solid and important in a period with low interest rates and a need for
longevity reserves strengthening. Operationally, the transition from guaranteed to nonguaranteed continues. Our guaranteed pensions, fee and administration income is
reduced by 12% from the corresponding quarter last year, and our income on loan has
increased by 13%. The cost reductions are following the plan we have set and is nominally
down by 5.4%, compared to the same quarter last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Lastly, the asset management division is a lot developing positively, and have now passed
500 billion in assets under management, as our corresponding strong development in
income and a strong reduction in costs, that is solid results from the asset management
business.
Moving to slide number three. Lars would give some more insight in the results. I just
want to comment upfront on the development in the fee and administration income. That
shows quite a ﬂat development in the ﬁrst half of 2014 compared to the same period last
year. There is two powerful forces that drives this development. First of all, the
discontinued business with the corporate bank and the public sector, that is in rapid runoﬀ and the income from these areas are declining.
Secondly, we see that shift in the business mix also impacted the top line. Nonguaranteed savings and insurance is growing quite rapidly, while income from
guaranteed pensions is reduced. These eﬀects will continue to aﬀect the fee and
administration income line also going forward.
Let's now turn to slide number four. As usual, this slide introduce our review, our
measures taken in the quarter to transform the business into changed market and
regulatory conditions. Our goal is clear and that is to move the business into Solvency II
without raising new equity capital.
Let's turn into the next slide and look what is going on in the second quarter. We continue
to adopt measures in the business to ensure the right capital realization of the business. I
want to highlight the following action in the second quarter. First, on capital optimization.
There has been a limited transfers from guaranteed to non-guaranteed in the quarter. The
bulk of the transfer in the ﬁrst half was done in the ﬁrst quarter with 7 billion of public
sector funds moving out of Storebrand.

However, we do expect that at least 85 clients with 5 billion in assets will move at the
second half of 2014 out of the guaranteed public sector assets. I'm also delighted to see
that we are managing to pick up speed in the non-guaranteed fee- based part of the
public sector. During the second quarter, we have won two tenders to provide asset
management and close pension funds solutions to two large municipalities in Norway;
Baerum and Tromso, for those over who are familiar with Norwegian municipalities. That
represents 7 billion in assets under management, that will be moved to Storebrand in the
second half and in the ﬁrst quarter next year.
It's also worth to note that the run-oﬀ of Storebrand corporate bank is being implemented
in a good and eﬀective manner. The loan book has been reduced by 36% to last year.
Within risk reduction, I would like to spend time on the segmentation of the paid-up
policy portfolio. We implemented the segmentation at the beginning of the year. This
segmentation is important to reduce shareholder's direct contribution to the longevity
reserve strengthening.

Bloomberg Transcript

It will be further reﬁned, going forward, to implement the conversion to non-guaranteed
paid-up policies with investment choice. With that, we skip slide six and moving to slide
seven. The regulations for longevity reserve strengthening was clariﬁed in this spring.
Storebrand will strengthen the reserves by 12.4 billion over a period of seven years. We
have managed to increase longevity reserves with 2.1 billion in the ﬁrst half of 2014, and
that is without assuming the so-called solidarity.
In the graph, this 2.1 billion is grouped together with the 4.2 billion set aside by year end.
The 4.2 billion will be recalculated during the third quarter as previously communicated
and we expect the number to be reduced by about 500 million when it is arranged for
solidarity.
Other (inaudible) capital is strengthened and our most ﬂexible buﬀer, the market value
adjustment reserve is now on 3.7 billion. On top of this, we have 8.9 billion in our values in
bond held at amortized costs. We have not changed this quarter the assumptions about
owner's share to longevity reserve strengthening, and have charged 90 million directly on
the reserves also this quarter.
Moving down to slide number eight, the Ministry of Finance released regulations
regarding paid-up policies with investment choice on the 27th of June. The content was
as expected. That means, paid-up policies need to be fully reserved for longevity, a
technical 3% rate in the payout phase to even out the payments has allowed it, and there
is rules for customer advice.
We strongly feel this is good news for the paid-up policies customers, which get more
options and possibility to increase the pension by moving to a more long-term asset
allocation.
Storebrand is well prepared and ready to deliver the product during the autumn [ph]. We
bill assets, the cost of propping up the contracts with equity to make it through reserve for

longevity against the positive eﬀect this will have for our customers, for capital release in
the Solvency II, and increased sales on loan guaranteed products.
Then I hand over to you, Lars, to give some comments on the results.

FINAL

Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Then I would like you to move to page 11 with the heading Storebrand Group's strong
investment returns. And I will only comment on this page. Mr. Grefstad has already
commented on the results overall, and I would like to comment a little bit more on the
result per line of business under the same picture.
And the savings, non-guaranteed, you will see that there is a 63% improvement in results
year-on-year from last year. There has been a 26% increase in non-guaranteed reserves
within the pension business unit linked business, driven by good customer returns and
large payments into these reserves and very few payments out of these reserves as a
consequence of that this being a young portfolio. Furthermore, I would like to comment
on premiums, premiums have gone down from the second quarter last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

That is a result of lower one-oﬀ premiums due to us leaving the public sector in the
Swedish market and because of the transition in the way with that more savings-based
unit linked solutions rather than one single payment. The underlying development in the
deﬁned contribution rates in Norway is 14% and 18% in Sweden. So, the underlying
savings continued to grow, but single premiums have gone down, and therefore reduced
the overall premium quarter-on-quarter.
Under the insurance business, the results are more normalized after a very strong ﬁrst
quarter as we commented on certain one-oﬀ eﬀects in the ﬁrst quarter. The results for the
second quarter are strengthened by good ﬁnancial returns, but weakened by reserves
strengthening in certain business lines as a result of a somewhat higher visibility and
deﬁcit in certain product lines, we don't see any trend sets here, but we have increased
provisions by 45 million altogether.
The combined ratio is 90 on an overall basis, but in the P&C business, the pure P&C
business, the combined ratio is 83 and the growth in the P&C business is 11%. In the
guaranteed pension business, the results seem quite stable. However, there is a
weakening of the deﬁned beneﬁt proﬁtability in Norway due to the reduction in
municipalities and the longevity reserve strengthening, but that is compensated for by a
very strong proﬁt sharing in the Swedish market due to high booked return in the
guaranteed portfolio at Sweden at the level of 7% year-to-date, that is giving good proﬁt -split of NOK188 million in the quarter standalone. The level of reserves in the guaranteed
portfolio has gone up by 2% in the quarter, that is a real consequence of higher liabilities
measured in Sweden when you discount by a market rate. So, even at the -- this
guaranteed portfolio is in decline with a lower interest rate discounting factors in Sweden,
the liabilities increased.

Within other, the good results are due to a good ﬁnancial return on company portfolios as
well as lower costs in the holding company. So that basically sums up somewhat more
detailed discussion on the diﬀerent business areas, and I now give the word back to Mr.
Grefstad.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) The ﬁrst question comes from the line of Peter Eliot from
Berenberg. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. I had three questions please, if I may. First one was, we heard from
your main competitor recently that it was increasing some of the risk in its asset portfolios,
but that policies that still need longevity reserving, to that top of the risk-reward proﬁle of
doing that was very attractive. It doesn't look like you're going down at least at the
moment, I wondering whether you, that was something that you might consider and if
not, then perhaps what the, why you might not consider doing that?
And the second question was, given your returns have been very good, the 90 million for
quarter charge, I appreciate it's very early to revisit that. But I'm just wondering at what
point that the marginal diﬀerence going to reduce that quarterly charge in the future?
And then the third thing was on Solvency II, I mean, I appreciate it's very diﬃcult to be
scientiﬁc. But you referenced a reduction which obviously isn't surprised at all given the
drop in interest rates, and but I was just wondering whether you can give any sort of
qualitative feeling about at what level (Technical Diﬃculty) remain very comfortable of not
needing or what level you might still start to think about transition rules. So, is there any
comment you can give in that sort of area? Thanks very much.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. If I start answering the ﬁrst question about the risk proﬁle, if you looked
at slide number ﬁve, you will see that we have done actually already for the start of the
year, a segmentation of the paid-up policy portfolio, and that is very much to make sure
that we have the right risk proﬁle in the diﬀerent brand areas and especially based on the
longevity reservation in the diﬀerent sub portfolios.

FINAL

We have also looked very closely into, of course, our competitor's asset mix. We see that
we have a very comparable asset mix to our competitors, there might be some changes,
diﬀerences in expected return on the diﬀerent asset classes. But overall, I think you can
see that research strategy of DNB and Storebrand by the way is very much the same on
this area. And we do -- as we always have do look forward to have as good and even
better return than DNB going forward.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Could I just come back on that very quickly. Actually it's just my understanding of the slide
ﬁve is that, it's the business with the lower buﬀers, that has the lower equity proportion,
whereas they seem to be doing something a bit the opposite, maybe I misunderstood
that. But--

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

No, this based on very much as we did by the start of the year. We saw that the life, the
increased life length would come in place. And based on that, we actually made these
portfolios and also focused on having more risk capacity on the portfolios with the need
for the highest reservation based on the fact that we have a better risk reward for
shareholders in that portfolio.
And that is an ongoing process, and it will be reﬁned also now for getting as much speed
as possible into the market of our investment choice products going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

On the second question, Peter, whether we will revisit the 90 million. At the end of the
year, we will know how much we'll set aside this year, we will know how the paid-up policy
with investment choice market has started, and we will now expect that return next year.
At that time it makes sense to revisit whether the 90 million should continue. I don't
envisage that we will change it on a quarterly basis if nothing very large happen in
between. So, if that's okay, does that answer your question?

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you.

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

And with respect to the Solvency II sensitivity, we can only refer to the embedded value
reports and so on where you will see some on the economic value sensitivity to interest
rates. And we are not changing any of our plans in terms of being able to go into that
Solvency II regime without having to raise new equity as a result of the lower interest rate
at this stage.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thanks very much.

Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of David Andrich from Morgan
Stanley. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - David Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon. Two questions on my side. First, I was just wondering if you could
maybe comment on the competitive environment in the DC market in Norway and in
particular, when it comes to the risk products and the disability embedded within it,
whether you're able to charge adequate amount to cover that risk?
And then second of all, just in terms of it sounds like it was about 29 billion or so in the
paid-up portfolios where you think like there is a reasonable likelihood that the portion
that would switchover. I was just wondering what kind of timeline do you see that
happening over particularly with the longevity reserving that would have to be done,
whether you would try and push that a little bit faster or take it more evenly or if you could
just comment on that? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yeah. If I start with the environmental business in Norway, we don't see any large changes
in the competitive environment I would say, it's quite stable. It's been -- of course, I've
seen in all parts of the concentrated markets, especially for large corporates in Norway,
we have over 30% to 31% market share in deﬁned contribution in Norway. Then it's of
course, other areas for some of the risk products, where there are much more competition
and more players in the markets. And that of course, has also been a situation for quite a
long time. So, that the basic question is that there is no change in that environment
compared to what we have commented on the last quarter (Technical Diﬃculty).

Q - David Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

When it comes to the paid-up policy market of course, it's, I think we are all very eager to
see how that develops, it's a new market, it's a lot of individual choices by individual
customers, and the Storebrand has around 500,000 customers in this area. And we are
very much prepared, and we feel that when you look at the media, that is quite concerned
about this in Norway these days, and also the expert is talking about this, it's a positive
expectation around the product.
I think everyone now understand that it's not a very good way of doing long-term and
managing of the long-term assets by having it in a portfolio that is focused on having
short one-year goals and it leads to a situation where long-term, very much of our
customers will have a much higher pension by moving into investment choice.

Date: 2014-07-16

FINAL

And on your direct question, it's very hard to say how fast and how much of this market as
we speak, we will be able to move. But on your question, I will say that we are prepared to
use equity to make sure that some of the customers that want to move from today's paidup policies into investment choice, had the opportunity to move into investment choice
even if they are not fully reserved for longevity.

Q - David Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank.
Please go ahead.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, good afternoon. It's Matti here from Danske. Three questions if I may. Firstly, Lars you
mentioned that 45 million was increased, the reserves were increased by 45 million in the
insurance business area in the second quarter. Can we expect that these reserve increases
will continue or was this more of a one-oﬀ eﬀect so that kind of the normal run rate would
be 45 million or higher than we saw during the quarter.
The second question is on the SPP unit linked margins, we saw a fairly signiﬁcant increase
but -- on the reserves, but the margins were down. If you could comment, what was the
reason for that? And then on this page number eight on the paid-up policies, 29 billion
that you discussed, how much of the 29 billion is currently fully reserved for longevity?
Thanks.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

On the ﬁrst question on the insurance reserves, we've basically done three minor reserves
strengthening as a consequence of adjustments in three diﬀerent portfolios and we are
not planning as a consequence of the results we've seen so far in the second quarter to
do anything further in any of the business lines. So, these are only regular adjustments in
three diﬀerent portfolios and there is no expectation to do anything more to start at this
stage.

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

I think the second part of your question was about margin in SPP, I think to answer on that
is more about cost allocation internally, it's not about really the price we are able to take
to our customers, that is sustainable from quarter to quarter.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

I will ask a question on out of those 29 billion which we have said, have a good value
proposition to the transparent investment choices 3 billion is currently is now fully
reserved.

Thank you. And we currently have one ﬁnal question from the line of Daniel Do-Thoi from
JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Q - Daniel Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon. Daniel Do-Thoi from JPMorgan. I have two questions. The ﬁrst one is
on deﬁned beneﬁt and the decline in the fee income margin here, I mean I appreciate
that some of the margin contraction is related to mix eﬀect with the public, and that has
been transferred out, but the decline nevertheless seems to be a bit higher than my
anticipated. So, I mean, if you could just comment on whether there any of the factors
here.
And secondly, you've mentioned this 7 billion in closed pension fund solutions from
municipalities. I was just wondering, if you could talk about perhaps the business
opportunity from taking on additional closed funds going forward. I mean, how big is the
market here and also what is a potential impact on your ﬁnancials? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

If I answer the ﬁrst question, on the deﬁned beneﬁt margins in Norway, they are stable
and if you the fall in revenues is generated as a consequence of the fact that
municipalities have moved as you said, and also as a factor of companies closing the
deﬁned beneﬁt plans. In addition, there is a periodic eﬀect where we had slightly too
much revenue generated from the counterpoint of view in the ﬁrst quarter and slightly
less in the second quarter, but the year-to-date numbers are more accurate than the
quarterly numbers in this context.

Q - Daniel Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Okay. When it comes to closed pension funds, I would say the market is, it's a large
market actually, and we see it's more in a starting point for the large municipalities to start
to up and up the closed pension funds. And especially in this situation, both Storebrand
and DNB who was the only competitors to KLP in the public sector markets.
We see that now a lot of public sector clients only have one solution to it, they like to have
a guaranteed business with our insurance company and as such and that is moving into
KLP and that also open up for the opportunity to both reduced cost and more ﬂexibility
and move into closed pension funds.

FINAL

So, I would say that, this is a growing market, this is a very interesting market. And we also
see that there will be and we are in tender oﬀerings with much municipalities as we speak,
that will be closed during this autumn. So, it's an interesting market for us.
When it comes to the margin, of course, it's, well ﬁrst of all, we have the results directly by
managing this, but on top of that we also have margin in asset management by managing
these assets is of course, margin that you see in the market today when it comes to this
kind of a level sole assets under management, but then again, it is almost zero cost by
taking on additional assets in asset management. So this, in that respect gives very good
results to the company.

Q - Daniel Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay. But so if I were to look at for example, revenue margins in isolation, would it be a
fair assumption for example, to take the 7 billion and assume your current average
revenue margin of something like 15, 16 basis points within the asset management
business or would it be considerably higher or lower than that?

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

I think that a lot of this of course would be interest rate instruments. But it's around the 15,
16 basis points, that should be a ballpark.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Daniel Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. And can I just follow up on a previous question that was asked? And that
was on the paid-up policy transfers with 3 billion of the 29 billion being fully reserved at
present. What -- of the remaining 26 billion then, what proportion of that is close enough
to being fully reserved that you would be happy to facilitate conversion by contributing
intra-holder funds [ph]?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Well, this has all to do with also the segmentation we're dealing in the portfolios these
days. And we prepared for making a portfolio that is sustainable to start working with.
And of course, we will use our sales force, we will use our marketing eﬀort directly on the
customers that has the, what we call like the green, the greenest value proposition. That
means that they have most to gain from moving into investment choice in combination
with also limited use of equity to move into investment choice.
And, what we have been working with is the portfolio of around 10 billion, that should be
available and ﬁrst goal to be able to move into that kind of a portfolio. And of course,
going forward, as we are increased our reservation and as we have improved the ﬁrst
portfolio, it will be ﬁlled up with new customers and values of course. So, that is our sales
direct. But we also expect of course some clients even if we are not doing direct
marketing to them to contact us to move from today's paid-up policies into investment
choice. And we are prepared to let also these people move into investment choice, but of
course we'd probably need to solve some of the use of equity going forward.

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

Yes, hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two today. The ﬁrst one will be on debt.
From what I can see you have one instrument maturing previously, and are you planning
to reﬁnance this? And also if you do, to what extend you are able to use additional debt to
better your current solvency position? And the other one would be on MCV and
sensitivities. Can you give us an idea of how your sensitivities have moved post the
solidarity announcement, I would expect that actually your sensitivity to down [ph], or to
move to interest rates would have increased. Am I correct in this assumption? Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

I would answer your question, Paris. Yes you're right. (Technical Diﬃculty), the interest
rates are down usually also increased interest rates of the business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

Okay. And do you have an idea of how much that is or can you tell us how much of this in
real [ph] terms?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

I don't have any updated embedded value in calculation, it's something new. So, I don't
declare, I should go (Technical Diﬃculty) move into after doing a proper calculation, but I
think it's just say that if that has probably increased by how much, I don't think I should
answer it.

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

When it comes to the debt reﬁnancing, we have reﬁnanced all of the subordinated debt
for this year, this summer, where else on -- that the only company is more new in late
autumn that will be reﬁnanced. And then there is another 1 billion of subordinated debt in
that company next summer, which we are of course planning and in the process of
replacing with another subordinated debt (Technical Diﬃculty) ﬁnding it right.

FINAL

When it comes to the capacity of our solvency, I mean we do have room for more capacity
on the Solvency I and we would have even more room for more subordinated debts on
the Solvency II and during the last three to ﬁve years, the equity of the group has been
growing. So, the relative portion of the debt is lower, and will -- the solvency, the
optimization to what Solvency II will be -- will also include considerations of what's the
right mix.
