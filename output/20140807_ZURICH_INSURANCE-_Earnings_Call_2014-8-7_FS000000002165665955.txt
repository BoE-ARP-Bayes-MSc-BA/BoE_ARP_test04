MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen good morning or good afternoon. Welcome to the Zurich
Insurance Group Half-Year Results 2014 Analyst And Media Conference Call. I'm
Stephanie, the Chorus Call operator. I would like to remind you that all participants will be
in-listen only mode and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there
will be a Q&A session.
The conference must not be recorded for publication or broadcast. At this time, it's my
pleasure to hand over to Mr. James Quin. Please go ahead, sir.

James Quin

{BIO 18345789 <GO>}

Thank you and welcome to Zurich Insurance Group's results presentation for the second
quarter of 2014. I'm joined by our CEO, Martin Senn and our CFO, George Quinn. Martin

and George will make a few short comments before we open the Q&A. As usual please
keep to two questions.
I'll now hand it over to Martin.

FINAL

Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

Thank you, James. And welcome to everyone on the call also on my behalf. And let me
make a few introductory comments. As you have seen from the results we published this
morning that we have made a good start to 2014. Business operating proﬁt of $2.6 billion
for the ﬁrst six months is 15% higher than in the prior period and the BOP of $1.2 billion for
the quarter is 32% above the period last year.
And we're also on track against each of our three key targets. We have also made good
progress in terms of executing what we set out at Investor Day. We have largely
completed the streamlining of the group above the business unit level, have taken actions
in a number of our turnaround or exit operations and we have completed much of the
preparation for future investment in priority markets.

Bloomberg Transcript

That said, this is just the start, and there is a lot we still need to do to achieve the three key
targets we set out for 2014 to 2016, particularly with respect to improving our business
operating proﬁt after-tax return on equity.
In terms of next steps, we plan to provide a half day investor update on December 5.
We're going to do that in London. And we'll give full Investor Day updates on May 21,
that's going to be then May 21, obviously 2015, that's going to be then in Zurich.
And with that, it will now hand over to George. Thank you very much.

George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Martin. And good afternoon or good morning to everyone on the phone. I'll
make a few short introductory remarks on the results. First, in General Insurance, we've
reported a good combined ratio of 95.7% for the second quarter and just a reminder, this
is on the new basis including expenses that were previously shown within the nontechnical results. On the old basis, the combined ratio would have been 93.1% for the
second quarter.
We're particularly pleased with the accident year ex-cat combined ratio, which was 3
points better than in Q1 and 4 points better than in Q2, 2013.
If you look more broadly at the ﬁrst half of 2014 and compare it to the ﬁrst half of last year,
we see good improvement in the large loss experience as well as a roughly 1.5
percentage point improvement in the underlying loss ratio. As you've seen from
presentation, the level of rate increases that we achieved in Q2 has slowed compared to

Page 2 of 22



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2014-08-07

what you've seen in prior quarters. And I think that's consistent with what you've heard
from the rest of the market.

FINAL

In addition, as you've also heard from peers, this is the consequence of the fact that most
of our business is priced at levels that we would regard as adequate. Nonetheless,
irrespective of this trend, we need to continue to improve our accident year proﬁtability
and there are number of ways in which we intend to do that.
And speciﬁcally we continue to achieve rate increases in those classes of businesses
where we're not compensated for risk that we run and we're starting to see better results
in some of the turnaround businesses, but we need to improve our own performance.
In relation to the Life business, we've had a solid start to the year. The main change, and
you'll see in the results, is the introduction of source of earnings reporting. We've also
published an in-depth brieﬁng document which explains the numbers and the trends and
hopefully this will have addressed some of perhaps your more detailed questions.

Bloomberg Transcript

At Farmers, we've seen another quarter of encouraging development in the top-line,
although GWP was still down around 1% overall, we saw growth in our core business in
terms of both premiums and policies in-force. And we're also showing you additional
metrics around NPS, numbers of agents, new business and retention, and I'm pleased to
say that these are all pointing in the right direction.
We've also given you a forecast for expected full year cash remittances that we expect to
be in excess of $3.5 billion. We're also pleased with this number, but it does include some
one-oﬀs, so it's important that you don't extrapolate it over the entire plan cycle.
We've also updated the free capital generation analysis that we ﬁrst showed at the
Investor Day. And this conﬁrms what we said back in December and once again proves
that we're a very cash generative business.
To summarize, as you've heard from Martin, we see this as a good set of results with
encouraging progress across the group. Having said this, we all recognize that there's a
lot more to do and this will be our focus for the next 30 months. The targets are our top
priority. We expect to make investments to support future growth, but at the same time,
we won't hesitate to take capital from businesses that cannot meet our expectations.
Finally, we intend to take full advantage of our operating leverage to grow operating
earnings.
With that, I now look forward to your questions.

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. First question from Mr. Paul De'Ath
from RBC. Please go head, sir.

FINAL

Q - Paul C. De'Ath
Yeah, hi there, and good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of
questions, please. Firstly on the $3.5 billion cash guidance for 2014. And you obviously
mentioned that there are some one-oﬀs in that, is there any chance you can give us any
idea of the quantum of those one-oﬀs? And I guess it is fair to assume from your
comments that the three-year cumulative total is likely to be closer to $9 billion than $3.5
billion annual would imply. And – that's question one.
Question two, just on the new common customers between Global Corporate and
Corporate Life & Pensions over 2014. And how many new common customers have you
signed up so far? I mean, you say you're making good progress, so is that roughly half of
the 100 customers. And just on that, what's the mix of customers, is this mainly adding Life
customers to existing non-Life relationships or the other way around or are these new new
customers that you're adding? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On the ﬁrst one, yeah, I want to avoid that, trying to set expectations for three years
beyond what we've given at the Investor Day in December. I think on the ﬁgures you've
had today, the $3.5 million, we've got small amount of one-oﬀs. We see a run rate
underlying though that is higher than we would have anticipated given the $9 billion
guidance for the three years. So there is some of the excess that was seen this year is
additional cash that we've extracted that we would hope to repeat, but some of this is
clearly one-oﬀ. I'm not going to give precise detail on the one-oﬀ elements because it's a
forecast for the year.
I think on the other comment, would it be closer to $9 billion rather than the implied $10.5
million. I mean given what we said on the one-oﬀ, I think you have to assume that it'll be
closer to $9 billion rather than $10.5 billion.
On the customers for Global Corporate and CLP, the cross-sell were about 70 customers.
And I guess we're mainly adding Life to existing Global Corporate relationships rather
than bringing in new relationships.

Q - Paul C. De'Ath
Okay, great. Thanks.

Hi there. Two questions. First of all, thanks for the new disclosure on which are the priority
and non-priority markets in non-Life. But just on that, do you think you can still improve
the accident year performance in the priority markets? Clearly, there's less tailwind from
rates. I know that you're seeking to improve performance in the non-priority or manage
for value businesses. But in the priority markets, I'm thinking speciﬁcally U.S. particularly,
do you think you can improve that given the rate environment? And maybe, within that, I
know there were some speciﬁc initiatives in U.S. commercial on workers' comp and
commercial auto, I don't know if you've got any updates on that, would be helpful.
And second question, on Farmers, useful slide on new business policy count growth. How
do we translate that into when that would move into overall positive PIF growth at
Farmers? I'm thinking sequential positive PIF growth. Thanks.

A - Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

(10:50) will take ﬁrst question then hand over to George. Sorry, it was Andrew. Now, with
regards to the competitive environment. I think we have the right strategy in place and we
are executing it by duly investing in our priority markets where we think we have
distinctive positions. And if we take the half-year comparison last year versus this year, we
were able to grow in our priority markets by 3% in local currency. So that's pretty
encouraging.
If I break that down to the segments, thinking of Global Corporate, we have here
deﬁnitely a clear competitive advantage through our risk insight, through risk engineering
approach. I think that's a think that's a relatively high entry barrier relative to at least many
of our competitors in the space. The superior claim service and also our well established
relationship model.
Then Paul asked the question before asking about new customer achievements. I was in
Mexico about two-and-a-half months ago and at that time we had three Global Corporate
customers, Mexican based companies. The folks down there told me in three years we're
going to have 30. I said, well, put your hand on your heart. Is it 30? And they said yes.
Today, we have 12. The point I want to make here really is as the world keeps
interconnecting and globalizing and there is more customer sort of in new markets going
global, they cannot then rely anymore on the local carrier, that's where we also have
deﬁnitely a good advantage in that segment.
So back to your question, where is the conﬁdence for us to be able to continue growing,
even though the market becomes more competitive. And just the last example is North
America Commercial, we're executing on our strategic growth initiatives, we make
investments in data analytics. Many of you already have seen about two years ago when
we brought some of the investors and analysts to the U.S. where we were there. We have
made signiﬁcant progress again on the back of our analytical capabilities. And particularly
there we have profound strengths in some of the ﬁelds, construction, technology,
healthcare. Keep in mind, we are the number one writer of construction risk in the U.S.,
number three writer of surety. That's a very strong base to start working on, and we
continue having the conﬁdence even in more competitive environment for us to be able
to be grow in those segments and customer areas proﬁtably.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Then if I take the second question on Farmers, so I guess you heard on the video, we're
still down in the quarter on the policy count, but I guess if we focus in on the piece that
we would regard as more core. So excluding the non-exclusive – or the independent
agent, business insurance and standard auto, we've seen a rise of some 25,000. I think –
actually, Andrew, if you look at the report card that was in Martin's presentation, I think
that actually gives you a better sense of where things are headed because you have a
longer history on that page. And I think those metrics are in many ways just as important
as the policy count.
Obviously, we look at Farmers month-to-month. The trends we see are still improving, but
we have to punch through that zero line. I mean, you've seen a sequential improvement
of 4% there in Q4 last year, 2% in Q1 and 1% in Q2. We cannot be very far away from the
point at which we see some positive growth in Farmers. I'm trying to resist the temptation
to make a forecast.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Just my ﬁrst question wasn't actually on growth, It was on the margin in priority markets in
non-Life, the accident year margin. I guess I know you were trying to focus on improving
the accident year in the turnaround businesses, but I just want to know if there's any – if
you think you can improve it in the priority market?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

May be I can add. I think some of the things that Martin pointed to around the
investments we made in technology are not simply about growth, it was about trying to
be – use our customer segmentation to target parts of the market that we believe are
actually more proﬁtable for us than to try and manage the broker relationships in a way
that we see more of the business that we think would be in our sweet spot. And I think
Martin's comments may be focused on growth, but I think it's equally valid for the bottom
line as well.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay, thanks.

Next question from Vinit Malhotra, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. My ﬁrst question was actually on the (15:40), but I think it's
been addressed fairly comprehensively, so I'll just move to the second topic. In the video,
there's also a comment on evaluating options in Global Life, whereas our understanding
from the Investor Day was that it's more internal oriented. But is this new comment
designed to communicate that there are other options as well or is it more to say that
there's more of internal measures that you're also thinking?

And just to conﬁrm, I will use my second chance here. Just to conﬁrm that all these
analytics investment does it also give you a portfolio mix control which should oﬀset some
of the pricing pressure, just if you could reconﬁrm that, it would be very kind? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

Let me start on the question with regards to more structural options on Global Life. Now,
we are still in the process, of course, of looking at all options one has and that is not
limited to the usual options, but when we say structural, that means also potential
disposal of businesses or portfolios, it would include reinsurance, securitization and any of
the capital action of, you really referred to the capital side of equation. But let me also
stress, there is a reason why these are three-year targets, i.e. one needs to take timing
doing that. We are not in need of raising capital. We are clearly not under any pressure to
pursue any of this action at any price and we want to do that in a very balanced economic
sensible way and that what is the approach we're taking here, maybe George, you want to
add to that or?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Well, that's a complete answer.

A - Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

Okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Maybe I'll take the analytics?

A - Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I'll start with that. So on the analytics side, Vinit, I think there is a portfolio mix element if I
guess we're more focused on the customer side of it, so we're looking for those parts of
the customer map where we think our oﬀering is most attractive and where we can
generate the highest returns. So there is a portfolio mix element to it.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Nice. Thank you, George. Thank you, Martin.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi there. Thanks for taking my question. My ﬁrst question is on the Z-ECM. You've
commented that you're going to come back closer towards the 120% because of your
reinvestment in riskier assets. I was wondering, you still have a margin, what are your
other priorities for using that excess risk capital and where would you ideally like that to
be? That's question one. And question two was just, I mean you gave a – you're talking
about improving underlying accident year, but on the 1.5% of underlying loss
improvement that you've achieved in these results, how much of that is just a decent
quarter because of the large loss experience? How much of that can we start
extrapolating? Thank you.

A - Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Start with the ﬁrst question. Now, the Z-ECM, how we look at our capital base is obviously
that is our ambition to have a AA rating, and that translates back into a 100% to 100% (sic)
[100% to 120%] (19:21) range. And the economic capital models, as you all do know, they
can be very volatile and very volatile from quarter-to-quarter, and that's the reason why we
deal with this range. We consider the excess capital to be indicated by the ratio, well in
excess of this range for a extended period of time. And while the ratio has now been
above that target for the last few quarters, it is also to be recognized that that's been
mainly due to model changes.
Now, with the additional risk taking throughout the ﬁrst half in Q1, we have reported there
was an impact on Z-ECM of 4 points. With action and the deployment of capital into
investment management in the second quarter, we expect a further reduction of that of 3
points to 5 points. This is still bringing the Z-ECM then slightly above the top of the
current target range.
What is very important to stress again here is that in terms of our priorities for capital
deployment, ﬁrst comes the dividend; second, the growth of the business; and then third,
if you cannot use the capital in the business then obviously, you'll have to ﬁnd sensible
ways to return this capital to shareholders in a very eﬀective manner. And that's how we
do look at Z-ECM. I'm sure later on, there might be a question in terms of what speciﬁc
risks we have taken, but I'll leave that for the time being.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On the second point, on the improving underlying accident year loss ratio. Again, to look
back at maybe half one half to try and get a more stable view of what's taking place. Our
view is that of the total improvement that we see, we would estimate, it is an estimate
because it's not a precise mathematical science and we have about one percentage point
improvement from good luck on large losses, and we see the remaining 1.5% is at the
actual underlying rate improvement. So depending on how bullish you are, you can
extrapolate it straightaway or you can give another quarter or two quarters to see further
evidence if it sticks. But I mean, we have no reason to believe that the 1.5% is not a
sustainable improvement.

Q - Atanasio Pantarrotas

{BIO 5933123 <GO>}

Yes, thank you for taking my question. First of all, thank you also to provide more visibility
on your life business with new data. I have two question. First one is on GI investments,
you just mentioned that you would like to take some more risk on the investment side. If
you can provide some more color on this, or these new investments in the liquidity
instruments and what could be the impact on G&I running yield in the next couple of
years?
The second question on your German Life business. I remember there was some options
in place to apportion to defend the portfolio by low interest rates environment. I would
like to know if you can provide some color on what could be the evolution on this part of
the portfolio, if it is a totally closed – the originals part of the (22:57) business totally
closed to new contracts? And what could be the evolution in the next future provided that
interest rates will remain as low as they are? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

Let me start with the ﬁrst question, the investment action we have taken to date. I should
mention here as well that we have ﬁnalized in Q2 the deployment of additional risk capital
into investment. What we speciﬁcally have done is to increase the asset allocation by
about $2.5 billion in equities. That brings the current exposure in equity to 4.8% from
before that 3.8%, so it's about one percentage move. In absolute numbers, at current FX
rates, it's from $8.2 billion to $10.5 billion equity composition.
The other major initiative on risk deployment was an increase in our credit exposure from
40%, i.e. $85 billion to 41%, i.e. $90 billion, that's also been completed at the end of Q2.
And the impact on that with regards to business operating proﬁts means, you got to
understand, there are obviously some moving parts to that given market movements. It's
the timing of it, there are some tactical considerations against that. But if you take this sort
of limiting factors in the analysis into consideration, you should expect an additional $60
million to $75 million of net investment income coming through this year, this is before
policyholder allocation.

Q - Atanasio Pantarrotas

Next question from Mr. Michael Huttner of JPMorgan. Please proceed

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

(25:24) Thank you so much. So on the $3.5 billion, how much – you sound very certain, but
we're not at the event obviously. How much of that's have you already received or have
your subsidiaries already kind of said they will do, how much of that is actually certain
already?
And then the other question is on the combined ratio. I noticed that there's $40 million of
expenses in other operating business, which might normally belong to GI and I just
wondered what was the impact in your 1.5% underlying improvement? I'm sure you
reﬂected that, but just a concern. And then it sounds as if now reserve releases are
completely out of the picture, the zero numbers is the new normal. Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah, Michael, I'm going to have a go at these and Martin can – so how certain are we on
the $3.5 billion, how much have we had already? I mean, I think you can hear from the
conﬁdence in our voice that we've had a very large proportion of the $3.5 billion already
and you'd expect that, I mean given the way that dividends ﬂow, so these things are going
to be typically front-end loaded. But I think it's more important to focus on what we'll
generate for the full year. So we've given this guidance, more than $3.5 billion. We're
highly conﬁdent, but of course things can change. But we've got a very large proportion
of the cash already.
On the improvements, as I mean, well-spotted, you're right, we have this ﬂipped between
OOB and both – in fact all three of the segments in the quarter. For GI, the 1.5 point
Page 10 of 22



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2014-08-07

improvement that I talked about earlier is a loss ratio improvement, so of course that
expense impact has no impact on that number. And your last question was PYD, Michael?

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, please.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So I guess – I mean obviously, we've guidance of 1% to 2%, and you see 0% in the quarter,
so does it have an impact on us? But I guess, we're trying not to be complacent. We've
looked extremely carefully at what drives it. I mean we can pick a number of very large,
including one extremely late reported claim, which is signiﬁcant for us. And of course, if I
exclude those, you'll ﬁnd we're in a 1% to 2% range. And I guess the key question is do we
see things in those losses that would give us concerns that these would be something that
would continue over signiﬁcant periods and we conclude. I mean, while there's always the
risk of further development, we don't see these being systemic issues into future quarters,
so we're conﬁdent in the 1% to 2%.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Yes, good afternoon. Two questions from my side. First one on the cost savings, the $250
million. Could you perhaps give us any indication of how it will break down by division
and how much you expect to be reinvested? And secondly, if I may come back to the

Page 11 of 22



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2014-08-07

comment you made at the December Investor Day on the 12% to 14% operating ROE
target, you said you would be disappointed if you only achieve the lower end of this
range at the end of the period. So I just wanted to hear about whether you're conﬁdent
that the high end is in reach without making strong assumptions on the macro side?

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So if I take the ﬁrst one, I think Martin will take second. On the cost savings, to highlight
something I mentioned in the video already, it will mainly fall to the divisions because it'll
impact the recharges that are made. I don't have the precise split yet of where it's all
going to fall, so I can't give you very precise guidance. But given that GI is the largest
business, I expect more of it to fall there. But I guess in due course, we'll give you more
clarity on where that's going to fall. I think you had a second point on the cost saving
which I forgot, Niccolo.

Bloomberg Transcript

I mean, I think it depends on the opportunities we see. If we're seeing very attractive
opportunities to deploy capital that requires expense support then we're absolutely going
to do it. So it depends on what Mike, Kristof, Geoﬀ and rest of the team bring to us. I
mean, we would be prepared to reinvest all of it if the economics make sense. But we'll
see in the future as opportunities emerge.

A - Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

On the ﬁrst part, Niccolo, the point we made at Investor Day, that's still valid, deﬁnitely so.
And with the BOPAT ROE number we have shown now 12.5% that shows and indicates
that we are in our target range. But we also made the point that, George and I, that this is
a good start, but there is still much more to do. And the key component is to put through
action to keep moving this business operating proﬁt after tax return on the equity
upwards. And that's the core of our strategic initiatives.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Very clear. Thanks.

Next question from Andy Broadﬁeld from Barclays. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Andy D. Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. Just one quick question on the capital management side of things.
As we look at the – you've talked a little bit cryptically about the ECM model being at
128% and that you want to maintain some buﬀer because of volatility. But I guess the
question that will increasingly emerge is will you consider other actions to maintain that or

Page 12 of 22

to keep that to the range of the 100% to 120%, such as buybacks, or are we just nowhere
near thinking about that sort of thing at this stage?

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Apologies, Andy, if we were cryptic. I think just to repeat what Martin said on priorities. So
number one dividends; number two, business growth where it meets the hurdle
requirements that we have. And then number three, if we have access that we can deploy,
I mean just to repeat, we'll look for the most eﬃcient way to return it to shareholders. I
think in terms of timing, we're not ready today to give guidance on when that's going to
be. I mean, I think it's a bit like the – it's a bit like Niccolo's question on the expenses. We
want to see what the businesses have as possible growth options. I mean, some of those
will extend more than one year ahead of us. I mean once we've had a chance to evaluate
them then we can make a decision about what the best deployment of the excess capital
is going to be. But I means we can't answer that question today.

Q - Andy D. Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

But do you have a numerical framework that we should be thinking about, accepting that
you might use 8 percentage points for some transaction? But sitting above 120%, is that
generally a level that you're prepared to sit at for some time or will you get tired of that
pretty quickly and want to bring it back down to the 120% region?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

The target range is 100% to 120%, so I mean ordinarily we look to operate around the
middle of that range, I mean it'll partly depend on what our outlook is. And I think if we
think we're in uncertain times, we'll let the thing rise to the top end of the range. I guess, if
we're more bullish and we have more growth opportunities we'll let it shrink slightly or fall
slightly to the lower end of the range, but we want to be in that range.

Q - Andy D. Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

Next question from Stefan Schürmann, Bank Vontobel. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Stefan Schürmann
Yes. Good afternoon. Just two questions. The ﬁrst, on non-Life, I saw that your retention
was increasing to, I think, roughly 86%. Is that a trend that will go on? And can you maybe
more speciﬁcally say if that is special lines of business or across the board? And the
second one is on duration gap. Can you give some update here on the duration gap in
Life and non-Life in the view of your investment rebalancing, if there is any change here?

FINAL

Stefan, I'm going to take the ﬁrst question on retention, you may have to repeat the
second question because we were just debating what the ﬁrst question really meant while
you were speaking the second part. On the ﬁrst one, we don't really see a signiﬁcant
change in retention for non-Life. There's certainly a change in retention for Farmers, I
mean that certainly improved and that's a positive sign for future across GI. I don't think
we see signiﬁcant deviation.

Q - Stefan Schürmann
Okay, yeah.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So can I ask you to repeat the second question. Sorry.

Q - Stefan Schürmann
Yeah, the second question is just on the duration gap, if there's any change here in the
Life and non-Life segments from your investment rebalancing?

A - Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No, there isn't actually, same duration. As you know as the principle, we try obviously to
match durations and if anything then it has slightly lengthened, but very much
unchanged, weighted, I think at 5.9 years, 3.5 years on the General Insurance and
somewhere around – to give the exact numbers we can deliver, but somewhere around 7
years, 7.5 years for Life.

Q - Stefan Schürmann
Okay. So no changes?

A - Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

Yeah, no change.

Next question from Thomas Seidl, Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. First question, on the P&C expense ratio, it seems a bit
higher than expected, and given the typically lower expense ratio in the second quarter, I
wonder what the mid-range run rate is on this new basis expense ratio that you're
disclosing. Should we hence expect it to be higher than the 29.7% shown today?
And secondly, on the investor day, I think, I remember you told us that Farmers, one of the
strategies they have is they want to grow the conﬁdent planner segment, and I wonder if

Page 14 of 22



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG

you can give us an update what actions have been done and what the success has been
on those actions to-date?

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thomas, on the ﬁrst one, I'd point you to the comments on the video. So the 50 basis
points, we think is the one-oﬀ beneﬁt that we have. So if you adjust for that, that'll give
you a sense of all things being equal where we go. And I'd also point to – I mean what I
discussed earlier with Niccolo that I think we've opened the possibility that we are
prepared to let it rise, if we think that's a smart investment for the future. But certainly on a
running basis the 50 basis points is the best guidance that we can give you. Can you
repeat the Farmers question again?

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

The Farmers was just going back to the Investor Day where I think you've told us that the
strategy to turnaround the growth was you want to grow not in the price sensitive
segment, but in the conﬁdent planner segment. I wonder what actions Farmers has really
taken year-to-date and what the impact was of those actions? In other words, do we see
impact from this strategy?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

Hi Thomas, this is Martin. Yes, deﬁnitely, we do see impact and actually the initial action
we took was the re-pricing on the more price sensitive segments, which are very cost
conscious representation of the customers, which we are pricing out. That's part of the
decline in GWP we have seen last year, along that side as well somewhat an improvement
in the combined ratio. We continue pushing that, particularly the conﬁdent planner
segment. Keep in mind this is 17% of all U.S. households we are focusing on. We have
some good early indication in terms of the receptiveness of this prioritization through the
agency channel.
On the back of that also commenting is that we keep growing agents that's why we're
mentioning this time, there is some correlation to that that this is a segment which needs
higher maintenance and that goes in line. There has been some investments which starts
coming through with regards to the billing procedures and the way the customers do
receive then their respective statements. You get one statement no matter what policy you
buy as a retail customer. That's been a very important part of improving the service to the
customer. There's also been a renewal on the web and particularly as well on the web
accessible for speciﬁc customers only through password protections.
So that's a series of action which is starting to ﬂow through, but it's deﬁnitely supporting
the targeting and the validation of Farmers' consumer strategy to the segment of
conﬁdent planners.

Next question from Marcus Rivaldi from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.

FINAL

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Hi good afternoon everybody. Two quick questions from me. First on the cash, if you are
far that ahead of your expectations or sorry the $3 billion run rate, what are you planning
to do with that excess cash? And then secondly just on – a quick question on the UK, the
combined operating ratio – combined ration there is 88%, an exceptional performance
there, very tough market. Could you give some sort of color as to what's driving that
performance? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Marcus, on the ﬁrst one, I guess, I can only point to what we said earlier as to the – I mean
the cash is really – demonstrating our ability to turn the earnings into cash and bring it
through the group to a place where we have freedom to choose what we do with it. And I
mean, I'd point to the priorities we mentioned earlier that our priorities are, number one,
dividend; two, business growth; and then three, if we still have excess and excess
determined by the target capital levels, going back to Andy's question, we would look to
return it to shareholders in the most eﬃcient form possible.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the UK, the real driver is PYD, that's why you're seeing a combined ratio that's, I guess,
slightly abnormally low.

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Thank you. Just on the cash ﬂows, coming back to that, given that I guess you're also
guiding that perhaps over the three year it's still closer to the $9 billion is where you're
really thinking, I guess this should be read that this just gives you more comfort that can
be achieved and ultimately gives greater comfort over the dividend at the current level.
Would that be the best way to think about it?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. I think that's not a bad way to think about it.

Next question from Andrew Ritchie, Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hello. Hi there. Sorry, just a follow-up question. Could you just talk about claims trends on
the P&C side? I'm more interested really in the spread between written rate change and
loss cost trends. Is it fair to say now written rate change more or less equals loss cost
trends, or shouldn't we look at it in aggregate because obviously it's a diﬀerent picture in
individual portfolios? Maybe just some sense of what you're seeing on claims trends in the
key areas would be helpful. On German Life, just to clarify, did you say that the swaption
program has now been taken oﬀ? Is that part of a deliberate re-risking or why has that not
aﬀected the duration which you said is unchanged? Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So ﬁrst of all on claims trends, I think that overall I think your summary is a decent one. I
think, we have the beneﬁt in the quarter of the earn through of a prior positive margin
impact from rates that we think that loss costs are certainly rising. It's certainly coming
close to what we're seeing from rates. So I mean from an overall – the element that falls to
the bottom line probably not as signiﬁcant as it was before, and it may well be close to ﬂat
in the current market conditions.
On the swaptions, so again to repeat, we have removed them and I guess we're not
running this business anymore either. I guess, we're going to look at alternative ways of
managing the portfolio. But in terms of why it hasn't impacted duration I don't know, I
need to come back to you, Andrew, I don't have the immediate answer to that question.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

And does it mean, there's a bigger interest rate sensitivity to the overall capital model or
it's because you've found alternative ways that mitigates it?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Sorry, I was just listening to someone else. So the...

We have a follow-up question from Mr. Huttner from JP Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

I've been called Mr. Huttner, I've been promoted. Thank you. Just two questions. On the
reinsurance slide, 32, so you did – you had part of the (44:13) program which you did in
July. Could you talk a little bit about what the changes were both in terms of how you
position yourself and in terms of the cost of it? And then I probably got this completely
wrong, I was trying to read your speaker notes, but I was also trying to compare with what
you said, and I'm sure I got it wrong, but – has Farmers now, has it reduced the amount of
reinsurance it buys in total, and what is the new number? In the speaker notes I can't see
anything, but may be you said it and I've probably completely missed it. Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So on nat cat reinsurance, I don't have the precise number, but obviously we beneﬁt from
the market movements, so there'll be a margin improvement overall for us given the
reinsurance market trends you can see at the moment, but I don't have a precise ﬁgure for
you, Michael, in terms of the beneﬁt.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

I mean, the reason I asked is it was a little bit a trick question, because in January what you
did is you bought more cover higher up with the saving. In other words, there was no
cash saving. It was just you had more higher up cover, which if there are no nat cats
actually doesn't deliver. But I'm guessing from your answer here you actually kept the
same cover and you paid a bit less, but maybe I'm wrong.

again?

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Yeah, I'm sorry. So, really simple. I had in mind that Farmers buys 18.5% reinsurance. I
thought this was still the case and I just wondered, A, am I right and has it changed?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, you're absolutely right. I guess what we signaled on the video and in the speaker
notes is that, I think at Q1 we've said that Farmers is kind of operating above its target
surplus range ,that we'd planned to use its capital strength to reduce the quota share at
the year end. Through Q2, it's roughly back where it started the year given the frequency
and the nat cat experience that it's had in Q2, but it's still above the range. So we still
expect it to reduce reliance on the quota share, but at the end of this year.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Thank you very much.

A - Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

Just to add to that, Michael, the all lines quota share with us is still the 18.5% and then they
have obviously an agreement in the marketplace, I think that runs to around 1.5%.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

Yes. Thank you. Just one follow-up question on the Z-ECM, and speciﬁcally on the model
changes. We have had a few points up last year, a few points down this quarter. Just if you
could clarify whether there is any further reﬁnements already planned, or whether it will
be only driven by potential regulatory changes from here on? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

We're doing our best to try and avoid model changes that would drive this thing up and
down. We look at maintenance of the system every year, but I'm currently not aware of
anything that would have a signiﬁcant impact on the model going forward. I mean, there's
always the possibility that we have a particular area where we see a need to make a
change, or a regulator has a view where they would propose something. But I don't see
anything at this stage, Niccolo, either up or down.

ahead, sir.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks for taking my follow-up question. It's on slide six, the Life waterfall. Just two
questions here. The in-force management, I think at the Investor Day you mentioned the
UK is just at the start, I wonder to what extent have you already now seen the tangible
beneﬁt of this in-force management? And the second is what do we have to expect on the
other category in this waterfall chart?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Maybe if I talk through it a second, Thomas, just to give everyone the beneﬁt. So I mean
the VIF unwind is the natural runoﬀ of the portfolio. In-force management is mainly
focused on Europe. So I guess we've seen a relatively small proportion of that yet, but I
think the team has very solid plans that are pretty detailed and we have high conﬁdence
in that.
On priority market growth, I think there is a risk that you would look at that and think, well,
that's something that they have to grab in future and that would be partially true, but of
course some of this will come from, for example, some of the bancassurance deals that
we've done that tend to be less proﬁtable, again, because of the shape of amortization of
the initial commission or the initial expense. I mean, those are the key items on the
waterfall.
