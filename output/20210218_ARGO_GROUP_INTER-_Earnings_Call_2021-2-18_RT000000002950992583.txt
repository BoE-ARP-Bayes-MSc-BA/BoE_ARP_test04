{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Good morning, and thank you for the introduction, Brett. Welcome to everyone on the call.
The last 12 months have been a period of dramatic change for all of us as we have had to
adapt to new ways of working and living. This has created a number of challenges and
opportunities as we manage through this period.
Despite these challenges and by embracing these opportunities, I'm proud of the Argo
teams continued effective engagement with customers and producers, reinforcing our
position as a go-to-specialty insurer. These challenges have not impacted our strategic
focus or impeded progress as we have advanced on a number of our key objectives over
the last 12 months.
First, we streamlined and refreshed the senior leadership team with a number of new
hires and internal promotions. This work was capped off with Scott Kirk joining the team
last week to take over the reins of CFO. We're excited about the experiences,
perspective and leadership he will bring to Argo.

Bloomberg Transcript

The leadership team today is better positioned than ever to serve the business, under
our refocused strategy and is simpler as we have been able to eliminate certain senior
positions along with streamlining our strategy. The team is energized and we are excited
about the opportunity we have for profitable growth in the current market environment.
Second, we executed on a number of transactions to exit underperforming or nonstrategic businesses and have focused our go forward strategy on our primary strength
U.S.-focused specialty insurance. These actions demonstrate our emphasis on deploying
our time; resources and capital to businesses that we believe can have strong returns and
can meaningfully contribute to our bottom line. While there will be some lingering costs
associated with these exits and transactions, these are necessary steps to achieve our
desired outcome, which we believe will benefit our shareholders over time.
Third, we announced the formal expense initiative with targets over the next two years
designed to drive a more efficient organization and expand underwriting margin. We plan
to continue to invest in better systems and technology that will reduce manual processes
and allow reducing staffing costs. We've already made progress on removing expenses,
and this is an area where Scott has valuable experience. So we're very excited for him to
bring those best practices to Argo.
Lastly, the reconstituted Board of Directors is highly engaged in providing invaluable
counsel to the leadership team. In addition, there have been a number of governance,
policy and compensation enhancements led by the Board, all to ensure our goals and
targets are closely aligned with enhancing value for shareholders.
These positive steps shouldn't be overshadowed by the impact COVID and a highly
active catastrophe season had on our financial results for the year. We did not achieve our

FINAL

financial targets in 2020, but I'm pleased with the underlying strength in our underwriting
results and confident in how we are positioned for the future. Our talent underwriting
expertise and outstanding service will allow us to capitalize on the many market
opportunities we are seeing today.
During the fourth quarter, we continued to push for improved rate terms and conditions.
For the third quarter in a row, we achieved double-digit rate increases and pricing was
above 10% in both our U.S. and international segments. And while terms and conditions
are improving, we were able to reduce our average limits exposed in several business
lines.
For example, in commercial D&O, we reduced our average limit exposed by
approximately 15% in 2020 versus 2019. The reduction was even more dramatic in our U.S.
and Bermuda excess casualty books, where average limits were down approximately 20%
and 30%, respectively during 2020. The combination of these actions by our underwriters
will lead to more premiums with less exposure at risk. We expect this to produce better
loss ratios as these changes earn through our results over the next several quarters and
as claims are paid over the next few years.

Bloomberg Transcript

Importantly, market conditions have not shown any signs of cooling. The macro
environment, including the pressure that lower interest rates is having on investment
income, suggests that this momentum should continue and we plan to deploy our capital
where we find the best underwriting opportunities.
In terms of growth, our top line in the quarter continued to reflect our focus on strategic
growth areas. Overall, gross premiums were up about 1% in the quarter. U.S. growth was
6.6%, while international declined 10.4%. In international the top line result primarily
reflects underwriting actions that have been underway for the past 12 to 18 months or
longer. We're carefully growing where we have confidence in our results and pulling back
or exiting in other areas.
Excluding these businesses, such as the grocery and retail business in the U.S., our growth
in the U.S. was over 10% in the fourth quarter, which we feel very good about. We
achieved strong growth in lines where we have been adding talent and investing in
underwriting tools, such as Casualty, Inland Marine and Argo Pro. Premiums in all of these
businesses were up by more than 20% in the fourth quarter and in some cases well
above that.
We also saw encouraging submission trends in some of our focused growth areas. For
example, Casualty submissions were up 25% in the fourth quarter. And Inland Marine
submissions were up more than 50%. Construction submission growth was also positive
and had pockets of strength in the high-single-digits. These trends give us confidence in
our growth outlook for 2021.
As I mentioned, our financial results for the quarter were impacted by several natural
catastrophe events, namely U.S. wind storms and wildfires as well as additional
catastrophe losses associated with COVID. No single natural catastrophe event was a
Page 3 of 13

FINAL

surprise to us, but the frequency of events was significant. According to Swiss Re, 2020
was the fifth costliest year on record for the industry, including a record number of named
storms in the U.S.
One of our key initiatives in 2021 and beyond is to reduce our aggregate catastrophe
exposure. This started with our sale of Ariel Re and will continue with actions on our
insurance portfolio as well. We are reducing property line sizes as well as exiting large
property accounts in certain wildfire-prone areas. Our goal is to reduce the volatility of our
underwriting results and allocate our capital to businesses with more stable returns. This
will be a gradual process as we see the impact of the actions over the next 18 to 24
months.

Bloomberg Transcript

The impact of catastrophes pushed us to an underwriting loss for the quarter and the
year. However, on an underlying basis, there were some very positive signs, our current
accident year, and ex-CAT loss ratio, improved by more than 7 points from the prior year
quarter. The fourth quarter of 2019 included some current accident year strengthening. So
the full-year comparison is more representative of the improvement at 3.4 points. The
better result, which was seen in both the U.S. and International segments, was primarily
related to rate and underwriting actions I spoke about a minute ago.
The expense ratio improved 2.2 points in the fourth quarter to 40.1%. As we noted in our
earnings release, there were a number of items related to strategic actions and other
nonrecurring items that added approximately 3 points to the expense ratio for the
quarter and about 1 point for the full-year. This total includes professional fees for
transactions we announced during the quarter and severance costs to rightsize some of
our infrastructure platforms. These costs are part of our expense initiative we have
discussed and are expected to lead to future savings as we continue to make progress
on our expense targets.
Some of the actions we took in the fourth quarter are important steps towards continued
expense ratio improvement. We exited several businesses during the quarter, including
the sale of Ariel Re, pending sale of our Italian business, the runoff operations in Malta,
and our U.S. grocery and retail business. These decisions will allow us to exit certain highcost areas and focus our resources on better returning businesses. As I mentioned last
quarter, our expense improvement will not be linear due to some of the extraordinary
costs associated with our actions.
Last week, we announced that we are hosting a virtual investor event on March 12. We
plan to use the time to dive deeper into our go-forward strategy and highlight certain
businesses in a form where we are not also trying to explain the movement of a single
quarter. We look forward to clarifying what Argo looks like as we trade forward after a
number of changes we have announced in the recent months. We will also give you some
more detail on where we're heading with expenses and introduce additional members of
the team. So please join us if you can.
I'll now turn the call over to Jay to discuss our results in more detail.

FINAL

Thanks, Kevin. I'll spend a few minutes going over our results, and then we'll take your
questions. For the fourth quarter of 2020, Argo reported a net operating loss to common
shareholders of $18.2 million or $0.52 per share, an improvement from last year's result of
a loss of $2.15 per share. For the full-year, our operating loss was $0.64 per share
compared to a loss of $0.90 per share in 2019.
The factors driving our financial results in each period are much different, with 2020 being
driven by external factors, namely significant natural catastrophe activity and COVIDrelated losses and materially lower investment yields, while 2019 reflected a number of
internal challenges.
Importantly, the issues we faced in 2019 have not resurfaced this year as reserve
development was very modest at less than 0.5 point in 2020. The underlying results for
2020 provide a lot of optimism for the future and with a more focused strategy, there
should be a renewed confidence in Argo's outlook.

Bloomberg Transcript

First, on the top-line, we reported gross premiums written of $718 million in the fourth
quarter. This was up approximately 1% from the prior year quarter. As has been the story
for much of the year, we have seen good growth in our targeted areas, primarily in the
U.S., which is being offset by business that we have been pulling back from for some time,
primarily in areas in our International segment. There's also been a negative impact in
certain lines from lower insured exposures and payrolls as a result of the pandemic.
In the quarter -- in the fourth quarter, U.S. gross premiums were up just under 7%, with the
strongest growth in professional lines. This is a line that continues to benefit from
favorable market conditions as rates were up approximately 20% for the third consecutive
quarter. Rates on average across the U.S. segment were up just over 10%, with
Professional Lines, Casualty and Property, continuing to lead the way.
Growth in net written and net earned premiums in the U.S. was strong at approximately
15% and 12%, respectively, and is amplified by an adjustment to ceded premium that
impacted the prior year quarter. On a gross net and earned basis, the full-year growth
figures present a more representative pattern.
On the International side, gross premiums declined 10.4% in the fourth quarter. The
decline was primarily in Specialty and Property lines, partially offset by growth in liability.
Rates on average across the International segment were up in the high teens and
strength -- this strength was broad-based.
Our combined ratio in the quarter was 110% compared to 126.7% in the prior year period.
The 2020 results included 11.1 points of catastrophe losses, which drove us to an
underwriting loss for the quarter. About 75% of the catastrophe total was related to
natural catastrophes, and the balance was from COVID-related losses.

FINAL

I would note that a portion of our natural catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter reflect
updated loss estimates related to events that occurred late in September, most notably
Hurricane Sally and certain wildfires. The timing and nature of these events and the nature
of the losses made the initial estimation process difficult for everyone, but we believe we
have fully captured these now.
Our COVID-related losses were $12.7 million in the fourth quarter and were primarily
related to event cancellation exposures in our international operations. Throughout the
year, our losses from COVID have declined in magnitude and we expect this pattern will
continue into next year with a much lower level of losses anticipated in subsequent
quarters. With regards to prior year development, overall, we're very pleased that the
fourth quarter in a row -- that for the fourth quarter in a row, net prior year reserve
movements have been modest.
On an underlying basis, excluding catastrophes and prior year development, our loss ratio
and combined ratio showed strong year-over-year improvement. Our ex-CAT accident
year loss ratio improved 7.2 points from the 2019 fourth quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

As Kevin mentioned, the year-to-date improvement of 3.4 points is a better marker of our
performance and profitability improvement during the year. As you'll recall in the fourth
quarter of 2019, we adjusted some of our accident year ratios in International to reflect
pressure from recent accident years. Additionally, as noted previously, we completed a
reinsurance to close transaction in 2017 and prior years in our Lloyd's insurance operation,
giving us reasons for confidence in 2018 and forward.
Our expense ratio in the fourth quarter was 40.1%, an improvement of 2.2 points from the
fourth quarter of last year. For the full-year, our expense ratio was roughly flat at 38.3%. As
Kevin mentioned, during the quarter, we incurred costs related to some of our strategic
transactions, personnel and severance expenses, and the early exit of certain office
facilities. These and other nonrecurring costs negatively impacted the expense ratio by
roughly 3 points during the quarter and 1 point for the full-year. The nonrecurring
expenses impacted each segment but primarily reside in the international and corporate
segments.
One final thought on the consolidated operating results. At the beginning of last year, we
established a combined ratio target for the business of 96% to 98% for 2020. No doubt it
was a challenging and most unusual year, and we missed this range due to much higherthan-anticipated catastrophes, both natural and COVID-related.
However, if you remove the COVID losses and adjust for what might be an expected year
of natural catastrophes and take out the nonrecurring costs related to certain transaction
and other expense initiatives, the business was performing in that range. We are pleased
with our underlying performance and feel even better today than we did 12 months ago
about our underwriting prospects and profitability potential.
Turning now for a moment to our segments, despite the heightened catastrophe activity,
we reported a small underwriting profit in our U.S. operations with a combined ratio of
Page 6 of 13

FINAL

99.3%. International fell to an underwriting loss and reported a combined ratio of 122.1%. In
both segments, underwriting results improved from the prior year period as higher
catastrophe losses were offset by relatively small prior year reserve movements
compared to some significant prior year strengthening in the fourth quarter of last year.
And on a year-to-date basis, the international segment has reported favorable
development.
In the U.S., our ex-CAT accident year loss ratio was 60.3%, improved 1 point -- 9 points
from the fourth quarter. Included in this are two large -- excuse me, improved 1.9 points
during the fourth quarter. Including in this result are two large losses that added
approximately 3 points to the ratio. One, a large property account we've already nonrenewed and the other, a larger-than-expected liability loss in our public entity business.
In International, we reported an ex-CAT accident year loss ratio of 55% for the fourth
quarter and 54.4% for the full-year, both strong improvements from 2019 levels. Overall,
we're encouraged by what we're seeing in terms of underlying margin trends, particularly
as market conditions appear to have strong momentum for some time to come.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to investments, our total investment income was down just 1.5% to $33.7 million in
the fourth quarter. This reflected strong performance from our reduced private equity and
hedge fund investments, offset by continued pressure on our fixed income portfolio.
Our core portfolio continues to reflect lower yields and tighter new issue credit spreads.
Investment income, excluding alternatives was down approximately 30% from the prior
year to $23.5 million. Part of this decline also reflects repositioning decisions we made in
the last 12 months as we continue to focus our capital deployment on attractive
underwriting opportunities.
Note for the year, there was a sizable foreign exchange loss as throughout each quarter
of the year we've seen deterioration in the U.S. dollar against several other currencies. A
portion of this is offset by gains in the value of assets held in these currencies which are
accounted for through book value.
Finally, on capital, we continue to be active during 2020, completing the $150 million
preference share refinancing in the second half of the year. Overall, we remain well
capitalized to take advantage of the market conditions and continue to grow the portfolio.
Book value per share ended the year at $49.39. This was roughly flat with the -- with
September 30 when adjusting for dividends paid. While on a tangible basis, we saw an
increase of almost $1, as a result -- dollar per share as a result of the Ariel sale.
In closing, I'd like to say thanks for all the support from my friends at Argo. I wish everyone
the best and expect good things to come.
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator

FINAL

Question And Answer
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)
And the first question will come from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Please go ahead.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. I guess, before I launch on to a couple of questions, I should
just wish you the best Jay. You've done a good job on behalf of the company. I know it's
been tough times. And good luck in your future.

A - Jay S. Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Thanks, I appreciate that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

So the first question is going to be a tough question, and your Board is not going to be
happy with this. But I know you said upfront Kevin, that the Board is actively engaged. You
guys are resetting everything. One of the observations I have is that the Argo Board's
compensation seems to be running at a much higher level than many of its peers. And I'm
not sure I've seen anything out of the board looking at that, I don't know what you can
comment on that or not, but I just wanted to make that statement to see if there's any
feedback.

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Well, good morning, Greg and I always expect the tough question to come from you, so
that's fine. We have engaged independent third parties to do an overall review of the
compensation for the Board and they looked at it on a relative basis with our peers, and
that's where the compensation was reset. So we used independents and advisers for
best practices.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

I see. And okay, so I don't need to -- so there's been a reset there. And so I guess that's a
good thing. Then pivoting, it's a lot of moving parts. You've announced disposals, you've
announced reinsurance transactions. If I just look at your full year '20 numbers, so let's
look at US first, $1.994 billion of gross written premium, $1.223 billion of net written
premium. If I -- you talked about the grocery business. How would that -- how would the
2020 results look on a pro forma basis with all the changes you've made or is this kind of
what we see is what we get for US?
And the same question, of course would then I would apply to the international. $1.2 billion
of gross, $585 million net, you've announced several transactions in that market. If I look

Page 8 of 13



Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td
Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2021-02-18

at 2020, how do these numbers look with all these adjustments? So I can use that as sort
of a base just on top line to think about '21 and 22.

FINAL

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yes. That is a good question. And we will certainly come back with more detail on that in
the Investor Day. But I can tell you that some of the places where we're out of in terms of
the size of those books, so if you think about cyber which we were moving out of, right,
we ended the year at $6.8 million there. In -- let's see. Retail and Grocery business, we
ended the year at $30.1 million, right? But some of these things aren't going to -- the
earned premium will be there. And the ability to get off some of these things is not always
as easy as one thinks, right? We didn't sell the book. So there may be some more written
premium in there. But you think about it as a baseline of $30 million is going away there.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Jay S. Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And then there's also Greg there's always re-underwriting that goes on. So last year we
did a big re-underwriting of the property book. And to shrink the P&L which obviously
helped but hurt us as well with what we still have left. And we don't -- but we're still in the
property business, right? And it's hard to quantify exactly how much of that went away as
we write new stuff and get rates. So I'm going to take that question on Board, and we'll
come back with some specificity in a couple of weeks later.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Got it. And then on the international side, do you have any -- do you want to give us any
markers there or...

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yes. I don't have the color right here for that, but we'll make sure we get that out. Thank
you.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Okay. And then I guess the final question.

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Although, Greg, we did highlight in the third quarter call the amount of gross and net
premium that was coming out of the businesses that we were exiting.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Right.

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}
Page 9 of 13



Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td
Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2021-02-18

So if you go back to that, the -- it gives a sense of what those things were on an annual
basis. And again, there'll be some that carries forward as we work our way out just duet to
timing where Ariel Re will be a little bit easier to figure out.

FINAL

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

So my second question and then I'll -- I guess I'll let others ask questions, but just be on
the international and the expense ratio in international. Clearly, our US operations are
chuggiing along at reasonable expense ratios. But you look at -- like for the full year
international, the 43.4, and it's just -- it's just border line obscene how high these expense
ratios are. I'm sure it's driving crazy. But when they think about maybe not '21, do you want
to think about '22, '23, what do you think the expense ratio on international should look
like, when you get finished with all the changes that you're going through?

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yes. Again, I think we'll give more clarity on that on the 12th. But I will say that the expense
ratio, where it is right now there were on the international segment almost half of that $14
million came out of stuff that was related to actions we took there. So -- and some of the
things we got out of were more some -- consumed more overall expense in the
organization. So some of the expense savings we'll see out of there are coming in a
couple of years' time. So we'll see some of the benefit in this year, but the majority would
be in 2022 as that goes away. And again, we'll give you some good clarity on that on the
12th.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Got it. And I guess I can't -- I want to throw a question at Jay here. When you think about
the capital structure of the company, you mentioned the offering in the second half of last
year, your top line is not growing, can you give us a sense of where -- what the excess
capital looks like for the consolidated company? And how you think about that at least
where we are based on how the numbers closed out the year-end?

A - Jay S. Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Well Greg that too is a challenging question. And the reason it's a challenging question is
excess capital is what I would I call in the eye of the beholder, right? So we pay a lot of
attention to capital ratios as defined by the rating agencies, and as defined by our
regulators and try to maintain what we would consider strong levels of capital against
those ratios. And that I think it -- was more important -- even more important as we
moved through 2019 and through 2020 because of some of the external things that we
were dealing with.
I guess the simple way to put it is, we look at our plans over the next several years and
through both the capital that we have today and the capital that we generate internally,
and we've got the capital to meet the market opportunities that we see. I don't think I
want to quantify what would be an arbitrary -- my word, an arbitrary measure of excess
capital.

(Operator Instructions) And our next question will come from Bob Farnam with Boenning
and Scattergood, please go ahead.

Q - Bob Farnam

{BIO 15005467 <GO>}

Yes. Hey there, good morning. I know Kevin, you mentioned, with the expenses; you're
still going to have some lingering costs. Can you quantify how much going forward do you
think that the expense ratio might still be higher than expected because of non-continuing
expenses?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Okay. So let me sort of dissect the question. I guess it's -- you're wondering, in 2021, what
it might be if we're looking at a targeted end of 30 -- 2022 to end at 36? Is that roughly
it?

Q - Bob Farnam

{BIO 15005467 <GO>}

Yes. I'm just trying to think -- I know you say it's not going to be linear, but I'm just still kind
of curious, how much of these costs might still get out there. So you have...

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

I think it's fair to think about it being in sort of the mid 37 to 38 range for the full year this
year.

Q - Bob Farnam

{BIO 15005467 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

But don't just -- we'll get there, right? It's -- some of these things that come up, there may
be lease buyouts, there's other things that occur that are worth it over the two year
period to do, but they may in a particular quarter be expensive or look expensive right?
