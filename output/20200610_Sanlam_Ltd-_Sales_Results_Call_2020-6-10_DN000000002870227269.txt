Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Sanlam Ltd Group's four
month operational update ended April 30, 2020. All participants are currently in listen-only
mode. And there will be an opportunity to ask questions later during the conference
(Operator Instructions) Please also note that this call is being recorded. I would now like to
turn the conference over to Mr. Ian Kirk. Please go ahead, sir.

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the conference call. I'm
joined on the call by colleagues from finance and actuarial, Wikus Olivier, Anton
Gildenhuys and Patrick Hartnic giving first out overview of the results. We released the
results for the four months period earlier this afternoon.
Just a couple of comments from my side. Before we get going with the questions. It's
undeniable that 2020 turned out to be much more challenging than anybody anticipated.
We had a very solid start to the year as we communicated in the COVID-19 update, which
we released at the end of March. And that was really most of the operational trends which
we experienced in the second half of 2019 persistent in the first two months. However,
the operating environment deteriorated substantially since the end of February. As
governments, globally responded to control the spread of the COVID virus through
lockdowns and curfews. Global growth estimates were revised down sharply in an
environment where both demand and the supply side of the economies were severely
disrupted. Of course this drove significant volatility in investment markets, which
significantly impacted our earnings for the four months to April. We are thankful that

there's been a considerable recovery in markets in April and May. Lockdowns and curfews
also prevented face-to-face sales in most of our businesses but particularly in the life
insurance business and therefore since the end of March, new business volumes declined
commensurately. Despite the headwinds we received, we achieved acceptable results for
the four months to 30th April. That's testimony to the resilience of the diversified
operations and obviously the commitment and the expertise of our people. Some of the
salient features in the performance as follows. New business volumes ZAR96 billion up
33% on the first four months of 2019 financial year.
Now, when considering this, it should be noted that the impact of the lockdowns and the
curfews are not fully reflecting, because of the timing differences between writing [ph]
and recognition of new business. As an example, new business production in South Africa
in April and May was down between 50% and 70% lower than our target, and obviously
the Sky intermediary channel was the hardest hit to now decline by some 90% for those
two months, because the worksites are not opened. That's just on the life insurance side.
Net value of new life business so VNB decreased by 18% on a constant economic basis.
Largely due to lower life business sales during the lockdown periods and we expect lower
sales for the rest of the year. And therefore, higher unit costs. Higher margin businesses
such as Sanlam Sky were more severely affected and that obviously impacted the VNB
margins. Overall, net fund inflows of ZAR14 billion was 17% lower than the ZAR16 billion we
achieved in the comparable four month period. Because in the month of March, we had
some large withdrawals at Sanlam Investment. Thankfully, there we had substantial inflows
in May -- in April and in May to more than counteract those flows. But May was -- sorry
March was difficult in terms of outflows at SIG. No real changes in persistency trends were
experienced in the first four months of 2020 and we continue to watch this. Net results
from financial service declined by 21% on the four month period.
However, excluding the negative investment market impact, which I referred to earlier, net
result from financial services increased by a very pleasing 13%, which is in line with what
we saw for the first two months and obviously, this period of last year. Headline earnings
increased by 40% but that was impacted by the one-off -- the accounting cost of ZAR1.7
billion, in 2019. Our capital position in CAT in Sanlam Life, which is our largest regulated
entity, was protected by the hedge equity structure. We've got those in place there, and
therefore, we didn't have a negative -- on that. The Sanlam Group Solvency Capital
Requirement or SCR cover ratio remained healthy. It was at 201% around 31 March, 2020,
but obviously that would have increased since the end of March because markets
recovered from their lows.
Funding levels in the smooth bonus and the participating annuity portfolios, for the larger
portfolios were between 84% and 94%, 31 March, 2020, but that has since recovered.
And at the end of April, it was between 92% and 101% and obviously the position now is
even better than that. So overall, I'm satisfied with the performance for the four months
to end April, reflects the resilience of Sanlam and ability to maintain value creation for our
shareholders in the difficult times. And looking forward, it's difficult because obviously
things are still playing out. And we continue -- continuing to actively manage the
consequences of the pandemic. Our priority remains the health and safety of our
employees and obviously then as well continuing to provide support to our clients, to our
intermediaries and the more vulnerable suppliers across our businesses to ensure the

FINAL

sustainability of the system. And we've been doing substantial work there. I think, we are
well positioned to weather the headwinds. We've got a robust balance sheet, our
solvency position is strong. We've got unique diversification across the geographies.
We've got some very strong businesses and some dominance in market segments. And,
of course, deep skills in our businesses. We are of necessity, I think like most businesses,
cautious about prospects for the remainder of the 2020 financial year, given that there is
uncertainty around the eventual impact.
So we're doing various scenarios, but of course the number of factors will have an impact
on that performance up until the short term, up until the end of June, as well as the full
financial year. And we've set that out in the operational update. And of course, as I said
these -- the current situation is quite fluid. We remain positive, we'll get through these
difficult conditions and I think again, we'll continue to outperform on a relative basis. So I
think that's it from me. So I'll open the call now for any questions that you may have on the
operational update.

Michael?

Q - Michael Christelis

Hi guys, can you hear me?

A - Anton Gildenhuys

Yes we can hear you.

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Yes, we can hear you.

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

Apologies, I was on mute. Sorry, thanks guys for the time. Three questions if I can. Firstly
the lag between new business production and that being actually recorded as new
business in your financials. I wonder if you can give us just sort of some clarity as to is that
sort of six weeks, is it two months, three months for each core business unit, clearly trying
to sort of assess the sort of impact on half one versus half two and which months will fall
away basically. That's the first question. The second question, Shamrock reported couple
of weeks ago, basically saying that lifestyles were down 35% for the first quarter. I mean,
maybe if you can just give us some comment on that. And sort of what's driving it and

Page 3 of 19



FINAL

Company N ame: Sanlam L td
Company Ticker: SL M SJ Equity
Date: 2020-06-10

what we should be expecting from the life business there. And as well as the non-life
business only growing at about 1%. I'm trying to understand, you gave -- previously given
us targets of sort of 12%, 13% I think as growth. I am just trying to understand what is the
new targets ignoring COVID, I guess. And then lastly, just around your expectations for
maybe just your base case for economic growth and job losses for this year and whether
or not you would use June as an opportunity to make material assumption changes if you
prop with lapses, we're going to deteriorate in, off to or would you wait for that to
emerge and only make significant basis changes at the full year. Thank you.

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Yes. Okay. Michael. Anton, maybe you can deal with the first one. Wikus the second one
and then Anton, you maybe come back on the third one around the -- how we're looking
at lapse assumptions at half year.

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

All right. Wikus, you should actually help me. My understanding is in operational update,
we are reporting the accounting new business production numbers.

A - Wikus Olivier

{BIO 20074722 <GO>}

Yes, the accounting numbers, Anton.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

Yes. So the lag, typically if a policy is written say in SPF today, it will typically on average
pop up three to five weeks later in the accounting. As I mentioned, that first premium is
undrawn towards the end of the month.

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

Is that on Sky as well, Anton?

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

Yes. But it also -- there the lag can actually be even more. Of course you've got stop
order business and the stop orders having loaded onto the system of the employer. So
you could have a six week lag or so on average, so there is a bit of a lag between
production and related accounting. But the numbers we've reported in operational
update is the accounting numbers.

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Wikus Olivier

{BIO 20074722 <GO>}

And on some Moroccan market, I am -- I don't want to comment too much on them as
you are aware, are a separate listed entity. But I would -- just to say that the comment that
I made referred to turnover, which is not necessarily the same as new business volumes in
Page 4 of 19

FINAL

our definition. So I'd rather refer to across the North West Africa region in that way for the
first four months, the life business growth was actually very good. On the non-life side
again, I rather refer to the region and then, Morocco, specifically, but for this year, we did
set them lower growth targets, and focusing them to look at the quality of the new
business, so for the region, the targeted growth for this year is in the single digits.

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

All right. And then on the assumption changes, it's very unlikely that we will do mortality
assumption changes for due diligence. The first one is we haven't seen significant COVID19 claims yet, and then to the degree that they come through, we've got the pandemic
reserve to deal with those. So it's unlikely for us to do mortality change. As for persistency,
it's an interesting one, of course of Sanlam's prudent reserving basis if we actually
weaken our persistence or strengthen our lapse assumptions, key markets, the result
where we actually see our reserves lowering, that is because we generalize our negative
reserves. So for onerous policies, we set up positive reserves and again if we increase the
lapse assumptions for those policies that will result in the reserves reducing.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we are thinking about potentially doing some out of model or just the EV adjustment
to allow for a short-term impact on persistency. We don't think as with the global financial
crisis that there will be a permanent shift in persistency. If there is a shift, it will be in the
shorter term. We just want to first consider the experience in towards the end of June as
well, over and above April, May to get a better feeling of where the trends are going and
then we may or may not introduce the RF model adjustment.

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Yes, it's early days. Michael, I would say that April and May were probably better than we
expected. So we'll have to give ourselves one or two more months just to see if there's
anything in there. So we're watching it very, very carefully. And obviously, with our
banking...

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

But you would make it?

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

With our banking...

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

You would make assumption changes if you felt things would deteriorate right?

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Yes, yes...

Q - Michael Christelis

Thank you. The next question is from Warwick Bam of Avior Capital Markets. Please go
ahead.

Q - Warwick Bam

{BIO 19921967 <GO>}

Hi, Ian, Wikus and Anton. Thanks for the time. Three questions from my side. How do you
foresee the shape of the recovery in advisor productivity as the lockdown regulations
ease? Second one, are you considering any tactical changes to your strategy in that
environment? Especially around cost cutting or enhancing your focus on digital sales
channels. The third one, you've got a very healthy balance sheet and I appreciate you may
not have as much discretionary capital available to deploy. But my real -- my question is
really around the Prudential Authority and whether you're under any pressure to retain
capital in the current environment. Thanks.

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Okay. Anton, maybe you can have a look at this one. The first one. I'll talk about the
second one and maybe a bit about the first one as well. But you can have a go at that
one. And then I will talk a little bit about the third one then as well. And maybe, Wikus, if
you can also chip in on the third one.

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

Company N ame: Sanlam L td

Thanks, Ian. I think the set of the recovery specifically on productivity will depend heavily
on the nature of the lockdown regulations and now they are being eased. We know that
government knows and expects the infection rate and the death rate to increase. The
whole purpose of a lockdown was not to try and dodge the pandemic but it's only around
preparing the healthcare systems and flattening the curves, so that we can cope with it.
So we should see an increase and that shouldn't deter government from the easing of a
lockdown unless even their projections are being exceeded by the actual experience. And
that will of course then lead to a reversing of the lockdown easing and will have a
significant impact. So in the middle and affluent market, our productivity, even though the
lockdown levels may ease you may still have a situation where some of our clients remain
anxious and they are more keen to engage with intermediaries via telephone or digital
means. So that may have a longer-term impact on productivity. In terms of entry level
market. We are very heavily dependent on not only work sites opening, but the
employees, being present in those worksite. And for that you would need, in our case at
least a level two but probably level one type of lockdown for productivity to revert back to
normal.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Warwick, let me come in here. It's -- I'm not trying to kick for touch. But it's quite difficult.
I'm sure you read all the stuff, the economic stuff and the scenarios around that. So that
doesn't -- I won't comment on that, but that would shape our thinking. So we would be
expecting this thing to take -- to be very negative. But actually, when we look at the -- on
the ground. In our own business, outside of the life business in particular, the bottom end
where the worksites are closed. We're actually doing better than we would have
expected. When we talk to our banking partners, things are not as bad actually at the
moment as they would have expected. When we talk to the retailers there is quite a lot of
activity. So it's a little bit counter intuitive. So we're having to watch this thing fairly carefully.
So what we're doing and remember in our business it's quite diverse. So what we're
seeing in South Africa in the middle market and the entry level is not the same. What
we're seeing in some of the regions is not the same.
What we're seeing in India is not the same as in Africa. So it's very, very difficult, so what
we're doing in Sanlam, we're doing scenarios. We've got a base scenario. And then we've
got one that's kind of worse than the base scenario. And then we've got a scenario that
says, we're going to have, we're going to have a second lockdown, which is really a
negative scenario.
And that's all quite honestly, we can do for you at this stage. I think, we'll be in a better
position at the end of June. So I mean, we find -- we're going to get through -- we're
down a little bit on the earnings side, we'll have to see where that -- we would hope that
we could sort of recover some of that. The markets have recovered strongly in May.
I think the pickup will probably be in South Africa, a little bit better than we were
expecting. We will just have to see. Now the next question is around. So what does this
do? Well some of the stuff that we were busy with, we can really push ahead quite quickly.
In terms of the operational side, I mean if you said to me today that we can run Sanlam's
80% of the people remotely, I would say, that's impossible. I would sayWe're doing it and

Page 7 of 19

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

we've been doing it. We had 87% of people away in the first five weeks, we're now at
80%.
I mean, it's extraordinary. Heck of a lot of those people are not going to come back to
work on a regular basis or come back for meetings. We're going to be able to push a lot
of this stuff around new ways of working that we never ever could have seen before. The
impact on how we work, the efficiency of how we work, the productivity, the type of
people we need, the head count that we need. The real estate that we need.
There's going to be some fundamental changes there and this is not unique to Sanlam.
It's the same stuff that we're seeing in our discussions with other insurance companies
around the world. And so it's really going to give us a lot of opportunity to relook at the
cost base and I'm not talking about wholesale retrenchments, not at all. But the way, the
type of people we employ, the numbers of people over a period of time and the way we
operate is going to be very different. And the second thing of course is the digital
transformation, stuff that we were busy with and Anton was driving that project for us
with, Wikus there as well and we ought to really be able to push hard on that, because of
what we've seen. Yes the intermediaries adoption of digital is going to be much, much
better than we ever thought because you know the face-to-face guys who haven't got
the digital were struggling through the six week. Your third question is around the balance
sheet and the opportunities and the capital. We're not concerned about the lack of
capital. There are sources, we've got available that -- it doesn't really concern us.
However, one must look at the things strategically because that -- and there's not big stuff
on the table strategically for us. So most of the stuff that had been done, we will have
some bolt-ons in Africa, there may be some opportunities in India that come through this
thing. So what you're saying is, will there be opportunities -- will be a lot of the
opportunities. And if we need the capital for the opportunities, we will raise the capital. So
that's the way I would look at this, and nothing on the table, but we have our eyes wide
open.
Wikus, how -- what would you say?

A - Wikus Olivier

{BIO 20074722 <GO>}

No, I agree with that, Ian. And I think part of the question was also around pressure from
the PA.

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Yes. And I think from that is -- maybe if you've seen the communication -- the joint
communication that's come out from the Prudential Authority and as regulated for the
industry. Yes, I should be concerned about the solvency of the industry, data. But at this
stage, I can see that if you solvent and then comfortable with your solvency levels that
they won't -- that they will prevent you from deploying capital or even paying dividends,
but it will of course be an engagement process with them, you won't simply do something
with -- without their knowledge to take them along on the journey. Yes, look if they got to
a situation where they were giving us regulatory relief in Sanlam to support the business.
Right, they would correctly say, guys, when are your shareholders coming to the party.
We're coming to the party. Where are your shareholders?. We've not been in that
Page 8 of 19

situation, we had those discussions with our final dividend. Our final -- our dividend is
driven off the cash operating earnings. It's not driven off the capital base. So the two
things are independent. So if the operating earnings are there and the capital position is
strong, we will pay the dividend. And that's basically how we see it.

Thank you. The next question is from Larissa Van Deventer of Barclays. Please go ahead.

Q - Larissa Van Deventer

{BIO 21570130 <GO>}

Good afternoon, guys. Two quick questions, the first one on Sanlam Sky, you gave a very
helpful table and thank you for that. On the extent to which movements are down in April
versus the first two months. But then you mentioned that Sanlam Sky was down 90%
relative to target. Can you tell us what it was down relative to the same period last year?
And then on hedges, you mentioned that the mark-to-market impacts were lessened by
the hedge program in place. Can you please give us a sense of what hedges you have in
place and when they were due for renewal and how you're currently thinking about your
hedge situation?

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Anton, will you have a go at those two. And I will come back on one at the end.

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

Yeah, Wikus, might have the reduction compared to last year. Of course it will be a bit less
than 90% given that we expect growth in our target. The hedges, we got the zero [ph]
premium collars. So the ZAR8 billion capital is still in tact, in fact, it is still contributing a little
bit to discretionary capital every quarter. And so we continue to roll those collars at the
moment. So there is not any significant change in that strategy.

Q - Larissa Van Deventer

{BIO 21570130 <GO>}

Where is your collar hit?

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

So we do it on a monthly basis. So every month, you will have some of those colors
maturing and then of course, they will stay at 100% to say 105%. So we will always have
full capital protection and then we give away upside to pay for that full capital protection
and we always retain the dividends. So in the current environment, the dividend yields are
high, which is assisting in the returns on the ZAR8 billion, and then of course if there is
capital growth, we will capture all of that up to the CAT of the structure.

During the CAT?

FINAL

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

It depends on the market conditions. When you implement. So at this time, last year, the
CATs would have been 7%, 8% for a 12 month collar. Currently, it's significantly lower
because of increased vaults. So we will depend more on the dividends to provide us with
a return at the moment. And then as conditions, as the volatility comes down, in the next
year or so, we expect those pricing to improve again.

Q - Larissa Van Deventer

{BIO 21570130 <GO>}

And downside protection, Anton?

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

And there it's full downside protection. So, we don't...

Q - Larissa Van Deventer

{BIO 21570130 <GO>}

Full downside?

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Larissa Van Deventer

{BIO 21570130 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Wikus, on the Sky. Compared to prior year?

A - Wikus Olivier

{BIO 20074722 <GO>}

Yeah, I think -- Anton covered it, so I don't want to communicate our targets, but I think
the 90% that we guided, just to give an indication into substantial decrease and then
actually, whether you express it as relative targets over last year. The actual production in
the month was really insignificant, to be honest. The 10% remaining.

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

So Larissa, let me just explain it now. The first thing, we would say to you is that we would
have had a low double-digits projected target for the business. For the traditional Sky
business. So you can work that back of that to the 90%. What we were saying was that in
the traditional Sky business. So those months when the work sites were closed, we saw a
substantial fall off.
But when you look at Sky, it's not just the traditional face to face operation. We also have
the Capitec operation, which writes a lot of volumes and we also have the group
Page 10 of 19

schemes. Now they are not quite impacted at the same way. So the worst impact was on
the Sky traditional agency.
The other ones are not as impacted to the same extent at all.

Bloomberg Transcript

Hello Ian, Wikus and Anton thank you very much for your time. And just two very quick
ones. The first one probably for Wikus, and the second one probably for Anton. Just in
terms of the difference between the down 21% net financial and results was up 13%. Can
you just explicitly explain where -- what you took out and, I have seen that there's a hand
float and have you also included the (technical difficulty) participation and then I see more
substantial maybe the mark-to-market on purchase.If you could maybe just give us some
more color on what exactly is excluded to get to the two different numbers.
And then, Anton, just on new business strain, I suppose. This is the benefit for the way you
guys account where you cash account for new business strength and whereas some of
your competitors are obviously going to have new business strength, leading to the
income statement when they're not actually selling anything. Can I kind of assume, I know
there is a bit of a mix difference but can I kind of assume that new business strength are
variable cost and will largely move in line with new sales for the year. Thank you very much.

A - Wikus Olivier

{BIO 20074722 <GO>}

On your first question, Greg, the table that we provided in the operational update, that's
got the ZAR790 million net negative impact in versus ZAR279 million for the prior year.
Those are the numbers that we've adjusted to calculate the difference between 13% and
21%.

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

As you say, it's the credit spreads in SanFin, which is 328, the mark-to-market on the listed

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

I'm sorry I've been on mute there. As for the new business trend, clearly some of the
commission cost, we don't have back, would be fully variable. But the -- let's call it the
Sanlam distribution management and that kind of infrastructure has quite a high degree of
fixed component in there. And that is why, I mean you can see that the average impact in
our VNB margins. And as the volumes come down, the VNB margin will also contract
because of that fixed component coming through in the new business trend, and now
there is quite a unfortunate -- while it's unfortunate in a declining environment that you've
got a fixed cost, but of course if you've got growth then you see an expansion in the
margin.

Thank you. The next question is from (inaudible). Please go ahead.

Q - Analyst
Hi gents. Good evening. If I may, two questions. One on SIG International and the other
one on India. On the first, I apologize if I differ to last year's numbers, but the full year
RoGEV was doing quite nice on the half-year number. And the full year number even
better still half percent assuming kind of fixed versus your sort of target, which is sort of
13.5. How much would the rand depreciation against the international SIG business
translate to your net results for financial services. And on India, it's a big oil importing
country. So obviously, some good savings on fuel during the lockdown but you have a
large land book here and you take it by the 7.9% hit on currency appreciation last year. And
I imagine it gives the rupee -- the last sort of two months, should actually depreciate quite
nicely. So you made some reference to exchange ForEx gains coming through on India
probably because that's in the scheme of things. Thank you.

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

FINAL

Yes, I think, I will. On the first one is SIG International, thus any site translated to average
exchange rate, so if you look at the full -- first four months of this year, it's about a 10%
positive impact on the translated earnings of SIG International. And from a GEV or RoGEV
perspective of course that works from spot to spot and the full weakening of the rand
exchange rate over the period will come through as part of your RoGEV earnings.

Q - Analyst
Thank you, Wikus.

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

India?

Q - Analyst
On India, if you may.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Okay, so I can talk about the operational side, maybe Wikus on the numbers. The issue in
India is that because of the payment on that that have been legislated, the collections in
the two credit businesses are impacted and that's now been extended so they in turn of
course get extension on their funding. But the pressure's on there, so we can anticipate a
weakening or additional provisioning and we can anticipate, some reduction in advances
so operationally, those two businesses run, will be under pressure and I think, we just
make the point again that we have lag accounting, so we're bringing through very strong
results from India and we're just cautioning that, -- we'll have to see, if those can continue,
we would actually anticipate that they won't continue because of the pressure.
So we've been through this with India, many times and might down to every -- and they've
always recovered very, very nicely. So we'll just have to see but from a currency point of
view, what again, we've had about 10% but they are similar to --

A - Wikus Olivier

{BIO 20074722 <GO>}

Let me just check.

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Yeah, maybe a bit less maybe about 8%

A - Wikus Olivier

{BIO 20074722 <GO>}

In US plus 15%.

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Yeah that will have a -- we'll have a positive on that but we're going to have to have a
close look at the values the -- for GEV purposes. At the end of June.

Thank you, (Operator Instructions). The next question is from (inaudible) of Business Line,
please go ahead.

Q - Analyst
Hi I just have one question, Ian, on business interruption insurance. Have you got clients
lined up for that and I'm guessing, you would be rejecting them, if you could just give me
a sense as to why, if you are rejecting them on what grounds?

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So that's business policy condition and the policy contracts I think are pretty clear. I'm not
dealing with it on a daily basis like the Santam people, but I mean, I know how the thing
works because I was across there. So if you've got clients that have taken the -- have got
the cover for the pandemic, and they have a particular incident in their business. So in
other words, they've had to close down because a customer came in or an employee
came in that was infected, they've had to close it down, we will cover that. We've had
claims like that, we will cover that. But if the business is -- has had losses, business
interruption losses because we have a global pandemic. And we have lockdowns applied
country-by-country-by-country. I mean, that was never anticipated in the contract.
It's not covered in the contract. And therefore, it's impossible. We are happy to bear
some of the risk in this thing and do the right thing for the clients and help out where we
can, but you can't have a situation that the entire cost of the COVID pandemic in the
economy gets transfered across to the short-term insurers because someone thinks, why
not, they've got some kind of cover. So one has to be very careful in how one goes about
this thing. And I can tell you that the Santam folks, I've looked at it very carefully. They have
looked at it with the industry association, they've looked at it with the regulator, they have
looked it with the intermediaries, they've looked at with the reinsurers.
And they will be very responsible and do -- you know, if you obviously apply the contract
conditions but you'll also look and see what the right thing would be to do for clients. It's
early days on this thing. It really is early days because clients, you know, they will have to
formulate claims, they will have to look at their own policies, they'll have to get the
brokers involved. This thing will play out over a period of time, but we will do the right
things for the clients. I can assure you of that at Santam and of course, you know, it's a
very small percentage of the commercial clients who've got this cover anyway. Most of
them don't take cover for that. And actually when you look at the insurance business that
we write in Africa and in India, so it's not coverd at all. So this is -- it's not really a very
significant thing in a Santam context. It's a much more serious thing for example in the UK
and in America, where those -- the policy contracts are worded differently.

FINAL

Thank you. The next question is from Serine Barnard of Multione [ph]. Please go ahead.

Q - Analyst
Good evening, gents. Just a couple of questions from our side. So firstly, the table on
Page 7 will show us the April production versus the average for the 3 months to March
2020. So would that be reduction or would that be on an accounting basis?

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

That's on the accounting basis, Serine.

Q - Analyst
Okay so the comment on the 50% to 70% is production but that table is on accounting
basis, correct. And then I wanted to ask. So, what percentage of the Sky business is
written through work sites and give you -- can you give us an indication on -- that are
government employees?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Government -- yeah, I can give you sort of volumes. You want the percentages. Yeah. I'll
add that one, because as I think if you look at the Sanlam's guidance book suggest more
than off the book which is government employees. On worksite perspective to be honest,
I actually don't know what the percentage is top of mind. But it's a smaller part of the
business. They still write a significant portion of course through Capitec these days, and
then also through the intermediary base and group schemes.

Q - Analyst
Okay, great. And then for the Saham struct. So you referenced the fact that quite a
substantial piece is invested in property. So does it do a full property evaluation at the end
of the period, just to get an idea of how much of the time is already in the number and
how much of the time is still to come in terms of property values?

A - Wikus Olivier

{BIO 20074722 <GO>}

The biggest part of the impact in the full month results comes from equities, there is
some allowance for a cut on property valuations, but it was a more high level estimate at
this stage for the June results we go through a proper valuation of the properties.

Q - Analyst
Okay.

A - Wikus Olivier

{BIO 20074722 <GO>}
Page 15 of 19



Company N ame: Sanlam L td
Company Ticker: SL M SJ Equity

So there may be a difference end of June.

FINAL

Q - Analyst
Okay, well -- yeah because usually the property valuations are only done on as use of sale.
And then I just wanted to confirm on your comment on the persistency. So you say the
trends in the first four months of this year was consistent with last year and then you also
commented that the April persistency was better than you expected. So did you see
significant dropdown -- sorry you said May was better than you expected. Did you see a
significant drop down in May from the sort of January to April levels?

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

No, we didn't. And that's what I was saying earlier, Serine. We were kind of expecting that
and didn't see it. And we also not seeing it with our banking partner. So that's why, we're
just being a bit cautious.

Q - Analyst
And those were across the book, is there specific areas that's faring worse than others?

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No, no, no, no. There's not one specific area that we're worried about, and we're also not
seeing it yet in Africa, where we're also concerned. But it's early days Serine.

A - Wikus Olivier

{BIO 20074722 <GO>}

Yeah, I think one factor that you must take into account is that we do have clients that took
premium holidays. So I think that the question is once those end whether they will
continue paying or whether then you might a incur lapse at that point. And this all
surrender at that point in time.

Q - Analyst
I guess, what has the take-up been on the holidays that you offered?

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

There has been fair take-up, but it's not a substantial part of the book.

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

No Again, again less than we anticipated. The thing about it is obviously there is pressure
with consumers. But when you go through a thing like this the people say cheapest. I'm
going to keep my life cover going. I've got to keep my funeral plan in place. And I've got
to also look after my short term insurance so it's almost like the awareness of health and
safety stuff. They're aware of this and of course the brokers are speaking to them as well.
So it's in a time like this that the value of what we do should come through or may well be
coming through.

Page 16 of 19



Company N ame: Sanlam L td
Company Ticker: SL M SJ Equity
Date: 2020-06-10

Yeah -- we understand the pressure, we really, we are live to the pressure that people are
under and particularly where people get retrenched. But to answer your question, we had
less people coming to us on the premium holidays than we expected.

FINAL

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

Yeah, I think you have a situation year away, you've got fairly strong forces pulling in
different directions. So what Ian talks about is people being retrenched or business
owners losing their income. Even if it's small business owners. And then of course their
employees are also being affected. And that don't clearly lead to lapses, I mean, it
doesn't matter what your intentions are if you don't have an income, it's impossible to
maintain those policies, but on the other end, you've got a lot of salary earners in South
Africa. A lot of the salary earners who work will just sit at home and their expenditure base
has reduced significantly, not only because the transport costs are down and so on, but
the mortgage repayments are down because the prime interest rate has been slashed by
pretty much a third or close to a third.

Bloomberg Transcript

So you've got actually more disposable income with your salary earners. And then on top
of that there is certainly less churning going on in the industry because in the Middle East
especially in the entry level market are precluded from entering the industry as well. So
you've got all of these forces and that's why, coming back to Michael's point earlier. We
try to understand those trends to have a bit more of an informed decision on what the
overarching adjustment should be. That all being said, I think it is an EV, it will be naive to
think that there will be no impact on our persistence if the economy shrinks by let's say
7.5% for the year.

Q - Analyst
Yeah, absolutely. That's great, thanks. That's very useful. And then lastly, you talked about
the fixed-cost element of the new business strain. Can you give us a sort of a rule of
thumb for what sort of volume decline, which result in sort of sensitivity for the VNB
margin. So what sort of volume decline will result in zero VNB. To get a feel for that
sensitivity? Or anything along those lines just to give us a feel for how sensitive it is?

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Anton, you want to have a go at that one.

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

Yes, I would say that you would need at least more than 50% decline in volumes for the
VNBs to become negative.

Q - Analyst
Okay, great, thanks. That very helpful.

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

We don't have a scenario like that Serine.

Thank you. The final question is a follow-up from Michael Christelis. Please go ahead.

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

Michael? I think you're on mute again.

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

Sorry. I forgot. Just a quick one on your Sanlam personal loans book. I see you've
increased your provision there or you've raised the provision to ZAR50 million. Could you
tell little about what's happening in net book specifically on non-performing loans? And
what your expectations, thereon?

A - Wikus Olivier

{BIO 20074722 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

At this stage, Michael the provision that we've made doesn't reflect actual defaults. So
you do have some clients within that book that also took repayment holidays. At this
stage, it's simply the IFRS 9 provisioning model that simply kicks out a increased
provisioning. Based on the delay in payments by clients. But the insure impact will be
determined by actual defaults that come through which is uncertain at this stage.

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

Do you expect a material pickup in credit losses data?

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

No, that's not our base case at this stage.
