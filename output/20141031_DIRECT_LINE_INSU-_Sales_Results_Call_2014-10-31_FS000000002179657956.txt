Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Direct Line Group
2014 Quarter Three Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listenonly mode. There will be a presentation followed by a question-and-answer session. I
must advise you that this conference is being recorded today, Friday, the 31 of October,
2014.
I would now like to hand the conference over to your ﬁrst speaker today, Paul Geddes.
Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.

Thank you and good morning, everybody, and welcome to our Q3 update. You've all had
a chance to read the statement which we issued this morning. And you've noted the usual
disclaimer in our IMS about forward-looking statements, which, obviously, equally applies
to this call.

FINAL

In line with the approach back in Q1, there's no formal presentation today, instead I'm
going to run you through the business highlights of the quarter, give you a brief update
on the headline ﬁnancials before sharing my observations on the UK Motor and Home
markets, and then we're going to take your questions. As usual, I'm joined by John
Reizenstein and other members of my management team.
So, starting with the business highlights, you'll see from the announcement, it's been
another busy quarter as we focused on improving our capabilities and propositions in
what's continued to be a competitive marketplace. Year-to-date, we've launched new
Motor websites, signiﬁcantly improved the quote-and-buy journey to our customers.
We've refreshed and diﬀerentiate the Direct Line proposition. We rolled out smartphone
technology into the claims process.
Our telematics oﬀering, which as you know now includes self-install, continues to grow.
And behind the scenes, we're good way through delivering the 30 or so pricing projects
we identiﬁed for this year. The combination of all these initiatives has helped us to
improve our competitiveness, which allowed us to trade a bit harder in the third quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Outside of the UK, we've recently announced the sale of our International business
system, Mapfre, which completes the strategic review announced early this year. The total
cash proceeds of €550 million are 1.9 times 2013, that's asset value, represented good
result for all our stakeholders. And we conﬁrm that substantially all of the net proceeds
will be returned to shareholders as soon as practicable post-completion.
Before I talk about the UK Motor and Home markets, let me take you through the headline
ﬁnancials. Ongoing GWP was £820 million, down 4.2% against the same quarter last year,
and a small improvement on the 4.7% reduction observed in Q2. Note, we are now
excluding International and this will be treated as discontinued.
In-force policies were down 2.6% versus the end of December and 0.5% in the quarter.
And I'll come on to that in more detail in a moment. We made further progress on costs in
Q3. Total costs were £241 million, which represent a 7% reduction versus last year. And
within that, staﬀ costs were down 20%. Year-to-date total cost was £737 million, 6% lower
than last year with reductions in staﬀ costs and marketing costs, partially oﬀset by higher
depreciation and amortization charges. Overall, we are on track to achieve our £1 billion
cost target this year.
Moving on to investments, we continued to see improving returns as a result of the
actions we've taken around the mix of our investment portfolio. In the third quarter, we
increased our holdings in the UK Commercial property and securitized credit and
securities within the corporate debt portfolio rated at BBB. We've recently agreed two
new asset classes, namely UK infrastructure debt and private placements of investment
grade credit, which we plan to build up in the fourth quarter this year and the ﬁrst quarter
of 2015, respectively.
Investment income of £48 million was up 4.6% on last year and year-to-date investment
income was more than 9% ahead of last year. The annualized income yield at the end of
Page 2 of 24

Q3 was 2.3%, which is 20 basis points higher than for the ﬁrst nine months of 2013.

FINAL

Investment gains were slightly lower in the third quarter, but year-to-date remain ahead of
the prior year mainly as a result of unrealized property gains. This gave us a total
investment return of £175.7 million for the ﬁrst nine months, which was 11.3% higher than
the same period last year, a good result given our assets under management have been
falling during the year.
Now for more detail on GWP including an update on the UK Motor and Home markets.
So, in the UK Motor market, there are four things I'd like to cover, pricing, current claims
trends, reserving and regulation. All these are clearly linked and the message I'd like to
take away is that whilst we've seen some stabilization in market pricing, but structurally
deﬂationary impact from LASPO has now worked its way through. So, based on historical
trends, we'd expect to see underlying claims inﬂation return to the market.
Starting with pricing. As you all have seen, the external survey so far appointing to
broadly ﬂat pricing in the third – in the quarter and we'd agree with those surveys. Our
prices were ﬂat in Q3 2014 versus Q3 2013. And this is the second successive quarter of
ﬂat pricing. For us, risk mix was, again, down a little bit, but in line with the trends which
we saw in previous quarters.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our GWP reduction in Q3 was less than the previous quarters as our prices were more
competitive in a stable market. We also continued to see the beneﬁts and improvements
in our pricing and our claims capability.
Now, on to claims where currently our trends have been a little mixed in the year with
high and large bodily injury volatility, partially oﬀset by good experience in small bodily
injury. In terms of small BI, from looking at portal stats, we believe we continue to
outperform the market albeit that the market levels of claims have edged up.
Putting all of these together, we expect our current-year loss ratio for Motor in the second
half of the year to be in line with the ﬁrst half. Still a good result in the context of the
market price deﬂation seen over the last two years and reﬂecting our disciplined pricing
strategy, claims transformation as well as LASPO. And as I said earlier, LASPO has now
worked through the system, so we expect underlying inﬂation to return to the market.
We've completed our third quarter reserve review, which included large bodily injury. And
these conﬁrm the strength of our reserve position and our expectation of signiﬁcant
reserve releases in 2014, both in the ongoing business and the runoﬀ segment. Levels of
reserve releases are expected to be lower in future years albeit still signiﬁcant.
I want to update on the regulation front. The CMA published its ﬁnal report on the private
motor market in September. We're pleased with many of the measures outlined, which,
on balance, should be good for customers including the banning of most wide and mostfavoured nation clauses, a change that should encourage competition between PCWs.
However, we were disappointed that CMA wasn't able to ﬁnd a solution for credit hire.
But overall, we don't expect these changes to have a signiﬁcant impact on our business.

FINAL

So, in summary, a second quarter stable prices in Motor, but this should be set against the
market where structural claims deﬂation has now pretty much worked its way through the
system.
So now, on to UK Home. In Home, year-to-date IFPs were down 4.3%, and within that own
brands, we're down 3.7% with partners down 5.8%. This reﬂects an increasingly
competitive market and changes in distribution trends as well as lower new business
volumes in partners. As partners continue to evolve their sales journeys, we expect to see
a relative increase in own brands versus partners going forward.
In the ﬁrst quarter, in-force policies were down only 0.9%, an improvement compared with
a 2% reduction in Q2, whilst GWP was down 5% in the third quarter versus the third
quarter last year, which is in line with the trend in the prior year.
On the back of strong underlying claims performance, which reﬂected the beneﬁts from
recent pricing and claims initiatives, we chose to trade a bit harder in the quarter. Home
retention continued at good levels.

Bloomberg Transcript

While I'm on the subject of Home, let me give you a brief update on weather costs. It was
another benign quarter, so total weather-related costs year-to-date remain unchanged at
£64 million compared with around £5 million in the ﬁrst nine months of 2013. Commercial
was also unchanged at £16 million.
In Rescue and other personal lines, underlying GWP was up 3.7% year-to-date, although
the headline showed a 4.4% reduction as the prior year includes some life premiums.
Rescue have continued to grow GWP and IFPs with premiums up 5.6% in the ﬁrst nine
months due to improved competitive propositions and customers purchasing higher
levels of cover.
Outside of UK personal lines, Commercial continues to grow with IFPs up 3.9% year-todate and GWP up 2.8%. Within this we saw double-digit growth in eTrading and Direct
Line for Business products, excluding van, partially oﬀset by Commercial van, which
similar to personal motor has been highly competitive.
So, to wrap up the key messages, we reiterate our 95% to 97% combined operating ratio
target based upon normal weather claims. Within this, we expect our current year loss
ratio in Motor in the second half to be in line with the ﬁrst half and also to include
signiﬁcant reserve releases.
Commercial remains on track to achieve a sub 100% COR, again, assuming normalized
weather claims and large losses and these CORs are underpinned by our £1 billion cost
target in 2014, which we are on track to achieve.
In terms of the market, we saw another quarter of stable prices in UK Motor whilst in
Home we saw further deﬂation. Against this backdrop, we are busy driving forward our

strategic initiatives by further developing customer propositions, driving greater eﬃciency
and improving our underwriting capabilities.
With that, I'm going to hand back to Rose for questions.

FINAL

Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. And your ﬁrst question, sir, comes from the line of Gordon Aitken. Please
ask your question.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Good morning, Gordon.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Morning. Three questions please. First, your costs are down 6% year-on-year, and just at
the end of September, if you can update us on how many people you have and how many
sites you're running with? Secondly on telematics, obviously, good progress here. Can
you just update us on some penetration rates and maybe talk a little bit about proﬁtability,
although I know it's early days really to the non-telematics business? And just third on
brands, you obviously mentioned something about your own brands relative to the other
brands, just how are each of the brands performing at the moment?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Great. Thanks, Gordon. Three big questions there. Let me do them in reverse order. So, I
mean, starting with the brands, the big news, I guess, is all the stuﬀ which we've done on
Direct Line, obviously the splashiest thing, the most notable thing that people see is the
new advertising campaign. We researched it extensively, researched really, really well.
And the initial response has been absolutely in line with the pre-research. So the brand
metrics are moving forwards. We're pleased with the sales performance.
So I think the new advertising is capturing people's imagination and again, moving
people's perception as the brand forward. The key thing about advertising is, of course,
advertising is there to catch the attention for the messages and we continue to move
forward the proposition. One of the things which we've got on air, allowing people to
report claims using their smartphone or digital and then for urgent items like TVs to get
those on their way within eight hours of the claim being notiﬁed.
So we've got some really propositions and we've got a pipeline of future propositions to
come because it's not just about the advertising format albeit the advertising format is
really good. And we're piloting lots of other cool things on Direct Line in terms of, for
example, the contact center model. So, we have a product where we're allowing agents to
sell multiple products for one brand, whereas at the moment we have agents selling one
product for lots of brands. So that should help cross-sells going forward.

FINAL

So we're really excited about Direct Line. Churchill is on our stat for 2015 to do a similar
sort of exercise on Churchill. And Privilege is a bit of unsung hero in our portfolio.
Privilege is a really good value brand and we're pleased with its performance. So I think
we're doing a nice job.
Again, there's no point of having three brands if they're all identical, appealing to same
customers with the same propositions. And I think, again, behind the scenes, we think
we're doing a better job of sorting out which brands and for which customers,
diﬀerentiating the propositions so that we appeal to more customers than we could with
just one brand.
The partner brand trend, I think you've picked up on and I think that's just a comment on –
and I'm not the ﬁrst to report this. There are clearly some changing dynamics in the
partner sales models and so they're important part of our book, but we're seeing slightly
changing trends between the brands – our own brands and other partners.

Bloomberg Transcript

On telematics, I think the new news, telematics book grew 50% in the quarter. So that's
just hard. I think we're in the early stages. It's growing fast. The encouraging thing for us is
the uptick we've seen on Web participation. So we're taking the messages which we've
learned matter to people on the phone and I now put those on the website. So we're
seeing a really good uptick now on the Web penetration not just on the phone.
We're early now into the renewal season and all I'd say is the encouraging thing for us is
overall renewal levels are up. But most pleasingly, renewals amongst the drivers, which
we now want as a result of seeing their driving behavior, really are improved. So we are
seeing good retention of better drivers. I think the full set of proﬁt characteristics of that,
we're going to have to have a bit more time to bed in, but we are really pleased to be on –
I think on the right side of the telematics trends and we see that whilst still small I think
doing everything that we'd expect and hoped and we expect to keep that momentum up
over the next few quarters. I'm going to hand across to John on costs.

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
Yeah. Just I think the facts on that. Excluding International, we've got just below 11,000
FTE and 11 COR sites. I think that was the question. (15:25)

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Yeah, super. Thanks.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Okay. Rose?

Operator
Yes. Thank you, sir. Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Tanna. Please ask your
question.

Hi, Ravi.

FINAL

Q - Ravi Tanna

{BIO 16926941 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. This is Ravi from Goldman. Just three questions please. The ﬁrst one is
on the home insurance market. Earlier in the year, you had mentioned that some of the
increase in competition that resulted from the spillover eﬀects from motor players coming
in and becoming a bit more aggressive. Are you still seeing that? Do you expect that to
reverse as the motor market stabilizes? And can you just speak a little bit more about
whether the home insurance competition is more structural, cyclical?
And the second question is could you perhaps just elaborate a little bit in terms of –
you've talked about this mix shift from partner distributions to own brands? Can you
perhaps just remind us a little bit more about the proﬁtability through each of those
channels and any diﬀerences there?
And then thirdly and ﬁnally, on the Motor book, you've de-risked a little bit over the
course of the quarter. Could you just speak a little bit about your attitudes towards
potentially at what stage you would think about re-risking the book or what the
considerations have been in that segment of the market?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Fine. Okay. Let me do them in reverse order. So, I would – nothing would please me more
than see a slight uptick in risk mix because we would only do that if we did it safely. We're
not going to suddenly kind of chase higher risk business. But I think we're getting in
place, many of the tools to increase the risk mix.
I mean actually, the fact that risk mix kind of ticks downwards is partly also a function of
the mix between retention and new business. If you do more retention than new business,
every year your book kind of gets safer because as cars get older and people have a
year's extra driving experience. So, that's a bit of a drag when we've been going through
the sort of period we were going through with less new business.
What I mean by the tools, some of our 30 pricing models or pricing projects are
speciﬁcally to try and work out the sub segments of attractive higher premium business
and we've got some good early leads on that. So, that should come through. Telematics is
another tool helping us get out to some of those higher premium business. So, I would
really like to see just as the IFP trends market permitting, looking – we've got some
positive trends even within the quarter in terms of the IFP trends, obviously, the next
frontier is then to get the AVP to get the stability in the top line, which should be a nice
outcome, not our objective, an outcome of all the hard work that we're doing.
On Home, I'm going to be a bit bashful on proﬁtability of partners because that is
something they wouldn't want us to disclose. But a generic point obviously, partners want
to make a return on it and within these arrangements, I think, it's well-known that
obviously the distribution, obviously, is a very proﬁtable business to be in. So, you can
Page 7 of 24

FINAL

make your own kind of observation. So that's probably all I can say. I can't be drawing any
further on that.
I think, in terms of the – what's causing the Home marketplace to be more competitive? I
think there's two things. So, we are seeing panels taking – having a big role and sitting
behind the panels, probably some reinsurance capacity. And I think you know about the
state of the reinsurance market. So, as you can judge well that's cyclical or structural. I'm
sure you know a lot more about the reinsurance proﬁt signals than I do.
And then, the second thing is, yes, some of the motor competitors are trying to grow their
home books. And again, if they're being successful not proﬁtable, I guess that probably is
something they'll continue to do.

Bloomberg Transcript

Said against that, I guess my tonality is slightly more positive than it was a quarter ago
because a few things have happened. I mean, we do make our own knock on (19:20)
Home. We've got – we continue to improve the claims process both giving customer
beneﬁts and in terms of indemnity costs, a lot of these pricing projects, the 30 pricing
projects are giving us good improvements in underlying performance in Home. We've
continued to move forward our propositions. We continue to refresh our marketing. And
that is translating through to two things I'm really pleased about. First of all, our retention
rates are staying at very, very good levels. I'm very pleased with our retention rates on
Home and that's obviously very important.
What's new in the third quarter is we used some of the ﬁre powers we've got, some of the
fuel which we've generated by all these initiatives to turn that into us trading a bit harder.
And again, the IFP trend even within the quarter was quite positive on our own brands.
So, we are not taking a more competitive market line down. We're very, very active in the
marketplace. And I was quite pleased with some of the trends in Q3, albeit in the context
of the market that goes down 1 percentage point on new business a month.

Q - Ravi Tanna

{BIO 16926941 <GO>}

Great. Thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Andy Hughes. Please ask your
question.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Morning, Andy.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Look, I have some – hi – a few questions if I could. The ﬁrst one is about the 95% to 97%
guidance for the year. Obviously, that's normal weather conditions and we're probably a
bit more benign than that. But the problem I've got is obviously you've got exceptional

Page 8 of 24



Company Name: Direct Line Insurance Group PLC

Date: 2014-10-31

FINAL

reserve releases this year coming through. And even though you've got the exceptional
reserve releases, you haven't reduced the guidance for your expected combined ratio for
the year. Could you kind of perhaps explain why and what that means possibly for the
combined ratio next year? Are you kind of signaling that you expect the 95% to 97% to be
worse next year as a result of lower reserve releases?
Third question is, I guess, it's two years since the IPO now. So, it'd be quite good to get a
view of where we are on the restructuring two years on. It still feels like many of the issues
are still there, declining vehicle count, pressure in the markets, expenses have been
reduced, but they still feel quite high. I'm just trying to get a feel as to how you think
things are going? Whether they're going as well as you hoped for? Certainly, on the
current year combined ratios, I would have expect them to be a lot lower by now. And
certainly, peers are reporting much lower current year numbers. So, maybe you can talk
about that?
And the ﬁnal point is on the large claims. I think you mentioned for the ﬁrst time – I think
you mentioned in the half year, but certainly in this statement today, you're talking about
increased number of large claims. Is that something that happened in Q3? And can you
maybe perhaps discuss what's going on there? Thank you.

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure, Andy. (22:03).
John here. Firstly, weather, benign third quarter, not very benign ﬁrst half, overall normal,
pretty normal year-to-date. I don't know what's going to happen the rest of the year,
certainly normal until 30 September, been very nice in the last few days.
What 95% to 97%, yes, we're going to have slightly higher reserve releases than we
thought when we set the 95% to 97%. And I guess, yes, our current year will be a little bit
worse than we thought we'd be getting. And why is that? Well, the main reason is that
normally or in the last couple of years, we've had CY improve over the year. And that's
probably not going to happen in the second half, which is why we made the – given the
guidance of the current year that the second half will be similar to the ﬁrst half.
And why is that not happening? Well, I mean, that's a combination of a few things that
have happened like the spike and I will call it the spike in BI claims, which I'll come back to
in a minute, and general trading conditions. So, we aren't quite going to make the CY we
wanted. I think the other point on the CY is that we do each reserve in a very conservative
way and so we haven't fully taken into account, LASPO frequency beneﬁts, for example.
We've still got quite a bit of that to come through. And that continues to be relatively slow
recognition. So, that's the reason why the CY hasn't improved much in the second half or
improved in the second half.
Let's talk about the BI cases and then maybe say something about next year. The BI cases,
we're talking about a lot of small numbers and these are the top end of the range of size
bands and we get very few, but we get a few more than very few. That's quite a bumpy
random spike.

FINAL

We do not think it's a trend. We've looked at all the individual cases in the greatest detail.
They're always in risk appetite. There's no connections to any risk mix activity or anything
like that. It does feel to us is totally random, but it's going to have an impact. Now, the
impact is going to be mitigated by the reinsurance reform, which obviously is better than
we had in previous years.
So, we think that is I would like to say one-oﬀ. It's certainly a bit of random volatility. About
the GWP, the third party data which just came out looks like years up to 2013 were quite
random and there's a bit of randomness for us anyway 2014.
What does it mean for next year? Well, there's obviously some bits to it. Starting with the
prior year, we're saying that prior year won't be as good and coming oﬀ obviously a very
high level. So that will still be signiﬁcant and still be signiﬁcant in the future years, too.
We will work hard. We are determined to get our current year down and through actions
we're taking on claims, on pricing and so on. We will do things on cost as well. Although
we can't always commit that our cost ratio will be better period-on-period. We managed
to do that so far. We can't commit it will always do that, but we will drive our cost down.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, it's going to be hard work, but we will give some perhaps some guidance at the yearend about our COR. Now, it's probably a bit early to start talking about that.
Now, you did ask a broader question about looking back the last two or three years and
we think we've done a good job on that. And Paul maybe is the right person to comment
on that.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yeah. I think we've got conﬁdence from the last two years that we can execute staﬀ and I
think I'm really proud of lots of things that we've done. Yeah. I think our claims
performance is kind of market leading now. I think our pricing's really getting there. I think
that we've done a good job on costs albeit with very high starting point. And I think
they're starting to get on to the front foot on technology, telematics and marketing and
propositions and brands.
Now, am I in a state of saying anything other than we've got still a load more opportunity
in this business to go at, absolutely, we have. So £1 billion is absolutely not the end
destination on costs. There is a lot of opportunity to drive our cost down and we will. We
just might not do require a target for reasons I've explained previously, which is there are
downsides to setting out the targets, but don't mistake that for my determination to get
our costs down. There's still a lot of scope for our cost to get better and that's certainly
ﬁrmly in our sights.
I think in terms of the IFP trends, we are trading harder. We are slightly – the mood of the
business has changed a bit. So (26:38) with Mike Holliday-Williams here. He's trading this
business harder and our marketing is working. We've got some really good things going
on and we've got a long list of things we're working on.
Page 10 of 24

So, I think don't mistake anything I've said for any sign of complacency, but we have
conﬁdence about us, I think, from what we've achieved over the last two years and there's
a lot more to do in the next – in the coming years and we're up for it.

Hi, Will.

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hey there, guys. You've touched on the Home market a fair bit there, but overall, just a
quick one on it. You're increasing your competitiveness. Headlines, generally, are pretty
negative on that market. Is it your cost savings that gives you so much conﬁdence and
your new systems is being put in place? And is it a fair reﬂection for us just to be thinking,
if you're being more competitive, we might see IFP grows, but possible margin
deterioration here. So year-on-year, we shouldn't be expecting much improvement
overall.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yeah. That's right. I think the – what we've said about this is, as of – so pretty much the end
of last year, we were pulling oﬀ some fantastic thing, which we were keeping our policy
count ﬂat at market-leading levels and keeping our proﬁtability ﬂat at market-leading
levels. And that was the picture.
Now, what we've said is the market competitiveness means that keeping exactly both
exactly ﬂat is very challenging. And we've made trading choices, which are either
probably in favor of one or other on a daily, weekly basis. What I've seen in the third
quarter is a much, much more stable, and especially within the quarter, top line picture
supported by very, very good retention and a much more aggressive stance in the new
business marketplace, and at still attractive loss ratios. Whether we can keep loss ratios
exactly as low as they have been, that may not be possible, but we're going to optimize
between the two and retain much of the book and retain pretty much all of the book in
own brands and keep a very attractive level of proﬁtability. That's some of the goals we
seek for that business.
And I'm encouraged by the Q3 trends that we can do that more than I was saying in Q2.
But that is a very impressive thing, I think, in a market that is, as I've said is going down 1%
pretty much a quarter in terms of new business pricing, but we have some very profound
assets here. And we're playing a long-term game. So, we recruit customers with a long –

view to their long-term proﬁtability and we have real long-term assets. We have amazing
data, which gives us insight into the market. If you're new to the home market, you're new
to any of these perils. You don't know about the state of water and ﬂooding and ﬁre and
substance and burglary. These are new things which you learn. We have fantastic supply
chain in place. We have some great supply chain deals. We have some great technology

So, we have a lot to give in the Home marketplace and we're going to be very
competitive in that.

Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Crean. Please ask your
question.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Good morning, all. A couple of questions. Firstly, I wanted to investigate a bit further on
when you're saying we're returning to underlying claims inﬂation in the motor market.
What level of claims inﬂation would you expect for 2015, in terms of burn cost? And also,
to what extent has the oversized reserve releases been a function of falling claims
inﬂation, as it's come through in the last few years? That was one question. The second
question is just a mathematical one. Could you give us the level of reserves and/or
investments sitting behind your run-oﬀ book and the proﬁle of how rapidly you think that
that will run oﬀ?

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
Right. Hi, Andrew, it's John here.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Hello.

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
Underlying claims, ﬁrst of all, we've done a bit of work on sort of taking the pieces – the
third party working party material has been updated. And it does look like whatever

Page 12 of 24



Company Name: Direct Line Insurance Group PLC

period you take, claims inﬂation, severity inﬂation has been about 5% in whatever period
you take.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah.

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
And then there's been some frequency improvements, relatively small frequency
improvements. There is also which is maybe that the burning cost inﬂation will be less
than 5%. So, that's the kind of assumption we would use in our own planning for market
inﬂation. We're not making forecast, we're just saying based on history.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

And also, we have track record. Our ambition is, obviously, to do better than market.

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
Yeah, absolutely. And then, LASPO has been a very big factor in a huge amount of noise,
but we believe (32:06). And therefore, we're assuming more likely that market would
return to more like a normal level of inﬂation. But as Paul said, that's not going to be our
inﬂation or any individual or other company's inﬂation. So, it depends on what we actually
do, which is we're very ambitious to improve on.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

If the market's looking at 5% burn cost or 4%, 5% burn cost inﬂation, why isn't it raising
rates?

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
Paul?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, that's the question for other people. I think rates...

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Okay. Why aren't you raising rates?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Well, you can be pleased with rates, I guess, not going down. Also, that it's not going
down as much. I think we've been quite clear, which is we have – we've been – I think
we've priced down less than the market and we think we have better claims inﬂation than
the market. So, that's a question for other people.

The PY, the prior-year question, which was – I think there was oversized prior-year reserve
releases due to falling claims inﬂation. And yeah, well, it's a combination of that and of
conservatism in the ﬁrst place. And there was something behind the question there.

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein

Q - Andrew J. Crean

Yeah. No. Just the degree to which the – I mean the level of prior-year reserve release has
surprised even yourselves, isn't it, given your forecasts at the beginning of the year.

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
We thought we'd get a lot...

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
... and we've got more than we thought. And as we've seen in some of those charts and
we haven't produced them again this quarter but we probably will at the year-end. We do
think there's a lot of built-in conservatism in our reserves. So, it's not surprising we'll get
quite a lot of reserve release. We think that's – the signiﬁcance of those will continue for
quite a while, although they will not be maintained at the current level.
And we – part of which is driven by the sheer amount of change that's going on because
when our reserving team see change, they will – that may be good or bad, we don't know,
but we're not going to just assume it's built-in till it's absolutely clear that it has. And so, I
think as we get change, the change is good in terms of claims, we'll tend to get
conservatism building up. And it could happen again, but (34:23) I think we'll just come
back to you on that one.

{BIO 6587493 <GO>}

Yeah. She pointed that out to me the other day. Just three questions. One of your peers
mentioned, in terms of regulatory changes, that these independent medical reports still
all have to be bid down and they implied there was some beneﬁt there in terms of small
BI. I wonder if you'd comment on that.
Second question is you said something in your comments about you're having better
pricing – or lower prices than your peers in Rescue, so I want you talk about that. And the
third point is, I noted I think the rating agencies had – S&P in particular, had said that
you're currently running a AAA capitalization. And they saw that coming down to AA over
time, even in the context of your A ﬂat stable rating. I don't know if you want to make
some comments about it. To me, that implies that we're going to have special dividends
continuously for the next few years because basically, the latter (35:53) take three, four
notches oﬀ your rating. I don't know if you want to talk about that.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. It's cool. I've got Steve Maddock here, just update on the regulatory.

A - Steven Maddock
Yeah. Hi, Greig. I think in terms of the whiplash reforms, I think the ﬁrst set of reforms that
we've seen around the ﬁxed costs and medical reporting, I think certainly when we've
looked at this in terms of a market impact, we think that sort of any beneﬁt that you would
see from a market perspective is likely to be oﬀset by the composite sort of ban on
settlement of claims without a med report. So, we think that's probably from a market
perspective, the ﬁrst set of reforms are likely to be cost neutral.
I think in terms of the second tranche of initiatives around the cab rank approach to
medical practitioners, I think we just don't have enough data. And I think whether we see
a reduction in cost M&A from that will really lie on the strength of the accreditation
process. And I think we just don't have – we're not sighted on that at the moment. So, I
think from a market perspective, it's a pretty brave call to say that we're going to see a lot
of reduction from that at this point in time.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

On to Rescue, I mean, I think the ﬁrst thing about Rescue is, it's not just about price. And if
you – it's a bit of an advert for Green Flag, but Green Flag does a very good job of getting
to you quickly. If they don't get to you within an hour, we'll give you half the price next
year. Misfuelling cover is included in the standards and our normal policy, and it's not in
our competitors, and we repair a lot of the road sides and all that stuﬀ.

And as well, we have really great prices. The market is a very proﬁtable market. And
therefore, we can have kind of insurgent pricing and still be very proﬁtable. And so, we're
quite enjoying that position. So that's that. S&P, John?

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
Yeah. Talking about the capital side, Greig, yeah, well, it'd be nice to be regulated by S&P
only. And we do obviously have very strong capital on their basis. It's a very diﬀerent
methodology from the one that really matters at the moment, which is the ICAS regime.
So, principally, S&P will be a bit heavier on market risk, but a lot lighter on reserving risk.
And so, we come out very strong on their measure. But on ICA, I mean we're pretty open
about where we are, not exactly with the regulator, but in terms of our own economic
capital model, which is pretty similar to the ICA model. And we were around 149% at the
last reporting date, which was June. And we talked about what things might move in
either direction and what our attitude is to the risk appetite buﬀer that we hold on a range
of that. So I think everyone pretty much should understand that.
I mean, the other factor clearly is the transition to Solvency II. And I said this before, so I
hope you don't mind me repeating it, but it's possible to be optimistic about the longterm impact of that on capital requirements because some of the methodology in
Solvency II if you go to the internal model is potentially more favorable than the ICA
regime. And that may be helpful in the future. However, there's a lot of ground to cover
before we get there, including whether you will get your internal model approved, when
it'll be ready, how some of the challenges which you'll get from the regulator will operate
during that period and so on, and a lot of that is yet to settle. There are a lot of moving
parts and uncertainty about that. One thing we do know is we won't be operating on the
internal model from day one anyway. It'll take us at least six months to move on to that.
And during the initial period, we'll be on the standard formula, which is a lot less – which
you can be a lot less positive than about the eventual internal model.
But I don't want you to get worried about it because I'm not worried about the standard
formula. We do have strong capital and I'm sure we'll be ﬁne on the standard formula. We
might be better on the internal model one day.
So, what does mean in terms of dividends? Well, I think, again, our stance, I think, is
hopefully reasonably well understood, i.e., we will be reasonably transparent and we
won't hoard and we'll tell you where we are and our risk appetite and why. And if we are
holding more than we think we need, we will pay it back and we have.

Q - Greig N. Paterson

{BIO 6587493 <GO>}

Just remind me on the timing. When is six months after the internal model? When do you
envisage the date in terms of internal model approval, six months after what date?

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
Yes. So, our most optimistic ambition would be that we would operate on the internal
model from the 1 of July 2016.

Good morning.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Fahad U. Changazi

{BIO 15216120 <GO>}

Hello. Good morning. Just got two very quick follow-up questions, ﬁrstly, on Andrew's.
Given you were trading a bit harder in Q3 and given your expectation of the claims
inﬂation going forward, how are you planning your strategy to the pricing? Are you going
to wait for others to see what they are doing? For example, I do know that Aviva did say
that they don't see a major catalyst for a demonstrable increase in rates. So, just some
thoughts around that in respect of the environment. And the other question is just on
Andy's question. I'm sorry if you already said this and I missed it, but did you say where
the claims spike was in terms of relation to the year? And where are you seeing the
reserve releases in terms of large claims bodily injuries, as well in terms of years? Thanks.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Okay. I mean, in terms of pricing, I'm going to plead the ﬁfth or whatever you say. We are
very loath to talk about future pricing. I think it's an inappropriate thing to talk about. But
we make trading decisions daily, weekly, monthly and I think we've got a track record of
optimizing quite well between value and volume. Yeah. So, I think that's probably what I
want to say. John?

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
Yes. So, the spike is really across the year and starting in about April and then we did the
big review. That's obviously a notiﬁcation thing. And then there's a big review, which we
did at Q3. So, the numbers are (43:05) in Q3, but I'd say we think it's a spike. So, let's not
spend too much time on it.

Good morning, gentlemen. Just one quick question concerning the sale of the
International business. Could you just explain what factors aﬀect the diﬀerence between
the cash sale proceeds and the net proceeds?

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
Yeah. Primarily, transaction costs is the answer to that one. Primarily, transaction costs. We
don't expect any tax or any signiﬁcant tax. So it's really just the transaction cost. Maybe
(44:06) foreign exchange movement, but it's going to be pretty small.

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. Can I ask a couple of questions, please, on the commercial
market? I'm talking about that year-to-date. You talked about, I think, weather now
normalizing over the course of 2014 year-to-date. Does that mean that potentially your
Commercial may deliver a headline combined operating ratio of around 100% by yearend, assuming we get a more normal Q4?
Secondly, if you just talk a little bit about the market dynamics there in Commercial and
where pricing is going in some of the major segments there? And then ﬁnally, just on

Page 18 of 24



Company Name: Direct Line Insurance Group PLC

investment income. You're talking about re-risking in Q4 further, where do you think the
average yield on the portfolio can go from here? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

So, ﬁrst question, yes. So, if the weather turns out to be normal then it'll be 100% is a
target. The other caveat which we've got is some extraordinary kind of large loss proﬁle,
but none so far, but still only – we've got ﬁreworks night and Halloween to get through us
I suppose.
The – in terms of the trends we're seeing, I think we've kind of given a little bit away in the
IMS on that. So, the van market is highly competitive and we are, again, value seeking in
that. Even that said, I think we can do better on the van market going forward. We have a
lot of kind of key assets there. We've got – all our Motor assets should transfer into the van
market. So, I think that's one for the future. But right now, with our current capabilities,
we're being a bit cautious in the van marketplace.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think the positive news for us is on the bits where we're making strategic investments.
Direct Line for Business and the eTrading part kind of NIG with – outside the van
marketplace growing nicely and we're pleased with the proﬁtability of them. And I think
as we said, Commercial have lots of, we think, attractive parts within it and those are the
ones which we're targeting.
So, I think, Commercial market – the overall Commercial business I think has done a great
job to get to the 100%. We want it to do better than 100% to get towards the 15% RoTE for
that business as well. But it's a fantastic staging post and I think we'll obviously be saying
more next year about where we go next on Commercial, but it's very great core business
and performing well.
Yeah. John, do you want to...

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
Yeah. Just on the investment side, I'm probably not going to answer your question in a
helpful way, I mean, we will probably update on our normal chart at year-end. I mean, I
think in the interim, we're – yeah, we're trying to eke out a few basic points here and there,
again, with the diversiﬁcation approach. So, it's not really re-risking within existing – within
the kind of conventional debt area. It's by spreading around and ﬁnding niches that ﬁt
with our maturities or which represent a diversiﬁcation in some other ways. In private
placement, it's re-risking in the sense of – yeah, we're taking liquidity risks rather than
extra credit risk. And I think that's probably a good idea because we are very, very liquid.
We have loads of gilts and cash. We've done lots of stress testing of multiple weather
events and all coming at once with a ﬁrework display as well. And I think we got enough
cash to pay out. But we can take a bit of liquidity risk so why not? That applies to
infrastructure as well.
Rate-wise, return-wise, yes, we're eking that out. We're going to get some pickup from
some of these things, but equally the news on the rate – on the yield curve or on risk-free
Page 19 of 24

is not particularly positive. I mean, it keeps being longer, and lower and longer and,
therefore, I can't promise you that the whole – the totality when we add it up at the yearend will be much better. We'll give you that ﬁgure then.

FINAL

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Just maybe just got one quick follow-up. It's just also you were talking
about progress you're making in telematics. When you look around the telematics
proposition, is there any areas where you feel that you really need to invest by – and I'm
talking here more about investing in maybe third-party ﬁrms to help you progress the
telematics business? I mean, obviously, you have made investments already in The Floow,
et cetera? Are there more sizeable investments that you might need to be doing there to
really make it work?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No. And I think we're really happy with The Floow, great investment, great company,
which is doing very well. So, that's good. I mean, I think we've also said, we're relatively
device agnostic. We kind of quite like our OBD box, but as technology changes, boxes
will change and whether they'll be installed in cars. So, we need to be quite ﬂeet of foot, I
think, as technology enables better devices or cheaper devices, because device costs and
data costs are barrier to this becoming – we can kind of make it – we can make it work
really easily for young drivers down to 1000. We can kind of make it work down to 500. To
get it any lower than 500, we need to continue to see innovation in the device and the
data costs.

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
And The Floow helps in there because they are device agnostic – they have a device
agnostic business model, so that's why it makes sense. If something else really attractive
came along, modest in scale, who knows, we could.

Morning, chaps. Just another one on telematics. You mentioned in your half year about
Commercial ﬂeets and things like that and that you were doing a couple of trials. I wonder
whether you're able to talk a little bit more about the progress that you've made with that
and whether you've seen any beneﬁt to the business? And also, you're relationship with
your suppliers is on all of that sort of stuﬀ. Are you kind of rolling it out in other areas at
the moment? I wonder whether you could just sort of talk on that?

Yeah. It's very early days on Commercial. I mean, conceptually, it works quite well in
Commercial because people don't have a choice whether to have it ﬁtted or installed or
any of that stuﬀ. And the data is useful to ﬂeet operators on a number of fronts, including
driver safety and where people are and all that stuﬀ.
So, conceptually, it's quite a big one for Commercial and most of our eﬀort is currently
going into personal line space though. So, we'll kind of – it's a watching brief on
Commercial. It's still early days on the pilot. Was there another question there on the
personal lines, telematics?

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
Suppliers.

Suppliers.

Q - Operator

So, you've pretty much sort of talked about – you talked about The Floow, presumably,
you're going to carry on working with your hardware suppliers as well and roll it out in
that respect as well. You're seeing more growth in these areas. Did you say 50% growth in
terms of the number of people who'd signed up over the last quarter? Did I understand
that correctly?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean, I think, 50% growth, it's oﬀ a relatively low base, but growing nicely. And as I
said, we're pleased with the boxes we've got at the moment, but we need to respond to
whatever trends there are in the marketplace.

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Hello. Good morning. Just a couple of technical questions to ﬁnish up. First, in response
to the question on Commercial, you talked about would like to get to 15% RoTE. Should
we just be sort of pro rata-ing the net asset value across the diﬀerent lines to get to a
combined ratio, or would you like to give us sort of some indicated combined ratio that
that would imply?
And then the other question I've got is, when you return the proceeds from the
International division, I think you sort of half-mentioned that you might do a share

Page 21 of 24

consolidation at the same time. I was just wondering if you'd had any further thoughts on
that?

FINAL

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
Thanks, Oliver. I think probably the simple – the rule thumb I would use is mid 90%s COR
(52:17) RoTE Commercial. I'm not promising in which year they'll get it, but I'm sure they
will. And the other one was share consolidation. Well, yeah, it's something we'll think
about. We haven't said anything deﬁnitive on what we'll do. I mean it will be something
more like special dividend than anything probably more complicated, but share
consolidation. If we're hearing feedback from people and advisors that it's a good thing,
we'd certainly look at it.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Hi, guys. Just following up from the comment about the PRA reserve risk capital, I thought
they allowed reserve prudence to count towards the capital that they assume when doing
their ICA+ (sic) [ICAS+] (53:11) stress test. In which case, if you have an exceptional amount
of reserve releases in a year, can you really pay dividends from that? Because, actually,
what you're doing is moving capital from the reserves to surplus shareholders' equity.
Does that make sense that question? Thanks.

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
Yeah. The way ours works, maybe we're missing something is that the margin we hold and
we haven't said what it is since the IPO, but we did say at that point, does count or most of
it counts towards capital. But the conservatism in your ABE, which we hold a lot, does not
or mostly does not.

...basically doesn't. I mean, some of it might in your proﬁt forecast for the coming year,
whatever, but it doesn't – essentially doesn't. So it's only the margin and we hold more
margin (54:10). We've always said that the reserve release we've been showing you have
not been from the margin.

Right.

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
Yeah. Does that make sense?

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Okay. But the stuﬀ this year, the PPO revision, that will be from the actual underlying
reduction in reserve strength won't it?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
Well, I don't think we've said – we haven't actually said there's been a PPO revision. I
mean, we've said large bodily injury. But wherever it is, it'll be – it's from the (54:34)
assessment, not from the margin. Now, the releases, as you get reserve release – as the
reserve shrink, you get some reduction in margin. To the extent, elements of our margin
are a little bit arithmetic. That's in the elements of our margin. But that's a very small
amount of money compared to any releases you see and also small amount of money in
terms of the balance of conservatism we hold both in the margin and in the ABE. Is that
helpful?

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Yeah, kind of. I think I follow it. So you're saying the reserve releases you're doing in H2 is
not a review of the PPO provisions that's leading to a large exceptional reserve release?

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
It's not particularly PPOs, it's more just bodily injury, bodily excess we call it, bodily injury
excess.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
(55:20) PPOs in there, but it's not the bulk of it.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.
