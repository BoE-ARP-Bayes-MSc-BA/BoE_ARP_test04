MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION

Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Direct Line Q3 Trading
Update. My name is Courtney and I'll be your coordinator for today's event. For the
duration of the call, you will be on listen-only. However, you will have the opportunity to
ask questions.
I will now hand you over to your host, Paul Geddes, to begin today's conference. Thank
you.

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Q3 update. As usual, I'm joined
by John Reizenstein and other members of my management team. Hopefully, you've all
had the chance to read through our trading update and have your questions ready.
Overall, we're pleased with how we traded this quarter, having maintained the strong
momentum across our own brand portfolio and another great quarter for our Direct Line
brand in terms of both policy count and premium growth. We also made progress against
the many initiatives that I set out at the half year. And this trading update, I think, reminds
you of the value of having strong brands, propositions, and customer relationships, and
this has enabled us to deliver good value for our customers and good return to
shareholders.

So on to the headlines, we delivered policy growth in our own brands across Motor,
Home and Commercial Direct, and Rescue, and we're really pleased with the 5.1%
increase or a third of a million additional policies, and again much of this growth was
driven by our Direct Line brand. We maintained strong momentum in Motor growing our
own brand policies by 5.5% year-to-date at good loss ratios. In Home, we are encouraged
the actions we've taken on the escape of water across pricing, claims, and underwriting
have started to show a positive impact albeit it's still early days. And overall, our
continued momentum means that we are on track to deliver full-year combined operating
ratio around the middle of the 93% to 95% target, still assuming normal annual weather.
So, now a few words on each of our business areas starting with Motor. We continued to
grow policy account and premiums particularly across own brands as a result of the great
momentum in Direct Line. Motor own-brand policy account was 5.5%, ahead of the same
point last year. And Q3 premiums were 10% ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

We saw some signs that the market prices starting to ﬂatten in Q3 versus Q2 although
they are still up strongly year-on-year. We're really pleased with how we traded, having
achieved a good balance of growth at or above our target loss ratios, and this was helped
by some favorable experience on claims frequency, which we're not banking as a trend.
Moving on to Home, as I've mentioned upfront, we're pleased with the actions we've
taken to address escape of water claims inﬂation are beginning to bear fruit. These
actions are taken across pricing, underwriting and claims, and have collectively had a
positive impact on escape of water inﬂation. Against this backdrop, we traded well,
growing policy count and premiums across our own brands. In Home Partners, we
continue to see a reduction in policy count and premiums in line with historic trends.
And a few words on weather, it's been another fairly benign quarter, so we're below our
weather event load although it's still too early to bank this as a beneﬁt. A reminder that
our overall core guidance includes a normal annual Home weather load of around £65
million.
In Rescue, it's another strong quarter for our Green Flag brand. At the end of Q3, in-force
policies were 10% ahead of last year. Linked (03:44) Rescue also achieved double-digit
growth helped by higher Motor volumes and our Churchill promotion.
And in our Rescue Partners, I'm delighted to announce that we've just agreed to renew
our arrangement with Royal Bank of Scotland to continue to supply Rescue services to its
bank customers for another ﬁve years.
Finally, Commercial, which grew policy count and premiums in Q3, policy count was 5.8%
ahead of the same period last year, largely driven by the continued growth in Direct Line
for Business, which was 8% ahead of prior year. Commercial premiums overall grew a little
in Q3, as the great performance in Direct Line for Business was almost fully oﬀset by lower
premiums in NIG, where we continued to focus on returns.

FINAL

A few words now on costs and our ongoing investment across the business, as well as
some perspective on the potential impairment we ﬂagged in the statement. As you know,
we're undertaking an extensive transformation agenda, investing in multiple initiatives
and systems aimed at improving our customer experience, supporting our growth and
improving the eﬃciency of our business.
The investment in systems span policy, pricing, payments and other related data and
digital systems across the business. And as we said before, we expect to incur capital
expenditure on average of around £80 million to £100 million per year, up to and
including 2019.
For example, as you saw at the half year, Direct Line for Business successfully launched a
leading new platform for small business customers, which is progressing well and we're
planning to rollout our next update around the end of the year, which will include Bed
and Breakfast.

Bloomberg Transcript

Overall, we made good progress on initiatives to improve our eﬃciency and we're on
track to deliver a better business as usual expense ratio lower than last year at 24%.
However, as can happen with this level of change, not everything has gone as we'd have
liked. And we recently decided to rework some elements so as to give us the
performance levels that we demand.
As our impairment review is underway, this could lead to an impairment charge at the
year-end somewhat higher than last year's level. Impairments, remember, are non-cash
items and so have no impact from a capital position, but would impact the headline
expense ratio. And ﬁnally, on the outlook where a strong performance in Motor gives us
conﬁdence that even with our potential impairment, we can deliver around the middle of
the combined operating ratio target of between 93% and 95%, still assuming the full
annual weather load.
We've made great progress on costs and are on track to reduce our business as usual
expense and commission ratios. For investments, we increased our guidance from 2.4% to
an income yield of 2.5% in 2017. Please note, we continue to expect assets under
management to decline modestly. So, in summary, we are pleased with how we traded
this quarter. We maintained a strong momentum across our own brand portfolio and
particularly Direct Line.
And with that, operator, we'll go to questions.

Q&A

Okay. Okay. So, our ﬁrst question comes in from the line of Thomas Seidl calling from

Good morning, Thomas.

FINAL

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning, Paul. Three questions, if I may. On Home, it seems that most of
your actions had impacted the claims side, while the average premium seems to be down
year-on-year. And so, I wonder if you could give some color why it is so diﬃcult not only
for Direct Line, but for the whole market to re-price for the obviously higher claims costs.
Is this related to the increase in price comparison penetration or what is the key driver
here? That's the ﬁrst question.
Second question is on those impairment charges. To what extent does this imply that you
expect lower proﬁtability going forward or are those impairment charges more related to
technical stuﬀ not coming through as you planned. I would like to have some color, if
possible, on that one. And ﬁnally, on reinsurance, I wonder if you had by now more clarity
how reinsurance costs will change on Motor, in particular for next year. Thank you.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Thanks, Thomas. John is going take all three of those.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
Yeah. Thomas, morning. So, we'll start with Home. And as you say, yeah, we are
encouraged by the results we're getting from the actions we've taken across pricing. But it
wasn't just pricing, of course. It was claims and underwriting. And in combination, those
seems to be working better for us.
But you're right. The market, the Home market remains highly competitive. That is partly
due to distribution channels. PCWs are still growing. Although I would say that we are
pleased and NatWest and RBS are pleased with the progress they're making with us in
their channel. So, I don't think the bank channel is at all in internal decline. It's battling
back. But nevertheless, it's still true that PCWs are growing. And we are trading quite
adequately on PCW. So, we're not too dissatisﬁed with that.
Obviously, in our case, average premium can be aﬀected by risk mix, and we've seen that
before. We'll obviously update that. We don't do that every quarter. We'll update that at
the year-end. In terms of pricing versus claims inﬂation, in our case, having taken the
actions, obviously some pricing is going through. Not quite enough. We always said that
we saw positive (09:33) competitive conditions in this market maintaining very, very, very
healthy loss ratio, which we've had for many years would be tough. But overall, I think
things are coming through more or less on track for us, and we're back on track and we're
happy with where we are.
On impairment, no, we don't think this will have an eﬀect on our proﬁts going forward.
Obviously, we're not happy that we've invested in something that's not quite good
enough and we have to rework. But we can do that rework within the envelop of spend

that we've been talking about for a while. I think £200 million (10:10) for the next couple of
years through the end of 2019 and we're not changing any of our targets for the future so
the answer is not.
And ﬁnally on Reinsurance, yeah, it's going to be interesting or it's (10:23) already
interesting discussions this year with reinsurers. Obviously, for them and for us, we have
to look at how Ogden settlements will settle not today, but maybe in three or four year's
time if there's an accident in the next 12 months.
So, that is going to be an interesting discussion. We go into this discussion with ﬂexibility
and a kind of good balance sheet, which means we probably have choices about how
much reinsurance to get, which brands we want to retain, which brands we want to
reinsure, or there's some type of structures that we can do that maybe work for the
reinsurers as well as us, so we're not too pessimistic. But, yes, clearly, they would like
some (11:00).

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

So, for some players we have seen 30% increase in reinsurance ﬁrst half year (11:05) is this
a good ballpark number or is it coming down because of the reasons – revision of the
Ogden revision if you want?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

I think we're in a negotiation. You wouldn't expect us to show our hands, but I think we've
got a good hand to play. We would expect prices to go up, right? But we're debating the
level, so there's still several weeks to run on the process.

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
And there could be some subtleties in the arrangements. So, they're not quite as simple
as they were in previous years.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

True. Yeah. All right...

The next question comes in from the line of Kamran Hossain calling from RBC. Please go
ahead.

FINAL

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi. Morning. Just coming back to, I guess, the impairment and the investment. Can you
just talk about what potential of the investment might be over the next few years? How we
should kind of think about measuring success on that investment? I mean, is that a lower
expense ratio? So just any color on that would be really helpful? Thank you.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean, I think, listen, let me say a few things. I think the ﬁrst thing is, just to remind
you that we've been improving our systems kind of throughout this period and continue
to do so and launch things. This is not a one-hit wonder. We continue to improve things. I
think the fact our current systems we've improved to the extent we've grown 0.75 million
policies at good loss ratios over the last year. So we're in a pretty good position.

Bloomberg Transcript

And really, therefore, the investment is to get us into a future position to stay ahead of
consumer trends, to continue to grow our businesses, to continue to grow our pricing
sophistication, continue to give customers the experience they want and to deliver more
eﬃciency and you know that we've got a longer-term target to reduce our cost ratios.
So, kind of that – we got a program against that, we got those targets baked in to the new
targets, which we updated at the half year. And we're conﬁdent we're going to deliver
that. I mean, just to put in context what this impairment is about, we have chosen, as
we've done over the last eight years, to invest in really proven products, working with
proven suppliers and we're well advanced on the build of those products.
What happened this time is that what proved a bit harder, and we're reworking how we're
doing it, is the connectivity between those systems and the data ﬂows between those new
systems and legacy. And that's where we weren't getting the levels of performance that
we were looking for. So we decided to rework. We're happy with the way through now.
We'll give you more of an update at year-end. So we are – it's a small part of our overall
change agenda. We've got a good track record. And as I said, this will set us up for the
years and maybe in decades ahead, which is why we're taking our time to get it absolutely
right.

FINAL

Thanks. It's Arjan van Veen. A couple of questions if I may. Firstly, RSA, in the 3Q call you
mentioned that Home pricing that there seems signs of that starting to ﬁnally now move.
So, could you comment a bit about sort of price trends in the last few quarters?
Secondly, on the frequency. The fact you're calling it out, I assume it's more than one
quarter of improving frequency. So, can you give a bit more color on that. And at the
same time, can you also – has there also been any sort of more recent changes in bodily
injury. One of your peers mentioned to us that small (14:45) bodily injury for example has
been more favorable over the last few quarters. And then ﬁnally, can you just give us an
update in terms of when the Churchill reboot is happening? I thought that was in the
fourth quarter and is that still on track?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. The last one, next year, but we're excited about what we're working on in terms of
the Churchill reboot. Listen, on Motor, let me just tell you – give you a little bit more ﬂavor
on Motor. So, we're pleased with how we're trading given the pricing action we've taken.
We've priced ahead of trended claims inﬂation. And 2017 is going to turn out, we think,
better than that trended view of claims inﬂation for two reasons. One is obviously, we've
got favorable post-Ogden reinsurance arrangements. So, we've got this – 2017 is very
favorable for us on reinsurance.
Second is, we are seeing general 2017 is looking like across the year a good year on
frequency. We're not trending that yet We're taking out as a one-oﬀ piece of good news.
We could trend it because you could say, it's linked to the Jack's reform MedCo (15:51)
and autonomous emergency breaking, but we think it's too early to trend that. So, we'll
not. But that's been generally favorable and it has acted as piece of good news.
We're still seeing the same accidental damage trends, which are inﬂationary, but I
wouldn't demure from saying that we're seeing encouraging trends for (16:13) bodily
injury as well. So, 2017 is going to turn out, we think, a good year on Motor. We're not
taking all of that good news forward in terms of our plans.

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
Our Home pricing, yeah, I think we said last time and it's true this time. Home pricing is
up a bit, but it's modest. And I suspect it's not quite enough if only for the market trend
inﬂation. But it's certainly better than it was for many, many quarters period prior to that.

Date: 2017-11-07

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

FINAL

Good morning. I have three questions. Firstly, on the UK claim inﬂation just following from
the last question. Could you quantify what that number is i.e. what's the net of the
accidental damage and frequency? I think at half year, you still said it was running at the
top-end of the 3% to 5% long-term range.
Secondly, on the Ogden, as in is there a time line? Is anything happening? As in I haven't
really heard much on that. And lastly, in terms of impairments, I might have missed if you
made any opening remarks, but what is the diﬀerence in terms of impairment this year
versus what happened last year? What is driving that impairment? Thanks.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yeah. So, Dhruv, listen, we're not giving you a number at this stage on claims inﬂation.
What we're saying is that it's certainly going to be a year when it's – and if something
remarkable happens, it's going to be better than our long-term trend, but we're sticking
our long-term trend in our assumptions still for the outgoing years.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, we're treating Ogden and frequency as kind of one-oﬀs. Ogden, it is clear that the will
of the government is to implement this change, the ability of the government to execute
that change whether it's together with other measures like whiplash on its own (18:06). So,
it's still to be determined. We're clearly running out of weeks for this to happen in 2017, so
I think that's very unlikely now, but we think, hopefully, this will get moving in 2018.
I think the uncertainty about the Ogden timing and whiplash is creating a kind of a market
environment where there's a bit more variation of pricing in Q3 from the market
competitors, which is not an irrational thing, because people are trying to work out
business. Right now, when claims settle, what will be the environment there for Ogden
and for whiplash? So, it's quite hard to call it. But, obviously, we have to make some
assumptions. So, it looks like people are making slightly diﬀerent assumptions, but all
against the backdrop of (18:46) we think a pretty rational market. Do you want to talk
about impairment?

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
Yeah. So, on the impairment, obviously, the context, Dhruv of it is that extensive set of
changes we're making across – a lot of systems across all our products and brands and
channels. Last year, we found some components which weren't going to add suﬃcient
value and we potentially wouldn't complete. So we wrote those oﬀ.
Slightly diﬀerent this year, obviously, we are further advanced. And what we've seen is
that some data and connectivity between the new systems with each other and also back
into our legacy systems doesn't really meet our expectations on things like speed, agility,
cost of ownership and so on and generally (19:35) on performance. So, that's a question
of reworking. So, it's not that we don't need those things. We do need those things, but
we need to work them so that they are as good as we expect them to be.

FINAL

Good morning. Good morning. Could I ask on two things? Firstly, on the politics. Do you
expect Ogden changes to be linked into the same bill as the whiplash changes, which I
think were part of the Queen's Speech?
And, secondly, on large bodily injury claims settling this year, where are they settling? Are
they settling at minus 0.75% or they're settling at around 0% to 1%? And how would you
deal with that in the full year? Will you call out to us, where you're getting a reverse in
some of your Ogden reserving because it's settling at a better rate or will it just go
through the mix?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. Listen, we don't know whether they're going to be separate or
together. We would rather they were separate, because we think there is kind of physical
consensus on Ogden and we want to get on with that. It's obviously up to politicians
(21:28) they want to do.
In terms of where we're settling, currently, it's kind of still early days. We got about 20
claims, where the rate is a material part of the settlement and therefore we got a sense of
it and we're probably not out of line, but I think what RSA said which is, generally, claim
seemed to settling around the new range of 0% to 1%, rather than where Ogden is
currently set. But, I have to say, it's still relatively small numbers.

Bloomberg Transcript

And we'll take the way (22:00) you're suggesting that just to separate them out and think
about it.

The next question comes in from the line of David Bracewell, calling from Redburn. Please

Q - David Andrew Bracewell

{BIO 16394801 <GO>}

Good morning, guys. I have a couple of questions. One, just on the Nationwide deal,
which is going to be expiring anytime soon. I know you talked about the premium
volumes for example. Could you give us anymore clarity on the kind of eﬀect it will have
on proﬁtability and also kind of competitiveness going forward, because of course that
contribution to your ﬁxed expenses there, so I'm just wondering if that will disrupt your
competitiveness in the UK Home market?
And kind of a follow-up on Andrew's question actually, when you talk about the Ogden
claims settling at a slightly better discount rates, at the half year, a lot of your peers have
talked about putting through enough rate increase for actually the new Ogden discount
Page 10 of 18

Date: 2017-11-07

rate of minus 0.75%, I mean, is that do you think the claims which are settling now are
somewhere in the region of 0% to 1%, is that aﬀecting the kind of pricing, is that one of
the reasons why we're seeing, as you called it, a bit of a slowdown in the rates of increase
for motor insurance pricing because actually claims are settling slightly better? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yeah. I think it's quite hard to take the sugar out the tea of all the input costs. But certainly,
we've got a situation where you've got a good frequency here, you've got a favorable
reinsurance arrangement this year, because of course we're not largely on the reinsurance
bill in terms of the Ogden costs. And then, you got a potential change to Ogden and
you've got potential change to whiplash. So, all of those are inputs. And we think,
therefore, the level of rate the market got away in the ﬁrst half is deﬁnitely suﬃcient for all
of that. And, therefore, unsurprising to see how the market is priced in Q3, albeit with a
bit more variation. So, yeah, you're right. There are a number of kind of positive factors
which you should judge the pricing in the market again, which is why we're saying the
market has been pretty rationale.
Nationwide, a few things to say on it. First of all, this is not new news for us. It's been a bit
later than we thought. But our plans have been counting on the loss of Nationwide for a
while. And, therefore, all our longer-term targets, reduction expense ratio, GWP targets
have all been set in the context of Nationwide going. The actions we're taking today have
been to make sure that we can get the variable cost out the business which is – which
we're well advanced in doing. And then, the contribution to ﬁxed cost, which is really
what it is making because in a partnership, some of the proﬁt goes to the partner. The
contribution of the ﬁxed cost is part of our overall challenge of getting our ﬁxed costs
down and getting that ratio down. And we have a number of initiatives to meet that
ambition, including the loss of Nationwide.
A few things to say on partnerships generally though is we have this fantastic partnership
with RBS, and that's working really well. All the investment we've put in, and work with this
joint venture improved the digital journey, to have really fresh propositions seems to be
really working with them. We renewed our rescue partnership deal with RBS which is for
ﬁve years, which is really helpful in terms of the volumes. And partnerships can provide
proﬁt, they can provide volumes, and they could also provide strategic advantage. And
that's why we're very active in the motor manufacturer marketplace where we want to do
partnerships with motor manufacturers because we think that's strategically important.
So, partnerships are very much a part of our future and a part of our plans, and we're
doing pretty well in them actually. As I've said before, I think the loss of Nationwide is a
reﬂection of historic factors rather than kind of where we're at today in terms of our
capability. (25:49)

give some explicit numbers. I wonder if you could talk us around what sort of rate and mix
has been achieved in Motor? That's question one.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second one is I was wondering to what degree this impairment – and whatever you
learned from that, to what extent it would delay the implementation date of your UK –
your new UK Motor IT platform? And then the third question is I believe in the process –
somewhere during this process of impairment, you've decided to no longer use an
internal development team and have gone towards an external vendor. I wonder if you
could tell me who that external – I believe you announced that. I didn't pick it up, though.
Could you tell me who that external vendor is and why you decided to go external versus
internal?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yeah. So, let's start, in terms of – we've decided to be less exhaustive in our disclosure on
our pricing movements in the older quarters, Greig, just because we were over-disclosing
and are slightly competitive in it. What I can say is we are certainly at the right side of the
line in terms of us pricing, in the long term, trendy claims inﬂation. And in terms of mix,
not particularly new trends, but improving mix in terms of (27:31). So we'll give you – we'll
revert to more disclosure on that at the full year.

Q - Greig N. Paterson

{BIO 6587493 <GO>}

That means it's still down, right? Still negative impact?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yes. Yes. Absolutely. So the AVP doesn't do justice to the pricing we've achieved. So we'll
achieve more pricing as implied by the – similar to H1. But we're not going to give explicit
disclosure of the old quarters. So that's positive, Greig. In terms of the program, a few
things. Yeah, listen, we continue to work with a number of vendors, and we don't choose
to disclose who those are and change them time to time. But we continue to work with
people that are – have got good experience of delivering these programs and these
packages globally.

And the good news is they're all proven products, right, that work together with each
other in other insurers around the world, and we are tapping into the right experience to
make sure that we learn from that. So while this is not kind of greenﬁeld, this is not us
(28:35) completely new systems out of the blue. This is – we work with people who know
what they're doing.
You, I think, referred to this as a kind of Motor IP program. The bit which should be
impaired is only a bit of our total overall change program, and it doesn't just relate to
Motor. And I think just on the timing, we've kind of decided that it's – we can take our time
to get it absolutely right because as of today, we are really competitive in the market, we
are winning market share at good loss ratios. A part of that is testament to the fact that we
haven't been sitting still on our systems to-date. Our digital experience is really good. We
win awards for customer experience right now. So we have somewhat the luxury of taking
our time to make sure it's absolutely right. Recognizing that we're building systems for
many years ahead. So we don't feel uncompetitive now.
We'll give you a sense of the sequence of what will come out and this is not one big burst.
As our approach is to all systems, we continue to release things in stages, in phases, and
therefore, we will give you a sense of what those future phases are at year-end.

(29:48). Just trying to understand the logic. My understanding (29:51) for example has
been the models we're using are being implemented by our team internally, and you
spoke to an external team. Is that cost that's cheaper or just basically an internal team
wasn't (30:04)...

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

We do these things in the right way for us and in a most eﬀective way, and we'll use the
people who're best able to do that.

Q - Greig N. Paterson

{BIO 6587493 <GO>}

I'm just speaking to IP, the internal IP in the company, that's obviously something one
pictures as a positive or negative for various companies. So, I'm just trying to understand
or maybe the top management suddenly decides (30:34) with its own internal IP. Is that
(30:36) so just want to try and get to – trying to understand your thinking.

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yeah. I don't think it's about IP. What we're saying is bringing these systems together has
been done many times before. We continue to (30:47) people have got that experience.
So, I don't think it's...

FINAL

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
Our IP is all our data and all our great people do pricing, and propositions, and
marketing. All that's entirely our own, and it's a continuing set of teams and experience
we've got.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

And the other way of thinking about it, Greig, is this – we're buying packages, proven
packages. What we've built within those packages, the products that we build, the pricing
models that we build, that is where the IP exists, and actually that build's gone pretty well.
So, that's not really what we're talking about here. This is purely kind of the linkages and
the data interplay to make sure that we've got (31:22) performance we need now but
actually in a (31:23) systems quickly, and that the message on the amount of data and
processing we consume is aﬀordable. So, really, the IP actually, I think a lot of it does ﬁt in
the – how we build the package and the products, and the pricing algorithms that we
build within them rather than the products themselves.

Q - Greig N. Paterson

{BIO 6587493 <GO>}

I'm sorry (31:40). You've spoken in the past about getting a noncorrelated pricing team in
certain footprint in Motor, for instance, that you for some reason are not pricing, and
you'd like to price. Has there been any progress in that regard?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yes, it's true. That's moving ahead well. Again, we'll give you an update at year-end, but I
mean, we – at the half year, we set out a number of initiatives which are a subcomponent
of the conversation we – are much more than, let's say, we've just talked about. So, again,
medium term, we do feel alternative pricing is a big opportunity. We are progressing
really well with it. We're excited about it. Again, we'll give you more updates on that. And
again, that just shows you the speciﬁc rework that we're talking about is just a component
of a much bigger program on many diﬀerent frontiers including alternative pricing that's
moving ahead to plan and to expectation.

Hi. Good morning. This is Waj Rizvi from Deutsche Bank. I'm afraid I have a couple more
questions on impairment charge again. So, just wondering is the impairment charge in
2016 and 2017 both related to a speciﬁc system or platform you're using, or is it more
broad-based, and you have just decided to take it in lumps?
And secondly, does it mean you would need to keep investing for longer or invest more
to get that right speed of connectivity, which you didn't really achieve with these
investments? Thank you.

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
I think I've already answered those, actually, to be honest. I think what we said we're
doing a broad-based set of programs, and, yes, the – where we – it hasn't gone perfectly.
It's not down to one thing. It's down to one or two certain things. And in this particular
case, it's down to connecting things together. In terms of, will it cost us more? Well, we
said we're going to spend a certain amount. We said £80 million to £100 million over the
next couple of years. So this is not going to change that, and I think we've answered that
one already as well.

Okay. Let's get some more questions.

Operator
Okay. The ﬁnal question comes in from the line of Dom calling from Exane (34:01). Please
go ahead.
Good morning, everybody. Just one question left for me, and I promise it's not about
impairments, but it is on Ogden. We've known for some time now the government is
looking at 0% to 1% as proposal. As you've said, it's highly unclear whether that will arrive
and when it arrives. But thinking about the scenarios, are you able to give us any sense of
what, A, the reserve release might be at 0% or at 1% for your results and, B, what do you
think the market price impact might be at either end of that range, just to give us some
sense of that? Thanks.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yeah. So, let me do this the market thing. All we can say is that the – we've said that the
change down to minus 0.75% was probably kind of growth 6% to 7%, I think, roughly 6%
to 7%, so you can do your own math. It's obviously not linear. You can do your own math
at what the answer might be at diﬀerent stages.
Just to be safe, 0% – the government's proposal, they don't know the answer between 0%
and 1%. There's quite a lot of subjectivity even when they set out the guidelines about
Page 15 of 18

where the rate actually settled depending on the basket of investments they choose. So
and 0% and 1% are quite diﬀerent.
But, John, do you want to talk about the...

FINAL

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
Yeah. So we're doing some work because we know people will want to know those
sensitivities update, and we'll do that for you at the year-end. But some things to think
about. First of all, obviously, since we ﬁrst showed the impact which was at the year-end,
we've had a release from Ogden reserves at the half-year of about £50 million, which you
know about. That'll obviously have some impact. Then we've had some settlement. Paul
said we've had about 20 settlements so far with the rate that's being part of that
settlement. So that will have an impact.
Thirdly, obviously, general changes in our BI reserves which tend to be down, will also
have an impact on that sensitivity. So we're – it's a good question. We will update it at the
year-end. We haven't quite got the answer right now, but we'll give you that.

Thank you.

Good. Anymore questions?

Operator
We currently have no further questions coming through. Okay. We do have one last
question coming through from the line of Andrew Crean calling from Autonomous. Please
go ahead.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Sorry about this. PPOs is what I wanted to ask. But we've seen from the Institute and
Faculty of Actuaries, a continuing fall in the propensity of PPOs, and obviously with
Ogden, at minus 0.75% or (36:43), they are likely to be less used. Could you talk a little bit
about your experience, and talk about your capital sensitivity to a lower assumed PPO
rate?

A - Anthony Jonathan Reizenstein
I think that we – propensity, clearly, has come down. It was coming down actually before
all the noise about Ogden, and we adjusted our assumptions. I think we talked about that
at the time of the Ogden hit. We don't have any more to say today. And I imagine we'll try
and say something again maybe at the year-end. On the other hand, it might depend on
what's happening with Ogden, if that's still out there – this uncertainty. We (37:27) I think
the challenge we had last time for us, I think, which was could everything move to PPOs. It
seems like it's not that – it's not going to happen.

And on capital, I don't (37:43) have an answer right now. It is quite complicated set of
things and depending on what the Ogden rate is. I know it's diﬀerent when Ogden rate is
negative, when Ogden rate is positive. So, I think I'm going to leave that for now and
maybe we can come back to that later.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thanks.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Very good. Any more questions?

Operator
We do have a question coming in from the line of Paul Walsh (38:06). Please go ahead.
Good morning. I understand it's been mentioned once or twice in previous questions, but
can I just – to clarify on terms of Ogden, have you changed your assumption about the
Ogden rate since the Ministry of Justice report came out and how has this aﬀected your
reserves?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

So, I'll answer in a slightly obscure way. And we're always slightly cagy about how we talk
about pricing. The reserve point of view, nothing's changed and that we still have the
minus 0.75% assumption in our reserves. In pricing, we do have to have some riskweighted assessment of future claims trends, including whiplash and Ogden. And so, it
has to be somewhat in our thinking because we write a policy now. The claims may will
suﬀer in a few years' time, so we have to have a view of it. But we're not saying it's not
mechanical and we're not saying that the percentage of that which is put into our pricing.
But it's obviously a consideration. I hope that helps, Paul (39:08).

Q - Operator
Thank you.
There are no further questions coming through.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Right. Well, thank you, everyone, for your questions this morning. Listen, we're really
pleased with how we traded this quarter. Good momentum in our own brands, a third of a
million policies, good margins. We've got quite a busy year-end from all the topics which
we discussed this morning. We look forward to speaking to you on that at the end of
February, if not before. So, thanks very much for your time.
