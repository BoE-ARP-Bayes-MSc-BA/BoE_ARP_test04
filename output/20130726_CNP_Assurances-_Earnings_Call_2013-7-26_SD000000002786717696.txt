{BIO 5074454 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. Welcome to everybody from Escole [ph]. I propose to go
through the diﬀerent slides we have from the screens that are before us and to answer to
your questions.
First I start with the summary of the diﬀerent signiﬁcant ﬁgures regarding the half year on
page three. The premium income was up by 5.6% at EUR14 billion over the period. It is
worldwide premium here and the net revenue is at EUR1.6 billion, less 3.5% during the
same period.
As you see, the administrative expenses were well managed and they are there at just less
4.8% at EUR445 million, therefore the EBIT stayed at EUR1,152 million, up by 4.6%. The net
proﬁt is at EUR583 million, plus 7.9% and the two last signiﬁcant ﬁgures being the MCEV
per share which is at EUR21.5 and the return on equity which is at just above 10%, 10.2% to
be compared with last year's of the same period which was at 10.6%.
If now we go to the performance in France on page four, it was marked by a signiﬁcant
shift in the product mix towards unit link and personal risk and protection products. If you
look at the tiers relative to the traditional savings and pension products they decreased by
7.1% over the period, at EUR7.3 billion, where the unit link products were up 15.6% at 735
million. And the personal risk and protection products are still up, as at more than 2% at
2,336 million.

FINAL

Then the decline in premium from traditional savings and pension products leads to
negative net inﬂow on this part of the business whereas the unit-link sales were up and
mainly led by good performance after a bumpy start.
The personal risk premiums are up 2.2% and they reﬂect the performances made by
Caisses d'Epargne network and or so by the creditor insurance business. We got these
French markets premiums are down to 3.8% overall, we have an increase in the
contribution of the unit-link producers.
In economic terms that means that we are starting to get the beneﬁt of our policy which
was to favor the production of high return producers, unit-links and personal risk, even at
the detriment of the traditional savings on which we lose market share but so far we
consider that at the current level of interest, it is not wrong to recede in terms of market
share on these compartments.
If we turn to page ﬁve we have a look at the net insurance revenue in France and you see
that growth was up 2.4% which is roughly the same growth as the average assets
managed in France.

Bloomberg Transcript

When you have a look at the breakdown of these diﬀerent activities, savings still represent
67% of the net insurance revenue in France, pensions just below at 5% and personal risk
and protection businesses at 28%.
The breakdown between technical reserves is quite diﬀerent for the vast large majority of
technical reserves is in selling the business. You see there 233 billion out of 272 as a
whole. The pension business has EUR30 billion and the personal risk and protection
represents only EUR9 billion whereas it is a signiﬁcant part, just below one-third of our net
insurance revenue in France.
The ﬁgures in Latin America are on page 6. With premiums up 22% including the currency
eﬀect and issue excludes the currency eﬀect meaning if you look with Brazilian glasses on
these ﬁgures, the performance was up 32%.
The breakdown of this premium is 60% in pension business, at least remember that
pension business is quite diﬀerent investment from what we consider in Continental
Europe, meaning that the duration of the contract is much lower, around four years and
that new business margin on this compartment is roughly at 25%. Then you have 60% of
the business in pension, 37% in personal risk with a high new business margin and just
2.2% on savings.
On page seven you have also the look on the net insurance revenue in Lat Am which is up
by 12% including the currency eﬀect and by 22% excluding this eﬀect. There you see also
the stricture of this insurance revenue of which more than three quarters consist in
personal risk, 76%, 11% in pension business and 12% in savings.

FINAL

If you compare page six to page ﬁve, the French model you have very clearly
complementary business models in the two areas, our main areas of activity, with a very
quickly growing business focus on personal risk in Brazil whereas in France we have a
more lean business and more traditional.
If you come to page eight, what we call here the Europe excluding France it should be
southern Europe if you accept that Ireland belongs to Southern Europe which is in some
terms it is a new deﬁnition of peripheral, we have there very impressive growth of
premiums by 73% but in fact you have to consider that out this EUR2 billion premium
there was unique premium, product premium in one contract in pensions in Denmark.
And nevertheless without this contract, we have substantial growth, about 39% in
premium in Europe being mainly in traditional savings and in pension business and in
protection.

Bloomberg Transcript

But there is, nevertheless, a decline in net insurance revenue in this area which is due to
lower technical reserves, we have think (inaudible) end of contract in Italy which was not
recycled in the company and a slowdown in term creditor insurance business in Southern
Europe, Spain, Portugal and Italy which is consistent with the current level of the crisis in
this country and decrease of amount of credit made in this country.
If you have now a look on the page nine you see the new business margin in the diﬀerent
areas where we operate, ﬁrst we mark the global level of the new business ratio, APE ratio
is up by 4.2% to 15.8% and which is mainly credible by the ﬁgures in France, plus 5.2%
which leads to 12.6% due to a diﬀerent product mix in France for the last year. We’ve
shifted from traditional to unit link and individual personal risk which was already seeable
in the ﬁgures of the premiums.
The level of the new business margin in Brazil is still at very high, very high and in
Southern Europe you are on average, a little over 10% which is (inaudible).
On page 10 you have few informations about our administrative expenses, they are stable
in France, they are stable in Europe excluding France. And they are slightly up in Latin
America, in the local currency the cost would be up by 12% which is to be compared with
the net interest income which is up by 22% in Latin America.
Therefore that means that the cost to income ratio is improving in France and in Latin
America and globally in spite of the relatively poor performance in Southern Europe.
Globally the cost to income ratio is down by 0.8% at 37.8 during the ﬁrst half of this year.
The EBIT is explained on page 11. We have two breakdowns, ﬁrst between the business
drives where you see that we have a slight growth in savings and pension business. More
signiﬁcant in personal risk business which represents more now, signiﬁcantly more than
the savings and pension business and on our own diﬀerent (inaudible) we have also got a
signiﬁcant part of the EBIT of the company.

FINAL

You should look now at the ﬁgures in (inaudible) term, France is up by 2%, Latin America
by 15% and the rest of Europe is receding by 41%.
On page 12 we mind the main characteristics of our investment management strategy with
two main items. First we remain very prudent in our investment choices. The peripheral
investments (inaudible) have stabilized around EUR10 million, additional investments we
made in this zone were only made on very short durations, in fact maturing before the
end of this year and are properly covered in terms of risk by the ECB policy.
And we are also still maintain a very strong liquidity position, 7.3% of the assets we
manage which allows us to face any eventual move in interest rates, the rates without any
problem of liquidity.
Beside this we also are trying to innovate in terms of portfolio diversiﬁcation in the lowinterest rates environments, the insurance being clearly to ﬁnd new more proﬁtable
investments. We carried on our policy of investing more and more in corporate debt, over
EUR5 billion at the end of the ﬁrst half which is roughly 40% or 45% of our new
investments.

Bloomberg Transcript

We also added to have two new experiments. First we take part in (inaudible) for small
and medium-sized company debt which was launched in France. We have just taken
EUR100 million of this fund which represents 1 billion and which goal will be to seek the
best rated medium-sized company issues.
And we have also decided together with a few other insurance companies to a line
participation in equity of French companies in order to be able to consider them as strictly
participations and to have a certain word to say in terms of strategy and in terms of
control. And as a member of the board we are representing the fund of which we are a
part. That means we ﬁrst consider our role as long-term investors in a more organized way
with some of our partners.
And the last item in this line is the eﬀort we made to diversify infrastructure ﬁnancing our
assets. We made a new (inaudible) partnership with (inaudible) as originator of project
infrastructure ﬁnancing. We have also invested in several bonds -- sorry -- asset
management producers led by (inaudible) Aviva[ph] for instance, Aviva investors for
instance in order to enhance our exposure in these instruments while keeping a very
good management of our risk and fostering very, requesting policy of risk in this respect.
(Inaudible) you have four common elements of reserve. I will explain how (inaudible) was
constituted, it stays at EUR1,462 million. (Inaudible) we have to pay tax expenses and the
minority interest which (inaudible) to the (inaudible) proﬁt of EUR729 million, up by 2.7%
to last year.
We have net gains on equities, property and assets for sale -- available for sale assets,
goodwill impairment and (inaudible). It is a line where we can (inaudible) diﬀerence of
valuations in certain elements of assets and our investments.

FINAL

As you see in this line, we got slightly lower revenue than last year. It is explainable by the
fact that it is a place where we located the impairment of Cyprus goodwill which was
decided three months ago and which we conﬁrmed the valuation at this -- for this time,
for this period. Therefore, we considered that the Cyprus damage is behind us so far.
The non-recurring items on the last time represent remove of certain of our provisions.
Last year we added provisions for EUR104 million. This year we took back slightly EUR12
million of these provisions in this part of our net income.
In fact the provisions made on some of our portfolios which are of the same nature but do
not appear in our income statement, these provisions represent more than EUR200
million where they went (inaudible) last year at the same moment. That means that little of
our (inaudible) is (inaudible) is still at this time.
On page 14, you have the traditional ﬁgures regarding the equity, with net equity of the
company at EUR14.4 billion and the MCEV ﬁgures which stayed at EUR14.7 billion. And we
(inaudible) in force having registered important growth, 17% growth on the period.

Bloomberg Transcript

You see there that the contribution of the operation because this is a most important part
of this improvement whereas the contribution of diﬀerent environmental elements
represents minor part of this improvement.
On page 15, we just remind the (inaudible) solvency capital requirements coverage ratio
of the company at the end of June in (inaudible) mergers we estimate our coverage ratio
at 266%. The tier one solvency capital, core solvency capital coverage ratio is 116. Last
year it was at 112. But (inaudible) dividends which met very great success allowed us to
improve signiﬁcantly this ratio.
And we have also given the estimation we made of our solvency ratios under (inaudible)
tier two for the ﬁrst half of 2013 it was around 180%. In fact slightly above this ﬁgure you
will see the diﬀerent appendices. But it was at the highest level since we made this
measure.
On page 16, we submit the main elements which depict this period, the improved product
mix in France is an achievement for us. It is of course to be conﬁrmed. But it is satisfaction
for the company to see that we start to move in this direction.
The ongoing growth in Latin America is still very strong. We've considered that we are still
very important growth potential and we observed a rise in pensions and democratic
movements in these countries.
Caixa Seguros is also opening a new activity in Brazilian -- Brazil micro-insurance market.
And we made a little acquisition of a small company in the south of Brazil called Previsul
which a personal risk insurer.

Therefore, the development in this area is still very fast and I just underline the fact that we
still have the same goals for year -- the current year and that we do not see a signiﬁcant
eﬀect of the diﬀerent troubles which occurred in Brazil over the last week.

FINAL

I am ﬁnished with this part of the presentation. You have diﬀerent appendices. But I think
it is better (inaudible) to give you the ﬂoor and (inaudible).

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thanks so much, sir. (Operator Instructions) We'll go to our ﬁrst question being asked by
Michael Hudder [ph] of JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Michael Hudder
Thank you very much. I have two questions. The ﬁrst one please is on the solvency, the
116% in the pro forma basis in January, 116% now. It is now, you are now in kind of steady
state. So with the current rate of growth, will solvency stay roughly where it is. And what
would happen if you reverted to cash dividend? Would this ﬁgure go oﬀ to 112 or
whatever? That's the ﬁrst question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then the second, you've cut sales in traditional French life by 7%. It's still a big number.
You're still a market leader. How much would you be willing to reduce sales in order to
protect margin? Thank you.

A - Unidentiﬁed Company Representative
Good try, Michael. But we never give any ﬁgures oﬀ of our objectives in that area, mainly
when it is a question of reducing our market share. We have no goal in terms of reduction
of the market share in traditional products.
To be more serious, it is clearly for the ﬁnancial point of view not so bad to have a low
production of traditional products nowadays because investment returns are relatively
low. We are clearly reminded that (inaudible) still represent an important part of the
business model and it will remain a substantial contributor to the business model.
But what we want to see is the adaptability of our customer shift to the reduction of policy
or the dividends. And so far we have taken the ﬁgure of last year in terms of policy holder
dividend return. But it is clear that if it decreases at the end of the year it will bolster the
interest of adding traditional products in our business model.
Regarding your ﬁrst question, I would not make any comment. We are satisﬁed with this
ratio. And that was clearly an additional coverage made by the (inaudible). But we do not
take the habit of having discrete dividends if it is the answer you want to get. We do not
consider that it is a normal way to improve our solvency ratio and we have no goal of
going above this level with this device.

Q - Michael Hudder
And just from the dividend policy holders, what was the level for 2012?

A - Unidentiﬁed Company Representative

FINAL

2.5%.

Q - Michael Hudder
2.5%. So the idea is then to see -- or to know the sensitivity of net inﬂows to this ﬁgure. Do
you have any indication at all?

A - Unidentiﬁed Company Representative
Well it is diﬃcult to say because in some years, we decreased this policyholder dividend
without any eﬀect on our next year's sales. In 2013, you can link poor performance in
traditional product with the fact that we posted the lowest level of policyholder dividend
of whole market in France.
But as I already said, we assume the idea that it is a way to steer our production and we
accept the idea that it could be reduced if it leads to a more proﬁtable level.

Q - Michael Hudder

Bloomberg Transcript

I understand. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you, sir. We'll now go to Mr. Federico Salerno [ph] of MainFirst. Please go ahead,
Sir. Your line is open.

Q - Federico Salerno

{BIO 2565091 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everyone, just a couple of things. The ﬁrst point is on delivery
(inaudible). I was wondering if the recent change in the yield is going to open up some
opportunities for you in the coming quarters. Do you see your new business going back
towards traditional life savings products or you will stick to the current mix of trying to
have more protection. That's the ﬁrst question.
Then I realized it's a bit early in the year. But again in the dividend and solvency issues -- I
mean, is the $0.77 starting point whether you have [a scrip] or not and what level of
solvency will you feel conﬁdent enough not to have a scrip [ph] if you can answer.

A - Unidentiﬁed Company Representative
Well regarding to the ﬁrst question. It is clear that reduction of (inaudible) operate [ph]
appears as a good news for life insurance sector where people ﬁnd better returns
traditionally than at that level and that they will certainly have a higher return this year
than the current level of (inaudible).
Page 7 of 16



Company Name: CNP Assurances
Company Ticker: CNP FP Equity
Date: 2013-07-26

FINAL

We nevertheless consider about the long-term. We have to contemplate rather a shift of
our business model to unit links or to the new generation of insurance products which are
called (inaudible) which are discussed nowadays between French authorities and
insurance sector in order to foster the insurance -- life insurance sector in much longer
term products which will have higher part of their assets invested in equities, in
infrastructure and so and so.
And we -- in fact, we would prefer to make a shift in the contracts we sell to our customers
but simply to rely on the idea that the policyholder dividends of our contract will stay very
low -- over a long period.
On short-term task, clearly. But on longer-term we have to contemplate a world where the
quest for return by our customers will be higher, slightly higher than the return oﬀered by
-- even the traditional products (inaudible).
Regarding with your second question, I have not very much to add to that question of
dividend is rather analyze the level of company at the end of the year rather than now. We
have no indication just to repeat the idea that what was done is not a proxy to forecast
what could be done.

Q - Federico Salerno

{BIO 2565091 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

But in this case, you think you will still begin with the $0.77 reference point or not
necessarily?

A - Unidentiﬁed Company Representative
Well it is in itself a reference point and it is a point of where we stayed during three years,
therefore it is a reference point. Not the question of what we consider. It is a fact.

Q - Federico Salerno

{BIO 2565091 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you, Mr. Salerno. Well now, we will now go to, Mr. Benoit [ph] of (inaudible). Please
go ahead, Sir. Your line is open.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Yes. Good afternoon, all. Just a couple of questions on unit link, I was wondering if you
see some kind of positive momentum for the quarter and also in Q3. And maybe you can
help me to analyze with the technical reserve on unit link.
I see that it's actually down 1.3% in H1 despite that you have actually positive good sales -unit link sales in France and Italy. So also equities were up in H1. So I was wondering if you
have seen any big redemption on unit link in H1.

Page 8 of 16



Company Name: CNP Assurances
Company Ticker: CNP FP Equity
Date: 2013-07-26

Then -- yes, just one detail about sales in Italy. What do you expect there for the rest of the
year? Do you think it's sustainable? Could you just comment a little bit on that? Thank you
very much.

FINAL

A - Unidentiﬁed Company Representative
Well I take ﬁrst your second question. It seems that the unit link PM were done because
we have the redemption (inaudible) end of the contract in Italy which represented EUR1
billion (inaudible) which was in unit links mainly but it doesn't impact on the global ﬁgure
at the level (inaudible) of the company.
The second -- the last question was about our goals in Italy. To be frank, we -- I'd [rather
go] in terms of structure of production rather than on the level of premiums. Why?
Because for diﬀerent reasons we don't want to have in the balance sheet of the company
traditional products, more traditional products invested in Italian govvies.
And at the large part of the production of the company -- of the -- half of the production
of the company is indeed invested in Italian govvies. But we do not push them to make
this product, therefore the ﬁnal ﬁgure of premiums in this country will be the result rather
of a very -- I would say risk adverse policy in terms of assets rather than oﬀ a commercial
push, if they can produce unit links, we encourage them.

Bloomberg Transcript

If they say that we must have larger assets in terms of govvies we will discourage the
production of such a contract. Could you remind me the ﬁrst of your three questions,
please?

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
No. It was just about the momentum of unit link sales to the quarter. And do you just
actually -- do you expect acceleration in Q3 and for the rest of the year?

A - Unidentiﬁed Company Representative
Okay. The momentum is rather -- I think which in certain extent you create. That means
that it was not only because we observed this increase in unit link. But we also pushed to
do that by granting favorable conditions of return on this contract. We have the ﬁrst year.
We have several guarantees given during one year to contract investment at more than
15% in unit links, where -- which in our networks, which are very -- I will say traditionally not
very good sellers of unit links which we presented a push [ph] because they were granted,
the customers were granted an improved return on the traditional part of the contract if
they accept to get the ﬁrst 15% of their investment in unit links.
Then it is not just a momentum in which is observed. It is also a result of the policy to try to
draw them to this sort of investment.

FINAL

Thank you very much, Sir. We'll now go to, Mr. Franz Rodker [ph] of Societe Generale. Go
ahead.

Q - Franz Rodker
Hello, everyone, just a couple of questions actually. First of all, could you please elaborate
a little bit on the drivers of currency (inaudible) why it went up in the ﬁrst half. Then
second, turning back to page number 12, your new investment focus on corporate debt,
investments in SME lending and so on, do you have any maximum targets for investments
in SME and infrastructure ﬁnancing?
And the last question on your peripheral exposure, page 55, when I look at the increase
of your -- of growth sale value, is it possible, actually, to split it up into a price and volume
eﬀect? Thank you.

A - Unidentiﬁed Company Representative

Bloomberg Transcript

Well regarding the ﬁrst question in solvency to the (inaudible) increased because
(inaudible) because of integration of years result and because of the increase of the
volume (inaudible) then the drivers are drivers which you cannot serve in diﬀerent items
of our presentation, on the other side where SCR is globally stable over the period.
On the second question, we have no speciﬁc goals in terms of volume invested in SME as
in infrastructure. You have to bear in mind that these diversiﬁcations will be relatively
marginal in the ﬁrst period. We manage a balance sheet of about EUR300 billion and it
would (inaudible) completely full to have a goal at a certain level. It would oblige us to
buy what is to be sold at this moment.
We are more prudent (inaudible), okay? We want to add to these investments over the
time and look ﬁrst if the long-term interest rates are [going up] over the time, we will
probably reduce our investments in the spread products and (inaudible) if the long-term
interest rates are still down or even lower, we will trigger the policy of seeking spread
investments.
So far we try be very pragmatic on that respect, we consider giving to ourselves goals in
terms of months would not be (inaudible). The third question was about -The price and volume eﬀect on slide 55 which is about the public debt exposure
(inaudible).
The (inaudible) that you're looking for Rodker is a rough breakdown between the price
and volume eﬀect on the public debt exposures in slide 55?

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Hello. I have got two questions if I may add. The ﬁrst one is regarding your slide 11
where Europe ex-France EBIT has gone down. Is there something except that there are
some banking changes in Cyprus? And I assume this time only because of that. And the
second question would be again regarding your dividend. I mean, I see your solvency
ratio improving as your operating cash ﬂow numbers are quite healthy in the ﬁrst half.
If I assume this trend to continue, are you going to signal any kind (inaudible) dividend is
going to cash and what -- do you have any plan rather you have considered (inaudible) to
be maintained?

A - Unidentiﬁed Company Representative
Regarding your second question, I just can repeat that we will decide dividend for the
year at the end of the year. It's your assumption is that our operating cash ﬂow ﬁgure
shows that we would be able to pay a cash dividend this year. Yes. It shows that it should
be possible. Yes. (Inaudible) we have money, if it is what you want to be conﬁrmed. Could
you repeat to me your ﬁrst question please?

Q - Avinash Singh

{BIO 20134511 <GO>}

Yes. My ﬁrst question is regarding your slide 11 where I see your Europe excluding France
EBIT down by some 40%. I assume that this is primarily due to some banking deposit
changes in Cyprus. Or was it something which I am missing at the moment?

A - Unidentiﬁed Company Representative
Well you mean that what we call Europe excluding France?

Okay. Well it is due partly to Cyprus. But also mainly to poor performance in credit debt
insurance in Spain and in Italy where we got very low revenues. And the last piece
(inaudible) on page eight with the fact that we have a slowdown in term creditor
insurance and also lower technical reserves. It's still a question of our redemption in Italy,
Italian products in savings business which go to the reduction of EBIT in this country.

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. I just got one question on slide 26 of your
presentation where you show the net insurance revenue by segment. In terms of the
sources of revenue of the insurance company for the France business, the numbers seem
to have been restated compared to the numbers you showed at the ﬁrst half here last
year.
Just, for example, in the equivalent side for 2012, half-year 2012 presentation plans, you
reported net insurance revenue for France as EUR687 million compared to EUR567 million
on page, slide 26 here. I just want to understand what you're doing diﬀerently.

A - Unidentiﬁed Company Representative
It is where we made the (inaudible) apparently knowing what you are referring to
(inaudible).
Well actually -- yes, we can go in to it in further detail subsequently if you wish, William.
But, in a nutshell, is that at the same period last year, our accounting friends had [split out]
speciﬁc non-recurring technical factor line items which we did not have this period. So
you're actually right. It makes the legibility and the clarity somewhat problematic. But
that's -- the numbers in this are the non-recurring items, the non-recurring technical items.
I don't know about -- Vincent, do you want to say a word? You're the accountant. You
know more about it.
Well if you want to speak to our accountants, I will give you the ﬂoor for the rest of the
afternoon. No. But, perhaps, you would (inaudible) come back afterwards to precisely

What those numbers (inaudible).
-- reconcile the ﬁgures of last year's and not representative of last year's. All right? Is that
all right with you, William?

Q - William Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Well I wanted to know if you changed or what changed and whether these are (inaudible)
numbers. And whether the numbers you're sharing here are excluding or including
recurring (inaudible) are they just for forecasting.

A - Unidentiﬁed Company Representative
I propose you speak directly with the team with your question on the probability of the
ﬁgures. I think it is a little technical to be discussed in this (inaudible).

Q - William Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

(Inaudible) complicated question. I mean, is that EUR581 million you show, for example,
for the ﬁrst half of 2013 of the net insurance revenue. Is that a clean number? Is that a
sensible basis for forecasting and/or does is include non-recurring things that we should
be considering?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Unidentiﬁed Company Representative
Yes. Yes. In a nutshell, yes. In a nutshell, yes. You can take slide 26, the net insurance
revenue for France and the net insurance revenue for Latin America. And the net
insurance revenue Europe excluding France, the ﬁrst half of 2012 and the ﬁrst half of 2013
are reasonable, updated bases for making your projections going forward.

Thank you.

Thanks very much, sir.

We now have a follow-up question from Mr. Michael Hudder, JPMorgan. Please go ahead,
sir.

Q - Michael Hudder
Hello. Thank you very much. It's just that I wanted to understand slide 27. In slide 27, you
show a net asset value, adjusted net asset value. The last -- that one line -- is an item
called MCEV model; and it's a ﬁgure of minus EUR483 million for 2013.

So I'm imagining and so I just wanted to ask if my assumption is correct -- that this is what I
would normally call the (inaudible) uplift, in other words, the amount of embedded value
not already in the balance sheet.
And here, what appears to be the case, because the item is negative, is that this uplift is a
negative item. In other words, it's already in the balance sheet and various things and,
therefore, you have to deduct an item to arrive at the kind of NAV per share. Is that the
right understanding?

A - Unidentiﬁed Company Representative
Michael, thank you for having raised that question. I have two actuaries and one
accountant there and they are trained to package (inaudible). I think there too that would
be a good evening work and you would get your answer.
Yes. The question on the (inaudible). Can we (inaudible)? (Inaudible) later if you wish.
(Inaudible).

Bloomberg Transcript

(Inaudible) already in the equity in IFRS. In fact, we (inaudible). So (inaudible) equity inside
the equity. So we for MCEV, we have to wait until we realize the gain to take them into
account in the (inaudible). And the same thing in the equity, you've got also (inaudible)
that is already count for acquisition and so on and we have to [replace this info] inside the
MCEV info [ph].

Q - Michael Hudder
I understand. So the -- it's to do with the treatment of the unrealized gains. Now, I just
want to ask just a very, very quick follow up. If I wanted to ignore this adjustment just for
the unrealized gains, I know it sounds a bit tricky, what I'm trying to arrive at is what would
be the embedded value per share based on shareholder's equity? Is that ﬁgure that
you've shown on slide 27 -- what corresponds to this or is that, ﬁgure on slide 27, more a
(inaudible) kind of technical view? In other words, is it (inaudible) than it would normally
be.

A - Unidentiﬁed Company Representative
As it turns out, by pure coincidence or circumstance, they're approximately the same
number. The number you have here on 27 is actuarial. That's actuarial (inaudible).
If you look at the accounting number and take away minority, the GP sub debt and a
certain portion for intangibles divided by the new number of shares outstanding, you get
from an accounting basis, from an intangible common equity accounting basis, you get a
ﬁgure that's not too far from 16 [ph] as well.
