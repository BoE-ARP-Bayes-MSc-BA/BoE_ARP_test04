{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Good morning everyone. And welcome to this conference call to discuss NN Group's
Third Quarter 2014 Results.
I will start today's presentation by looking at the highlights of this past quarter and the
progress that we are making on implementing our strategy and delivering on our targets.
Delﬁn Rueda, Chief Financial Oﬃcer of NN Group will then talk you through the ﬁnancial
details of the third quarter results at a group level and for each segment, and I will
conclude the presentation with a short wrap up after we will open the call for Q&A. We
have also Doug Caldwell, Chief Risk Oﬃcer of NN Group with us here to answer your
questions.
So I suggest we turn to slide number three. I am pleased to report a strong set of results
for the third quarter of 2014. The operating result of the ongoing business was EUR270
million, up 17% on the third quarter of 2013 and up 21% on a year-to-date basis. The net
result for the third quarter of this year improved to EUR354 million. This compares with a

FINAL

net loss of EUR652 million in the third quarter of 2013, which included a loss on the
divestment of ING Life Korea.
Our focus on reducing administrative expenses in the Netherlands is progressing well. In
the ﬁrst nine months of this year, we reduced expenses in the Netherlands by EUR108
million. The net operating return on equity of the ongoing business of NN Group
remained stable at 8.3% for the third quarter of 2014, which reﬂects a higher operating
result on a higher equity base, following the debt-to-equity conversion and the pre-IPO
capital injection from ING Group.
Our capital position remains robust with our IGD ratio at the end of the third quarter
standing at 283% and our holding cash capital stable at almost EUR1.2 billion. And ﬁnally,
we successfully completed the issue of EUR1 billion of undated subordinated notes in July
2014, which we used to repay hybrid debt to ING Group. This has enabled us to further
strengthen our ﬁnancial ﬂexibility and reduce funding costs.

Bloomberg Transcript

So let's turn to slide number four. At the time of the IPO, we set out the strategy and the
targets of NN Group and also of the individual operating segments. In summary, we are
transforming the businesses in the Netherlands with a focus on reducing expenses. For
Netherlands Life, we are also gradually shifting to higher-yielding assets, and in Non-Life,
our focus is on restoring proﬁtability by improving underwriting performance. At ING -- at
Insurance Europe, Japan Life and Investment Management, we aim to achieve proﬁtable
growth and increase scale with our operating leverage.
The operating segments are focused on executing their strategy. In Non-Life, for example,
we have taken management actions to restore proﬁtability including premium rate
increases and more stringent underwriting criteria. These measures are starting to bear
fruit. In addition, Non-Life has already achieved substantial cost reductions this year.
At Netherlands Life, we continue to look for opportunities to invest in higher yielding
assets, and in this way, keep our investment margin stable. Given the nature of the cost
reduction program being implemented in this segment, these savings will only start to
come through later in the program towards 2016.
In our growth segments, we are making progress despite some headwinds and the low
rate environment. The pension reforms in Poland have impacted our income in Insurance
Europe. However, we are successfully shifting our product focus to protection and feebased products and voluntary pensions.
The higher new sales at Japan Life are driven by the continued economic recovery in that
country, but also thanks to our eﬀorts to increase agency production and to diversify the
distribution channels. For example, 10 new bank distribution partners have been recruited
so far this year.
Investment Management is investing in its people and processes in order to attract new
mandates. For example, the emerging markets equity team has recently been
strengthened with new hires. And of course, we are delighted with the announcement last

week that we have been appointed by the ECB as one of the four asset managers to
execute its asset-backed security purchase program. This prestigious mandate, which
commences this month, follows a competitive tender procedure and underscores the
quality and the expertise of our investment management professionals. Finally, NN Bank,
which is included in the segment other, is showing satisfactory growth in retail savings
and new mortgage production and is introducing new products such as the recently
launched credit card.
So let's turn to slide ﬁve. I would like to recap the strategic priorities of NN Group as a
whole. These priorities are to reduce expenses in the Netherlands, improve earnings and
increase the return on equity of the ongoing business. We have set ourselves the
following targets; ﬁrstly, to reduce administrative expenses in the Netherlands units, that
being Netherlands Life, Netherlands Non-Life, and at the corporate and holding entities
by a total of EUR200 million by 2016.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second, to realize an annual growth rate of the operating results before tax of the
ongoing business of 5% to 7% on average in the medium term, and lastly, to increase the
net operating return on equity of the ongoing business in the medium term measured
against the pro forma 7.1% for 2013. Although we are still at the beginning of our journey
as an independent company, we are pleased to note that we are making good progress
on delivering on those targets. In terms of administrative expenses, we have realized
EUR108 million of cost reductions year-to-date, so we are on track to reach our target by
2016.
The year-to-date operating result before tax of the ongoing business, of EUR826 million,
represents a 21% increase compared with the same period in 2013. Please bear in mind
though that there may be quarterly ﬂuctuations in our growth rate. Our target of an
average annual growth rate of 5 % to 7% will be measured over the medium term.
We have reported a net operating return on equity of the ongoing business for the ﬁrst
nine months of this year of 8.9%. This is higher than our 2013 pro forma return on equity
of 7.1%. Now, aligned with these targets, we expect over time to generate free cash
available to shareholders in a range around the net operating result of the ongoing
business. This assumes normal markets, the current regulatory framework and no material
special items.
If we then turn to slide six, this shows the results so far of the execution of our strategy and
our disciplined capital framework. NN Group maintained its robust capital position with
the IGD ratio increasing to 283% at the end of the third quarter. Solvency I capital ratio of
our biggest unit, NN Life has remained broadly stable at 252% at the end of the third
quarter. The cash capital position at the holding company is also stable at almost EUR1.2
billion.
In terms of leverage, the gross debt position is EUR3.7 billion as the proceeds of the
undated subordinated notes were used to repay hybrid debt to ING Group. Our ﬁxed
cost coverage ratio went up to 8.4 times and the leverage ratio improved to 23.7%.

the ﬁnancial details of the third quarter results. By the way I'm not passing on Delﬁn
Rueda to you. I am passing on the mic to Delﬁn Rueda. Please go ahead, Delﬁn.

Thank you, Lard. NN Group posted an operating result of the ongoing business, which
excludes the Japan Closed Block VA business of EUR274 million in the third quarter of this
year. This is up 17% on the third quarter of last year, mainly due to lower administrative
expenses and lower funding cost. Investment Management and NN Bank in particular
posted higher results in the third quarter of 2014, while the results of Netherlands Life and
Insurance Europe were lower compared with the same quarter last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we look at the ﬁrst nine months of the year, the operating result of the ongoing business
is up 21% compared with the same period in 2013. The net result for the third quarter of
the year also improved signiﬁcantly to EUR354 million. This reﬂects ﬁrst the higher
operating result, higher revaluations, lower special items and a couple of non-recurrent
impacts. Firstly, a refund of EUR52 million was received from the guarantee fund, which
was discontinued on 1st July 2014 as a result of the pension reforms in Poland. That was
reported under market and other impacts. And secondly, higher lapse experience on outof-the-money policies was reﬂected in our change in lapse assumptions at Japan Closed
Block VA. This led to a decrease in reserves of EUR63 million.
The net loss in the third quarter of 2013 includes the loss on the sale of ING Life Korea.
The net result on a year-to-year basis was down 18%, as the ﬁrst quarter of 2014 included
EUR400 million after-tax charged to the proﬁt and loss account in order to make ING's
closed deﬁned beneﬁt pension plan in the Netherlands ﬁnancially independent.
I would like now to turn to the next slide and show the progress we are making on
reducing expenses. One of our strategic targets as Lard has mentioned, is to achieve an
absolute reduction of the administrative expenses in Netherlands Life. Netherlands Nonlife and at the corporate/holding entities of EUR200 million by 2016. And that is measured
against the 2013 cost base.
Of these, as you can see in the chart, we have already realized total cost savings of
EUR108 million in the ﬁrst nine months of this year. This progress is certainly encouraging.
And however please remember, that this is a 3-year program and there is still plenty of
work to do. Due to the nature of the expense reductions, about half of the savings have
been achieved already this year, as was also ﬂagged at the time of the IPO. But other
initiatives in particular, of the Netherlands Life will take longer to start showing results and
therefore, the associated cost savings at this entity will be somewhat back-end loaded.
I would now like to go through the results of each segment individually. Let's start in the
slide 10 with Netherlands Life. The operating result of Netherlands Life amounted to
EUR152 million, down 13% from the third quarter last year. The year-to-date operating
result decreased 11%. The lower operating result is attributable to a number of factors. If I
were to pick out the most signiﬁcant, this would be. First, lower fees and premium-based

Page 4 of 26

FINAL

revenues which reﬂects the run-oﬀ of the individual life closed book and lower fee income
on the unit-linked portfolio. I would say that this is more of a structural trend.
The negative impact on the technical margin has also been under pressure, as a result of
higher unit-linked guarantee provisions following a decrease in interest rates. This is more
volatile in nature and inﬂuenced by interest rate movements. But also there was one-oﬀ
negative of EUR18 million on a legacy book of paid-up pension contracts. These negative
impacts were in part compensated by a higher investment margin and lower
administrative expenses. The latter was also inﬂuenced by the reallocation of expenses
related to personnel provisions for retired personnel in the Netherlands amounting to
EUR11 million from this business unit to the segment "Other".
In line with our strategy, we are gradually increasing our allocation to higher yielding
assets. Together with higher invested volumes, this is expected to oﬀset the drag on the
investment margin due to the current low interest rate environment. The investment
spread remained more or less stable at 108 basis points.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to slide 11, let's look at the results of Netherlands Non-life. The operating result for
Non-life amounted to EUR32 million for the third quarter of this year. This was driven by a
further reduction in administrative expenses. The current quarter operating result
represents an increase of 14% compared with the third quarter of 2013. The year-to-date
operating result was up 39% on the ﬁrst nine months of last year.
Our two business lines in these segments are showing mixed results. First, if we look at
Disability & Accident, we see that this line of business continues to report an
improvement in results, reﬂecting the measures we have been taking during the past few
years to restore proﬁtability, such as more stringent underwriting criteria and premium
rate increases, as well as more favorable claims development on prior accident years. The
combined ratio as a consequence of Disability & Accident improved to 95.7%.
The results of Property & Casualty however, are impacted this quarter by negative claims
experience, including bodily injury claims in the Motor portfolio and weather-related
claims in the Netherlands in the Fire portfolio. The combined ratio increased to 102.6% in
the third quarter of this year. However, the combined ratio Property & Casualty last year of
96.3% also beneﬁted from a EUR15 million one-oﬀ provision release. Excluding this, the
combined ratio would have been more comparable to last year. The total combined ratio
came to 99.6% for the third quarter of 2014. Year-to-date, the total combined ratio was
99.4%.
Let's have a look now at Insurance Europe. The operating result of this segment in slide 12
decreased to EUR45 million for the third quarter of 2014 from EUR57 million a year ago.
The year-to-date operating result was down 11% on the same period in 2013. Insurance
Europe is facing some headwinds due to lower reinvestment rates and lower investment
volumes, which are impacting the investment margin. The Polish pension reforms are also
having a structural impact on operating income. We do see a steady sales growth across
the region, which is reﬂected in higher fees and premium-based revenues. We continue

FINAL

to be disciplined in managing the cost of this segment in line with the operating income.
The cost-income ratio on a year-to-date basis remained more or less ﬂat.
Looking now at Japan Life, the segment Japan Life reported an operating result of EUR37
million for the third quarter of 2014. If we exclude currency eﬀects, this represents an
increase of 16% on the third quarter last year. On a year-to-year -- on a year-to-date basis,
the operating result of Japan Life decreased 2% excluding currency eﬀects on the same
period in 2013.
The main source of income at Japan Life is fees and premium-based revenues. These
were up 11% in the third quarter of 2014 versus the third quarter last year, driven by higher
premium income, reﬂecting the strong sales and larger in-force volumes in 2014. This was
partially oﬀset by higher DAC amortization, which tends to follow the evolution of
premium income.
New sales increased substantially and were up 20% from last year, excluding, again,
currency eﬀects. The productivity of independent agencies has increased and we are
seeing growth in the bancassurance channel, this diversifying therefore our distribution.

Moving on to slide 14 and the Investment Management segment, I would start by
mentioning that total assets under management increased to EUR180 billion at the end of
September, thanks to the strong market performance during the quarter. The growing
balance of assets under management is reﬂected in higher fee income.
The operating result for the Investment Management segment increased 32% in the third
quarter of 2014 compared with the same quarter the previous year. This reﬂects an
improved cost-income ratio as operating income grew faster than administrative
expenses. On a year-to-date basis, the operating result grew 14% compared with last year
on higher assets under management and as administrative expenses in the ﬁrst half of
2014 beneﬁted from EUR10 million of personal provision releases.
Our strategy is focused on growing third-party assets. While new third-party assets were
acquired this quarter, this was more than oﬀset by the outﬂow of assets, in particular by a
couple of pension funds in the Netherlands that transferred their assets and liability to an
insurance company as part of a buyout. We continue to invest in our investment
proposition with the aim of attracting new mandates going forward.
The segment other, which comprises the holding, the reinsurance business and NN Bank
is on the next page. The total operating result of this segment improved from a loss of
EUR89 million in the third quarter of 2013 to a loss of EUR33 million in this quarter. This
improvement was mainly due to lower funding costs, higher investment income and fees
as well as higher result at NN Bank. Year-to-date, the operating result of the segment
other improved substantially to a loss of EUR106 million from a loss of 300 million for the
same period last year.
In the holding company, interest cost on hybrids and debt in the third quarter of 2014
went down by EUR18 million versus last year, following the reﬁnancing of debt, the EUR1

billion debt to equity conversion last year and the classiﬁcation of our newly issued
undated subordinated notes as equity. I will give more details on this classiﬁcation later
on.
Investment income increased to EUR16 million as a result of the subordinated loans
provided to NN Group -- to NN Life in the ﬁrst half of this year. Holding expenses
decreased by EUR4 million as the savings from our cost reduction program were partially
oﬀset by the EUR11 million reallocation of expenses to other referred to in the Netherlands
Life segment.

Bloomberg Transcript

The operating result of the reinsurance business improved to EUR2 million on better
underwriting results. The improvement on a year-to-date basis reﬂects a EUR31 million
loss on a speciﬁc reinsurance contract in 2013. NN Bank continues to expand its position
in the mortgage and savings market. This is reﬂected in the increase of the operating
result in the third quarter to EUR13 million from EUR3 million last year, which was mainly
driven by a higher interest result.
Let's look now at Japan Closed Block VA. Japan Closed Block VA reported an operating
result of EUR89 million in the third quarter of the year. This includes an amount of EUR63
million arising from a reserve decrease due to higher lapse assumptions, reﬂecting higher
observed lapse experience on out-of-the-money policies. The result before tax in the third
quarter of 2013 beneﬁted from positive hedge results. The market related result net of
hedging was EUR7 million as hedge assets largely oﬀset EUR276 million movement in
reserves. As you can see on the graph on the right, the net amount at risk was EUR393
million at the end of the third quarter versus reserves of EUR792 million. So the hedge
program continues to demonstrate its eﬀectiveness and the book evolved favorably in the
third quarter. We still expect around 90% of the portfolio to run oﬀ by the end of 2019.
With this, I complete the results of our operating segments. I would now like to touch on
our cash capital position. For that, let's move to slide 17. The cash capital position at the
holding company remained essentially stable during the third quarter of 2014 at almost
EUR1.2 billion. Dividends of EUR58 million were upstreamed from the subsidiaries. This
was oﬀset by capital injections, mainly relating to EUR25 million capital strengthening of
NN Bank. Dividends from subsidiaries can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter and the
majority of annual dividends are received in the second quarter of the year. During our
second quarter results, we started -- we stated that we would be reporting on capital
generation on a six-months basis. We are therefore not disclosing that information this
time around.
Turning to slide 18, we can see our gross debt position, which has remained stable at
EUR3.7 billion. As you know, we issued EUR1 billion of undated subordinated notes in July
this year, and the proceeds were used to repay an equivalent amount of hybrid debt from
ING Group. The undated subordinated notes issued in July are required to be classiﬁed
as equity under IFRS accounting rules. This means that the associated coupon payments
of approximately EUR45 million a year are not recognized through the proﬁt and loss
account, but are distributed out of equity.

FINAL

While this impacts the level of interest cost that you see reported in the segment "Other"
and therefore also the net result, it has no impact on the return on equity, because we
adjust for this in the calculation by treating the undated subordinated notes as debt. We
also consider these undated notes as debt when reporting our gross debt position and in
the calculation of our ﬁnancial leverage ratio and ﬁxed cost coverage ratio.
As you can see, both our leverage ratio and ﬁxed cost coverage ratio has improved this
quarter. The improvement in the ﬁxed cost coverage ratio is quite notable to 8.4 times at
the end of the third quarter. This is, of course, on a last 12-months basis, and this
compares with 6.5 times at the end of the second quarter of 2014. Main reason behind
this increase is the increase of proﬁtability, lower funding cost and reduced debt levels.
And with that, I pass you back to Lard for his ﬁnal remarks.

Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes. Delﬁn, thank you. Let's turn to the wrap up page number 20. I'd like to sum up by
saying that we are pleased to report a strong set of results for the third quarter of 2014.
The operating result went up, expenses down in line with our strategic focus, and we have
maintained a robust capital position. We continue to make encouraging progress to
deliver on our strategic priorities. Now, we recognize that we are in the early stages of our
journey and there is still a long way to go, but that journey continues and we are conﬁdent
that we are heading in the right direction.

Bloomberg Transcript

So with that, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to open the call for your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you, Mr. Friese. (Operator Instructions) First question is from Mr. Cor Kluis. Your line
is open. Please go ahead.

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

Good morning. Cor Kluis, Rabobank. I've got a few questions. First of all concerning the
bank, it has incredible increase of results that we have seen there, the 13 million operating
result, is that a kind of recurring ﬁgure or is this something exceptional in that? That's my
ﬁrst question.
And second question is more broader that's on dividend. When you did the IPO, you
clearly mentioned on the 175 million dividend that it's not a policy and it's discretionary.
Might it be possible that you pay more than 175 million as a ﬁnal dividend next year
because of that link that seems somewhat on the low side given the great progress that
the company is making, annualized EUR350 million dividend? The company is making
much more on the free cash ﬂow and earnings basis, solvency is quite good. So could you
indicate something more about that or -- yeah, that's my second question.

FINAL

And my last and third question is about your Solvency II ratio. When can we expect some
new information on that? I believe that the Dutch regulator is going to manage, look
closely to Solvency II ratio from next year onwards here in the Netherlands. Can you at
least give some indication on the timing? And if you could give an indication on the level,
that would be even better, of course, but that's -- those are my three questions.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes, Cor, thanks for your questions. So the ﬁrst two will be covered by Delﬁn and the third
one about Solvency II will be covered by Doug Caldwell. So Delﬁn, over to you.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Cor. On NN Bank in detail, we are very pleased with the improvement in
proﬁtability of NN Bank. Obviously it was to be expected. NN Bank started as a very small
bank and as it has grown its balance sheet, has improved from increased interest margin.
In terms of your speciﬁc question, if this 13 million can be considered recurring, obviously
we do expect that over time the bank will grow further, but I think you have to -- I think
there are several drivers of the proﬁtability. In terms of the interest margin, this will
obviously be inﬂuenced by the pace of mortgage production going forward and
obviously the evolution of the cost of funding relative to the spread on the mortgages and
that obviously can vary over time.
In terms of the operating expenses, as the bank grows, it's expected obviously to
continue increasing some of the expenses. Maybe just to give you an indication of
something that might not be in your radar screen is that as of the third quarter of 2015,
NN Bank will incur charges for the deposit guaranteed scheme, something that is not
currently the case. And that will be approximately 2.5 million per quarter or 10 million
annually. I think that answers your question on NN Bank, Cor.

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

Yeah, yeah. Correct.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

In terms of dividend policy, we have been very explicit about our policy in relationship to
ordinary dividends with a target between 40% and 50% of our operating result of the
ongoing business. Certainly, we are pleased with the positive evolution of capital
generation and evolution of solvency reﬂected by the improvement of the IGD to 283%.
And I think that we'll need to wait until we have more clarity in relationship to the required
capital going forward, which of course, the ongoing discussions on Solvency II is a key
input.
And as you know, for 2015, the ordinary dividend, as you rightly mentioned, is 175 million
and as a consequence, the 40 to 50 million will start based on the 2015 ﬁscal year.

A - Doug Caldwell

{BIO 17900909 <GO>}

FINAL

And on Solvency II, I think the -- as we move toward January 1, 2016 we saw the regulation
is becoming clear, we are working quite intensively on the implementation of the
speciﬁcations, discussions with the regulator and further interpreting some of the
regulations. This is ongoing. We're also considering our management actions as
necessary to make sure we're prepared.
At the same time, there are still quite some material uncertainties, and while the technical
details are becoming more clear, except for potentially the volatility adjustment which is
still we're waiting on further speciﬁcations from EIOPA, but also we are -- it's also
emerging how regulators will interpret all of the details, what the kind of ratios to be
expected will be and these conversations are really now starting more in earnest, and very
likely will run through most of 2015. So therefore it's certainly too early for us to provide
further guidance or to say even conclusively when we will give further guidance.

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

And when I combine your last two answers the fact that Solvency II has probably not yet
totally clear at the end of this year, it does also mean that you will not pay more than 175
million dividend as a ﬁnal dividend. Is that a correct conclusion or not?

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Delﬁn?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

I think that our conclusion on the payment of dividends can only be reached once that
decision has being taken and obviously that needs to go through our own assessment
over the capital situation, the stress events that we consider based on the new regulatory
regime and also in consultation with our supervisory board. So it's premature in order to
say anything else than the guidance we have already been -- we have already provided.

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

Okay, wonderful. Thank you.

Next question is from Mr. Farooq Hanif who is with Citigroup. Your line is open. Please go
ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. I've got two question areas.
One is on Japan Closed Book and the second is Solvency II again. And so on Japan
Closed Book, you took a positive reserve release on lapse assumptions. I was wondering,
ﬁrstly, what is the likelihood that if we continue to see an improvement in net amount at
risk and the out-of-the-moneyness, markets going up. Would you -- would it be normal to
expect further reserve -- additional reserve calculation changes of this nature? And the
reserve release that you've taken now, what does that imply for the outstanding duration
Page 10 of 26

FINAL

of capital release of policyholders? Has this been a material change? That's sort of
question one.
Question two is, on Solvency II again, could you update us on internal model validations?
So I believe that ING and NN Group were quite advanced in the production of internal
model and discussion with the DNB on this. Are you still conﬁdent that at some point in
the next couple of years the internal model process could be the main driver more than
standard formula? Thank you.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

So Farooq, thanks for your questions. Doug will cover both.

A - Doug Caldwell

{BIO 17900909 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. So on the Japan VA, I think it's important to note that we regularly review our
assumptions usually approximately this time annually. And the overall change is not that -it's a modest changes to our assumptions for out-of-the-money lapses. So we just over the
last year have been getting much more experience in account values above the
guarantees and those lapse rates have been higher than we had been assuming. And so
we've reﬂected that experience into the ﬁgures as best we can estimate it. And that is also
used for our hedging in all of our models because -- for all purposes.
In terms of -- since we've updated our best estimates and based on experience, then we
don't necessarily anticipate updating them further in the future, but we will always
monitor experience and see where we end up. In terms of -- because of course we do
model the lapses that diﬀer by where the account value is versus the guarantee and that's
certainly the way customers have behaved.
In terms of whether this could be running oﬀ faster, it's not a highly material change to our
ﬁgures, but it does say that in general, our assumption show that if customers have
account values higher than the guarantee, they are more likely to lapse, which could lead
to some acceleration, but again the -- because of the maturity process, the main focus we
have is the 90% of the block will run oﬀ by 2019.
In terms of Solvency II, I think the internal model, the standard model, how those will
interact, how the regulators will assess these and exactly how it will go through is one of
those things that's still to be worked through. It is true we've discussed with the regulator
for quite some time on the internal model, but the process begins for -- in earnest in 2015
when you have to formally provide an internal model application. And it's really only
working through that process that you have -- we have enough clarity to give more
deﬁnitive guidance.

Next question is from Mr. William Hawkins who is with KBW. Go ahead please.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hello, thank you for taking my questions. First of all, in the roll forward of the holding
company cash capital, could you just remind us what you'd expect to be a normal
quarterly negative? I think there have been some positives that have helped you this year,
but what sort of the normal running costs, and if you like, interest cost we should allow?
And if we think into the fourth quarter, is there any reason to be expecting any dividends
coming out of the subsidiaries then or are we now really holding on till the second
quarter next year?
And then secondly, just brieﬂy on the investment margin, I think you've repeated most of
your comments about re-risking and the rest of it, but can you just remind us, if we're on, I
think the 108 basis point Dutch life investment margin, is that a ﬁgure that should stay
about stable or do you think it could be going up or down over the next couple of years?
Thank you.

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning, William. Delﬁn, can you please take both?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, in terms of the holding capital, the cash capital generated, is diﬃcult to have a
normal running cost, because this depends on the decisions of distribution of dividends
from the diﬀerent subsidiaries. Keep in mind that, particularly for Japan Life, but also in
Insurance Europe, dividends tends to come in the second quarter or normally in the ﬁrst
half of the year, but more towards the ﬁrst quarter.
Then there are also elements like proceeds from divestments. We are still waiting for
closing on one transaction, important transaction in China with our joint venture with Bank
of Beijing, and basically you have the running cost, which relates to the funding cost and
that is easy to calculate based on the level of outstanding debt.
And also keep in mind on that, that although the interest on the undated subordinated
notes are accounted -- are paid out of equity, for the purpose of calculating the cash ﬂow
generation on the holding company, this is included as a ﬂow towards -- basically an
outﬂow, so it's considered as an expense.
And in terms of the normal holding expenses, you can take around 30 million a quarter.
And if you look at the interest cost including this undated, I think it's around 40 million. So
I would say that pre-tax is around 70 million or 40 million around -- after-tax.

Thank you. And any dividends in the fourth quarter?

FINAL

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

We'll see the dividends as they come along, William. It might -- we might receive some
dividends, but I think it's better to wait for that outcome. The most important element
here in terms of the capital generation is that it's not a quarter-per-quarter evolution that
matters. It's the overall evolution. That's why we have always set also the targets in a
medium-term, but in terms of, as I said before, keep in mind that the second quarter is the
one that tends to be bigger in terms of dividend generation.

Then we'll go to the investment margin development. So Delﬁn?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, certainly the investment margin is under pressure. For Japan, it's not that relevant or
important. For Insurance Europe, we have seen that due to the lower investment -- lower
volumes of investments, assets -- of invested assets as well as the low interest rates on the
reinvestments, that there is -- are aﬀected negatively and that we expected to continue.
And also within Netherlands Life, which is obviously the highest contributor to this line, as
we have mentioned in the past, the eﬀort to invest into higher yielding assets so far has
bear fruit and we have managed to compensate that investment margin going forward.
We will -- there is -- that policy we will continue to be applying, but it's diﬃcult to predict
into the future how interest rates or spreads might evolve.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yes, hi. Thank you and good morning, everyone. Just a couple of questions. First of all,
can you give us a bit of color about your cash in the holding company. I mean, you are
running at around 1.2 billion cash at the moment whereas, if I remember correctly at your
IPO, you were kind of running at around 900 million, which you mentioned is kind of a
comfortable level. So what's the likelihood of you doing a buyback or something, maybe
a buyback from ING Group in 2015? What's the likelihood of that or would you want to
hold this 1.2 billion cash in the balance sheet going forward as well? So that's the ﬁrst
question.
Secondly, if you can update me on -- update a bit on, have you taken any hedges on your
credit exposure on your credit risk, because certainly your IGD is very volatile if credit
spreads start moving in. So have you thought about taking any hedges on that or do you
think it's best to avoid that thing?
And thirdly, any thoughts on litigation, any news, good, bad anything we should expect?
Thank you.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Thanks Ashik. The ﬁrst question about the cash capital at holding will be covered by
Delﬁn, the second one by Doug and the ﬁnal one on litigation by myself. So Delﬁn?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Ashik, thanks for the questions. Obviously, we very pleased with the evolution of our
Solvency and the evolution of the cash capital. In terms of your explicit question about the
possibility of doing a buyback in 2015 is something that is not reasonable to answer at this
time. And we have to -- and I repeat myself now, we have to wait and see how the cash
capital evolve over 2015 and what is also the intentions of ING Group in relationship to
their divestments.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Sorry, just to add on to that, just to put it other way, do you intend to think about any M&A
at the moment or i.e., use this cash at capital to do any M&A maybe in your local market
or anywhere else? Yeah. Thank you. Just a follow-up on that.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yeah, Ashik, when it comes to M&A, we are focused -- our priority is really taking the
current platform that we have and driving the earnings improvement and generating cash
capital. That's our priority, that's our focus and that's what we are busy with. So please
continue Delﬁn or maybe we can cover the hedges on credit exposure.

A - Doug Caldwell

{BIO 17900909 <GO>}

So in short, we're not against hedging this at some point, but we are not currently holding
any material hedges on spread exposure. I would say though, I mean, if you look at, again

Page 14 of 26



Company Name: NN Group NV

FINAL

I reiterate, our balance sheet, we have a signiﬁcant number of government bonds and
also we've been expanding in mortgages and loans, which had a little less exposure to
spread risk. So when you look at the overall ﬁxed income, it's true that you have a spread
risk, but we also note that we have a very illiquid set of liability. So we want to -- there will
be some volatility but over time we believe this will be a reasonable way to manage this.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

When it comes to the unit-linked ﬁle, well, there is no material update or material
developments otherwise we would have updated you also in the form of press releases et
cetera. So nothing to update you on what already has been disclosed. So that's basically
it.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah, but just so -- just one thing on that. I mean, I remember that there was some thought
that by the end of the year, we should hear back from European Court of Justice. I mean,
any thoughts on where we are on that or has that period passed or any thoughts on that?

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

No, Ashik. That's still the same expectation that we have. So a -- the European Court case
that will -- that's aimed to provide more insight into the interpretation of the European
Directive on information provision, that court case is expected to have a ruling no earlier
than by the end of this year. That's the same situation.

Yeah, hi. Good morning. Two quick questions. First of all, on the NN Non-Life P&C
combined ratio, you ﬂagged weather and bodily injuries as factors that resulted in above
100% combined ratio. Can you specify for each of these components, how much they
aﬀected the combined ratio? And then secondly, I heard what you just said about the
"woekerpolis" issue to Ashik, but yesterday, I think the Consumentenbond made an
announcement of a proposal to the insurance sector or the request to this insurance
sector to resolve this issue. Do you expect that this could trigger a general agreement for
this issue across the sector or how do you look at the Consumentenbond statements from
yesterday? Thank you.

FINAL

Yeah, let me take the unit-linked ﬁle ﬁrst, Michael, and then hand over to Delﬁn for the
Non-Life question. So yeah, indeed the Consumentenbond, which is a large consumer
organization in the Netherlands, has indeed written a letter to the industry, to all the
insurance companies. We received this letter as well. We are studying that letter.
Having said that, that's -- whether that leads to general outcome for the entire industry, I
mean, it's really very early to speculate on that. And by the way, there is many -- during
the weeks and months et cetera, there is oftentimes media around this issue where
various interesting parties are -- interested parties are giving their views or their opinions
or other things. So we will just look at the letter that Consumentenbond has sent to the
various insurance companies and take it from there.

Q - Michael van Wegen

{BIO 6435238 <GO>}

So maybe on the Non-life company?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, Michael. So indeed that has been -- to understand the combined ratio for
Netherlands Non-life, one has to split and look at what has happened with Disability &
Accident that has improved the combined ratio signiﬁcantly both in the quarter and yearto-date. And some deterioration in the Non-life Property & Casualty combined ratio.
When -- your speciﬁc question was about weather-related claims. And in the third quarter,
that represented a 2 percentage points of combined ratio within Property & Casualty.
One thing to take into account when comparing the ratio, Property & Casualty with the
same quarter of last year is that, in the third quarter of last year, there was an adjustment
of 15 million provision release and that has basically lowered that combined ratio then. If
you were to adjust for that, basically we would be at around the same level in terms of
combined ratio, and obviously if you were to take the weather-related claims, that will
reduce by approximately 2 percentage points in the combined ratio Property & Casualty.
However, I think that weather-related claims might come and go and I don't -- I wouldn't
say that it is a non-recurrent, but it just happened this quarter.

Q - Michael van Wegen

{BIO 6435238 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. And maybe one follow-up on that, if I may. I think also you guys ﬂagged
bodily injuries. Is that something that you consider as a one-oﬀ? And if so, what was the
impact?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

No, I don't think is a particular one-oﬀ. I think it's within the deterioration on the claims
ratio for Motor. This is one part that obviously is included and there is -- we have seen a
deterioration on the underwriting there, but I would not say it is one speciﬁc nonrecurrent event within the particular quarter, but that can be obviously be bumpy from
one quarter to another.

Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I just want to follow up on the -one of their earlier questions on internal versus standard model under Solvency II. And I
understand that the formal process for submitting the internal models is just getting
started. I was just wondering if you had any kind of estimate or guidance of when it might
be approved by and I understand that's very tough because it is just at the starting stages,
but I'm just wondering if you comment on that?
And then second of all, in terms of your normal historical operations, when would you
normally expect to see the Japan Closed Block VA or the Dutch Life business or any other
unit kind of upstream the dividend, particularly I am thinking 4Q and what possibly could
be upstreamed. Thank you.

Yeah, on the -- in terms of timelines, I think these things run pretty close to the start of
January 2016. So to the extent you would work to an IMAP [Internal Model Approval
Process] or to the extent that you'd be using standard model, those discussions are
probably only going to be ﬁnalizing in the fourth quarter of 2015.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

And in terms of the potential dividend from the Japan Closed Block VA, just a reminder to
everyone, this is the capital release under ING Re within the Netherlands and indeed the
net amount of the risk has reduced and as the portfolio has started to run oﬀ, we have
seen positve development in the solvency and the capital required behind. But as I said
before, any decision on the actual dividends will be announced and communicated when
decided.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

The dividend -- you have to diﬀerentiate two things. One was the dividends coming from
Japan legal entity. Japan legal entity, in relationship to the Japan Closed Block VA,
beneﬁts from the administrative fees that the company receives there. In terms of the
dividends coming out of ING Re, we have come through a process where there has been
some strengthening of the capital of ING Re recently. So i.e., there is no, let's say, seasonal
or a pattern on when ING Re paid dividends in the past.

Next question is from Mr. Francois Boisson of BNP. Your line is open.

Q - Francois Boisson

{BIO 2188833 <GO>}

Yes, good morning, everybody. Three questions please. The ﬁrst one is on the
Netherlands. You are seeing a fairly good business growth there on pension renewals and
the new pension fund buy-outs. I was wondering whether you could give a bit more
details about the terms you are getting on renewals, the level of internal rate of return that
you can get, or I'd say the ways where it can reduce guarantees and improve the
proﬁtability of the capital being deployed there? And also if you can give a bit more
details about the pension fund buy-outs, the size and the terms you reached?
And second question is on your Investment Management business, and I was just
wondering what was going to be the impact from the mandate you get from the ECB on
the ABS program? And last question would be around your tax rate. I think it's 19% in
terms of eﬀective tax rate in Q3 and which seems to be lower than, I think, the 26% you
are guiding on, so a bit more details?

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes, so let's -- so ﬁrst of all I'm going to cover the ﬁrst two and Delﬁn will cover the tax rate
question. So when it comes to the business in the Netherlands, indeed we were able to -as we know, there is this pension buyout opportunity in the Netherlands. This is

something that we are active in. Having said that, we've always said that we maintain our
own pricing targets, in let's say, negotiations on these deals. And if they meet our pricing
targets, then we hope to -- if we win them, then great. If we don't, then not.
We have been able to win a contract in this quarter. It's roughly 100 million single
premium. That was a pension buyout. In terms of its terms, we generally price this on a
market consistent basis and always -- and also look of course at return on capital that we
will be making for this. We have speciﬁc pricing targets for that, and it needs to adhere to
that in order to make sure that we get the right bang for our buck, if you will, in terms of
return on capital. When it comes to the --

Q - Francois Boisson

{BIO 2188833 <GO>}

Sorry, on that, do you have a minimum threshold in terms of return on capital deployed?

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, I would say, MCVNB obviously needs to be positive and the internal rate of return, I
would say it's high single-digit, high single-digit at minimum. So when it comes to the
impact of the ECB mandate, well, obviously we are very pleased with -- that our
Investment Management group has won this mandate in the sense that it's been
appointed by the ECB as one of the four asset managers to support the ECB in the ABS
purchasing program. It's I think proof testament and underscores the expertise and the
experience that our investment professionals have in this ﬁeld.
Now obviously, the ECB mandate has -- in terms of the size, has not been disclosed by the
ECB at this point. It's run a competitive process. So we expect obviously the mandate to
contribute to the proﬁtability of the business, but please bear in mind that, the ECB has
run a competitive process. The tax rate? Delﬁn?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, Francois. In terms of the tax rate, 19% is not that extraordinarily low or diﬀerent. I
mean, normally you can expect anything from 20, 26%. Any changes of course in
relationship to the eﬀective tax rate in all the diﬀerent tax regimes that where we are
operating. But the largest explanation for this lower tax rate in the quarter is driven by the
tax exemption in the Netherlands for investments that you hold for more than 5% as
stakes.

Yes, good morning. Two questions please. First is on the IGD Solvency at group level.
Wondered if you could break down the 12 percentage points sequential increase between
the part driven by organic capital generation of the market movement and the unrealized
capital gains? And also related to that, if you could just update us on the economic capital
ratio, you were at around 200% at the start of the year. Just wondered how that evolve in
the meanwhile.
And my second question was on the Dutch Life. I wondered if you could provide the
breakdown of the operating results between the individual and the group life segments,
just in order to get a better idea of the impact of the run-oﬀ process on your individual or
on your Dutch Life earnings power? Thank you.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Okay. Delﬁn, can you cover maybe both the topics?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, the IGD ratio, the increase is mainly driven by the increase in the IGD capital base,
which was around 10 million [ph] while the required capital increased by approximately
100 million. And basically the main reason behind this increase in the available capital, it
is related to the net result of the period of 344 million and also the positive revaluation
resulting from market movements. Does that answer the question, Matthias?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Matthias De Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Yes, partially and just wondered with regard to the economic capital ratio and the more
market-based framework. Would you see the same movements, for example, since the
start of the year from the 200% economic capital ratio?

A - Doug Caldwell

{BIO 17900909 <GO>}

Yeah. Yeah, this is Doug. I'll take this one. The -- on the AFR/EC ratio, we disclosed this
once a year and we disclose it, I think, as you said, 203% at the end of the year 2013,
including the pro forma for the capital injections. We haven't been disclosing this on a
quarterly basis. I think it's fair to say though that we are comfortable with our current
capital levels. And so that we have a good level of capital.

far and it will be strange to do it so quickly in answer of a question now. So I think that the

proﬁtability of the segments so far, we have not provided details.

Yeah, good morning. A couple of questions on Dutch deﬁned beneﬁt, please. You
obviously had a lot of success through renewal of the DB schemes that you are
administering. Could you just please give us an indication of persistency of those
schemes?
And the second question is on the buyouts. I know you've answered a little bit of this
already, but it's relatively small, but we didn't -- the guidance sort of we got at the IPO was
that maybe you weren't looking to do these sort of deals for a few years. And just why
particularly do you think you won that scheme? Is it lack of competition, is it the strength
of your brand? And is it maybe more desire from your part, if you could just talk about
that please? Thank you.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yeah, so ﬁrst on the -- yeah, thanks, Gordon. First on the Dutch renewals, so ﬁrst of all,
when it comes to Dutch pensions as a strategy, the -- our focus is on doing renegotiations
or renewals in such a way that we cater for the need also for our clients to move to the
deﬁned beneﬁt, more to deﬁned contribution in terms of their features. So that's what
we're doing and we have a very elaborate renewal strategy in place to do that.
We are indeed quite successful on that which is good. So we have a high persistency rate,
the percentage of which, I cannot give you at this point in time. So we'll get back to you

separately on that, but we have quite a successful way of doing that, including those
negotiations.
When it comes to the buyout market, we have -- ﬁrst of all, this buyout opportunity stems
from let's say, smaller pension funds that want to ﬁnd a new home for the liabilities and
insurance companies are competing for that. There's a number of insurance companies,
small number of companies that actually do this business and can do this business and we
are one of them, as we are one of the largest pension businesses in the market.
We've always maintained a view that we want to participate in this market of the buyouts,
but only at terms that what are agreeable to us. And in the past years we've seen quite
some softness in our view of the markets. So the pricing targets that we have could not be
achieved, and in those negotiations, at a certain point, you come to a certain area and
then it stops, and then you basically hook oﬀ.
And in some cases, in this case, we actually were able to get through and we won. This is
not because of a lack of pricing discipline. It's because we -- there is many puts and takes
and many particular components in such a deal that you're negotiating, which we were
able to conclude more successfully than others and that's why we won the deal. But
again, our pricing discipline is driving this and the pricing discipline is as I just mentioned,
MCVNB positive, internal rate of return and return on capital appropriate with the
minimum level of at least high single-digits.

Thanks. I'll just follow-up on the ﬁrst question, and it seems -- if you give us an indication
of that conversion of DB to DC, just an indication of size more proportionally. I mean, it
doesn't seem -- whenever I see so, don't seem that the Dutch market is going DC any
time soon. It seems with the industry fund that's so big and so deﬁned beneﬁt, that seems
to be a -- I mean there's no real move that we've seen in the UK or the U.S. in the Dutch
market yet.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

No, I agree with you, Gordon that this is a gradual process, but please bear in mind that,
the history of the Netherlands is that pension plans were very much deﬁned beneﬁt plans.
Having said that, ﬁrst of all, the low rate environment et cetera are really making these
plans in terms of the renewals, et cetera very expensive for employers that are the
sponsors of these plans. So what you can -- and secondly, you have the IFRS volatility that
on their balance sheet often times, these DB plans bring.
So what you see is that there is a need, a real need that we see progressing and
accelerating actually the Dutch market where employers say, we'd like to move more to
deﬁned contribution plans -- this requires negotiations between trade unions and
between employer representation. So it's quite a complicated structures and that takes
time to completely roll through, but we are very well positioned for driving this change in
the market through our own portfolio and to getting business from our competition. We

have a full set of solutions for this, insured solutions, non-insured solutions. So we're very
well positioned to do this for our own clients and from clients of our competition.

Next question is from Mr. Frank Kopﬁnger who is with Commerzbank. Your line is open.

Q - Frank Kopﬁnger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Thank you. Hello, everybody. I have two questions. My ﬁrst question is on Life
Netherlands. Life technical margin was 70 million, looks very low. And I think in your
presentation, you mentioned that this was internal rather volatile and this was driven for
Q3 by negative hedging impacts. And my question would be, could you elaborate a little
bit on the magnitude of the hedging impact on -- and overall what you would regard as a
normalized technical margin level for the Life Netherlands business?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then secondly on the Investment Management division, there you had net outﬂows of
2 billion. In the presentation, you said this was driven by pension plan company. Could
you comment also whether this was rather a one-oﬀ or there is more to come in the next
quarters?

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Please, Delﬁn -- thanks, Frank. Delﬁn, can you take those questions?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. Frank. There is no hedging impact within the technical margin, but in the technical
margin indeed, there is some volatility from one quarter to another. In this particular
quarter, there are two large impacts that we have ﬂagged with our press release. First is
an 18 million negative impact related to our legacy book of paid up pension contract,
which have a 4% guaranteed interest rate and receive a percentage of any positive
technical result. Any negative technical result is netted with this investment income or
otherwise is deferred and oﬀset against future positive technical result.
As the investment income is under pressure and the technical result due to mortality was
also under pressure, following a review of the particular contract, we concluded that it was
necessary to basically write oﬀ this asset of potential compensation with the future
technical results. So this is certainly a non-recurrent 18 million explaining the decrease in
the technical margin.
And then we have another one that may change from time to time, which is related to the
unit linked guarantee provision. And this is the reﬂection of the lower interest rates that
have on these guarantees that we have provided in the past for a portfolio of around 400
million. And when the interest rates decrease as it happens not only in the second quarter

FINAL

of this year, but also in the third quarter the value of the guarantee increases and
additions to the provisions need to be made. And as a consequence, this can be volatile,
but in this particular quarter was negative by 13 million.
Just for your information. Last year in the second quarter and third quarter, it was the
other way around, interest rates decreased and as a consequence the provision as you
know, move in the opposite direction. And that in itself in a year-to-date as you know had
in 2013 an impact of 44 million in the technical margin. So the comparability with last year
is important to take that into account. So no particular trend that I can see here, but
basically this volatility quarter-per-quarter may and will continue to exist.
Then the second question on the net outﬂows. These are obviously that there is 2 billion
of net outﬂows, about half of this is explained by the third-party mandates and your
question about the pension funds, basically, this is a couple of pension funds in the
Netherlands that following their decision to transfer the liabilities to insurance company,
we lost the assets under management for those companies.
Don't know if I have answered all the question or there is something --

Q - Frank Kopﬁnger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Yeah, when would we open the -- there is more to come in terms of outﬂows in Q4 now or
this was it?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Well, we should not understand this net outﬂows as the fact that, that we did not have
inﬂows and this will always be -- so we are talking about the net impact this time that
indeed was aﬀected by these transfer of the pension, but also by some other small things
like the closing of our oﬃce in Hungary that although the majority of the assets under
management were transferred to other locations that has an impact. But that will go up
and down.

Q - Frank Kopﬁnger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Okay, thanks.

(Operator Instructions) And the next question is from Mr. Fahad Changazi, Nomura. Go
ahead sir, your line is open.

Q - Fahad Changazi

{BIO 15216120 <GO>}

Good morning. I have three questions but hopefully they are very, very quick. First on the
Investment Management side of things. But -- quite good earnings, it was actually 14%
looks like sort of beat the mid single-digit percent increased target you disclosed at the
IPO given that you just hired your emerging markets equity team, can we take the 67%

cost to income ratio at nine months stage as a good base to work from going forward?
That's the ﬁrst question.
Second question is on the cost savings. I know Delﬁn, you don't want to give too much
detail in terms of breakdown, but you've achieved 108 million already, 60 million for
Netherlands Life, which is 30% of the original is going to be back-end loaded. So that 60
million coming later, 100 million achieved now, bit more in Q4. Does that mean 2015 will
have no cost savings coming through? I'm just trying to get -- understand how the
projection would be working on that one.
And the ﬁnal question is on Insurance Europe. I appreciate that in a recent scale in some
of the markets, but could you just reprise us that when, at what point in terms of time,
would you have a look at these operations here? We've tried turning them around, if not
working, perhaps we should look at disposals. Thank you.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

So the ﬁrst two will be covered by Delﬁn and I will do the last one. So Delﬁn?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, in terms of cost income ratio going forward for Investment Management, the ﬁrst
thing you need to take into account is in the ﬁrst half of the year, there were 10 million
extraordinary releases of provisions so that is something to be taken into account.
However, taking a longer perspective, as the assets under management increase, we do
expect to have improvement on the cost income ratio in the future, while at the same
time, obviously the investment in building up the franchise may slow down these
improvements.
In terms of the cost reduction program in the Netherlands, of course, we are expecting
that in 2015, there will be -- there will continue to be some cost savings. As explained
some of the savings particularly in corporate/holding we're very much front-loaded,
particularly those related to legacy business. And one cannot extrapolate our savings
going forward or the split of savings. And we do not consider at this point of time that our
indication or target towards 2016, there is no change on that.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

And Fahad, when it comes to our portfolio considerations, so we take regularly we do a
review of our portfolio and we look at the performance obviously of the businesses that
we put it in context of why we are in that market, what the future trends are in that market,
the attractiveness et cetera. And we will take it -- we take a dispassionate view on that. We
basically analyze it regularly, make sure that we put it in context, we ask ourselves are we
the right owners for this and we'll take our decisions from there.

Q - Fahad Changazi

{BIO 15216120 <GO>}

That's great. Thank you very much.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

So if there are no further questions, then I would like to sum up by saying that we are
pleased to report a strong set of results for the third quarter of 2014. The operating result
went up, expenses are down, in line with our strategic focus and we have maintained a
robust capital position. We continue to make encouraging progress to deliver on our
strategic priorities. We are in the early stages of our journey, and there is still a long way
to go. But that journey continues and we are conﬁdent that we are heading in the right
direction. I want to thank you for your interest. I want to thank you for all the questions,
and I wish you a very good day.
