Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to today's Hannover Re International
Conference Call on Interim Results Third Quarter 2016. For your information, this
conference is being recorded.
At this time, I would like the hand the call over to your host today, Mr. Ulrich Wallin, Chief
Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.

Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Thank you very much and good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining
the Hannover Re conference call. As usual, I'm joined by our CFO, Roland Vogel and we
are pleased to present to you the figure for the first nine months of 2016.
We are very pleased that our net income for the first nine months saw an increase
compared to last year and now stands at €790 million. We feel that this increase is
remarkable for three reasons. Firstly, last (0:58) result was aided by a positive one-off
effect to the tune of €39 million which, of course, was not repeated this year.
Secondly, business environment for reinsurance remained difficult due to the continued
soft market in the P&C reinsurance business and due to the continued low interest rate
environment. Thirdly, the absolute level of profitability displayed in the first nine months is
fully in line with our profitability target. At least from the favorable results for the nine

months, we are increasingly confident that we will reach our full year net income guidance,
provided that the large losses as well as the capital markets develop, in line with the
expectations.

FINAL

Adjusted for foreign exchange rate movement, the growth premium income is slightly
down by 1.7% whilst the net premiums earned, at the same time, are slightly up again by
1.7%.
The reason for this is mainly the result of some discontinued large transactions in
particular on the Life & Health side, which however had significant amounts of (2:33) on
them so that the effects are more pronounced regarding the gross premiums and less on
the net premium side.
On the P&C side, whilst the volume is a little bit down after nine months, our fee income
increased premium on the third quarter on a stand-alone basis. This is due to new
business being written in the third quarter, and thus, we can expect that this development
will continue into the fourth quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Shareholder's equity increased by 8.8% and the book value per share stands at €72.81.
The reason for this will be explained by Roland. Nevertheless, due to the favorable
earnings, the ROE continues to remain at attractive levels, well above our minimum target
with an ROE for the first nine months of 12.5%.
The combined ratio, as well as the resultant increased underwriting result, is very much in
line with expectation and the third quarter did not benefit from any reserve releases over
and above the usual positive runoff result. Following the benign third quarter of large
losses, we are well below our large loss target after nine months. However, in line with our
usual practice, we largely kept the unused part of the large loss budget for the remainder
of the year.
Our Life & Health business developed somewhat above our expectation even though last
year's result was benefiting from the already mentioned positive one-off effect. The EBIT
increased by 17.9% compared to last year and this increase in profitability in particular
stems from our Paris branch that last year we had experienced some problems. This, of
course, will not repeat it this year, and our Paris branch is back to the normal level of
profitability.
Despite the fact that we saw some adverse claims experience on our U.S. Mortality
business, overall, the profitability of our U.S. business on the Life & Health side is up. The
net income or the income from our investments under management is fully in line with our
full-year target. So, return on investment from assets under management reached 3.0%
which is even slightly more than our full year target of 2.9%.
With this rather positive note, I would like to hand over to Roland who will explain to you
these figures in more detail.

FINAL

Yes. Good morning and thank you, Uli. As usual, I will focus on the nine months figures and
try to keep my comments as brief as possible, not the least because the quarter is fairly
straightforward, and does not include too many extraordinary effects.
The slight decrease in the top-line is in line with our expectation for the full year, especially
in light of the strong growth we recorded in the previous year. Net premium income
increased by 1.7%. This is driven by the change in unearned premium in our P&C segment
on the one hand and by the slight increase in retention on our Life & Health segment on
the other.
Investment income is in line with our expectation excluding the €39 million positive one-off
effect in Life & Health in Q1 2015. Investment income from assets under own management
is on the level of the previous year, which I feel can be seen as a success in the current
yield environment.

Bloomberg Transcript

Other income expenses decreased mainly to less positive currency effects. We are still in
positive range, but not to the extent we had experienced last year. Last year, the
depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar had that significant positive effect, which
again didn't repeat itself. At 27%, the tax ratio was only slightly higher than in the previous
year.
On the next page, you see that shareholders' equity increased by 8.8%. On the right hand
side of this slide, you can see that in addition to our very positive result, most notably the
capital contribution from valuation reserves in our investments increased by nearly €700
million as a result of low interest rates, thereby more than compensating the dividend
payment.
On one the hand, it is good to see our capital strengths improving even further, while on
the other hand, the increased valuation reserves loan are diluting our return on equity by
more than 50 basis points. Without that additional increase in reserves, the ROE would
have been over 13%.
At €1.7 billion, cash flow continue to be very positive in the first nine months of 2016, again
demonstrating the strong cash flow production of our business model. Supported by this,
assets under own management increased by 3.4% to more than €40 billion, increasing
valuation reserve had a positive effect of around €1 billion while the negative impact from
foreign exchange rates on the other hand was around €700 million, to especially the
weakening of the British pound after the Brexit decision has materialized.
As a result of our strict margin oriented underwriting approach, P&C gross premium
decreased by the mentioned 1.5% on an FX adjusted basis. This decrease is less
pronounced and reported at the time of the half year results, driven by a favorable
premium development in the third quarter, which showed an increase of 6% on a standalone basis.

FINAL

Please bear in mind that we had a non-recurring effect associated with the accounting of
our facultative business in the previous year, where we booked almost €100 million in
additional premium. Moreover, we scaled back our involvement in Chinese motor
business as well as in our specialty lines particularly in aviation where rates did not justify a
continued participation. This was partly offset by business opportunities especially in the
U.S. and additional contributions from our structured reinsurance team.
Net premium earned increased by 0.9% on an FX-adjusted basis. This is as already
mentioned, not the result of a higher retention which actually decreased slightly, but
rather it is due to the change in unearned premium driven by the strong growth in 2015.
Following a very benign first and a very active second quarter, loss activity was clearly
below the expected level in the third quarter with net large losses amounting to only 41%
versus the quarterly budget allocation of €265 million. As a result, the overall large losses
were 6.6% of net premium income for the first nine months and, therefore, significantly
below expectations.
However, in line with our usual practice, we have capped the yearly large loss
expectations in our reserving assumptions which provides us with a comfortable buffer for
the rest of the year. On that basis, the pleasing underwriting results leads to a combined
ratio of 95%, clearly beating our maximum target of 96%.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the third quarter, the run-off of reserves was positive within the expected range and we
did not benefit from any extraordinary developments here.
You will remember that we did mention an extraordinary positive run-off of around €150
million at the end of the second quarter, which largely is still included in the year-to-date
number. At that point in time, the confidence level of reserves were slightly down when
compared to the end of the 2015. I here do refer to the number we have published
during our Investors Day of nearly €1.9 billion. With the positive result in Q3 stand-alone,
the confidence level of our loss reserves should have at least remained stable or even
slightly improved when compared to the end of June.
On the reinvestment income here was in line with expectations, the total investment
income decreased slightly. I will explain the details later. The tax rate increased slightly
compared to last year mainly as a result of a less positive result from our Bermudian
subsidiary. Altogether, with an EBIT margin of more than 15%, the P&C segment again
delivered a very pleasing performance in the light of a challenging market environment.
As already mentioned, the overall large loss situation was below budget for the first nine
months. As a result, the unused part of our large loss budget was boosted or has
boosted the remaining large loss budget for the rest of the year to €432 million at the
end of the third quarter. Based on a recent conservative, but of course still uncertain first
calculation, Hurricane Matthew led to a loss of slightly below €100 million and with some
smaller losses from Italy and the larger fire loss in Germany. Today we should have
approximately €300 million left for the remainder of the year when it comes to large
losses.

FINAL

After nine months, 14 losses are showing up on our large loss list. The overall benign large
loss experience can be attributed mainly to the very moderate situation in the third
quarter, which was one of the least affected quarters if I look at that recent past. The
absence of a major Atlantic hurricane, as mentioned Matthew was a fourth quarter event,
is not the only factor here because other losses were also below the expected level.
Looking at the technical profitability of our P&C book by line of business, but first to
confirm the favorable development in the business line as explained in connection with
the half year results. The combined ratio in Marine includes a positive run-off of reserves
of roughly €40 million in total in the second quarter. As expected, the combined ratio for
the first nine months here is trending higher again, but it is still below the normal level.
On a nine months basis, various lines made good contributions to the very positive results
and in particular, the target markets driven in part by the volume of the segment. Our
NatCat segment is also back below the MtCR, thanks to the absence of Cat losses in Q3.

Bloomberg Transcript

The earthquake loss in Ecuador explains the high combined ratio in the worldwide treaty
business, and credit and surety was mainly affected by one large claim. As mentioned, our
P&C portfolio, as a whole, continues to perform well below the maximum tolerable
combined ratio.
As we explained in our Q2 call, premium growth in our life and health segment was
particularly strong in the third and the fourth quarters of the previous year, and, hence, our
premium decreased by 2% adjusted for currency effects here. This is mainly driven by the
discontinuation of individual large treaties in China and Australia, marking the continued
demand in Longevity especially from the UK.
Net premium earned increased by almost 2.8%, adjusted for currency effects, and the
increase in net retention reflects, first and foremost, the reduced need for repossession
premium Ulrich has already mentioned.
Even without adjusting for the €39 million positive one-off effect in the previous year, the
EBIT for the first nine months of 2016 has increased significantly as compared to 2015.
Our financial solutions business continues to show excellent profitability with an EBIT
margin of more than 19%, Longevity also favorable with an EBIT margin above the 2%
target.
The unfavorable development of the US mortality experienced in the second quarter is
the main reason for the missing mortality and morbidity. Here, the third quarter, US
mortality came in with the results slightly above expectation. Overall, the 4.3% trigger is
definitely an improvement as compared to 2015.
On the investment side, ordinary investment income here was similarly in line with our
expectation, realized gains a little bit higher than normal, and I will come to this on the

Page 5 of 18

FINAL

next slide. The effect from our ModCo derivatives was close to zero for the first nine
months. And again, all together, net income increased strongly by nearly 18%.
Looking at the investment, the development is very satisfactory with investment income
slightly above our expectations. The decrease in ordinary investment income mainly due
to the last year's one-off effects from the termination fee in Life & Health. Additionally, the
decreased reinvestment yields have the expected effect on our fixed income portfolio
although this was, at least, partially compensated for by higher returns from real estate
and private equity.
Realization; slightly above last year's level with the majority driven by structural changes in
our private equity portfolio but also some turnover in our L&H portfolios, partially driven by
the restructuring of our US collateralization requirements to decrease the respective
costs. Other than that, we did not harvest the sharply increased unrealized gains on our
fixed income portfolio. Overall, realization of this asset class have actually decreased
compared to the previous year.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you know, the volatile equity markets following the Brexit referendum resulted in some
impairments on individual stocks within our equity portfolio in the second quarter. Overall,
the equity portfolio even including such write-downs is well in the positive range. Apart
from that, impairments mainly consisted of regular depreciation on our real estate
portfolio. The return on investment was 3.0%, slightly ahead of the 2.9% we are targeting
for the full year.
And the next slide shows an overview of how the different asset classes contributed to
the ordinary investment income compared to where we are invested. On the right-hand
side, you can see what we have – that we have kept the asset allocation rather stable. As I
also explained in our Investors Day in October, we are still following a strategy of investing
in – of more investing in the highly liquid government bonds in combination with some
higher-yielding asset classes when it comes to the investment of new cash.
Altogether, this may lead to a slightly higher utilization within the existing risk appetite on
the capital market risk side and is increasing the liquidity of the overall portfolio. At 38%,
corporate bonds have, by the far, the highest share, and our investment income, real
estate and private equity are contributing significantly more than their respective share in
the asset allocation.
Finally, the modified duration of our asset portfolio has slightly increased to 4.8. But I think
I should now conclude.
And as usual, I leave the target matrix to Uli.

Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Thank you, Roland. Yes, on the target matrix, you can see that despite all the challenges
we would like to comment on continuously we see ticks on almost all our profitability
target. Keeping in mind the strong growth that we saw in 2015, it does not concern us that
Page 6 of 18

Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2016-11-10

FINAL

the premium income has fallen short of our growth targets for the first nine months. I
already explained and Roland as well the development that is the result of that.
Our guidance for 2016 remains unchanged, purely based on the results after nine months
and disregarding the possibility of major losses exceeding the expectations or a distortion
of the capital markets. The net premium income target of €950 million at least appears to
be well within reach. Based on such a result like in previous years, we would, again
consider to pay a special dividend over and above our usual payout ratio of 35% to 40%.
Looking at the individual segments of our well diversified P&C business. You can see that
the premium income looks rather flattish for the entire year. North America, we already
mentioned we have written some new treaties in the third quarter, so we will see an
increase there, maybe a little bit more pronounced even than we have seen after nine
months.
Also, this is aided by the Canadian business because following the large wild claims, we
saw opportunities to grow our business in Canada at a very acceptable and increased
rate.

Bloomberg Transcript

Continental Europe, it's very competitive at this point in time, particularly if you go outside
Germany. Therefore, in order to safeguard profitability, we expect that the premium
income will be slightly down, but (24:08) only slightly down.
On the Marine side, we feel that we have quality book. However, we try to keep the book
as pure as possible and therefore under current market conditions, we see premium
reducing but the profitability will continue to be favorable.
Aviation, as mentioned, very soft market. We have changed our portfolio back to a soft
market portfolio which we have in the late 1990s and before. There of course, reduced
the premium volume, very significantly, but we feel that the business on that basis can be
profitable and we are pretty confident that it will be profitable this year, largely also
because of the very conservative loss reserve position we are seeing there.
Credit and surety and political risk, volume quite stable. Results, we had one large claim
Roland mentioned, but also we saw increasing frequency of claims in the developing
world and the developing markets due to the turmoil that you have seen in some of the
economies there.
UK, Ireland, London market and direct, going fine. Profitability should be above the cost of
capital, and we would also expect more or less a flat volume. Facultative, due to the oneoff effect already mentioned, premium volume is down, but profitability should continue
to be above the cost of capital.
On worldwide treaty, we have continued to see growth in Asia, and therefore premiums,
despite the soft market, should be flat. And for the full year, we expect the results to
return to be within the maximum tolerable combined ratio.

FINAL

On the cat side, there's some business that we write in Bermuda, and again, flat
premiums. Well, I mean, if we have significant losses in the last weeks of this year to bring
up the overall loss levels to the expected losses, then we will not earn the cost of capital.
However, for the remainder of the year, that would, of course, be a very, very negative
result.
And we are very happy with the development of our structured reinsurance. We see
increased demand here that we were able to fully compensate the discontinuation of
some rather large Chinese motor quota share new business and also, I mean, going
forward, we can expect growth from this segment.
Coming to the Life & Health business, we can see that our volume should remain largely
stable. This growth on Longevity and some reduction of premium income. On the
mortality side, again, as this is due to the treaty set that are discontinued that have
already been mentioned.

Bloomberg Transcript

Profitability, overall, pretty good. Particularly exciting on the financial solutions side. The
business is actually developing very well. And particular in the US, we have very good
pipeline of new opportunities as well. As I've said, Longevity business continued demand
from the UK, but also continued competition. So, we see some growth opportunities
there.
Coming then to the guidance for 2017. As we have done in previous years, we would like
to give you a guidance for next year. This is a report of the nine months of the current
year. In general, we feel that for next year, we should largely be able to maintain our gross
written premium at the levels of the current year. And this is both true for the gross and
the net premiums. And also, pretty much stemming from both of our business group.
On the P&C side, we expect soft market conditions to continue. But at the same time, we
feel that we have very good quality book and we've also seen some slowdown in the rate
reductions. And on the Life & Health side, we expect continued underlying growth of the
profitability of our business. Therefore, we feel that the group net income should again
be more than €950 million for next year. I mean, all pretty much in line with what we have
seen for the current year.
The return on investment. Of course, as Roland explained for many years, continues to go
down in relative to – by 20 basis points to 2.7%. However, this downward trend will be
mitigated by expected increased assets under management because we continue to
expect a positive cash flow from our business.
This basically shows, I mean, (30:46) development of the results, we will again consider
paying special dividend also for 2017. Of course, considering that all things being equal,
capital level remains comfortable. And, of course, the large losses and the capital markets
develop in line with expectation. This, of course, is also the provider (31:14) for our net
income guidance.

FINAL

This slide may be familiar to you, if you watched and listened to our Investor Day in
October. As you can see, we believe that our business model would allow us to grow the
bottom end of the top line in the medium term, fueled by improved profits on the P&C
side with an improving market and increased profits on our Life & Health side once the
legacy problems of some of our US mortality business are solved.
For investment returns, we assume that they should be largely stable in absolute terms
due to the continued low-interest rate environment. In the short term, however, we
expect profits to remain stable so that we will continue our policy to pay extra dividends
to manage the growth of the capital.
With that, this concludes our presentation. And we look forward to your questions. Thank
you very much.

Q&A
Operator
We will now begin our question-and-answer session. One moment please for the first
question. The first question is from Kamran Hossain of RBC. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, everyone. Two questions. The first one is just on – so you were seeing
a bit of a shift in yields in the last day or so and kind of a little bit before that as well. If
yields continue to go up, how will that change your investment strategy going forward?
That's the first question.
And the second question, I guess again, related to the impacts of what's going on in the
US, we heard, yesterday, there might be some more spending on infrastructure. There
might be some new opportunities coming out in the US. Can you just, maybe, give a few
comments on what you think, I guess, the business potential is in the US in the, I guess, in
this new world? Thank you.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Well, I mean, for the second question, I will hand the first one to Roland in a second. Of
course, I mean, you say it's a new world, but it's a very new world, and I would say what
actually will develop in the US from recent events is difficult to predict, I would say. I mean,
for the time being, we assume that we will continue to do business as usual in the US and
– I mean, outside from any political events, we see further good prospects to grow our
business there.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Okay.

FINAL

And with regards to the investment strategy, although this might not really increase
fantasy, I don't see us changing the strategy a lot because if you go back two or three
years, and you had looked at our composition of the overall portfolio, and that was at
times when interest rates were low, but still remarkably higher than they are today. So, if
we go back to those levels, this wouldn't change the overall investment strategy.
Of course, if you see some volatility, it may make sense to follow a strategy a little bit in
accelerated terms, and – but also here (35:25) yesterday, didn't give us a lot of
opportunities. I'm sure some – we're waiting for that, but it didn't materialize. So, overall,
the composition shouldn't change much even if it goes up. I did mention the impact that
the additional valuation reserve after Brexit had on the ROE. But when it comes to the
overall portfolio composition, nothing would change that much. Yes, of course, if there is
volatility, one would try to take benefit out of that, but only to a small extent.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Okay. Perfect. Thanks very much.

The next question is from Edward Morris of JPMorgan.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Edward Morris

{BIO 16274236 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First is on the net income
guidance for the current year. Obviously, given what you've done over nine months and
the unused budget that you're carrying into Q4, it looks very conservative, I would say. I
think I remember asking the same question last year. If you could just talk a little bit how
we should think about that for Q4, particularly given that you released the extra €150
million in Q2. Is there any temptation to kind of top that up again if you're doing much
better than expected by the end of the year?
And then, the second question is on capital and potential special dividends. Given that you
are guiding again to stable to slightly down on premium, is there any particular reason not
to return all of the capital that you've generated this year or how do we balance the year –
the choice between operating at the most efficient point and sort of steady progression
on a year-on-year basis? Thank you.

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean, on the net income guidance, I already said that of course this – the results
that we have achieved after nine months and with still quite comfortable level of unused
large loss budget, at least €950 million would now probably put a higher emphasis on the
– at least, rather than the €950 million. But nonetheless, we said we keep the guidance
stable also in order to – or readily display that we see for 2017 a similar situation from the
outset than we had for 2016.
The guidance, of course, always assumes that the large loss budget will be used
completely. Regarding the special dividend, yeah, I mean, we will, of course, again after

the fourth quarter look at the capital ratios. I mean, your colleague has just mentioned
some possibility of interest rate increases which might already take out some of the
growth of the capital. But, once we have done that, we will then consider how much we
pay out. I would say that, at this point in time, I not see us going below the €4.75 that we
paid out for 2015.

Q - Edward Morris

{BIO 16274236 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

It's sufficiently vague (39:03) to answer your question.

Q - Edward Morris

{BIO 16274236 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks. And just on the first point about the reserves, the additional reserve release
that you saw in Q2, is that something that you would allow to be offset by the end of the
year?

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No. I think we will probably keep – not put that back into the buffer because – I mean, at
the end of 2015, the buffer has gone quite high also in the eyes of our auditors. So, I don't
think we will have, really the room to put that back.

Q - Edward Morris

{BIO 16274236 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thank you.

The next question is from Jonny Urwin of UBS Limited. Please go ahead.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi, there. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. Thinking a bit
about growth firstly. So, I remember at the Investor Day, you guys were talking about
growing in credit, surety, political risk in the US. I can see on the profitability matrix today
that that's got a bit less profitable and that you're guiding to stable volumes overall. I
mean, is it still the case that you'd like to grow in the US and you're shrinking elsewhere?
Just a bit of color there would be great.
Also, on the Life division US mortality. So, I mean I remember you being quite cautious at
the Investor Day. But obviously, today's results are pretty good. And there's a comment in
the release that the restructuring is starting to bear fruit. So, I mean, are you still quite
cautious there? Is this just a bit of a lumpy quarter where you've had no – large one-offs
and we should think that the outlook is still relatively subdued? Thanks very much.

FINAL

Well, I mean, on the credit and surety, I mean, what we write in the US is largely excess of
loss business which has been extremely profitable overall those years. And as a result, of
course, the credit balances – the credit balance on that business is, I mean, very, very
favorable for reinsurers and that of course puts pressure on pricing.
So, I don't think that our growth on credit and surety will particularly come from US but to a
larger extent presumably from the Far East. I mean, the reduced profitability on this book
compared to, say, 2009, 2010 and 2011, as I said, one of the reasons is, of course, that we
saw increased claims activity particular in the emerging market, but that is, of course,
taken care of now by rate increases and improved reinsurance terms that is happening,
hence, a positive outlook there.
On the other side, of course, if you look at the terms condition – terms and conditions of
the reinsurance treaties and particularly on the credit business, of course, I mean, they
have been a lot better in, say, 2009, 2010, 2011 because now, following the very good
results that we have seen in those years, I mean, commission terms are pretty close to
where we were as I said with our pre-cycle.

So, all in all, I mean, where we grow on that business is largely due to our position that we
have reached being the second largest credit and surety reinsurer, and therefore, if there
are opportunities, we normally go to see them, and that could actually result in some
growth even in the fourth quarter.
On the life side, yeah, I mean, I think I'll probably remain relatively cautious when you look
at the big block that we purchased in 2008 because it has continued to surprise us
negatively. I mean, yes, the restructuring beared some fruit. I mean, for example, if you
look at the other income line on the Life & Health business for this year, we saved, in the
first nine months, €24 million in LC costs and that is, of course, directly associated with the
restructuring there.
And also, our new business that we write in the US, I mean, we have been quite
successful in growing that business and it is actually quite profitable. I mean, there, we
actually see, for the most part, positive deviation from the expectation. So, I mean,
eventually that business will get more profitable because – I mean, the new business is
becoming more prevalent in the overall result and see the big blocks that we purchase
becomes – I mean, loses somewhat in weight of the overall result.
Therefore – I mean, actually, I expect an improvement in our US mortality business. I mean,
the remainder of our US business, particular financial solutions is performing excellent.
And also what we call health and special risk is another area that we write in the US and
also, there, we see increasing profitability. So, whilst the US mortality big block is not
looking all that as well, our US business, nonetheless, shows increasing profitability, if you
take the entire piece.

The next question is from In-Yong Hwang of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Hello. Thank you very much for taking my question. I've got two. Firstly, on the Life Re top
line, third quarter saw quite a sharp decline. You pointed to some large transactions in
Australia and China that were discontinued. But looking forward, do you kind of see
potentially more of these discontinuations of large transactions, and is there any pattern
that you see here?
And I guess, just linked to some of the largest deals you're doing based in Life and P&C,
how much of the pipeline do you factor into your premium guidance for 2017? I guess they
can be quite lumpy, but it'd be interesting to see whether you see the risk more to the
upside or the downside regarding that side of things?

Bloomberg Transcript

And my second question is on the Cat XL combined ratio that you've shown on slide 8. I
think there's quite a big variation from quarter-to-quarter, which I guess I find slightly
difficult to understand given that you booked the large loss but in full before tuning up in
fourth quarter. So, if you just help us explain where the variation comes from quarter-toquarter, please. Thank you.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you for the question. I mean, on the Life Re top line, I think we are through, in
2016, with the effect from the discontinuation of large treaties. Because, I mean, the
largest part of this has actually been single premium transactions from China where we
just reached our maximum risk that we are prepared to take on these. And as a single
premium, I mean, there is no further premium to be accounted on those. Of course, the
margin is gradually coming out of those treaties.
And the other just was a large Australian group business, which unfortunately we lost, but
there is – I mean, in Australian business, we are back to underlying growth there. So, I
mean, we will have to make up for this lost transaction, I think, in the next two years,
because as the rest of our Australian business is growing actually quite favorable.
But we take into account in the premium guidance for next year, both for P&C and Life &
Health, are not the assumptions that we should be able to write any loss transactions. But
if we do, they would come on top. What we take into account is the usual developments
that we expect. For example, on the Life & Health side, on our U.S. mortality business, the
new business, I mean, that will grow because we have certain assumption on new
business that we write. And, also, on the existing business, yes, it's YRT due to the
premium increases year-on-year as that automatically would create some growth and
then as if that is included. And the same as the growth we are seeing, for example, on our
Australian retail business. In the normal course of business, that's included. But any
Page 13 of 18



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2016-11-10

extraordinary large transaction that may or not come about, we not include that in our
guidance as we also don't include it in our planning.

FINAL

On the development of the combined ratio on the Cat side, I mean, on the Cat business
in the second quarter, we just went above the large loss budget.
And whilst during the year when we don't reach the budget, we are not released that.
However, then in a quarter, we have losses that are above the budget, we were booked
for those rather than using the budget of the next quarter, and that explained why the
combined ratio on Cat segment, jumped up in the second quarter and a step down in the
third quarter.

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

If I may add, you should also bear in mind that it's not always a direct correlation between
something happening and the business line as we present it here. So, for instance, I did
mention, I think the earthquake in Ecuador made itself felt mostly in the worldwide
business because it was more per risk book rather than a Cat XL book. If you go back to,
for instance, to Sandy that was more a marine loss event than anything else, so you
should bear in mind that also the losses, even if we see them as Cats, do not only show
up in that business line. There can be a different composition as well.

The next question is from Vinit Malhotra of Mediobanca Securities. Please go ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks very much. So, just two very quick fact-checking questions, please. On the
Life margins, from speaking with IR team today, it appeared there are some realized
gains as well as part of this restructuring of the collateral business. Could you quantify that
please, so we can get some idea of what is the underlying sort of EBIT margin in Life, if
you don't mind?
And second question is just to clarify, this merely 7% growth in premiums in CapEx
adjusted in P&C in 3Q stand-alone. Just to clarify, is it coming from U.S. or is it coming
from some structured facultative, those kind of lines? Just want to clarify that please.
Thank you.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Well, if I may take the second and leave Roland the first one. Yes, I mean, this stand-alone
third quarter growth for the most part is actually U.S. business. And partly that U.S.
business on advanced solutions and partly its traditional U.S. business, largely property
rather than casualty. That is the reason there.

And in Asia, of course, the facts of the discontinued motor quota share are no longer
prevalent if you could compare third quarter to third quarter. And the compensating
business that we wrote in particular in Eastern Europe, of course, is making itself felt in the
third quarter numbers. That actually as I've said will continue into the fourth quarter.

And with the Life question, Roland is working at it and he will answer that now.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Thanks.

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Vinit, of course, we do not exactly track each and every security which is sold, as to why it
was sold. But if I – and this is a little bit of gut feeling and a rough number, I would say, at
approximately or around €20 million was the extraordinary number. We may come back to
that but that would be my first gut feeling that this has increased from quarter-to-quarter.
It may even be a little bit less than that if you make it €15 or so. That would be the number
which just came through by touching some of the portfolios where we had changes from
deposits and collateral provisions here.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, I appreciate your color here. Thank you very much.

The next question is from Andrew Ritchie of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hello, hi there. I just wanted a quick update on Australia from a Life claims perspective.
You start to see primary insurers taking into account the new mortality tables and talk
about still elevated claims levels and disability and individual income per section. How are
claims running for you relative to the adjustments you've made a couple of years ago?
And what's your general view on new business opportunities in the Australian Life market?
Thanks.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Well, if you look at the new mortality business in Australia, I mean, we have taken into
account, of course, the new tables but it hasn't affected our business negatively. I mean,
particularly on our retail business, results are actually above expectation. Therefore, our
Australian result is in line with expectation and a little bit up compared to last year. Where
we see further growth is largely in the retail business, and to some extent, also, again, in
the group business, where we have improved our service levels and that is fueling some
additional business.
If you look on the legacy DII business, I would say claim frequency and severity is in line
with our reserve that we increased quite a lot two years ago. However, what we see is
Page 15 of 18



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2016-11-10

due to the reduced interest rate fee, sufficiency of the future premiums – I'm sorry,
deficiency reserve for that has actually increased due to the drop in interest rates. But
this, I mean, detrimental effect as a result was more than offset by better performance of
the rest of the business.

FINAL

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

And is the individual morbidity business also running in line?

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

No. That's what I mentioned. I mean, what we call the legacy DII business...

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Individual disability income as I said, claim frequency and severity is in line with
expectation. However, the discounting of the future expected the claims and that is
actually suffering from the reduced interest rates.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. So it's fair to say the prime rate to some degree may be catching up with whether
reinsurers adjusted things already.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

That's right. Yes.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

The next question is from Frank Kopfinger of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. I have two questions. My first question is on, again, on your
unused large or major loss budget. You mentioned the €300 million that are still available
as of today. How should we think about that if we assume that there are no major losses
going for the remainder of this year? Would you put it again into the reserves or are you
willing to put it into the P&L, so to say?
And my second question is on your credit spread sensitivity. Within your appendix, you
show a sensitivity which is based on a relative term. So, increasing it by 50%, could you

Page 16 of 18



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2016-11-10

translate the sensitivity into basis points development?

FINAL

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Okay. Let me take the first one, and then Roland the second one of your question. I mean,
if there are no large loss from now to year-end, definitely, our result will be well above
€950 million. Because then, not all the unused budget will then remain in reserves. I mean,
a fair amount of that will be released. And the reason for that is that, as we have shown
you on the Investor Day, that level of the redundancies has increased quite significantly in
2015, pretty much above expectation and we have to take that into account. And we look
at things like keeping additional redundant loss reserves somewhere on the balance
sheet.

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, Kopfinger, let's come back for your sensitivity question. If you go back a few years in
our presentations and you look at that sensitivity which we provide, I think we had a shift in
50 basis points or 100 basis points in absolute terms. We then had a similar discussion as
we now have today that this from the addressee's point of view it really doesn't make
sense. If you increase in a stressed scenario AA rated bond by 50% and a BB investment
also by 50%, this is not the same scenario.
As from then onwards, we changed that to percentage points. So I cannot translate that in
absolute basis points of course, because if we have a corporate bond with the credit
spread of, let's assume, 50 basis points then the 50% stress of course then would
increase that to 75%. If we have a high yield bond with 300 basis points, that would
increase the stress to 150%. We felt that this, of course, rather standardized approach
provides more meaningful information.
Internally, of course, we use other stresses. You should bear in mind if something really
dramatic happens, one would assume that corporate or government bonds or very high
rated bonds would be a safe harbor and even potentially decrease credit spread. So
there are far more complicated things available, but we felt that the percentage stress
provides more meaningful information, this is why we have included it here.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

The issue is obviously always the starting point. And maybe it might make sense to break
it down into government spreads and corporate spreads?

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

(1:00:35) If I can take that up, potentially, this is a good topic for the next Investors Day or
something like this. And you have a special demand, again, we can cater for them, but this
is what we usually we provided. And again, we changed it to make it more meaningful.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.
