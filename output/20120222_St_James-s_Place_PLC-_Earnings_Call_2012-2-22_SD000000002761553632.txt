Presentation
Charles Gregson

{BIO 1529731 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone, those of you who are here in person and those who are
listening on the web. My name is Charles Gregson and I am the new Chairman of St
James's Place.
May I start by saying I have a hard act to follow, and I would like to thank Mike, who is
sitting over there, for his stewardship over the last 20 years. I am pleased to say that Mike
is staying involved with SJP as Chairman of the Foundation, and is also playing an advisory
role for our Academy, which is one important route for growing the Partnership in the
future. So thank you, Mike.
This is a very special company, as any of you that have attended one of our Partners'
annual meetings will know. I am therefore delighted to become Chairman. And I will be
doing all I can in the Boardroom to help sustain the momentum of the business and
deliver further good returns for our shareholders. I also look forward to getting to know
you better in the coming months.

This is very much a day for the executive team to talk about a very good set of numbers.
Personally, I am especially pleased about the dividend announcement, as is my wife, who
holds the shares in SJP that we jointly own.

FINAL

But before sitting down, I just also wanted to say how pleased we are to be able to
announce the appointment of Patience Wheatcroft as a non-executive director, with effect
from the beginning of April.
And on that note, I will pass you over to Andy.

Andy Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Thank you, Charles, and morning, everyone.
In a slight change to my usual presentation, before looking at the financials, I'm just going
to quickly recap on the new business and funds under management announcements of
last month.

Bloomberg Transcript

So the slide on the screen shows the usual quarterly progression of new business,
measured on an APE basis, over the last four years. Despite the difficult trading conditions
in the final quarter of 2011, we were pleased to record flat new business, resulting in more
than GBP1.2 billion of new client funds, which gave a total for the year of GBP5.2b, a new
record.
Of equal importance to growing new funds under management is retaining existing client
funds. And our retention remains very strong, providing a net inflow in the final quarter of
GBP0.8 billion and a total for the year of GBP3.3b.
Looking at the quarterly net inflow for the last four years, you'll see on the current slide it
is very consistent, and not once have we seen net outflows. In fact, this is also a consistent
pattern over longer time periods.
All this provided for 6% growth in funds under management to GBP28.5b, despite the
market falls experienced during the second half of the year. The progression of funds
under management over recent years can be seen on the current slide.
Now, the growth in both new business and funds under management are the key drivers
of the strong financial performance during the year. I am going to look at this by starting
with the EEV result.
The new business contribution was GBP246m. Sorry, can you move the slide forward,
please? Looks like we have a technical gremlin. Just bear with us for a few moments.
That's it. Thank you very much. We'll see if it goes over from here.

FINAL

Right. So yes, looking at -- can we go back one? Yes. And next one along. That's it. Oh, it's
happening on my one here. We rehearsed earlier and it was absolutely fine, as a worst
case. Right, okay. So it's there now then. Okay, let's see if it goes.
So starting with the embedded value result and the new business contribution, which at
GBP246 million was up 13% over the previous year. The increase reflects a slight widening
of the jaws, with new business up 10% whilst the growth in establishment expenses were
only up 5.8%. Consequently, the new business margin increased to 38.3% on an APE basis
and 4.6% on a PVNB basis. And I think the slides have got stuck again, by the looks of it.
No. There we are.
In considering the margin for 2012, it is worth noting we expect establishment expenses
to increase by 5%, and in addition we will be investing in the relaunch of the Academy.
The expected profit or the unwind for the year was GBP91.2m, slightly lower than last year,
and I'm going to spend a few moments commenting on this figure.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you know, the unwind is calculated by applying a discount rate to the opening value of
in-force. However, there is no prescription on whether the calculation should use the start
of year discount rate or the discount rate at the end of the year.
At SJP, we have always used the end year discount rate, and therefore the unwind in 2011
includes the effects of a 1.6% reduction in the discount rate, mirroring the fall in the 10year UK gilt yield, or in our case the risk-free rate. Had we used the start year discount, or
had indeed the discount remained unchanged over the year, then the unwind would have
been GBP27.8 million higher, with the corresponding offset within the investment variance.
Reflecting on this practice, we have decided to change our approach going forward from
2012, and we will now use the start year discount for the calculation of the unwind. This will
help you with your forecasting, and will also bring us more into line with the other life
companies.
There was a strong experience variance of GBP38.1 million in the year, compared with
GBP26.4 million in 2010. The key contributor to the positive variance in both years was the
continued strong retention of funds under management, whilst the current year also
recognizes a benefit of a lower level of actual administration costs compared to those in
the EEV assumptions.
There was a very small positive operating assumption change of GBP0.6m, compared
with a small negative assumption change of GBP3.4 million last year. Taking into account
the investment income, the life and unit trust operating profit was up 12% at GBP378.7m.
Distribution contributed a profit of GBP6.1m, marginally higher than 2010, whilst other
operations contributed a loss of GBP13.3 million compared with a loss of GBP11.7 million
last year.

FINAL

Included within these figures is the cost of expense and share options, at GBP10.5 million
in the current year and GBP8.2 million for the prior year. And taking all this into account,
the operating profit for the year was up 12% at GBP371.5m.
And looking at the non-operating items, there was a negative investment variance of
GBP180.4m, reflecting the fall in the markets in the second half of 2011. There was also a
very small negative economic assumption change, giving a total pre-tax profit of
GBP190.8m.
Within the tax charge, there was a positive GBP50.5 million in respect of the change in
corporation tax rates. Given the ongoing commitment of the government to further future
reductions in corporation tax, we have now reflected not only the reductions enacted in
legislation but also the 1% reductions announced in each of the next two years.
And before leaving EEV result, the current slide shows a net asset value per share, which
at 385p was up 9%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving on to the IFRS result. As you can see on the current slide, the IFRS profit for the
life business increased to GBP89.1m, whilst the profit for the unit trust business increased
to GBP27.8m.
The principal driver for the increase for both was the higher income from funds under
management. And in the case of the prior year unit trust business, you will recall that this
was impacted by a negative GBP3.5 million levy from the Financial Services Compensation
Scheme.
I've already commented on the distribution and other, so I won't repeat the comments
here. And therefore, the total profit before shareholder tax, at GBP109.7m, was up 30%.
Looking forward, as the cash result grows, which I will cover in a moment, the IFRS result
will also grow.
Now, the IFRS tax charge has been impacted by a reduction in the corporation tax rates,
but also by a GBP15.2 million market timing effect. In your models, I would suggest you
assume that there was no market timing effect going forward. The IFRS net asset value at
the end of the year was 137.5p, up 14%.
Now turning to cash. The current slide provides the usual analysis of the cash result. And in
a slight change to previous years, we have shown the underlying cash result before any
one-off items and timing variances.
As you can see on the slide, the cash arising from the in-force business, at GBP125.4m,
has increased by 23% over the year, whilst the cost of acquiring new business, at
GBP62.4m, has increased by only 2%. The combined impact of the two provides for an
underlying cash result of GBP63m, up 54% over last year. There was a net positive
variance from one-offs and timing in both years, giving a total cash result of GBP67 million
compared with GBP48.3 million last year, up 39%.
Page 4 of 24

Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity

FINAL

Looking forward, we expect the cash arising from the in-force business to continue to
expand, since there is approximately GBP10.2 billion of existing funds under management
in their first six years, and you will recall therefore not contributing to the cash result. If all
this business was now fully contributing to the result, then the current position would be
some GBP70 million higher.
Just pausing for a moment and thinking about this point, like any asset manager, our cash
emergence will increase in rising markets. However, in falling markets, there is an in-built
nature to our cash flows. Whilst like other asset managers we would see a reduced
income as a result of falling markets, our cash flow is cushioned as this GBP10.2 billion
starts to contribute to the cash result for the first half.
Looking now at the investment in new business, at GBP62.4m, this was marginally higher
than last year, and the current slide provides the usual measures of valuing this
investment. I would like to draw out two points. Firstly, the cost of the investment
represents just 1.2% of gross funds acquired during the year. And secondly, you will note
we are now achieving an IRR net of tax in excess of 20%.
Incidentally, as we are not expecting the cost of investment to increase significantly over
the coming years, we should experience ongoing improvements in these measures.

Bloomberg Transcript

The cash result and our expectation of future cash emergence are the two key drivers in
setting the dividend. Consequently, given the strong growth in the cash result, the Board
has increased the full-year dividend by 33% to 8p per share.
Our confidence in the future cash emergence means shareholders can expect a similar
significant increase in the dividend for 2012, a third consecutive year of significant growth.
Beyond that, we hope to progressively grow the dividend in line with the underlying
growth of the business.
And finally, looking at capital, total Group solvency assets are GBP342.2m, and the
solvency remains strong. We continue to adopt a prudent approach to managing our
solvency assets, with no direct exposure to peripheral European sovereign debt.
Preparations for the implementation of Solvency II continue and based on the proposed
rules we will not adversely be impacted, and in fact expect to see a reduction in the total
capital we are currently required to hold for regulatory purposes. And of course, we
mustn't forget that the cash emergence from the business is expected to continue to
grow.
So a strong set of full-year results and before finishing let me just recap. EEV new
business profit up 13% and operating profit up 12%, the EEV net asset value per share up
9%, whilst the IFRS profit before shareholder tax was up 30%. The cash result was up
39%, with further growth expected going forward. And the dividend was up 33%, with a
similar significant increase in the 2012 dividend expected.

So that's it from me. Thank you for your attention, and I'll now hand you over to Dave.

David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you, Andy. Good morning, everyone.
As the headline said in our press release this morning, a strong financial performance,
which is exactly what it was. And just to go back to Andy's final slide on the financials, add
to it Partner numbers up 6%, Partner productivity up 4%, diploma qualified Partners at 82%
of the Partnership, and 11 new fund managers added in the last 12 months. And you'll see
that it's much more than a strong financial performance; it's a strong performance across
pretty much all parts of the business, and particularly encouraging for our future
prosperity.
Nowhere is that better demonstrated than in our fund inflows. On both a gross and net
basis, we are performing very well. In 2011, we achieved GBP5.2 billion of gross inflows
and GBP3.3 billion of net inflows for the full year, 10% up on the GBP4.7 billion and GBP3
billion we achieved in the previous year.

Bloomberg Transcript

This chart takes a longer-term perspective and looks at the pattern of gross and net
inflows over the last five years. As you can see, a very consistent correlation between the
two and a very consistent delivery of strong net inflows. We believe this performance
compares very favorably against our competitors.
Looking forward, whatever the environment throws at us, I would venture that we are in
really good shape for the future; good shape as far as the partnership is concerned, good
shape as far as the investment proposition is concerned and good shape as far as the
Board and management teams are concerned.
Let me explain why I say that. Firstly, the Partnership. Clearly, in our business size matters,
and thanks to Ian and his field management team we've grown the Partnership not only in
2011 but in each of the last five years by a compound net 7% per annum. We should not
underestimate the significance and importance of that achievement.
Such recruitment does two things for the business. First, it replenishes the team, filling the
gaps from natural turnover. And secondly, it drives one side of our growth model. It also
has the benefit of introducing new ideas and refreshes the organization. Most recruits
today come from the IFA sector, and they join us with a richness of experience of the
market and of the competition. That intelligence is really valuable to us, and it helps us
know firsthand what's going on in the marketplace.
As well as the growth in new Partners and their impact on overall numbers, we are also in
great shape regarding the professional standing of our existing Partners. During the last
year, the Partnership took over 4,500 exams, which at a conservative 50 revision hours
per exam amounts to 225,000 Partner hours. Spread across the entire Partnership, this
equates to about one month per Partner given up to revising for and taking exams to
achieve the newly qualified -- newly required qualifications.
Page 6 of 24

FINAL

I suspect that's a very conservative impact -- or estimate on the impact of productivity.
Nevertheless, today 82% of the Partnership are now fully diploma qualified and a further
11% are within one or two exams. Of the balance of 7%, half of them are recent joiners.
And together with the bulk of the balance, I am confident they will achieve the necessary
goals.
A fantastic effort by all concerned, including our management and support teams, who
helped in the process. And even more impressive when you consider that they still
managed to attract 10% more business than in the previous year, against much less
favorable market conditions. With the vast majority of Partners now RDR ready, a year
ahead of implementation, they can now fully focus on the day job. And so we start the
year with more Partners and a more focused Partnership with fewer distractions.
Secondly, we are in good shape insofar as our investment proposition is concerned. This
time last year, we introduced our example portfolios, and we've been delighted with how
quickly the Partnership and our clients have embraced the concept. As part of their
introduction, we also appointed Orchard Street to manage our property fund, replacing
our previous manager Invista.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then, in October we announced a new Global Equity strategy, which saw the introduction
of three new managers, Tweedy, Browne, Majedie Investments and Sands Capital, who
alongside BlackRock and THS now manage the GBP3.5 billion Global Equity Fund on a core
satellite basis. What's significant about this is that our asset management team and
investment teams, led by David Lamb, oversaw the transition of GBP3.5 billion of equities
from the original fund to the new fund managers without so much as a hiccup.
I said last time we met that we would continue to enhance our investment proposition,
and that's precisely what we are doing this year. This month, our Investment Committee
appointed two new managers and a new team from an existing manager. PIMCO, based
in California, will manage a brand new multi-asset fund for us. Kenneth Buntrock at Loomis
Sayles will manage our Investment Grade Corporate Bond, and Paul Boyne and Doug
McGraw of Invesco Perpetual will manage a new Global Equity Income Fund.
We are also introducing an Index Linked Gilt Fund, managed by Blackrock, as part of a new
defensive portfolio to add to our existing portfolios. And in April we will appoint James de
Uphaugh and his team at Majedie to take over the UK Growth Fund.
So we now have 35 individual managers running the GBP29 billion of client money in some
very well diversified portfolios. The key takeaway from all this, or more importantly what
the approach delivers, is the unique choice of funds provided to clients and Partners alike.
Our association with Stamford Associates gives us enormous scope and reach, enabling
us to access some of the best names from around the globe. Let's look at where some of
them are based -- Toronto, Newport Beach, Boston, New York, Milwaukee,
Massachusetts, Virginia, not to mention Singapore and Wakefield. And a number of these
are not available to UK retail clients through any other means. There is no IFA group out

Page 7 of 24

FINAL

there that can give clients access to these names or provide the reach that we can
through our investment approach.
The role of Stamford Associates in all this is crucial, not least to the level of due diligence
they carry out on our behalf. Here's what Ken Broekaert of Burgundy Asset Management
said recently when asked about that process -- the most thorough and most professional
that we've ever experienced, going beyond the depth and detail we've seen before.
That's why we refer to our proposition as our distinct investment management approach.
Finally, I believe our management team and Board are in good shape too. All three of my
executive colleagues here today do a great job for this business. We've worked together
now for 19 years, and very closely as an executive team for five years.
The teams beneath them have largely come through the business too, and provide
strength and depth. There are clear lines of responsibility, Ian and his team driving
distribution, David and his team driving our investment approach and the development of
additional services, and finally Andy and his finance team overseeing investor relations
and all things financial. Between us, we have a clear focus on delivering against our three;
to five-year business plan.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to the Board, and following on from what Charles said, I'm also delighted that
Baroness Wheatcroft is joining our Board. Patience will join other recent additions in the
form of Iain Cornish, who joined the Board in October, and Vivian Bazalgette, who was
appointed to the Board in July last year. This trio brings us a great degree of relevant
experience which I know will benefit all of us in the future.
So as I said at the beginning, we are in great shape and well positioned to capitalize on
the market leading position we hold in the face-to-face wealth management sector. The
Partnership is strong, our investment proposition broad and compelling, and our
management team from the Board down is determined to deliver on our medium-term
objectives. Our aim is to double our funds under management in the next five years. And
whilst more of the same may be enough to achieve it, we will explore other ideas and
accelerate our thinking as needs be.
With that very much in mind, I am very excited about the relaunch of the Academy, which
is now up and running with the first intake in place. And we've planned two more intakes
later in the year.
Alongside that, we also plan a family business intake. That's sons and daughters of
existing Partners who want to come in the business sponsored by their parents, great for
succession and great for the next generation of clients too. We already have over 40 sons
and daughters working in their parent's practices, so we know it works. The Academy
should deliver real results for us towards the end of next year, and into 2014 and beyond.
We'll also be looking to broaden our client offering with the provision of banking and other
services that complement what we do. For example, this year we plan to explore the
areas of discretionary fund management and private client stockbroking services. And
Page 8 of 24

Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2012-02-22

FINAL

whilst no decisions will be taken until our work is complete, we are optimistic we can
expand our offering in areas which make sense for clients as well as the business and for
our shareholders.
The fundamentals of our market haven't changed in 20 years. As I've said on a number of
occasions now, the provision of good old-fashioned face-to-face advice is what we do
and what we will continue to do. More clients today are facing huge pre; and postretirement decisions and need help. Pension simplification, as it was once referred, is far
from simple. Tax reliefs with carry back and carry forward options, protected fund
provisions, are all far from straightforward.
And both the media and consumers are beginning to recognize that fact now. Hence our
confidence not only in our business model, but also the market we are playing into. Whilst
others may seek to exploit the direct-to-consumer model, we will continue to build longterm relationships with our partners and our clients, much as we have done in the past.
We believe that is the most effective and efficient way to build, and importantly retain,
funds under management for the good of all of our stakeholders.

Bloomberg Transcript

New business in the quietest two months of this quarter is running at the same level as
the final quarter of 2011. Our funds under management have grown to GBP29.5b. And with
6% more Partners and fewer distractions, we have a great platform for future growth this
year.
What is just as important, though, is the growing and predictable cash flows that our
business model is now delivering as business generated in previous years matures.
Shareholders are beginning to see the rewards of our strategy, not only from the strong
growth in the share price in the last year or so, but from the unbroken growth in dividends
over the last five years, and the particularly strong growth last year, this year and into next
year and beyond, all supported by the increasing cash flows generated from our growing
funds under management.
So I hope you can see from today clients have a much broader investment proposition
and means [ph] of services being made available to them. The Partnership is in great
shape. And as we celebrate our 20th anniversary, our Partners and employees at all levels
have a greater sense of pride and passion for this Company than ever before, as do the
executive team. And we are all part of a company delivering real value to shareholders.
Thanks for your time this morning. I'd now like to ask my colleagues Ian, Andy and Dave to
the front desk, to take any questions you may have. Thank you.

Questions And Answers

Yes. It's Gordon Aitken from Royal Bank of Canada. In the (technical difficulty).
And secondly (technical difficulty) can you give us some examples of what those (technical
difficulty)?

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Well first, David, do you want to take the tax relief, pension point?

A - David Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure. I think a couple of points here. Obviously it increases the cost of just providing for
retirement for the higher rate taxpayer, so definitely there is a need to provide for
retirement. And what I mean, if you just look around for other ways of doing it alongside
the basic pension tax relief. So I think things like, for example, unit trusts, offshore savings
plans will increase in attractiveness to clients if that happens.
In the actual practicality, though, the second point, influencing it is quite tricky in terms of
the impact on, for example, final [ph] public pension scheme holders. They're noncontributory pensions; we're paying tax every year. So there are some real wrinkles in the
detail about how you actually might do this. But it doesn't take away the need and the fact
there's a very, frankly, growing marketplace. There is a new generation of people retiring
in final public pension schemes in the next five or 10 years. That's all going to be finishing.
So the market is enormous. The need is still there. So things like offshore pensions -offshore savings plans, unit trusts will come in alongside the other aims that we have
today for higher rate tax payers. They'll have to do something. They can't not do
something.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Ian, do you want to pick up the IFA recruitment point?

A - Ian Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

Yes. The concept of people knocking on our doors and beating the doors down to join is - I have heard that before. It isn't actually like that. It's still -- they still need to be recruited
and make a substantial transition into our business.
In terms of selection, the first thing is obviously there has to be a certain quality and
productivity, and the business shape that they do fits what we are able to provide for
them. The second point is the transition also involves -- there is a level of sharing values of
the business and what we are trying to do for clients over the long term, so there has to
be a value fit.
Page 10 of 24



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C

And the third point I wrote is something about having a bigger future than a past, and that
we are looking for people who are future orientated, committed to looking after clients
for the long term and fit that model, rather than people who are very close to exiting the
business and are looking for a (multiple speakers).

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Yes, Oliver.

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Oliver Steel, Deutsche Bank. I'm just trying to compare slides three and five, slide three
being the quarterly new business trends and slide five being the quarterly net inflow
trends. I suppose two questions here. By way of background, what it shows is that you
generate most of your inflows in the last two quarters of the year but you generate most
of your sales in the first two quarters of the year. So question one is why is that different?
Why do you not -- why do you see so many implicit outflows in the first two quarters of
the year?
Then, secondly, in respect of your comment that First Quarter sales year to date are in
line with the Fourth Quarter, what does that imply in terms of net inflows year to date
versus either the First Quarter or Fourth Quarter last year?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Andy, I'll let you take the first part of that question, because I'm not sure there is a
difference between the two halves.

A - Andy Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Yes. I think the key point, Oliver, is that slide three is APE and slide five is funds, so I'm not
sure you can necessarily compare the two.

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

(Inaudible) (microphone inaccessible).

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

APE is the traditional measure of 10% of single premiums and the annualized regular
premium. So it tends to take a different shape than the single premium flow per se. And I
think the second slide Andy's referring to is funds under management, which is very
market driven, so.

A - Andy Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

And I think -- I've not considered your question in the past, so it's a good question I'll go
away and think about. But actually, if you look at the quarterly IMSs we put out, the lapse
rate or surrender rate consistently stays at 5%. So there's something else within your
question that I just need to think about.

FINAL

Are you taking that, David, or…

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Yes, yes. The statement was about the first six weeks or so of this year, where we were
running at the same rate as we were in the final quarter of last year. 45% of Q1's business
will come in March, when people traditionally have the end date of the tax year to deal
with their tax provisions, to deal with their ISA allowances, use it or lose it. And so the First
Quarter will be very much defined by that performance in March.
Either way, we are confident that we will achieve gross inflows much the same. And if you
look at the final quarter of last year, GBP1.2 billion of gross inflows, GBP800 million of net
inflows, we are talking about similar sort of numbers. We will still attract the best part of
GBP1.2 billion of gross inflows. And as Andy said, that retention, that underlying retention
rate, is pretty much maintained at 95% for four or five years now, and there is no reason
to see or believe that it will change going forward.

{BIO 16758460 <GO>}

Morning. Couple of things. First of all, in your commentary on the margin, you talk about
reducing life remuneration again. I think last year you did it to equalize it with unit trusts,
but there's no balancing effect.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

We did it over two years. So we signaled the best part of two years ago that we would
bring our 3.6% remuneration on life bonds down to 3% over a two-year period. So last
year, in 2011, we stepped down from 3.6% to 3.3%. This year we are stepping down from
3.3% to 3%, and so that by the end of this year we will be equal -- for this year, the start
of this year we are equal.

Q - James Pearce

{BIO 16758460 <GO>}

Okay. Number two, can we assume the distribution profit is recurring, because I think we
had it last year, then there was zero in H1, and now it's back again? What's the outlook
there?
Third, I think 9% of your Partners are not qualified, or within two exams of qualification.
What happens to them at the end of the year? Do you think they will all of them qualify, or
will there be some dropouts? And will that be a 9% or whatever fall in sales as a result?
How do we size that issue?

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Well let me just deal with the last point first. 82% fully qualified, 11% within one or two
exams, bearing in mind there's five papers, five exams to qualify for a diploma. So as far
as we are concerned, they are two-thirds of the way through. And we know from the
momentum those people have, which came to 93%. The remaining 7%, as I said in my
words, was that half of them have joined us in the last 18 months, and they're IFAs that
have come on board. We will give them the support. And I have no doubt, they haven't
joined us for 18 months, they've joined us for the long term.
As Ian said about the future, there was a small percentage that's left, some of which will
make it, 1% or 2% will simply be those people who choose to retire early, so people who
were thinking of retiring in 2013 or '14 that may well simply say the investment into
diploma is not worth the return from their perspective and quality of life, and whatever. It
doesn't alter our aspirations for where the Partnership goes.
Andy, on the margin?

A - Andy Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Yes. The distribution profit is a recurring item. It will vary depending upon new business
levels and expenses, but it is a recurring item.

Q - Toby Langley

{BIO 15924432 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. It's Toby Langley from Barclays. I've got a question on the
dividend. If I look at the cash cover, so it's the cash results versus the dividend, I think the
maths is roughly working out around GBP40 million for the nominal cost of dividend.
You've got a cover ratio of about 1.7. Is that kind of where you want to keep it, and am I
looking at the right metric there?
Secondly, on the Academy, you mention you've got 16 new recruits last month. What's the
lead time on that bunch of people and when do we expect them to start delivering
contributions to the AUM?
Then, on higher rate tax relief again, I recognize that there is definitely a need. Anybody
who is applying logic to this situation understands that there is a need, but nonetheless
policymakers aren't necessarily fully aligned with that understanding. And so with this in
mind, maybe it might be helpful to us to know what proportion of pension sales actually
have tax relief attached to them, because it's my understanding that the vast majority of
the stuff that you're marketing is single premium transfer and not necessarily really
affected by this anyway.
So it would be good to know what new money -- and it may not be something you can
give us now but something going forward -- new money that has relief attached to it, or is
motivated by relief, would be useful.

Okay. Andy, do you want to take the dividend cover point first?

FINAL

A - Andy Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Yes. On the dividend cover, one of the other things we've said we are doing is to build a
dividend reserve. That's what I've termed it on the balance sheet. So we would be holding
one year's worth of dividend as a cushion to any fall in income as a result of difficult
markets. So at the moment we are in the process of building that dividend reserve. We
probably have about GBP30 million set aside now. And the payout ratio will be lower than
we would ultimately expect whilst we build up that dividend reserve.

Q - Toby Langley

{BIO 15924432 <GO>}

We can expect one point -- the current level to persist while you continue to accrue that?

A - Andy Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

I think that's probably fair, yes.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Ian, do you want to talk about the Academy?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Ian Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

Yes. The -- I think you made the point that that group of people will start contributing
towards the end of next year, and then continually going forward, so end of 2013 into
2014. Besides that, we have got 54 own-grown advisors in the Partnership already from
the previous pilot, so we have got a model that works. And we are very confident about
the flow of new people coming in via the Academy, but they won't have a material impact
on business till the end of 2013/2014.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

And the aspiration for the Academy, as we said last time, is that the investment we are
making in the Academy will hopefully contribute circa 25% of our recruitment growth, our
net recruitment growth, in two or three years' time and thereafter per annum. That's the
scale of what we were trying to deliver here.
David, do you want to come back to the pension and tax relief point?

A - David Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

If you think about single premium pensions in particular, I think the point (inaudible) in that
part of the question. There are three types really of single premium pensions that you will
attract in the marketplace. One is somebody who wants to make a lump sum contribution
out of a bonus payment, something like that. That market change in April last year, when
they reduced the cap to GBP50,000, leave aside the carry forward facility that these
products (inaudible) in a year, that changed the nature of that market.

Page 14 of 24

Date: 2012-02-22

FINAL

The two other areas where they were not affected are the transfer market and the
drawdown market. And both those areas, which account for the majority of our single
premium business in terms of pension business, we continue to attract funds from other
pension providers, just as people sit down, talk about what they want their investment
proposition to look like going forward.
And secondly, the drawdown market increases and will continue to increase, because
there's a lack of attraction of annuity. The low interest rate environment that pension
(inaudible) started to look at, but a lot of it has earned frankly other returns and paid -annuitized their pension pots, as we've done in the past.
So the drawdown market is big and increasing; the transfer market is increasing for us in
terms of the way we play in that space. I think the pure single premium, what I call the
cash bonus market, will change in April this year. Apart from carry forward, it's the smallest
part of that whole pot.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Come to this [ph], yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Hi. Andy Hughes, Exane BNP Paribas. A couple of questions, if I could. The first one I guess
is on low investment income and charges. I guess you are talking about having an indexlinked gilt fund for some of your policies. Is there any danger that you might review the
1.5% charge down, in light of the fact that obviously investment income is not very high
now so it's going to erode a material amount of people's investments? Are you getting
pressure from the Partners to review down the charging level in light of current
investment conditions?
And I guess there's also -- in a backdrop to that, there's also been some rumors again -started again about a charging cap on pensions. Now, if a charging cap on pensions were
to come in, my guess is it would be lower than 1.5%, and that could be material, I guess,
for the business model if that were to be a problem. Thank you.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Dave, do you want to talk about the…

A - David Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

Investment income [ph]?

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Yes. I think the portfolios [ph] were -- and charges generally, I think.

FINAL

I think -- in terms of index-linked gilts, there's two components in the total cost for a client.
Well that's what I'd say. There's administration costs, the advice fees and the fund
management fees, and we do all that in one number. The index-linked gilts, the fund
management piece in that is 6 bps. So that's very cost effective as an access for indexlinked gilts.
The advice fees (inaudible) part of the same results. All of our products (technical
difficulty) 3% across the board and half (technical difficulty) across all our product mix.
So the second part of the question is where the charge is going in the marketplace. Right
now, through the work we did last year with (inaudible) and looking at our charges
compared to marketplace players, we know that on a like-for-like basis we are absolutely
in line with the marketplace.
If there is a change (inaudible), would the regulation come along and cap on pension
charges, I don't know. If they do that, it would affect everybody in the marketplace. So
from an SJP specific thing, we'll see what happens if they decide to regulate charges in
the marketplace. I'd be surprised, but let's see.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

If I could just come back on that, 0.5% trail plus, if I take the numbers you've given me on
cash flow for the GBP10 billion and the GBP70m, obviously that's another -- the GBP10.8
billion generates another GBP70 million of cash. Obviously there is a big profit margin
there as well. So your total charge must be about 1.2%, plus the 6 basis points for the fee.

A - David Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

Our total -- sorry, our total charge for our product range is 1.5% plus the total fund
management charge. That's just across the product range (inaudible). It's been that way
since the launch, so that hasn't changed. And if there is a change in the balance in the
marketplace generally, then we would look at that in the other businesses. But that isn't
on the cards right now today.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Thank you.

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Barrie.

Q - Barrie Cornes

{BIO 2389115 <GO>}

Hello. It's Barrie Cornes at Panmure Gordon. I've got three questions, if I may. First of all,
Andy, the change in the risk discount rate moving from a certainty, that model, I think you
described it to one where you're adjusting it at the beginning of the year. Can you give
me a bit of background to that, because you also changed the corporate rate -- the

Page 16 of 24

Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2012-02-22

FINAL

corporate tax rate? Then again you stood aside from doing that previously. So your
thinking behind that is my first question.
Second question I think is in respect of the Chairman's statement. It talks about building
on the future, and obviously you've strengthened the Board. I just wondered if you might
be looking to change, over and above the private client stockbrokers and the banking that
you talked about, David, whether or not you're looking at other areas such as overseas
branching abroad, in terms of the business model.
And lastly, I think, just picking up on James Pearce's comment on the number of exam
passes. I think where James was really going is whether or not the Head of Sales has
actually started taking his exams (multiple speakers).

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

I'm so pleased you asked that, especially without coercion. Ian.

A - Ian Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

I think it's more appropriate I'm the last one through the door. Everybody's shepherded in
through, and I'll make sure there's no waifs and strays behind me. I will be taking a few
exams this year, that's for sure.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Barrie.

A - Ian Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

Thank you, Barrie.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Andy, do you want to deal with the gilts and tax?

A - Andy Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Yes. The gilt -- no, I'll do the tax first. The coalition has clearly laid out their intention to
reduce corporation tax by 1% in each of the next two years. When they first announced
that, there was some uncertainty, I guess, as to whether or not the coalition government
would survive over that period of time. And I think it's become more and more certain -certain is probably a very strong word -- more and more likely that the coalition
government will survive and will carry out.
And they have shown that they will carry out what they've said they are doing. So
therefore, on a best estimate type basis, it's appropriate to take into account those
future tax reductions.

FINAL

On the discount rate, just to be totally clear, the embedded value at the end of the year
will still be calculated based on the year-end economic assumptions. What I'm talking
about here is just which line the movements will take place in. And I think what we've seen
this year, with a big reduction in the discount rate driven by the UK gilt rates, it's caused
some confusion in terms of the operating profit versus the total profit. So the move is
really to help people forecast the numbers, including me.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

In terms of future plans, not being on the agenda in the short term, Barrie, the corporate
appetite pretty big, as I said, to double our funds under management over the next five
years. We think we can do that. I'm not sure it's right to say organically, because we
acquire new Partners, we acquire small ISA practices, we acquire new fund managers to
help broaden the proposition, and we are focused this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

First and foremost, we need to get everything in place for the RDR switchover on January
2, but we've got some back office initiatives streamlining our investment process. We call
it straight-through processing. It's like electronic business transactions. That's very much a
focus. We've added some 20 new fund managers to the portfolio of fund managers that
we offer today. We want that to settle down and really start to be effective. We'll carry on
our recruitment and our Academy plans.
And for the moment that's where we are. But we don't rule out the possibility of
broadening the proposition beyond discretionary fund management and private client
stockbroking services into the future. And what I was trying to relate to, when I talk about - what's more of the same may well be enough. We will respond and adjust our plans as
need be.
Two more questions. One more here.

Q - Daria Asadullaeva

{BIO 16508025 <GO>}

Hello, Daria Asadullaeva from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. I've got two questions. First is
if you could please talk about the difference in the IFRS tax charge this year, and whether
it is related to the change in UK insurance companies' taxation.
And the other one is if you could give an update on the private banking initiative as well.
Thank you.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Okay. Andy, yours is the first and David --

A - Andy Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Yes. Shall I go with the IFRS tax charge? There are two things driving the IFRS tax charge
this year. One is the change in corporation tax rate, and you'll see that that's reduced the
tax charge by GBP7m, because there were two 1percentage cuts this year. Going forward,

Page 18 of 24



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C
Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2012-02-22

you will see under IFRS a further 1% reduction in 2012, when it's enacted, and a further 1%
reduction in 2013. So I would model GBP3.5 million reduction in tax in both of those years.

FINAL

The second item that's going on is what we've termed market related tax effects. And
this gets particularly complex. It is not a recurring item, so I would certainly model zero
going forward. It has nothing to do with the forthcoming changes in life company taxation.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

David, do you want to do the private banking stuff ?

A - David Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

As it happens, we've been doing a lot of work on this. We talked about this last time. And
in March this year we start rolling out a pilot with a group of Partners. And the pilot is going
to initially focus on total tax year-end planning (inaudible). We've put in place a
governance process and a whole of market approach to that.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are also, as part of that, putting in place two centralized things. One is we're
centralizing advice around some of the bigger advice conversations that are going on,
and a different scale of proposition around that. So we're going to roll that out in a pilotdriven test (inaudible). And we've also tied up with some extra law firms to do things like
funding to Partnerships and PPPs [ph] for those sorts of clients. So all of that will be tested
out in March with this group of Partners.
Later in the year, two things that are in the second wave, if you like, where we've done a
lot of work looking at hedge funds for our clients. And we haven't decided yet, but we are
working with a couple of external advisors and are exploring either doing portfolios of
fund-of-fund hedge funds to that market. We may or may not do that. Until we finish that
exercise, we won't go live with it, but we will be certainly well down the track in looking at
how that might work.
And the second area which we are also well under track on is looking at some of the
things to do with the private client stockbroking, so if you like (inaudible) accounts and
custody accounts in the St James's Place standard way.
So there's a lot of work in the background. The pilot will tell us how successfully that will
start to land with the clients and the Partners, and we'll grow it slowly from there.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Thank you, David. James, another question.

Q - James Pearce

{BIO 16758460 <GO>}

Yes. A couple more things. Could you talk about how you expect your shareholding
structure to evolve, one shareholder in particular?

Page 19 of 24



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C

Date: 2012-02-22

And second, you had a big positive experience around persistency. Have you rejigged
your embedded value assumption to reflect the better than expected persistency, or do
you not expect it to persist?

FINAL

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

On the Lloyds question, which as a result there's no change. And the (inaudible)
shareholders will carry on with their business -- our business. They've clearly got their own
agendas and there's no update, no change from last time we spoke.
Andy, do you want to…

A - Andy Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Yes, on persistency, we set the persistency rates on long-term experience. And what we
are seeing at the moment is our retention is stronger than the long-term experience, but
we will still use the long-term experience to set the rates. So we haven't -- apart from
round the edges, there's been no change.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

We've still got a few more questions to go. Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Marcus Barnard

{BIO 2103471 <GO>}

Yes. Marcus Barnard from Oriel Securities. A couple of questions. Firstly, on the
equalization of remuneration between unit trusts and life products, is that going to make
any difference to the mix of business you sell in future, and does it really matter? Is it
going to affect the margin, or whatever?
And secondly, do you have any feel for what percentage of your new business comes
from city bonuses and how that might be impacted this year? And perhaps that might
help explain Oliver Steel's point about seasonality.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

I think on the unit trusts and life business, my view is that it makes no difference at all. The
right advice is the right advice. I don't believe people were doing things for 0.6 reasons or
0.3 reasons. And the overall remuneration, we have certainly not seen any shifts in any of
the patterns there. So that was an equalization point. I think Andy made the point in last
year's accounts, or the year before, that we also made the move on the trail on ISA
business by April year before last to also equalize that. So in overall terms, we are about
breakeven in terms of the corporate balance sheet, so to speak.
New business bonus, Ian and David can comment on this. I'm sure the bonus season may
have an effect. If you look at our investor presentation, you look at the geographic
coverage of the Partnership and where the money lies, it's a very small part of the overall
business. 9% of the Partnership and circa 9% of the funds under management sit in and
around the center of London. That's city center, if you like. It may have a small impact, but I

Page 20 of 24



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C
Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2012-02-22

think, as David said, with the pensions relief and the GBP50,000 cap coming in, that we
are already impacted in that marketplace in any event. So I don't imagine there will be a
significant --

FINAL

A - David Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

No. I think if you look at it, our scale is such that the city bonus market is not out to do that.
It's there but it's not (inaudible).

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

It's one of those illusionary things that hit the press three or four years ago, that St
James's Place was very city centric. It was one of the reasons that we put the map in the
investor presentation in the first place, to make the point that our GBP29 billion is pretty
much in line with the demographics of the UK, as the Partnership is.
We'll take two final questions and then we'll wrap it up. Thank you, Robin.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Robin Buckley

{BIO 3596512 <GO>}

It's Robin Buckley from Deutsche. Can I just ask a question about investment
performance? You used to put some slides up just showing how your investment
performance was doing by quartile. And I guess I'm interested in that, firstly in terms of
how the model portfolios have performed in particular this year against whatever
benchmark you want to provide, but also just in terms of rolling out the number of fund
managers that you now have. And you are talking about the amount of choice that you
provide to clients in terms of the fund managers that -- funds that they can invest in.
How does that sit in terms of absolute performance versus total choice? What's the
trade-off there that you see, because I guess historically one of the key selling points was
just in terms of the strong track record that you had?

A - David Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

Yes, I'll pick that up. If you look at our rolling five-year numbers, we presented that bar
chart graph and you can see the top -- instead of the medium, the top half of that, over
each running five-year period, we'd have between 65% and 75% of our funds under
management in the top half; typically most of that in the top quartile. If you look at last -- a
rolling five-year period, each of the last three years, that was around 70% for the last two
years, and it moved slightly, and 2011 running slightly (inaudible) around 65%.
The changes made over the last three years, including 20 managers, is a -- directly will
impact that going forward now, because it changes the mix quite a lot. And therefore, one
of the risks of bringing out portfolios was to help people, clients and Partners pull
together the right combinations of managers for the future.
So the portfolios were one year old literally at the end of January this year, so we had
those. So they've done exactly what we expected in terms of the relative performance,

Page 21 of 24



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C
Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2012-02-22

relative to each other and relative to the market. And that shouldn't be a big surprise,
given the amount of work we've put into constructing these things.

FINAL

As we go forward now, I'm sure we'll start playing back to you information about how the
portfolios are performing. There will be reviews. There have been reviews right now for
the coming 12 months. We need to change them again. And that will be a continuous
process. It's part of the investigative work.
So the performance figures over a rolling five-year period look broadly consistent, the
last, as I said, 65%, in the top half. And the five years ending January this year is very
consistent. It's marginally down on what it's been in the last two or three years, but it's
pretty consistent across that picture.

A - Andy Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Another thing, sorry, just one other thing, if I may, David. The other thing, by introducing all
the managers, is we were very exposed to a number of large managers, if we went back
three years ago. But now it's significantly changed.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

65% of the funds under management at the end of 2009 sat with four managers. And
this has been a deliberate strategy that we've deployed, to broaden our investment
proposition. And one of the reasons for introducing the portfolios was to make sure we
put some structure around the amount of choice and how you model portfolios, selecting
from that choice, depending on clients' attitude to this.
So I think we've got to that stage now where you look at the fund selection, you look at
the portfolio, and it is, as I said in my words earlier on, very rich. It's selected from across
the globe and it's about right now. Surveys we do with our existing Partners, senior and
principal Partners, we've asked them the very question about the investment proposition.
They are delighted with the portfolio. And they are very -- I think it's probably the right
word to use -- satisfied with our investment proposition today in terms of we have
enough.
The other thing about the better fund choice is -- if I come back to our aspirations to
double our funds under management over the next five years -- we now have the breadth
of fund management offering to enable us to grow in that space, and a lot of capacity
across a very broad base of fund managers to give us the platform for growth. So very
deliberate strategies against where we are. We are in a good place right now.
One final question and then -- providing it's a nice positive one.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

I'll try my hardest, sorry. Sorry, asking how much you charge is probably not a good start,
my first question.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

It's Andy Hughes from Exane BNP Paribas. So I guess I'm most curious about the transfers,
coming back to that. I think David said something which got my interest up, which was that
you were accepting a wider range of transfers going forward. And I guess what I'm trying
to do is -- it would be helpful if you could give some color on this. In terms of the single
premium inflows you are getting, how much is transfers, and split that between DB and
DC?
Then maybe, looking at the DB bit, when interest rates some down, presumably you get
bigger transfer values from the DB schemes.

A - David Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Just on the DB/DC split, the vast majority, very few DB transfers. DB transfers are
very complex technical conversations with individual clients. There are some. They are
very rare, because of the nature of what you are giving up in terms of guarantees. So
most -- the vast majority by a long way is DC transfers, and that is a growing marketplace.
Given the fragmentation, the historical fragmentation of this marketplace, there is a big
consolidation path there.
And also, the drawdown market is a market (inaudible) and it will grow, grow partly
because of annuities which are poor value in terms of lower rates, and partly because of
maturing pension funds that are arriving there.

And I guess the second part of the question, so you took a proportion and you'd say it's
mainly DC?

A - David Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

Oh, absolutely.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

What, about 80% of the business?

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

More than 90%, more than 90%.

A - David Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

More than 90%. A few, a few specific DB scenarios, but they're tiny (multiple speakers).

No, but in terms of the single premium proportion that is transferred, is that around 80%,
or is it…

FINAL

A - David Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

It's around two-thirds, three-quarters, and that's last year's figures. It's (inaudible) around
that sort of number.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Okay. Then I guess the following question was on income drawdown, which is I guess you
mentioned interest rates coming down being a positive thing for income drawdown. But
obviously the amount of income you can take from income drawdown is also coming out - coming down as well. And that's not changing investors' attitude to an income
drawdown product, the fact that they can only take out, as a maximum income, a very low
amount?

A - David Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

Currently, under the current guide rules, that's right. But I think that's still more flexible
going forward than buying an annuity today, which has no chance of change in the future. I
would think, if we end up with 2% gilt yields for the next five or 10 years, we'll see some
changes in the way drawdown (technical difficulty).

Okay? On that very high note, we'll end the questions. Thanks for your time this morning.
Thank you, to my colleagues. We'll be around if you have any further questions over
coffee. Thank you.
