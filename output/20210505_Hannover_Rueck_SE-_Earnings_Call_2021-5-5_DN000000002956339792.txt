Presentation
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I welcome you to today's Hannover Re Conference
Call on the Q1 2021 Results. For your information, this conference is being recorded. At
this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr. Jean-Jacques Henchoz,
Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.

Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Well, thank you very much and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our conference call
presenting our results for the first quarter of 2021. Sorry to those of you particularly who
are London-based, for the inconvenience due to the unusual early time of this call. The
reason is as per last year that the Annual Shareholders Meeting is taking place later this
morning at 11:00 AM CET.
As usual, I'll start with an overview before our CFO, Clemens Jungsthofel, goes over the
financial details -- financials in detail. I'll then comment on the outlook. And for the Q&A I'm
additionally joined by my Board colleagues, Klaus Miller on the Life side and Sven Althoff
for P&C.
I'm pleased to report that Hannover Re had a good start into 2021. In the first quarter of
the year, we continued to successfully grow our business. And Group net income of

FINAL

EUR306 million is very much in line with our full-year guidance. Additionally, at 11.1% the
return on equity is well above our minimum target. And gross premium increased by
16.8% adjusted for currency effects. This is mainly driven by our property and casualty
business group, where we recorded remarkable topline growth of 20% on the back of
improving market conditions.
In the first quarter, technical profitability in P&C returned to a normal level. There was
some loss activity during the quarter where large losses stayed within the budget. In
addition, our net estimate for COVID-19 related losses remained unchanged compared to
year-end 2020 at EUR950 million. Hence, the combined ratio of 96.2% is not only in line
with our planning, but also a good reflection of the improving underlying profitability in the
first quarter.
As expected, the results of our Life and Health Reinsurance business group continues to
be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the high number of deaths in
January and February in the United States also led to losses in our in-force portfolio.
Overall losses connected to COVID-19 amounted to EUR151 million, slightly higher than
initially expected.

Bloomberg Transcript

As indicated in March the, restructuring within our US mortality portfolio led to a positive
one-off effect of EUR129 million, offsetting a large part of the COVID impact in Life and
Health. To be clear, this restructuring for our ING portfolio does not affect the business
reinsured by Hannover Re. However, a change in the ownership of the ceding company
allowed for some other changes, in particular with regards to the collateral structure.
Finally, we recorded pleasing premium growth of 8.6% adjusted for currency effects. At
2.5%, the return on investment is fairly well in line with expectations overall, and the
capitalization according to Solvency II continued to be excellent confirmed by the very
strong solvency ratio of 252% at the end of the first quarter, well above our threshold of
200%.
The operating cash flow in the first quarter was a particularly strong EUR1.7 billion, mainly
driven by attractive reinsurance growth as well as very solid results on the investment
side. On top of that, the restructuring within our US mortality portfolio led to a positive
operating cash flow of around EUR640 million. Driven by this positive cash flow, total
assets under own management increased to a record high of EUR52.5 billion. This growth
was additionally supported by ForEx effect and the issuance of the EUR750 million in
hybrid capital in March.
This new bond issuance is also visible on the next slide, bringing our total hybrid capital to
EUR3 billion. We still have flexibility in regards to our total hybrid capacity, and
shareholders' equity was rather stable in the first quarter of 2021. Market movements
again had a strong impact in the first quarter and the negative change in unrealized gains
due to increased interest rates was stronger than the positive impact from currency
translation. Altogether, the net income was enough to bring the balance back into positive
territory.

FINAL

Clemens Jungsthof el

{BIO 20496428 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Jean-Jacques. Good morning, everyone. Moving on directly to the
segmental reporting, I will start with the development of our Property and Casualty
business group. Gross written premium grew by a remarkable 20% adjusted for currency
effects. Based on the January renewals, the growth in our traditional reinsurance portfolio
is stemming mainly from Europe although premium volume also increased in the US and in
Asia. On top of this, we were also able to successfully conclude a number of (inaudible 14:58) in our structured reinsurance. This shouldn't come as a surprise as we had
mentioned our healthy pipeline in this area several times. Furthermore, the recognition of
premium from the underwriting year 2020 was material and also supported the growth in
the first quarter. This effect is generally most pronounced in the first quarter and should
therefore not repeat itself in the coming quarters. The two latter effects are also the main
reasons for the more pronounced growth in the first quarter compared to the premium
growth reported for the 1-1 renewal.

Bloomberg Transcript

Major losses came in at EUR193 million, slightly below our quarterly budget of EUR215
million. And just as a reminder, in line with our usual practice, as you know we have kept
the unused part of the budget within our IBNR as a buffer for the remainder of the year.
Even more importantly, we did not have any reasons to adjust our net loss estimate for
COVID-19 in the first quarter while the gross loss estimated actually increased slightly. This
was offset by our retro protection.
The runoff of our reserves was slightly negative in the first quarter, but this development
is more a one-off in nature and does not reflect any general negative trend in our
portfolio. However, as we've not changed our conservative reserving approach, I would
expect the confidence level of our reserves to be stable compared to year-end 2020.
Altogether, the 96.2% combined ratio is in line with our expectation.
Ordinary investment income was stable while realized gains were lower than in previous
years, explaining the decrease in our net investment income. Nevertheless, the first
quarter 2021 also benefited from realized gains because we sold some of our listed
equities. Other income and expenses amounted to minus EUR91 million, mainly driven by
negative currency effect of EUR82 million. Altogether, the EBIT increased to EUR324
million, thanks to the improved underwriting results. Finally, the tax ratio was below the
normal level due to a favorable earnings contribution from lower tax subsidiaries.
On the next slide, total net large losses accounted for EUR193 million in the first quarter,
again EUR221 million below the budget. There -- I think there's not a lot more to say on
this slide, so I will directly move on to our detailed large loss overview.
As you can see on the next slide, the largest individual event was the Texas freeze with a
total net loss of EUR75 million, adding to storm in Spain since the Australian flood. The net
impact from nat cat was EUR105 million, hardly a severely impacted quarter for Hannover

Re. On the man-man -- on the man-made side though the quarter was more active with
one satellite loss and four property claims, leading to a net loss burden of EUR88 million.
The next slide shows the technical profitability of our P&C portfolio by reporting line. The
picture for the first quarter is a mixed one. As is usual for an individual quarter, the
combined ratio is slightly above the target in some line or region, mainly due to large
losses and slightly better than the target in other areas. I see this as a confirmation of the
benefit of our highly diversified portfolio.
One comment just on credit and surety, which looks part -- particularly good. The
government programs to mitigate the impact of the pandemic are still in place and have
certainly had a positive impact on the reported numbers. Therefore, the good 83
combined ratio is the result of the actual loss development in the first quarter and not
driven by any reserve releases related to COVID-19. Overall, again the 96.2% combined
ratio was very close to our target.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, let's move on to Life and Health; the pleasing premium growth highlights the fact that
our strategic initiatives are bearing fruit, given that it's mainly driven by the APAC region
and by longevity. The technical result is affected by losses in connection with COVID-19. As
in previous quarters, the main impact is coming from our US portfolio. Apart from the US,
the bulk of the losses are from South Africa and to a lesser extent from other countries.
As indicated in March, the restructuring part of the ING portfolio in our US mortality book
led to a positive one-off effect of EUR129 million. So when you look at this effect of
EUR129 million, it might sound a bit complicated now, so I will try -- because this one-off
shows up in three different lines in the P&L. First, the transfer of some assets as part of
the funds withheld led to a positive valuation gain of EUR86 million. The restructuring of
the collateral agreements had a positive impact of EUR58 million in the other income and
expenses, and the valuation effect of the ModCo derivative was minus EUR14 million. So,
as mentioned by Jean-Jacques, this adds up to the EUR129 million offsetting therefore a
large part of our COVID-19 losses in the first quarter.
The ordinary investment income was in line with our expectations while the fair value of
financial instruments was significantly negative in the first quarter. This is driven by the
valuation of the derivatives embedded in the Life Reinsurance contract. Unfortunately, this
derivative creates some volatility because the corresponding positive effect of the
liabilities is not visible in our IFRS accounts due to IFRS accounting regime. Taking an
economic view, the negative impact is to some extent offset.
Other income and expenses are mainly driven by a further increase in the contribution
from our Financial Solutions business, a large portion of which was recognized according
to the deposit accounting method. Currency effects this quarter was slightly positive. All in
all, the EBIT of EUR80 million is affected by a number of larger individual effects. Adjusted
for COVID losses, the positive one-off from US mortality and the negative derivative
valuation, the result would have been in line with our expectations. At 37.9%, the tax ratio
is above normal level driven by the taxation business but I'd caution you not to read too
much into quarterly tax rate.

FINAL

On the next slide, for Life and Health premium development, it's just one way to measure
growth. But what is probably even more important is the value of new business. On the
next slide, you can see that we were quite active in our reporting categories and also the
pipeline for new business remains very healthy. By region, North America, APAC and the
UK for longevity are currently the most promising. But European markets like Germany
and France may also bring some new opportunities.
Looking at the indicator for the new business value at the bottom, the first quarter was
particularly strong. As you know, actions in life and health are rather bumpy and the value
of new business also closely linked to the duration of the business written. In any case, I
see our Life and Health business group is being well on track in terms of new business
production.

Bloomberg Transcript

The next slide, development of our investments, in the first quarter I think it was very
satisfactory. The ordinary investment income is in line with our expectations. On the one
hand, our portfolio of inflation-linked bond, as you know, is to some extent still affected by
lower inflation. On the other hand, the return from alternative investment is back to higher
levels compared to the previous year. Around EUR50 million of the realized gains are
linked to the partial disposal of listed equities. The remainder is the result of normal
portfolio maintenance in a low yield environment.
Listed equities are not really a strategically important asset class for us. Therefore, the
realization was rather opportunistic following the strong performance of equity markets.
Additionally, we still have our desired exposure to private equity, as you know.
Impairments and depreciations are comparable to last year but still on a really moderate
level.
As explained in my comments on Life and Health, the derivative valuation was negative
explaining the majority of the decrease in investment income compared to the previous
year. The overall return on investment was 2.5%, meaning that we are well on track to
achieve our full-year target of roughly 2.4%.
Unrealized gains decreased by almost EUR1 billion due to the increase in interest rate, but
are still on a very high level at about EUR2 billion. More importantly, the rising interest
rates are of course positive for the new money yield even if the overall interest rate levels
are very low.
On the next slide, the asset allocation, as you can see, remained rather stable in the first
quarter 2021. The only notable change I'd mention is that we slightly increased the share
of profit to 32%. Here, we invested according to a broad-based approach with a focus on
developed market. The mentioned disposal of listed equities is not really visible here in
this overview and the rounded number is still at 1%. The contribution to ordinary
investment income is diversified, as usual. It's particularly pleasing to see that the
contribution from private equity recovered to the strong levels that we had seen before
the market volatility caused by the pandemic in 2020.

To conclude my remarks, the overall result for the first quarter 2021 does include few
larger extraordinary effects as you can see, but both the reported net income and the
underlying business development support our guidance for the full year. And I hereby
hand back to you, Jean-Jacques, for the target metrics and the outlook.

FINAL

Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Clemens. On the next slide, you see the target metrics, which
confirms that we had a good start to 2021. Growth, as mentioned earlier, is significantly
ahead of the strategic targets and our main profitability target for the Group, the ROE is
well above the minimum target and the industry average.
The treaty renewals as at 1st of April, 2021 we're also successful for Hannover Re. Both
the premium development and the price improvements are very much in line with the
trends we saw in the January renewals. In the US, we particularly benefited from the
underlying improvement in primary markets and we're able to generate a double-digit
growth. In Japan, growth was slightly lower but overall in line with our expectations.

Bloomberg Transcript

And for the cat business, the reinsurance rate improved further on the back of the heavy
loss burden in 2018 and 2019. Continued positive trends could also be observed in our
aviation and marine portfolios. Overall, our premium in the April renewals increased by
7.4%. The risk adjusted price change was about 5% positive. Looking at -- only at the nonproportional business, the price increase was even higher at 9%.
Based on the favorable renewals in January and April, we see further opportunity to grow
our highly diversified portfolio in an attractive market environment. And I would expect the
general pricing trends affecting the reinsurance industry to persist in 2021 and to carry on
into 2022. Influencing factors will be the amplitude of further COVID-19 impact for the
industry and also the large loss situation as usual. We still feel comfortable with our P&C
reserving for COVID-19 related losses and currently, we do not expect a material impact
in 2021.
In Life and Health Reinsurance, growth is expected to be well supported by our strategic
initiatives and most pronounced in longevity and financial solutions. In the latter case, this
volume indication also includes business which is booked according to the deposit
accounting method and is therefore not visible in the premium income. In mortality, further
losses from the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to decrease significantly compared to
the first quarter, mainly driven by the progress of vaccination programs around the world
but particularly in the US. The premium is expected to be slightly lower, mainly due to the
natural decrease in our in-force book and our limited appetite for new business in the
most competitive, traditional life segments, particularly in the US and the UK markets. In
morbidity, the overall development is more stable.
As mentioned by Clemens, the business development in the first quarter of the year
supports our guidance for the full year. On the premium guidance, it even supports a
slightly higher growth rate and we have increased our expectation to a high single-digit
growth rate. We have kept guidance for Group net income unchanged. On the one hand,

Page 6 of 16



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2021-05-05

of course the slightly higher assumptions for growth will filter through the bottom line. On
the other hand, the impact from COVID-19 was a little higher than expected in the first
quarter. Finally, I can reconfirm our positive view of the dividend policy and the potential to
pay a special dividend if profit targets are reached and the capitalization remains strong.

FINAL

This concludes my remarks and we would be happy to answer your questions. Thank you
very much.

Questions And Answers

Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our question-and-answer session. (Operator
Instructions) And the first question is from Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca. Your line is now
open. Please go ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning. Thank you, and hope everything is okay with everybody. So my two
questions please, one is the -- Jean-Jacques, you mentioned the pricing effect and you
mentioned an optimistic outlook for 2022. And you mentioned some factors including
COVID. Could you just elaborate a bit? Is it because you think COVID discussions haven't
actually had the opportunity to take place this year and that's why some of these effects
could roll over into next year's pricing? So, that's my first question. Or any other factors
you would like to highlight for next year would be helpful as well.
And second question is the mortality COVID effect, the EUR151 million total, but only
EUR105 million in the US. But -- so the ex-US, you mentioned South Africa, could you just
elaborate, is there some other risks because so far at the marketplace we've mostly
been focused on US mortality, partly UK. And also -- I mean in that context, does
something like the Indian situation bother you at all in terms of loss risks? So just any
comment on ex-US COVID mortality which seemed a bit higher than what I would have
imagined. Thank you.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Thank you for that. Just on the first question, you have several drivers for pricing of
course. You have the large loss activity in the past few years. The interest rate
environment of course puts some additional pressure. On COVID, as mentioned, I think
we were -- we're of the view that we are well reserved conservatively across the lines of
business affected, but there are some uncertainty on client-by-client basis. And in some
instances, this will still be a point on the agenda as we renew some of the businesses in
January.
So, I think you still will see the -- some impact and some further price pressure on the
cadence [ph] given the burden of COVID. As of end of last year of course, we had a much
better view on the overall exposure. But this is work in progress and this will be very much
on a client by client basis.

Maybe on the Life and Health ex-US, UK, Klaus can address that.

FINAL

A - Klaus Miller

{BIO 16886879 <GO>}

Yes. And then, the COVID claims, excluding the US, in our portfolio are mainly from Latin
America and South Africa. The worst country in Latin America is probably right now Brazil,
but not in our portfolio. We have hardly any business in Brazil. But Chile, Colombia, even
Mexico to some extent, have caused losses in our portfolio. It's just in the double digits
and I don't know how long this will continue. It's nothing what we are really worried about
in terms of our bottom line result.
South Africa, the team [ph] -- vaccination has not really started there and we have a lot of
financing business as well in South Africa, which can absorb a lot of COVID claims. But
including the mortality covers we provide, this is also I guess single digit, maybe doubledigit loss in the first quarter.
India is of not much importance for our bottom line against the total premium. Premium is
in the single-digit millions and that has absolutely no impact on the bottom line for us.
These are the largest markets outside the US and UK. Europe as such is not really a
problem so far. Please keep in mind that we have shifted our portfolio to financial
solutions and longevity in the last 10 years, to a large extent. This definitely helps in this
situation.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Thank you very much and good morning to everyone. Two questions, both on the P&C Re.
You mentioned the COVID-19 related losses, the estimate is unchanged at EUR950
million. It appears that new COVID-19 related losses are fully covered by retro, which is
somewhat counter-intuitive. Can you explain why this is the case and how the mechanics
works here?

FINAL

Second question, the strong growth in P&C Re 20.1%, you mentioned that some of this
comes from structured reinsurance. However, I thought that premiums from structured
reinsurance are generally deposit accounted. So, can you elaborate a little bit how
structured reinsurance plays into this strong growth and whether this strong growth was
affected by some large order share transactions or anything like that?

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Thank you. I guess so Sven will address both points.

A - Sven Althoff

{BIO 19104724 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

On the COVID side, as Clemens explained, our gross position has only increased a little
bit. So, the gross claim grew by approximately 3%. This was coming out of mainly
property-related, so business interruption related new loss advisors from our ceding
companies, and we saw a little bit of movement on the contingency side. So, the property
is covered by our retrocessional protection and the small increase from non-propertyrelated lines. We have eliminated by adjusting other lines very gradually downwards in
order to keep with the overall EUR950 million, which is an overall conservative number. So,
we wanted to have stability on that side in the first quarter.
When it comes to the growth, the ramp up of the 2020 business comes both from the
traditional business and from the advanced solutions business, which we have written at
the 1/4 renewals and later last year. The reason why Advanced Solutions is also
significantly contributing in that aspect is that the amount of business we write on a
deposit accounted basis in our P&C structured reinsurance practice is very, very small
indeed. So we -- it would be more the exception than the norm that we have deposit
accounted business in our structured P&C business. So, they contribute exactly like -- any
traditional quota share, for example, would contribute. And given that we are talking
about business that was written up, that 1-1 last year, as Clemens said, this impact will
phase out over the next couple of quarters.
But to give you a more detail, when we reported about our growth in Q1 2020, 25% of
that number at the time came from underwriting years 2019 and prior. And we are now
reporting about our growth in the first quarter of 2021. A remarkable 50% of that growth
is coming from the previous underwriting years. So if you put the growth into the
categories, the underwriting year 2020 and prior, it's more than we expected. When we
look at underwriting year 2021, the growth we are seeing is very much in line with the
premium growth we reported in early February when we talked about our January
renewals.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi, there. I joined the call a bit late, so apologies if you've addressed these topics. The
first question was, could you just give us a color as to the FX noise in the other income in
non-life? Why it is so large? How can I forecast or how can I -- what are the main
sensitivities and what was driving it? I think the fact that -- EUR82 million inside.
Second question, so could you just give us a bit more color on your outlook for mid-year
renewals -- but definitely, a bit more discussion with the weather, there is an accelerating
softening trend or still decent rate correction, maybe give us a sense how much of your
mid-year renewal is on sort of loss affected business?
And the final question, could you just give us a bit color behind your decision to raise
more debt in the quarter? It doesn't seem like from the outside that you particularly
needed it given your strong solvency and no imminent refinancing. So what was the
thinking? Is it purely opportunistic? Do you feel the need to run at a particularly high capital
coverage in anticipation of growth or some other metric that would be useful, just some
color on that would be great. Thank you.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Thank you, Andrew, and I'll give the question on ForEx to Clemens and also probably the
hybrid capital and then mid-year renewal for Sven.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Clemens Jungsthof el

{BIO 20496428 <GO>}

Yes, good morning, Andrew. Colleagues are looking [ph] at me with respect to the FX
effect in P&C because it's actually an accounting question, so that goes to the CFO,
because again it's an accounting one, it's not an economic effect. The reason is, the
stronger -- mainly the stronger US dollar in the first quarter development of the US dollar,
that's the underlying reason for it. And as we re-evaluate our balance sheet, both on the
liability and asset side or the liability effect flows through the P&L, that's the currency
effect where it's on the asset side. Only so called liquid assets, monetary assets that are
classified under IFRS flows through the P&L and the other in fact goes straight into the
currency OCI for particularly our non-monetary US product assets, for example, our huge
US sort of private equity portfolio.
You will have seen an opposite effect last year where we reported a gain on the P&C
side. So, it add a certain volatility of course to our results. But the movements were quite
significant to the last year, as you know, in the US dollar and this year as well. So, that sort
of flows through the P&L. However, again there is a fully offsetting effect in our P&L.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Would you want to address the debt or shall we go first to the mid-year -- mid-year
renewals, outlook?

FINAL

Yes, on what we have seen at 1/4 is that the momentum on the rate side is -- was
relatively unchanged to what we saw at the 1st of January renewal, both on the insurance
and on the reinsurance side. When you ask about 1st of June, 1st of July renewals, we
expect that positive trend to continue. There is some first sign of slowing down in the
momentum but the direction of travel is still up, I mean we're not talking about an SP4
[ph] kind of market yet.
Where we are particularly seeing more pressure is on proportional treaties where ceding
companies are arguing that in their business they have achieved two, very often three
round of rate increases. So, they are not really prepared to decrease their Ceding
Commissions further due to the fact that the underlying profitability of the business
should be significantly better. So, that's what we are seeing.

Bloomberg Transcript

The bulk of the business we will renew at 1st of June and 1st of July is coming from the US
and Australia. US was a heavy loss year. As you know, last year was Hurricane Laura and
various tornadoes, and so from that point of view we see little reason why that business
should see a lesser rate momentum compared to the one business we have written in
the US.
Australia on the other hand had difficult years in 2019. 2020 a lot of that was already taken
into account when we last renewed that business. The last 12 months were not loss free,
but didn't experience the same sort of loss good [ph] in Australia. So here, I would expect
that we still see rate increases but maybe not as high as we could report a year ago. So
overall, the trend is still very much intact. But maybe the rate increases we will be able to
report when we talk about Q2 will come a little below what we could now report at 1st of
April and 1st of January.

A - Clemens Jungsthof el

{BIO 20496428 <GO>}

Yeah, and just briefly on the hybrid, I mean it does give us -- as you've seen in our
Solvency II rate as well, it does give us some buffer -- provide some buffer both in
Solvency II, but also in our rating capital models. So there is some headroom for us, not
necessarily been in the first quarter of course. But we thought the market environment
was very good, so we took the chance and it was an opportunistic move in March, again
to provide us with some buffers to take advantage of the good pricing environment and
the market environment and the opportunities in the market.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

And just to respond to also a part of your question, Andrew, there is no different
benchmark now when it comes to Solvency II. We're still at the same level and see this is a
fairly high solvency ratio. But combined with the opportunistic nature of that death rising,
that gives us a photography of the situation as of end of March. But there is no change in
our practice yet.

Q - Jochen Schmitt

{BIO 4227302 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. I have one question on your ordinary investment income from
private equity in Q1 2021. Does this include any specialty within or any valuation effect?
That's my question.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Thank you. Clemens will address that.

A - Clemens Jungsthof el

{BIO 20496428 <GO>}

Yes -- no, it's really just ordinary distributions from our private equity funds. It's a variety of
private equity funds. There is no special effect in there, and no evaluation effects. We
don't evaluate our private equity investments through P&L. It all goes through the OCI.
There are positive effects in the OCI actually, but I think it's very pleasing what we saw
compared to last year in terms of ordinary investments, the results from private equity
(Technical Difficulty) in excess of first part of 2020.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. Just one question from me, and apologies if I missed this detail. I
understand that you have a parametric cover for your Life and Health business, which kind
of helps out in situations, kind of pandemic situations. Just wanted to ask, how close are
you to triggering this and how much cover does it provide? I guess given the situation
elsewhere in the world, the US, the UK seems to be getting a bit better. Does it also
include non-US deaths, any color on that would be really helpful. Thank you.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Yes, Klaus?

A - Klaus Miller

{BIO 16886879 <GO>}

Yes. The cover we have bought is currently at $255 million capacity and the trigger is
defined as the weighted average of the population mortality of three countries, the US,

Page 12 of 16

FINAL

the UK and Australia. We picked these three because they have the higher sums of risk in
our portfolio. The weights are about 60% US, about 22% UK and about 18% Australia.
Currently the trigger starts at 100% of this weighted population mortality and it ends at
100%, so it's 10 percentage point. And the $255 million mean that each percentage point
in excess of 110 is worth $25.5 million. Currently, we are pretty close at -- or to the trigger
point of $110 million. Not much is expected from Australia in the rest of the year, just
normal mortality. So, it will not increase the cost of Australia. It will probably also not
increase further due to UK because COVID claims are significantly reduced. And the US,
we have to wait what happens there. Currently, there are still about 500 claims a day. I
don't expect a large payout from that. And hopefully, this is not the case because that
would mean that we have the COVID pandemic under control. So, this is only linked to
population mortality in these three countries.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Hi, good morning everybody. It's Vikram, Soc Gen. I've got a couple of questions. First is
on the deposit accounted treaties contribution which ended EUR90 million for this quarter
versus EUR85 million Q1 2020. Can you give us a bit more color if there is a slowdown in
the growth that we have been used to in the past or is it more of -- because it's a lumpy
business Q1 was a slightly lower growth quarter and you might expect the growth to pick
up in the coming quarters? So any comments there would be really useful.
And second was on the cyber insurance, can you just explain how the book is shaping up?
What were the premiums for the full-year 2020 and how the things are looking for the
current year? Thank you.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Sven, Financial Solutions business?

A - Sven Althoff

{BIO 19104724 <GO>}

The Financial Solutions business is pretty stable, not impacted by the COVID pandemic
right now. And in -- we have two countries where most of the Financial Solutions business
is coming from, one is the US, the other is China. The US is up to 20 years, so this is more
long-term. China is significantly small-term but at least for the next 2 years or 3 years we
don't expect significant shift here. And we hope that we can write more business in the
near future. So, this is something what we see as a stable contributor to our bottom line
result.

(inaudible - 54:48) and on the other question?

FINAL

A - Sven Althoff

{BIO 19104724 <GO>}

On the cyber portfolio, this continues to be a growing class for Hannover Re. So in 2020,
we wrote approximately EUR300 million of cyber reinsurance premium. As you know, we
were able at 1st of July renewals onwards from last year to reduce the silent cyber
exposure on non-affirmative cyber business, which created some further headroom for us
in order to keep growing our affirmative cyber portfolio. And for 2021, we had a successful
start to the year where we could either increase shares on existing contracts or even write
a few more. So, we are going to approach a premium volume here EUR400 million for the
full underwriting year 2021.
Our loss experience continues to be favorable in this class. We have seen an uptick in the
loss frequency in the last 18 months. But the business we write is still well within the
ultimate loss ratio picks that we had chosen for that business at the beginning when we
were writing it. So from that point of view, we see this as a good contribution to further
increase the earnings capability of our P&C practice.

Q - Emanuele Musio

{BIO 19781440 <GO>}

Hello, hi, sorry, I was on mute. Thanks for taking my question. A quick question on the
combined ratio. Can you please give us an indication of where the line profitability stands
compared to last year, or maybe you can otherwise give me an indication of what the
contribution from prior-year development was this year? Is it comparable to 2020? Is it
more -- just some color about that, please.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Thank you, Emanuele. Sven?

A - Sven Althoff

{BIO 19104724 <GO>}

Yes, to the prior year development, as Clemens has said, that came in a little less good
compared to where we were a year ago due to some impact on our short-take classes
[ph]. For example, the winter storm in Texas was mostly resulting from business which we
wrote in underwriting year 2020. So, this showed some negative run off therefore for our

2020 property business. The run-off result for our long-take classes, casualty in particular,
was good, was positive, so no concerns from that side.
And as to your first question, I mean of course we are satisfied with the start to the year
with our 96.2% combined ratio. So, this makes us more confident that we will achieve our
target of 96% or better at the end of the year. But of course the, year has only just
started. So, there is a lot of exposure on the wind side waiting for us in the next couple of
quarters. So at this stage, I would say it's a good start. It seems to reconfirm our guidance
on that side. But we would not be more bullish than that at this stage.

Thank you very much for joining this early call. So, I think we handled the key topics. We
wanted to show that we had a solid starting to the year with these quarterly results on the
back of successful P&C renewals and good momentum in pricing and conditions with
strong growth that you've seen and the net Corona loss estimate, which is unchanged.
In Life and Health of course some uncertainties remain, but we believe that with the
vaccination programs, particularly in the US, things will improve in the coming quarters, but
of course still some uncertainties. Strong capitalization, we addressed that at the
beginning of the year. And this is reflecting of course the hybrid bond and the outlook is
positive.
We're quite confident about the guidance. We changed of course the topline guidance
reflecting the P&C business. But as Sven mentioned, it's a bit early in the year to look at it
in more detail. There is still some uncertainty. There is still some nat cat activity which
might be coming later in the next few quarters. But all in all, we're very positive about the
outlook for 2021 and feel very comfortable with the guidance.
With that, I'll close this session. Thank you again for joining today and see you next time.
