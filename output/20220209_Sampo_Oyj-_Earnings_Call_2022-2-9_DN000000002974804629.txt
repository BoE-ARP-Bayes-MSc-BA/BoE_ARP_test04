Presentation
Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Sampo Group 2021 Results Conference
Call. My name is Sami Taipalus and I am Head of Investor Relations at Sampo Group. I'm
joined on the call by Group CEO and President, Torbjorn Magnusson; Group CFO, Knut
Arne Alsaker; CEO of If, Morten Thorsrud; and CEO of Hastings, Toby van der Meer. The
call will feature a short presentation from Torbjorn followed by Q&A. A recording of the
call will later be available on sampo.com/results.
With that, I hand over to Torbjorn. Please go ahead.

Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Thank you, Sami. Please move on to page 3. There we are, thank you. Good afternoon,
everyone, and I'm very pleased to be able to present yet another set of solid numbers
and developments for our group. Maybe the ﬁrst page here speaks for itself, but let me
give you a brief commentary anyway. Our underwriting culture together with customer
focus have been our trademarks for decades -- two decades. Few insurance companies
have been able to show that consistency that we have also in our own well-structured

region. Thus, I think -- this I think has been particularly true for the past few years where
our digital advantages have supported the underwriting culture of the group. And a
combined ratio of 81.4% for non-life through pricing more than EUR7 billion in premiums
compares quite favorably to peers. And as usual, volatility in our numbers is really low.
In addition to our own development, the markets have stayed rather unconsolidated. The
one-one renewals in the Nordics we had more than 40% of the commercial and industrial
businesses renewed, was one of the most successful in the past decade for If P&C with
good growth and adequate rates. Furthermore, renewal rates were very satisfactory and
still increasing for all -- from already high levels in If P&C. Renewal rates reﬂect our success
in oﬀering customers value for money. They support keeping down on mid admin costs
for us and they certainly also reﬂect rational markets.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have come to learn that every year is a new year for investment returns and the
uncertainty for the future in those returns is high and that has been the case for a long
time. 2021 anyway supplied high returns. We don't rely on or calculate with higher
nominal interests when we price the insurance business going forward that more do we
cry wolf about claims inﬂation in the present, still very moderate situation.
Then further down on this page, on strategic actions and their capital consequences,
reducing our Nordea stake has been a rapid process and produced good proceeds in
time [ph] when Nordea's own strategic strong progress. And secondly, achieving full
ownership of Hastings happened already this year clearly ahead of expectations. The
Board then has today proposed a dividend of EUR4.10 including the extraordinary EUR2
management had already indicated in the autumn as well as the EUR1.70 insurance
dividend.
Next slide please, Sami. So starting from the right-hand side of this slide, 81.4%, already
mentioned, group combined ratio and together with the positive trend for If P&C. 1% and
a bit better attritional combined ratio in the last year that is the combined ratio adjusted
for all volatile items like large losses, COVID, weather, prior year results, in other words
slightly more than 1% better rate. Combining this with growth, we had 19% higher
underwriting proﬁt study year before adjusting for Hasting's ownership and COVID.
Next slide please. I'll leave the detailed volume comments to Morten later on in the call
probably, but just say that given the geographical mix we have, we will probably see
marginally increased market shares when the statistics come out. We are a bit dependent
on car sales and in the last two quarters only Norwegians have had the money, nor the
chance to buy cars apparently, but all in all very satisfactory development of number of
customers and market shares. It is worth mentioning also that we have achieved adequate
rate levels also in our commercial book some time ago and consequently volume
development also there is now good with an increasing number of customers.
Next slide. And this we will save for the call I think, so next slide. Turning to Hastings, we
are, of course, in the U.K. in the middle of a period of change in the market with Hastings,
really well prepared for a less aﬀected by the GIPP reform than many others. The market
reaction to this is something we monitor day by day, so talking about 2021 feels

FINAL

somewhat late now. However, summarizing then 2021, Hastings did really well, continuing
to build on their technological advantages, increasing the customer count, but being
cautious to avoid competing with price in the COVID over stimulated market. Excellent
operating ratio and continued rapid growth in home insurance completes the picture.
Next slide. In terms of the synergy process, let me now say and then point out that we
have started reducing the proportion of ceded business keeping more of the book on our
own account just as planned.
Next slide. Finally then let me just show a slide depicting the total capital distribution
broken down between buybacks, extra dividend from Nordea proceeds, insurance
dividend and the rest. I'm really pleased to be able to report on the rapid progress for the
group simpliﬁcation programs launched a year ago together with the usual Sampo
excellence in underwriting. And all of this wrapped up together in the handsome capital
distribution.
And with that, over to you Sami.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you, (Operator Instructions) Our ﬁrst question comes from Jakob Brink with
Nordea. Please go ahead.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Thank you and good afternoon. First question on Hastings, please. So on 80% combined
ratio for 2021 at a whole and 84% in the second half of the year, relatively limited premium
growth or revenue growth for the full year, could you maybe give us some more clarity on
how should we look at margins compared to growth going forward? Also taking into
consideration what you have already seen with the new pricing reform in the U.K.,
anything to add maybe, anything would be helpful. Thank you.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Toby, that's yours.

A - Toby van der Meer

{BIO 16628969 <GO>}

Yes, hi, good afternoon, everybody. Toby van der Meer here. So to give you a bit of color
on the dynamics, ﬁrstly, just to remind you that across the U.K. market, we've seen a range
of premium declines across the second half of 2020 and in particular the ﬁrst-half for
2021, but also continuing in the second half of 2021. And a lot of that, of course, driven by

Page 3 of 22



FINAL

Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2022-02-09

particularly in the early period COVID beneﬁts, some claims frequencies being reﬂected
in lower prices by us and the number of other insurers around the country. And the eﬀects
that had [ph] is in some ways a tale of two hubs for the 2021 ﬁnancial year. In the earlier
part of the year, the customers we booked with those COVID discounts embedded in
them in the pricing, would have been driven a lot less than normal because of the
lockdown and then, of course, return to more normal driving behavior in the second half
of the year and so the tale of two hubs is really one where we've had the earn through of
lower premiums in the second half of the year with driving behavior returning to normal
whereas we saw both the frequency beneﬁts or premiums in the ﬁrst half of the year.
Now those COVID discounts have then been unwound by us, so we've been applying rate
increases throughout the second half of 2021 and into 2022 and so that's to cover the
unwinding of the COVID frequency beneﬁts as well as general claims inﬂation. And I
suppose what that means overall is that our competitiveness has been stable. We've been
pricing ahead of the market. Normally that would take your policy count backwards, but
because of a range of good initiatives, we've managed to grow the policy count a little bit
and premiums are now going back up. And our pricing throughout all of that, whether
we're talking about the policy we wrote at the back end of 2020 or the early part of 2021
or the policies we're writing now, we're conﬁdent they are in line with our target loss ratio
or better.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

And how about the (Multiple Speakers). I am sorry.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Toby van der Meer

{BIO 16628969 <GO>}

But I was just to complete the picture, I just think what we've seen across the market in
January post the FCA pricing reforms is some turnaround in market conditions with
premiums starting to go back up. So we've been doing that throughout 2021 and January,
but we'll see more of the market to do that in January as well, albeit still a mixed picture
with a number of players being quite aggressive and a number of other players pricing up
quite signiﬁcantly.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Thank you. And just to round that up maybe. So if we also add in the inﬂation bid which
you write about in the report that inﬂation on motor repair cost is going up, could you
maybe -- so what level of combined ratios should we be looking at given the growth
you're seeing now, are we above last year or we getting closer to the 88% or we still
materially below?

A - Toby van der Meer

{BIO 16628969 <GO>}

Yeah, I think it's too early in the year to provide too much guidance on that. What I can say
is, ﬁrstly, policy count growth we regarded an output of our pricing, not a target in its
underwrite. And so we're conﬁdent that our pricing is consistent with or better than our
target loss ratio and therefore consistent with or better than our combined operating ratio
as well. We've seen muted policy count growth with some -- the back end of last year and
you can assume that sort of momentum will continue until we feel like the pricing

FINAL

environment in the market is such that faster growth is warranted. And obviously there is a
long way to play out this year to see where all of that normalizes post the initial few noisy
weeks of the New Year post GIPP.
So stable policy count growth until market conditions improve, pricing consistent or
better within our target loss ratio. And as we're already into that, we have seen premium
growth come back because although our policy count growth is stable, we've been
applying rate increases and unwinding COVID discounts throughout the year, so that top
line growth is something we would expect to see continue.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Great, thanks a lot. Then over to a question on, well, ﬁrstly buying more of Hastings back
in December and apparently also the fact that you have bought more shares in
Topdanmark during November. I don't know Torbjorn, maybe you can give us some
clarity on what is the rationale especially for the Topdanmark 1.5 million more shares and
also how do you look at this buying more Hastings versus buying own shares versus
buying Topdanmark, et cetera?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

There is not that much to say that where books [ph] available in the market on
Topdanmark and at the market price that was not diﬃcult for us. And Hastings, that was an
opportunity that arose out of the other owner's situation in the rest of their business and
as far as we can tell a strategic review of their own business on situation, so that we didn't
drive, but it arose in the autumn and we had a good dialog with them since before. There
you are.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Yes, if I can just follow-up, just I guess you can make many adjustments on your own share
price for excess capital at Topdanmark as well and also acquisition price of the last 30% of
Hastings, but I think it's fair to say that the PE, if we look at consensus on the three
companies of Sampo, it's up. And Hastings, the PE that you acquired, the last 30% of
Hastings at, is not that diﬀerent from what you could buy the rest of TOP at. And also you
could even argue that Sampo adjusted for capital is cheaper on consensus earnings. So
again but --

A - Toby van der Meer

{BIO 16628969 <GO>}

I'm listening very carefully to your analysis, but you don't -- I don't think you expect me to
say much more, do you?

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

It would be nice. But, okay, fair enough. Okay, then just a small last question to Knut I
guess on Nordea and the last bit of Nordea, how is it again that we should expect it to
account for that? Let's say you sold the last bit of Nordea in Q1, will you then reverse the
$464 million diﬀerence in the valuation through the panel [ph]?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

FINAL

Good afternoon, Jakob. That would -- the proﬁt recognition would obviously depend on
which price we sell at, but any price above EUR8.90 [ph] will be recorded as a proﬁt. Yes,
we've done the reversal of impairments, so that is a proﬁt in our P&L if we sell at the price
above EUR8.90. And at the current share price, the number of around EUR460 million is
about twice.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay, thanks a lot.

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

And if I should just add -- sorry Jakob, just to the best of the detail since you asked about
accounting in Nordea since many are listening and updating more. Listen, in terms of any
potential dividend we received from Nordea, if we still hold share at the ex-dividend date,
that will be recorded the best proﬁt as well.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Clear. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Will Hardcastle with UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 22230376 <GO>}

Well, hi, there. It's Will Hardcastle from UBS. First of all, thanks for the color on U.K.
pricing. I guess, I'd like to ask the question at what level of industry pricing change yearon-year? Would we expect to see Hastings back to signiﬁcant growth in excess of the
market? And then second, is it fair to say that leverage is the binding constraint from here
for further capital distributions if the Nordea -- if there is more Nordea stake sell downs
and how rigid are you with the view of the 25% to 30%? And perhaps an extension of that
is just thinking about that potential for the target range to be lowered from 170% to 190%?
Any more clarity or so on that since the last update? Thanks.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

So, Toby, the ﬁrst one and Knut the second. And just for the listeners, we are a little bit
more -- there is little bit more diﬃcult to coordinate our answers as we are spread out in
several places due to, in my own case, COVID protocol. But, Toby?

A - Toby van der Meer

{BIO 16628969 <GO>}

Yes, on growth outlook for Hastings, I guess, there's not a speciﬁc number I can give you
in terms of at what point -- at what level of market price increases would we start to grow
more. The way we build our models as we try and predict and we have a good track
record of accurately predicting future claims costs, we then try to make sure that we price
at a level where we hit our target loss ratio or better, those are the prices we put out onto
Page 6 of 22

FINAL

the market to the extent that makes us in any period more competitive, will write more
business to the extent that others have a diﬀerent approach, a diﬀerent view on claims or
are prepared to take more risk than they might write more business and it's the balance of
that equation.
And after two years of COVID frequency beneﬁts, I guess we're faced with a number of
other players who are potentially using the reserves built up during COVID to fund more
aggressive new business pricing. And whilst that dynamic continues, I wouldn't have
thought it can continue for very long in the face of those reserves running dry on claims
inﬂation, but to the extent, that it does continue and sometimes it does take longer than
you think and we're quite happy to take our current approach -- pricing approach and see
less policy count growth. Although as I've already said, we are seeing top line growth in
premiums now because of the pricing actions we've taken coupled with our initiatives.

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 22230376 <GO>}

Toby, just one more follow-up on that if possible. I guess, because diﬀerent competitors
are doing diﬀerent things right now, it's probably very tough to sort of decide for exactly
what the average industry level is doing. I guess in that sense, do you think in this current
environment, is pricing at least inﬂate -- is pricing at least capturing inﬂation in this level
from your perspective? And if you're pricing inﬂation to maintain the margin, are we
picking up any market share at these levels?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Toby van der Meer

{BIO 16628969 <GO>}

Yeah, good question. So premiums continue to fall for the market throughout the second
half of 2021. As already said, we put our prices up. The data is only a few weeks, but I'd
directionally say that new business prices in the market up mid-single digits since the start
of January, so falling prices in 2021, mid-single digit increase during January and early
February. I guess, you can make up your own mind about whether that's consistent with
claims inﬂation, but we would say that that feels tight to us to cover the impact of GIPP
and claims inﬂation and the unwinding of COVID discounts. So we're comfortable we've
priced for those things, but -- so it's tough to say with certainty that the market could have
done so given the average dynamics that I just talked about. Having said that, worth
recognizing that a few of the players that we would traditionally describe as being more
disciplined in their underwriting have done -- follow the similar pricing strategy to ours.
So there's a number of other players in the market who are still very aggressive.

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 22230376 <GO>}

That's really helpful. Thanks.

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Good afternoon, Will. It's Knut here reverting to -- your two other questions. Your ﬁrst loss
on leverage, whether or not leverage is a constrain to potential payout additional
dividend or capital distribution if we generate excess capital above our capital
management framework and it's not a constraint. We are committed to being below 30%
target. There will be need to do further deleveraging if we sell all of Nordea. But as we
illustrated, I think it was in the second or third quarters or may, we already have liquidity
Page 7 of 22



Company Name: Sampo Oyj

Date: 2022-02-09

FINAL

to deal with that leverage and we would consider that as being dealt with in terms of our
target if we generate excess capital from selling further Nordea. In other words, we would
be ﬁne this this. There is a certain diﬀerence in time between an actual reported leverage
and when we actually do something with the senior that we have on our books, with the
liquidity that we have already put aside. Was that clear?

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 22230376 <GO>}

Yeah, very clear. Thank you.

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Perfect. Solvency, we also committed to our solvency ratio of between 170% and 190%. We
haven't changed that targets. Rest assure that we will be working on making our capital
stack and balance sheet eﬃcient also going forward and we will revert to you when we
are taking decisions to continue the path to increase our return on the capital, we
consume to run our business.

Thanks. Our next question comes from Faizan Lakhani with HSBC. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Faizan Lakhani

{BIO 20034558 <GO>}

Hi, it's Faizan Lakhani from HSBC. Thanks for taking my questions. First is on January
renewals. It's good to hear that they are going very well. Could you just provide a bit of
color in terms of net of claims inﬂation, what sort of rates are you achieving, the renewals.
Second question is coming back to the Topdanmark state. Given that you purchased 1.5
million Topdanmark shares and in part you said that it has to make ﬁnancial sense, can we
assume from this that you still feel Topdanmark is undervalued?
And my ﬁnal question is on Hastings. Toby, can you help us disaggregate how much of
the 2021 performance was down to COVID related frequency beneﬁt? And given that the
pricing in the market is quite mixed on motor, but could you give some color on
household in terms of what price increases you're seeing there? Thank you.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Morten, do you want to give some color on the January renewals ﬁrst?

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Yeah, I can do that. Yeah, it's been very good January renewal for us in all business
segments. And, of course, not getting out an exact number on sort of the net eﬀect, but I
think I could put it in terms of order of magnitude and say that in the Industrial segment,
the net eﬀect is, I would say, well above expected inﬂation. In the Commercial segment, I
would say that the net eﬀect is above inﬂation and in Private, I would say, somewhat
above. So it's clearly a favorable renewal in all business segments. And for If, as a total, we
are pricing somewhat above than expected inﬂation. So I think favourable start of the New
Year.

Q - Faizan Lakhani

{BIO 20034558 <GO>}

Great, thank you.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

FINAL

And Knut, do you want to have a go at whether Topdanmark is undervalued or not?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

First of all, the price that we bought TOP at in November, it's a little bit diﬀerent than
today. It's that at least we made mainly on that investment if you like. I don't think we have
an exact number on what the right value of TOP is, but I wouldn't say that we consider it
to be undervalued.

Q - Faizan Lakhani

{BIO 20034558 <GO>}

Okay. And then just as a standalone view there rather than -- with synergies for example,
though. So standalone it feels fair, but in synergies, you could possibly justify higher
valuation. Is that a fair way thinking about it?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

It's absolutely fair to think that in a hypothetical merger between Topdanmark and the
remaining part of our Nordic insurance operation, there would be synergies.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

And the fact that Topdanmark is not -- doesn't have unusual multiples compared to other
Nordic insurers is also obvious to everyone. And then back to Toby on Hastings.

A - Toby van der Meer

{BIO 16628969 <GO>}

Yeah, I would say in short, no material COVID frequency beneﬁts remaining in the 2021
ﬁnancials. And the color on that is, of course, there was a biggish beneﬁt in 2020, but as
the COVID dynamics got reﬂected in market pricing and in our own pricing, then actual
behavior was only slightly better than reﬂected in our models. We got our pricing models
right and a small beneﬁt on top of that, but COVID has also had a negative impact on
some of our retail income streams just from customers not undertaking as much insurance
activity as they would normally do, changing their cars, changing their vehicles, changing
address that sort of thing. And so that dampening is largely oﬀset any underwriting
beneﬁts. So I think the numbers you can largely read is normalized now.

Q - Faizan Lakhani

{BIO 20034558 <GO>}

Okay. So, if we strip out the acquisition accounting, it's the end of normalized result?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Yeah.

Hub insurance pricing, let's say, not much happened to materiality during 2021, but post
chip, we have seen a more signiﬁcant increase than the mid single digit, so I talked about
for car insurance increases in prices. And so we regard that -- given that we don't need to
apply the sorts of increases in home, we regard home as they continue good growth
opportunity for us.

Our next question comes from Blair Stewart with Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Hi, guys. It's Blair here from BoA. Just on the Hastings aspect, on the motor -- sorry, on the
home side, I just wonder sort of how the brand name is translating into the home market
since you have some nice early success obviously from a low base, but just wonder what's
the strategy was from here in terms of plugging away at that market just using the same
distribution channels, et cetera, and particularly just how the brand is resonating would
be interesting.
Second question, Torbjorn, you made an interesting comment about pricing in the
Nordics and not crying wolf on inﬂation, which I thought was quite amusing. So I guess I
wonder what diﬀerence you're seeing in inﬂation that perhaps others are seeing or not?
And I guess an extension of that, as interest rates go up, what impact do you see that
having on pricing, if any? And then maybe just a couple comebacks, really, I don't know
you I think you said the 170% to 190% reﬂecting the balance sheet with Nordea clearly a
very diﬀerent balance sheet without Nordea, so I'm hoping that you will revisit that 170%
to 190%. And Torbjorn, I might have this wrong, but I think the transcript to the Q3 says
that your shareholders, I don't see value in TOP. I guess the diﬀerence between buying
TOP in the market and doing something else is that if you do something else you have to
pay a premium, so I guess that's the missing link, right. Is that somebody just start paying
your premium, it doesn't make much sense. Thank you.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

And Toby?

A - Toby van der Meer

{BIO 16628969 <GO>}

So the Hastings brand is working well in Hub insurance. So because of the distribution
channel, we favor price comparison websites, it's mainly about price product features,

FINAL

those sorts of things. And -- but the brand is helpful. And so what we're focused on is all
the boring but ultimately fascinating for us at work to build pricing sophistication, build
claims sophistication, build our data assets, build our internal teams and then doing so
build a larger and very proﬁtable home book over the next, say, three to ﬁve years. And
so we're very pleased with progress with the capability builds going well for good
momentum. Market conditions look like they might be favorable as a result of chip [ph].
So we're feeling good about the long-term opportunity to build that sort of business.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

And Toby, so are you able to leverage any of that expertise from your colleagues at
Sampo?

A - Toby van der Meer

{BIO 16628969 <GO>}

Yes, we've got great capabilities in our U.K. car insurance business that we can, of course,
leverage, but we haven't done much home in the past. And the If team, in particular, of
course have been doing home insurance at very large scale, lots of experience with
ﬂooding homes, with freezing homes, with pipes, claims management and pricing. And
so we are working as part of our collaboration eﬀorts to understand which bits of that are
transferable in both directions, but I suppose for Hub insurance mainly, If expertise that
we might be able to take advantage of.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

And then on claims inﬂation in the Nordics, Blair, just to put things in perspective, it is, for
instance, much lower now than in 2018-2019. Average claims inﬂation now is three-point
low ﬁgure. And motor is a bit higher than property because property -- the spike in
property claims inﬂation in the summer faded quite quickly. So as pointed out many
times, claims inﬂation is a very diﬀerent animal than consumer price inﬂation. Having said
that, it is one of the most important parameters to follow, so we do just that.

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

And Blair on your ﬁnal -- I don't know if it was a question actually or just a wish, but I think
it's important to return frequently to two important questions or comments. Regarding
our solvency framework, rest assure that we are working on and we'll continue to work, to
make our capital consumption as suﬃcient as possible. Now, when we talk about the
ratios and ratios in the range, capital management framework, that's one thing. The other
thing that is possible to work on is, of course, the nominal SCR requirement as such and
an example of being able to work and that could be that we over time could take beneﬁt
of some of the internal models, which we already have in the group, which is not the part
of our capital management framework currently on a consolidated basis.
Then we will, also I am sure, revisit the stresses we use on a lower SCR consumption and
see if the ratio as such, given those stresses and that makes sense at any point in time.

Right now, they make sense and the day after we have sold the rest of our Nordea shares,
it will always also makes sense, but we will continue to work on the capital eﬃciency to
increase the return on capital very hard as the non-life group going forward.

Our next question comes from Jan Erik Gjerland with ABG. Please go ahead.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Hey, good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. The ﬁrst one is on solvency.
Could you just remind us about how Nordea is not treated the entire 185% solvency ratio?
Is it sort of what that level [ph] is included and what is not included as of today?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Hello, Jan Erik. If I understand your question, it's more of the technical treatment or is it
how much we own in terms of some risk exposure, but it's a technical treatment. It's an
equity investment in our solvency framework and we own 6.24% on Nordea or so. It's
increasing a bit because of their share buyback shy of 250 million share. So you basically
take whatever market price you have from Nordea from time to time, you multiply by our
number of shares, you get to an equity exposure, you multiply that by 39% adjusted for
the symmetric adjustment and then your posted into our standard model and take
correlations on that.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay, so it's in that respect. When it comes to TOP, when would you need to sort of bit for
the whole company when the threshold is above 50% for capital or voting rights or what
kind of mandatory oﬀer? When do you really need to do a mandatory oﬀer and at what
price would that be recognized?

A - Morten Thorsrud

Should I take that Torbjorn or --

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Go ahead.

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

We have -- I mean, it's a long time, I know, but we actually have made a bid for
Topdanmark, a mandatory bid through sort of in 2017. So that's done meaning that there
are no requirements in terms of us placing a bid at any level of ownership in TOP going
forward.

That's a hypothetical question, but the answer is yes.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

Then on the Hastings level, could you give any insight to the quota share which you have
started the year with in Hastings?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

In what way (inaudible) it was a quota share of 50 points before and --

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

75% [ph] in the past.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Sorry I missed that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

We understood it was around 75% in the past. We understand that it come oﬀ, the quota
share agreement with the reinsurance companies.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

It's down from 50% to 35% and it's no big changes to the panel, no drama, no gradual
change.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. Finally, then is the IT system in Topdanmark equal to what you have today in If P&C
or is it totally diﬀerent? I mean, what is the renewal of the IT system in TOP is not really
being renewed? If you talk the diﬀerence on what you have in If today.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Yeah, I guess, in the IT system in any insurance company is diﬀerent as such. Of course,
when it comes to the things that you have to build for the future, in particular, digital
solutions, of course, there you could have similarities, but digital solutions, of course,
there you could have similarities, but the system is as such, of course, they are diﬀerent.

ahead.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Yes, thank you and good afternoon. A couple of questions from my side. First on Hastings,
can you give us a number of what your net cost was for reinsurance in '21 and how biggest
this insurance program is insourced in '22?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

It's -- I mean, Toby, you can think about what you want to say, but it was a quota share Per,
so 50% of premiums, 50% of claims for 50% quota share and then there is a commission
that we wouldn't reveal.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

And what we could basically get when Hastings was independent list is lifted from their
numbers, this could give us a pretty good impression of what the upside is from
(inaudible) and potentially could -- I guess, there is no reason, for example, to buy any
reinsurance at all for carving and diversify their multiple.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

You are an optimist as always Per. The commission varies year-on-year, so -- but we'll be as
helpful as we can as always.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. My second question Mandatum --

A - Toby van der Meer

{BIO 16628969 <GO>}

And if I may just add there -- sorry, Per, to interrupt you, but in one of the slides in the
investor deck and also one of the slides that all going to had initially, we talk about the
beneﬁt of reducing that quota share from 50% to 35%. This debt we know we're taking
which is a minimum EUR6. And the reason why we say a minimum, it depends a bit of
Page 14 of 22



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2022-02-09

course. It can be more depending on the proﬁtability of the book, which otherwise would
have been ceded and growth in the business going forward, but the step we took now 1st
of January already gives us a minimum of EUR6 in beneﬁt.

FINAL

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay, perfect. And there was something I had missed. On Mandatum, you now provision
for T plus 5. Previously, you only provisioned of T plus 3, what should we expect to do
going forward or will this still be at the heart that you provision when you basically have
that modiﬁed? I was talking about the low interest rates.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Knut, do you have a good answer for this?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Yeah. Now, you're correct. We sort of extend the time period if you like. Not sure I thought
about it like that. It's more that I want to do even more discount rate reserves. And the
reason for that to be blunt is that we have now positioned Mandatum well in terms of
neutralizing equity eﬀect translating into IFRS 17. So with the strong increase of EUR130
million in discount rate reserve during 2021, Mandatum is well prepared for the new
accounting regime next year. Obviously, depending on interest rate development during
this year, but based on how the world looks at the end of '21?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. Finally, I will address Topdanmark, now let's see whether you want to question or to
answer my impressive question. If I look at your positioning in Topdanmark ﬁve-six years
ago, I was talking about considering that the Topdanmark share was too expensive. When
we looked at it from the outside, the market basically paid materially more for your P&C
earnings than they did for the P&C earnings of Topdanmark. Now it's the other way
around and you have started to buy Topdanmark shares. What am I missing in this picture,
if anything? It's always more fun to buy (Multiple Speakers) fewer than myself than buying
some that is more expensive than myself.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

First of all, the diﬀerence isn't that much and you have to be really careful when you
calculate things. And secondly, that was sometime ago that were other deliberations at
this stage, I don't think that's going to be helpful to try to go back with those? And I don't
have any further comments to it. We think that Topdanmark is priced in parallel with the
rest of the Nordic and P&C markets. We were able to increase our holding a little bit -- a
tiny bit at market prices so that make sense to us. When you saying more or less, I mean
it's actually -- it's roughly the same.

A - Toby van der Meer

{BIO 16628969 <GO>}

And also just to add Torbjorn if I may. Of course, these blocks we bought, they were
supply base, they were oﬀered to our assets at what we can say there was an ACR price,
we didn't run around looking for them.

Q - Marcus Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I've got a very debt speciﬁc
question for you please. So just going back to slide 12 of your deck, you update us on the
progress you've made with capital synergy beneﬁt so far through reinsurance. There is a
EUR9 million gap to go. And very neatly, the cost of the Hastings debt outstanding would
ﬁll that EUR9 million gap. Just trying to understand why you're not looking to harvest that
synergy beneﬁt immediately? Unfortunately, the maturity to the bond life beyond the sort
of period that you set yourself to harvest all of those synergies, when I look at the group,
you've got no major debt maturities in '22, that would be a diversion for liquidity. It would
appear yes as an upfront cost to take that out, but then immediately you can start
generating synergies through the lower interest cost going forward. So could you just
help me understand exactly your thinking around that and your time about when you
might look to I'd say harvest those synergies?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Knut?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Good afternoon, Marcus. We're well aware on some of the numbers you initially
mentioned and it is, of course, meaningful to think about the Hastings debt as a part of
our capital management synergies from Hastings absolutely. But we monitor the cost of
debt management activities across the diﬀerent balance sheets and outstanding bonds
we have all the time. And if opportunities should arise, where we ﬁnd that attractive to
exercise such opportunities, we will do in line with also the question I answered earlier
where we have set aside the liquidity to do so, to make sure we are below 30% leverage
when we sort of have no Nordea on our balance sheet. And Hastings, that Hastings says
as a senior debt, there is some scope of the bonds we are continuously monitoring and
looking at.

I appreciate that. But as I say, it's just -- I sort of had an alternative route to you ﬁnding
EUR9 million of capital management synergies from Hastings as you sort of described on
that slide 12. And just wondering what would change to make you decide now is the time
to take that debt out?

FINAL

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Yeah, I mean, it's always interesting to see how debt trade some -- how -- higher interest
rates -- how interest rate moves. Obviously, when rates go higher, the ability to do liability
management exercises could be even more attractive, right. So it's an assessment of how
we see certain factors -- relevant factors developing going forward.

Q - Marcus Rivaldi

Okay, very good. Sorry, I was probably muted. On the dividend side, you -- last autumn
you sort of said you should be patient to see dividends from selling Nordea coming
through as an ordinary dividend than the special one. Would you consider adding special
dividend prior to the AGM in 2023 them? Or should we await another sort of a year
before we see special dividend coming through as your buyback mandates? I'm not
allowing you to sort of distribute capital fast enough, I would say, versus the amount of
Nordea would create? How should we think about this special dividend opportunities
once more?

That's greedy Jan Erik asking. I guess, we've just announced that we will prolong the
buyback program. We want to have a balance between buybacks. So our owners have
indicated that they want to balance between buybacks and dividends and we normally
have a dividend -- an annual dividend. And that's all normally and that's around

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. Just a question on If underlying combined ratio if we can go back to that. So,
Morten, you mentioned before that you were pricing above inﬂation in all the segments, I
believe, but still the Q4 underlying combined ratio and by underlying, I mean with what
we can adjust for and what you give us on large claims, run-oﬀ gains, COVID and the
weather. And it was still an extremely low level compared to the prior two years Q4. How
would you say of having all the numbers? Is this a normalized run rate at where we are
currently or is it even more to go down next year given the above inﬂation pricing or is
this too good to extrapolate?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Morten, of course.

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Yeah. No, of course, you're right, it's a very strong sort of underlying performance in the
business and it's a strong performance in all the segments and all countries. Of course,
you need to sort of -- as you pointed out yourself, sort of you need to factor in all of their
elements that are changing obviously with COVID sort of being one element that is now, I
guess, we all would say hopefully disappearing. And then of course it's a quite a bit of
uncertainty about what's the new normal that we return to them, sort of our comparison
ﬁgures now are already quite old. But indeed, there is a strong underlying proﬁtability in
the business I think that's there and we think to conclude from that.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay, fair enough. Thank you.

A - Sami Taipalus

the full year where there is no segment where we're not able to increase rates in tandem
with the claims inﬂation and we're actually growing on the back of digitalization in general
and more rational markets. So yes, this is -- this question is the core of what we're doing at
the moment.

FINAL

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Would you say maybe even that all this M&A we have seen in the Nordics have made it

the one space with integrating M&A or hasn't that happened yet?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

That remains to be seen how our competitors peers behave. But in theory, you're

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

We can hear you.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Yes, hi, I just want to ask how -- what is the process and how long would it take to get
approval for a group partial internal model presumably given the If already has been in
place, deposits won't be so time consuming. And I was just wondering if the process is
already underway. Thank you.

A - Toby van der Meer

{BIO 16628969 <GO>}

Good afternoon. To be clear, we have not applied for a group internal model in terms of
considering how to use the internal models also on a group-wide basis that is, of course,
something we naturally are thinking about as a part of our considerations around capital
management, but no formal process have been initiated. And if we apply for internal
model or go into any pre-approval process on the group wide basis, I would need to
revert to a timetable that is diﬃcult to sort of pick from the shell, if I say it takes exactly this
loan. But it's -- you shouldn't expect it to be a very short process despite the fact that we
have internal models within the group. But, of course, given the fact that it is very diﬀerent
Page 19 of 22

to apply for an internal model that has been used for ﬁve years compared to what it was in
2016 when no internal models had ever been used. There could potentially also be
possibilities to not make this as very long process. But we're a big group. Our internal
models consists of enormous amount of documentation which needs to be reviewed, et
cetera. So we have to be respectful for the fact that that is good and hypothetic and take
some time.

Yes, thank you. Two questions from me. So ﬁrst on the Baltics, obviously, I mean we're
observing strong growth there. So if you can give us an update of what is going on, I
mean, what is the outlook, what is driving this growth? And the second question if it's
possible to have an update on that portfolio of small investment you have like Nordax
Bank, Saxo Bank, et cetera? Thank you.

Morten, Baltic rim and digitalization.

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Yeah, I'll start with the Baltics. It's a very strong performance for us indeed in the Baltics
both when it comes to proﬁtability. But, of course, as you point that indeed when it also
come to growth. It's both price driven and increase in number of customers, I think
reﬂecting an extremely strong operating model that we have, a very modern operating
model and more than distribution platform that we have in the Baltics, which means that
we have been gaining market shares throughout the Baltics in 2021. So absolutely good
development and it really in all three markets for us in the Baltics.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

And then on the PE portfolio, we don't normally -- we don't run it or sales to individual
companies, so we don't normally comment that much, but Knut this time we have both
the dividends and accounting eﬀects, maybe you would like to touch on those.

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Sure, I can do that. In terms of Nordax, I'm sure many of you are aware that Nordax closed
the acquisition of Bank Norwegian in Q4, that gave us an accounting proﬁt of EUR84
million which is included in our holding segment in the fourth quarter. Then there is also
what we call an extraordinary item, but it's still, of course, is a positive in terms of the
valuation on Nordax. We didn't participate in Nordax funding. We didn't put in additional

Page 20 of 22



FINAL

capital in Nordax to fund their Bank Norwegian acquisitions, but we got new co-investors,
additional co-investors in Nordax and they came in to Nordax at higher valuation than our
book value and we were diluted, but that gave us a positive dilution eﬀect because of this
valuation diﬀerence also on EUR84 million, but it's not the same number. So, in total, we
have made in the fourth quarter EUR168 million, which actually is a part of our fourth
quarter reported proﬁt. Saxo, but you wanted me to talk about dividend, we -- Saxo is
returning cash to its investors as dividend. It's a smaller part, of course, compared to the
good value of Saxo, but it's contributed in 2021 to a part of the holding segment
proﬁtability and we received dividend of somewhat about EUR20 million.

ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thanks, guys. Two quick ones. I mean, we didn't quite get to the -- get around to
answering one of my questions last time. Just on the potential impact of higher interest
rates on underwriting, do you expect that weaken underwriting resolving in anyway. I
know we're still at very low levels, but if rates continue to pick up. And secondly, Torbjorn,
you talked earlier about when Jan Erik was being greedy, you talked about extending the
buyback. Sorry, basic question, just remind us where we are with the buyback. I think
you've done a bit EUR530 million without thinking about possible future proceeds, et
cetera, is that buyback going to run to about EUR750 million, is that -- am I right in
thinking that or is - of if I got these numbers wrong? Thank you.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

The answer to the second question is yes. And forgive me for missing your ﬁrst question,
you're right, we didn't -- I didn't get to answering that potentially impact of increasing
interest rates. Yeah, it's a very hypothetical question. We're all expecting interest rates to
go up one day or another. And if that was signiﬁcant, I think that the most of the large
companies in the Nordics have ROE targets or something similar underpinning their
behavior. Otherwise, I would be saying that for instance we would soon be aiming for an
ROE of in excess of 40% and I'm not saying that. We are not -- we will not price for that.
So signiﬁcantly increased interest rates may well aﬀect the combined ratios, but that's not
where we are at all. And I said -- and that's why I said in my introduction that we are not
counting on increased interest rates in ROE rate setting at all at the moment, that doesn't
enter into it. Let's see what happens in the world and we've been waiting for this for a
long time and speculated about it before.

And just to add on to that, of course, an increased interest rate would, of course, give us
an accounting -- positive accounting eﬀect on the underwriting side than the discount on
reserves just as the reduction in interest rate has given us negative eﬀects over the last
few years. So, of course, that comes automatically.
