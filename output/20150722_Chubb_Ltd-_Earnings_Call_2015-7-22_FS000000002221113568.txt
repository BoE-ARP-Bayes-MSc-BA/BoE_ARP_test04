Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning. ACE produced excellent second quarter results with earnings per share
essentially flat with prior year. Earnings and revenue growth were strong in spite of foreign
exchange and market conditions that are growing more competitive. After-tax operating
income for the quarter was $788 million or $2.40 per share. Our annualized operating
return on equity was 11.4%, a good return on shareholder capital.
Underwriting results in the quarter were excellent. We produced $478 million of total P&C
underwriting income, flat with prior year and up 5.5% on a constant dollar basis. The P&C
combined ratio was 87.7%, and the P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding
cat losses was 88.4% versus 88.7% prior year. Cat losses were up relative to prior by $44
million pre-tax, as a result of increased cat activity around the world, and positive priorperiod reserve development was up modestly as well. All divisions produced outstanding
calendar year and current accident year results in the quarter.
This was the first quarter that included the contributions of the Fireman's Fund U.S. highnet-worth business which contributed to both revenue and earnings, including a $15 million
non-recurring benefit to operating income.
On the other hand, foreign exchange negatively impacted operating income by $29
million. We produced $562 million investment income, up 3% in constant dollars. This is a
very good result given the interest rate environment and speaks to our strong cash flow.
Book value per share growth was flat in the quarter, affected by the impact of a rise in
interest rates on our corporate bond portfolio. Frankly, if sustainable, I view this as a
positive. The mark-to-market hit is simply a question of timing since we are essentially a
buy-and-hold bond investor, while higher rates mean greater investment income over
time.
Phil will have more to say about the impact of Fireman's Fund on revenue and earnings,
our investment portfolio, prior year's reserve development and cat losses.

FINAL

The big news in the quarter, obviously, was our announced agreement to acquire Chubb.
And I must tell you, I am even more excited and convinced of the potential opportunity
and the fit in terms of talent and complementary capabilities. The senior leadership of
both companies met for two-and-a-half days last week for integration planning purposes
and the chemistry, the optimism, the energy, and the earnestness to succeed couldn't
have been better. I'm awfully impressed by the Chubb leadership my colleagues and I
met. They are peers.
We are moving quickly. We have initiated the process for teams to be engaged on
integration planning that covers all businesses and functional areas of both companies.
We are planning to file an S-4 by the end of the month. And following that, we'll each set
the date for shareholders' votes, which should occur somewhere between the end of
September and the end of October. We're preparing to file for regulatory approvals. And
as we said, we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2016.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to revenue growth. Global P&C net premiums, excluding agriculture, grew about
6.5% in the quarter or over 13% on a constant dollar basis. The assumption of the
unearned premium from the in-force Fireman's Fund portfolio contributed about 6.5% to
this growth, and it is nonrecurring. Once again, we expect global P&C premium revenue
growth on a published basis for the balance of the year, will be mid-single-digit in spite of
foreign exchange.
In North America, net premiums for P&C excluding crop and the nonrecurring premiums
from the Fireman's Fund transaction grew 6% in constant dollars. In both our large
commercial business, ACE USA and in ACE Westchester E&S, net premiums declined
about 4%. There were some one-time items in 2014 that distorted second quarter
growth. And as such, we expect premium growth in our U.S. commercial business to
improve for the balance of the year. We grew over 20% in ACE Commercial Risk Services
which serves small to mid-market clients.
Turning to our international operations, P&C net premiums in ACE International were up
over 11% in constant dollars. Latin America and Asia had strong growth with net premiums
up 25% and 14%, respectively, while premiums in Europe were down 1%. In our Londonbased E&S business, premiums were down 16% as we shed (7:23) business in an
increasingly competitive London wholesale market.
In our A&H insurance business, net premiums were up over 4% globally in constant
currency. A&H premiums internationally were up about 5%, led by Asia with growth of 17%.
Premiums for combined insurance were up about 3.5% with our North American business
up nearly 6%.
Net premiums for personal lines globally excluding the non-recurring premium from
Fireman's Fund were up 46%. Our Asia-focused international life insurance business had a
good quarter with net premiums up 7.5% in constant currency. And finally, in our Global Re
business, net premiums declined 6% due to market conditions.

FINAL

I want to now say a few more words about current commercial P&C insurance market
conditions. The underwriting environment continued to soften in the quarter for our
commercial P&C business globally. As I've been saying, the underlying pattern we have
seen over the last few quarters is that large account business is more competitive than
mid-sized. Wholesale is more competitive than retail, and property more so than casualty
related.
Taking our U.S. commercial P&C business by its components and starting with our large
and upper middle market retail business, ACE USA general and specialty casualty related
pricing was up 2% in the quarter and varied by line. For example, large account risk
management-related casualty pricing was up less than 1%. Excess casualty was up about
2.5%, foreign casualty pricing was up 0.5% and management and professional liability
pricing was flat. Property-related pricing was down 10%, a steeper decline from prior
quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

New business activity slowed as expected and renewal retention levels are good. Both
reflect market conditions and our underwriting discipline. We will not chase underpriced
business. For our U.S. retail business, the renewal retention rate as measured by premium
was 89%.
Turning to our U.S. E&S business, casualty rates were up less than 1% in the quarter;
professional lines was up 2%; while property was down about 10%. Internationally,
commercial P&C insurance market conditions also grew more competitive. Again, for the
business we wrote, casualty rates were down 2%; property was down 7%; and financial
lines were down 4%. Rates in both Asia and Latin America, overall, were down 7% led by
property, while rates on the Continent and the UK were down 2%. In our London market
E&S business, rates were down 8% in the quarter.
For our commercial P&C business, we are ameliorating the impact of pricing on our
combined ratio through a combination of mix shift, targeting classes with better margin,
portfolio management that informs underwriting actions, including tighter individual risk
selection and pricing actions in more stressed areas, as well as better marketing and new
product innovation.
As you know, personal lines, small commercial, and A&H are about 40% of ACE's
business. And for these lines, rates were flat to up mid-single-digit, depending on
portfolio and territory. John Keogh, John Lupica and Juan Andrade can provide further
color on market conditions and pricing trends.
In summary, we produced good results this quarter despite the strong dollar. As you can
see, given our breadth of product, customer segment, distribution and territory, we
continue to capitalize on areas that represent attractive opportunities to grow profitably.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil and then we'll come back and take your questions.

FINAL

Thanks, Evan. Book value per share grew 0.5% through the quarter and 1.4% for the year.
Book value growth for the quarter was adversely impacted by rising interest rates, which
resulted in realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio of $602 million after
tax.
These losses were partially offset by favorable foreign currency movements of $103
million after tax and realized gains of $102 million after tax related to our variable annuity
reinsurance business. Tangible book value per share declined 1.5% for the quarter and
increased 0.3% for the year.
In addition to net realized and unrealized losses and favorable FX for the quarter, tangible
book value per share was negatively impacted by goodwill and intangibles related to the
Fireman's Fund acquisition. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, tangible book value
per share increased 0.5% for the quarter and 2.3% for the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

We had strong operating cash flow of $816 million that benefited net investment income.
Investment income of $562 million, which was impacted negatively by $11 million of foreign
exchange versus prior year, was better than expected due to higher private equity
distributions and call activity in our corporate bond portfolio.
Our strong cash flow will continue to benefit our estimated quarterly investment income
run rate of $550 million even with current new money rates of 2.9% versus our current
book yield of 3.6%. The estimated investment income run rate is subject to variability and
portfolio rates, call activity, private equity distributions and foreign exchange. Our net loss
reserves were up about $100 million for the quarter after adjusting for foreign exchange
and the Fireman's Fund acquisition. The pay-to-incurred ratio was 94%.
In the quarter, we had net positive prior-period development of $153 million pre-tax.
Approximately half from long-tail lines principally from 2010 and prior years, the remainder
was from short-tail lines.
Cat losses were $106 million after tax in the quarter, primarily from a number of U.S.
weather events, hailstorms in Australia and floods in Chile. North American P&C net
premiums written included $252 million from the transfer of the Fireman's Fund's business
in-force at the time of the transaction.
Underwriting income included $50 million from Fireman's Fund that will be nonrecurring in
2016. This amount is the result of eliminating the deferred acquisition cost, or DAC,
associated with the Fireman's Fund's business at the time of the close as part of purchase
accounting. Future amortization of the DAC is also eliminated. The North American current
accident year combined ration excluding cats and the non-recurring underwriting benefit
from Fireman's Fund was 87.9% compared with 87.3% last year.
The non-recurring underwriting benefit from Fireman's Fund was partially offset by
purchase accounting intangible amortization included in other income of $29 million. This
produced a nonrecurring net operating income benefit from the in-force business, as
Evan noted, of $15 million.

Total capital returned to shareholders during the quarter was $610 million, including $390
million of share repurchases and $220 million in dividends. The company has discontinued
its share repurchase program in connection with the announced planned acquisition of
Chubb.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We'll go first to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Evan, I just have one question. You mentioned you guys just came back from meeting with
Chubb management for a couple days. As far as Chubb as business, I mean, obviously,
the expense ratio there is higher, certainly, a different brand presence in personal lines.
How do you balance maintaining that brand with talking about expense synergies and
looking to optimize on that front? Thanks.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yeah, Michael, good question. Expense synergies aren't about in some blind way simply
trying to get every dollar of efficiency in a sterile view out of it. Chubb, as ACE does, each
have virtues to their model and their franchise as to how they operate. The core of Chubb
is an agency franchise and a smaller customer segment, more work-intensive, very local.
The service model, very high-quality local service in both underwriting and in claims. We've
very mindful of all of that.
And so, when you look at it, and when you take that, you can't also say, well, service is
simply a mindless word for a shield against inefficiency. There's a tremendous duplication
of expenses between the two companies in functions where you don't need two of
everything. And that varies by geography, that varies by function, that varies by business.
And we didn't use just some arbitrary rule of thumb when we came to our target number
of $650 million. It's a conservative thoughtful estimate. We went function by function,
geography by geography. We've done many acquisitions before.
And I don't mind telling you that we actually came up with an even higher number. But
being mindful that we're going to balance culture, we're going to balance service and
quality and what the franchise is about with a competitive profile of the combined
companies that necessarily will operate efficiently. All of that together mixes to how we've
arrived at what we think is a thoughtful target.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

FINAL

Great. Thanks. And then, Phil, I guess one follow-up on – just a numbers question. Looking
at the expense ratio in North America was a little bit lower in the quarter and then looks as
if there was some noise in ag. Was there anything unusual in the quarter? And I'm
guessing, I wonder if some of the Fireman's Fund adjustments went through as a contract
expense potentially? Maybe some color on that. Thanks.

A - Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

With respect to agriculture, I think, Evan said a few quarters ago that we'd expect the
combined ratio of about 91%, and we're close to that. We have changed a little bit of
timing of the recognition of our premium as it relates to – of the premium recognition as it
relates to the government program. And we've made some additional investments in our
non-MPCI P&C agriculture business. So, I would say, nothing significant.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And then do you have an underlying ex-Fireman's Fund adjustment, like just
so we can kind of square that away for the quarter?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

When you say under, do you mean – what do you...

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Extra $49 million – yeah. So, yeah the $49 million, obviously, you have the goodwill in there
as well. But just to make sure, it seemed like about 130 basis points, is that how we
should...

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

We gave you an 87.9% ex-cat current accident year combined ratio versus last year of
87.2%...

A - Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

Right.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

...with North America P&C does that – and so that's eliminating that onetime...

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Oh that is. Okay.

{BIO 2078659 <GO>}

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Hey. Sorry about that. So, I just wanted to ask on the Chubb international business. I think
there's three or four bill of premium there. And I was just hoping maybe for some detail
Page 8 of 27



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2015-07-22

on how ACE thinks they may be able to leverage its own international business and
maybe improve the profitability there, because I think it's been somewhat of an under
earner in the past relative at least to their broader personal lines.

FINAL

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yeah. As I'm sure you know, a minority percentage of that business is personal lines
actually, and it's more commercial lines and specialty, some large account, but quite
middle-market-oriented. And Chubb has an old network and has been at it for a long
time.
There will be a lot of efficiency we will gain between the two operations because they are
a duplication. Our plan is to integrate Chubb's international business into ACE's. So, we
will have only one statutory entity in the geographies and the vast, vast majority of those
will be ACE entities. Canada is an exception. We will integrate ACE into Chubb up in
Canada.

Bloomberg Transcript

There are many good people in Chubb's international operation, and so along with that
business, there is a marginal cost. You got to be able to service that business, and you've
got to be able to underwrite it, you got insight into distribution of it, and there are a lot of
good people who are going to bring a lot of value to ACE's international operation along
with that business. As I said, it's marginal cost and we will, at the same time, eliminate
duplication of cost and function across geographies.
In particular, what we see and we can see it by specific geographies is there is real
opportunity internationally given what they have built in middle-market in particular in
certain territories to take advantage of that and add meaningfully to product, add
meaningfully to the leverage of some of that talent to help in some other tangential
territories that are around the countries where that talent resides now. I hope that helps
you with it.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Yeah. That's helpful, Evan. Thanks. And then I guess my follow up is just on U.S. personal
lines and just trying to understand, obviously ACE and Chubb have different products and
how do we think about with the two entities coming together, are we going to see just
Chubb's product or is there a place for both products? And then a broader question I
guess is, what's been the reaction so far from independent agents in personal lines given
two of the biggest high-net-worth providers announced the combination?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I think around the – you can't see my colleagues shaking their heads around the room.
We're puzzled by the question, by the comment with all due respect of different product,
they're substantially the same product. We're both covering the needs of a high-networth customer. Each of us may have a slightly different risk appetite, depending on
cohort of customer. ACE may have been focused a little more on international. Chubb has
capabilities and product that is very old and very deep. And so, frankly, we actually see the
product integration as very complementary and quite comfortable.

FINAL

For agents and brokers, they want to know that we're going to behave in a similar way.
They want to know that we're going to covet Chubb's claims capability and service, which
is simply renowned. And I can guarantee you we're going to do that, and they'll be
leading those efforts.
And so, frankly, we think for agents, it brings them a superior ultimate offering. Agents
want to know that we're going to maintain compensation structures and that, by the way,
that we're going to keep the agency, the independent agency system as a centerpiece of
distribution here to the customers. And we're being loud and clear that that is without a
doubt. And so, I think in this case, it's good news for agents and for brokers and for
customers.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And by the way, the two of us, on one hand, may appear significant in that business. On
the other hand, it depends on how you define the business. The cohort of high-net-worth
personal lines potential customers in our own estimation is north of $40 billion. And it
resides on the books of so many traditional personal lines carriers around the United
States. And our objective is to identify those customers and make them aware of our
offerings and give them product that's more appropriate to their needs for many of them
than what they have today.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Okay. And from the product standpoint, just wanted to confirm, broadly speaking, there's
not a big difference in price point of what ACE was offering in Chubb. I guess that's more
of what I was getting at.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

You know, Ryan, that really varies. That varies by state, by company that is writing, by
vintage of policyholder. And as you know, there's tier pricing that is employed that allows
you to more finely risk rate the business. And I think that's where a lot of that noise that
you might see from the outside arises. But clear-eyed and thoughtful underwriters in
portfolio management know how to rationalize that, and it's not as chaotic as you might
imagine from the outside at all.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Thanks a lot, Evan.

Q - Charles J. Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

I had a question on the growth strategy with you and Chubb. And I guess on the product
line, I was wondering if you could give, not on the personal, but on the small commercial
middle-market, which products you really see as being the best positioned for you to be
able to introduce to the Chubb distribution? Where do you think the strength – you guys
obviously have a very broad product offering on the commercial side, where do you see
the most natural early fits for the growth plan going forward?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Charles, we're – on one hand, some of it is a little premature. I'm going to give you a
general feel. Some of it is a little premature. And we also have plenty of competitors who
listen to the phone calls. We're hardly going to hand a roadmap to everybody. But you can
imagine, Chubb does a great job in traditional middle market products and some
specialty products and towards industry verticals that they are such a deep knowledge of
and are great at.
On the other hand, imagine the products that ACE sells, everything from environmental
liability to farm and ranch to product recall to construction. And we could go on and on
with a lot of product that will enhance the offerings to those verticals and also might help
to expand into a few others as we go along. That's middle market, and that is distinct
from small commercial, which we have each been – have sort of nascent efforts towards
that we will endeavor to pursue in a far more meaningful way. And I think that'll present
substantial opportunity.

At the same time, I don't mind telling you, while we have product synergies that we
imagined around the world, whether it is cross-selling, which we're not Pollyannaish about
cross-selling, whether it is new product or new customer cohort, we also imagined
revenue dis-synergy in the early years where we have overlap and duplication, where
some agents may or brokers may think overconcentration in an area, in a line of business,
in a customer, et cetera. And any of our projections also recognize those. There's puts
and calls in the early two or three years between dis-synergies and synergies. Revenue
synergies we imagine will appear in a real way by year three and year four, meaningful;
year five, substantial.

Q - Charles J. Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Do you guys need to put on more people for the middle market product offering into that

A - Evan G. Greenberg

We will go next to Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

I wanted to follow-up on the Chubb acquisition on the double-digit earnings accretion. So
what is the net assumption for net revenue synergies? And where do you think there
could be upside? Could you buy less reinsurance? Could you put in some internal quota
shares to reduce the tax rate or reinvest the big portfolio?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Sarah, we're not going into that detail of specifics of the sources of earnings accretion
and how much is coming from revenue and how much is coming from expense. And we're
Page 12 of 27

certainly not going into details about reinsurance. That is actually a competitive secret that
we're not going into.

FINAL

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Okay. Fair enough. And then I'd be interested in getting your broader thoughts on industry
consolidation. What inning do you think we're in, in this consolidation wave? And do you
think you'll see more large primary insurers respond to your Chubb acquisition with big
deals?

Well, I've got a pretty full plate and I'm pretty absorbed in all the things around ACE and
around Chubb. I don't know what my competitors are imagining or doing at the moment. I
don't know what inning we're in. I can't really opine on that. I imagine there will be more
acquisition.

Bloomberg Transcript

I've been reading lately that there'll be more large acquisitions because of the ACE and
Chubb. When I think about it, I'm not sure that's right. I can't speak with any certainty. But
first of all, most of my or many of my competitors are very thoughtful and they're good
operators and they're good stewards. They attempt to be good stewards of shareholder
money and they have a good sense of strategy for their companies.
Anybody who thinks that way, first of all, is going to look at an acquisition not from the
point of view of size. They're going to look at the intrinsic value due to the characteristics
of that to be acquired hold and whether it is truly value-creating in a transformative way.
Otherwise you don't do something large.
ACE-Chubb is a very unique opportunity and we took advantage of that opportunity. And I
believe my Chubb colleagues, who are aware of the insights behind it, feel the same way
about that opportunity. And so when others are thinking about transformative, well,
they've got to imagine it's not simply about size. What does it bring to you? And there are
too many obvious combinations when you think that way.

FINAL

Good morning. Thank you. First question, Evan, you commented on the pricing details.
Thank you so much for the details. But the pricing looks more competitive especially on
large accounts, property and wholesale. Some of your industry peers opined that the
market now is more disciplined in terms of better data analytics and the still low interest
rate environment. So just wondering what's your take on that and do you believe the
competitiveness (38:05) of the pricing will get any worse from here? And what's that do
with your underwriting margin going forward?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Kai, first of all, yes, I think that pricing is going to become more competitive from here.
And I think, ultimately – listen, that gets reflected in margins, and there's no two ways
about that. I described to you and have many times the levers we have to pull in
ameliorating that margin impact. 40% of our business is probably not subject to cycle, not
nearly the same way, and we have a lot of portfolio management and underwriting
discipline in site and product mix and territory mix. It allows us to ameliorate. But you don't
eliminate it. And it will have an impact on margins in due course ongoing here.

Bloomberg Transcript

Number two, I think the question about cycle management and data and all of that, I think
you can't paint it with a broad brush. And I think those who do, they're overly simplistic in
either how they think or certainly in how they describe. Certain areas of the business
where you have broad distribution reach to get the customer where you have more
homogenous pools of risk, lower severity-related, higher frequency-related, I think that is
where there is a bit more discipline at least at this time. So, you'd say, more smaller
commercial, more middle-market commercial. I think that is less subject, though, hardly
immune on one hand.
I think as you get up to upper-middle market, larger risk, I think you'll have a lot of players
with a lot less data. People are buying much bigger limits. So you have a lot piling on to
the same risk who just have capital and an underwriter and a dog and are chasing some
volume. And there I don't see that same sort of, well, the insights of analytics will
ameliorate a market cycle.

Q - Kai Pan

dynamic and open and free-market-oriented and messy, therefore, than you can fit in 10
easy-to-say words.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's great. Second question is switching to Banco Itaú's P&C business. Just wondering
whether the progress of the integration over there is related to in particular the economy
in Brazil as well as any potential claims from the Petrobras investigation.

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

In a word, it's going very well, Itaú. And I'm going to let John Keogh embellish on that.

FINAL

A - John W. Keogh

{BIO 2104739 <GO>}

Sure. Yes, I'll pick up first the integration piece of it. It's currently on plan and on trajectory
to bring the two organizations together by end of the year. We've received regulatory
approval to do that.
As respect to economy and Petrobras, you all read the same thing and understand that
that investigation is widespread and growing. We are obviously keeping a very close eye
on it as it develops and mindful of the implication of it. But having said that, as we look at
the current state of all we know, there is nothing we see in terms of claims to our business
in Brazil right now that is significant or material.

Bloomberg Transcript

Certainly the economy is in bad shape. Nothing we're imagining in the near term that
suggests it will get better. And the implications for that right now in terms of the
competitive market in Brazil is it's possible. It's one of the more difficult markets right now
that we're operating in. And we've got good operators on the ground that understand
that. They've been through a market like this before, been through an economy like this
before in Brazil and we continue to perform well there.
What we can tell you is that the Itaú-ACE franchise is a very powerful franchise in the
commercial P&C business in Brazil with deep relationships. And they've done a very good
job of maintaining the portfolio, and at the same time they're very good underwriters.
And boy, they do know how to use reinsurance. There is a very hungry market down there.
And yet our operation, because of relationships has a lot of influence and controls a lot of
customer on access. So in many cases the road to your share of that business comes
through us.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you. So lastly just a quick number question. On the Fireman's Fund that you
mentioned about like a $15 million non-recurring. Of the component of that, the $49
million benefit is non-recurring, but the $29 million amortization, would that be recurring?

A - Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

Both components recur but the net of the two is very small for the remainder of the year.

Q - Kai Pan

A - Philip V. Bancrof t

Our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good morning. A couple questions here for you. First, Evan, we've talked about
pricing. I wondered if you can give us an update on kind of what's happening with loss
trend right now maybe domestically in the U.S. and internationally, commercial, personal.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yes. I'll ask Sean to opine a little bit on it. But it isn't any different than we saw last quarter...

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

...or the quarter before. It's quite steady. And loss cost is running higher than pricing.

A - Sean Ringsted

{BIO 4168540 <GO>}

That's right. We're not seeing any material changes in claims frequency in the quarter or
year-to-date, Brian.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Sean Ringsted

{BIO 4168540 <GO>}

Trend's generally in line with our expectations for the current accident year. On workers'
comp, as a reminder, that's risk management ground up, loss frequency is slightly lower.
Page 16 of 27



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2015-07-22

And our casualty and professional lines, as (45:46) we mentioned before, we see
frequency changes up and down but that's in line with the portfolio management and
underwriting actions that Evan mentioned, not being systemic or broad-based that we're
seeing there.

FINAL

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. Great. Thanks. And then the second question here, Evan, as a combined company
Chubb-ACE is going to generate a ton of cash flow. And as I look at Chubb and ACE's
capital management strategies, they're kind of different strategies. I'm just wondering
once you guys have reached your kind of desired leverage with respect to debt-to-cap,
do you see kind of the ACE strategy kind of evolving any more closer to kind of what the
Chubb strategy was or do you think it will be roughly similar?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, I think it will evolve. I don't see it as sort of the Chubb strategy which was
fundamentally to return all the capital you generate and maybe not have the same level
of investment for growth that ACE has had and our appetite to invest for thoughtful
growth will not go away. We keep faith that we have a franchise to build and we'll continue
to build and we'll continue to invest in that. And that's organic fundamentally. Remember,
two-thirds of ACE's growth came organically prior to Chubb and one-third through
acquisition.
We'll maintain, as Chubb, some level of prudence of capital for flexibility, for opportunity,
and for risk. And beyond that, I think as you said, you're going to generate a substantial
amount of cash flow, and we had already been returning capital to shareholders excess of
what we thought we required for the things I just enumerated. And we will continue on
that track. And I think the numbers will just be larger because the total is going to be
significantly larger.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

That's very helpful.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

What did you want to say, Phil?

A - Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

I was just going to say I think as we thought about it, it would be a smaller percentage. It
might be a larger number in terms of the total quantum but a smaller number relative to
total organization, right?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

To total capital?

Yes. Sure. Sure. Did that help you, Brian?

Chubb was doing historically?

Q - Meyer Shields

Thanks. Good morning. A couple of small ball questions. One, is there any guidance on
the ramp-up of Fireman's Fund related DAC amortization?

A - Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

When you say ramp-up, do you mean – so we've said that the DAC amortization that did
not occur in the first quarter was about the $50 million. And that was offset to some
extent by the amortization of the intangible that gets established at that point. And what I
said just a little bit earlier was as you go into the out quarters of this year, those two
numbers are also almost equivalent and will have very little bottom line impact of the two.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

We get $50 million in a year.

It'll be more than $50 million a year. It was $50 million in the first quarter. There will be
some amounts in each of the subsequent quarters almost directly offset by the
amortization of the intangible in those later quarters. As the new business emerges, we'll
be establishing DAC on that and it will reestablish itself just like a normal line of business.

Right. Okay. Perfect. Just wanted to make sure I was following it right. And also there was

Hi. Good morning and sorry to beat a dead horse on the Fireman's Fund. I just want to be
sure I understand. So, on the underwriting side of it, the full impact was the DAC. That
would have flowed in the expense ratio and that would have been the only ratio other
than the combined, obviously, that would have been impacted. Am I thinking about that
right?

A - Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

Q - Larry Greenberg

{BIO 16478161 <GO>}

FINAL

Right.

A - Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

...it would have been a reduction to acquisition costs. And at the same time, it's an
increase to other income for the amortization of the intangible.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

But, Larry, you said something that actually we should correct that. That's not the full
underwriting impact of the Fireman's Fund in the quarter. That's the one-time. There was
a modest amount of ongoing and we haven't disclosed that amount. We don't do that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Larry Greenberg

{BIO 16478161 <GO>}

Right, right, right, right. Got that. Thank you. And then, Evan, I mean, just a general
question on the deal. Obviously, there is going to be a lot of accounting noise related to
the transaction. And from our standpoint, it's going to be challenging to really track the
true economic returns that you'll be generating. And I've always viewed you as being very
focused on tangible book value and growing tangible book value. And you've been very
clear on how much you believe in this transaction and the merit of the transaction, and I
think we could probably put together your willingness to accept the tangible book value
dilution in the deal. But I guess my question is just how difficult was it for you to get over
the dilution hurdle? Just maybe if you could share some thoughts on that.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yes. Actually that's a really good question because frankly you hit at maybe the nut of it
for me. I had looked at this before over the years and the tangible book value dilution
stopped me in my tracks each time. I was unwilling to accept it. In June I had a lot of time
on my hands idle sitting because I broke my leg and a lot of time to sit and think when I
usually am pretty active guy. And actually I spent a lot of time thinking about that. And
what I realized, I came to was in my own mind, everybody has to use their own judgment.
In my own judgment I was thinking incorrectly about this. But actually, it wasn't the question
of the dilution. It was the question really of how long does it take you to get back to
where you were and how much faster therefore, will tangible book value grow and will the
value creation take place from there.
And by the way, that then will tie me back into book value and ROE, which I want to speak
about for a minute. And what I came to in my own mind was that if the dilution – if you
could come back to where you actually are right now, in three years, then that's a period
of time of enough certainty to me to get beyond 3, you're a little more aspirational,
you're less certain, that all else being equal, that is all the assumptions are reasonably
conservative and I believe in them of how you get back to that number. Then given the

Page 21 of 27



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2015-07-22

FINAL

value creation that goes on for many years to come and all that you're getting from it,
that was a price I'm willing to pay.
And the way I think about that is how you come back to book value. Book value grows not
tangible, but book grows immediately mid single-digit. And while ROE is basically flat, it's
basis points dilutive out of the gate, it's basis points accretive after three years. But that's
a head fake to me because the book value now has substantially more goodwill in it. And
that goodwill is of a very high quality because it's an income-producing asset, and it's a
great income-producing asset. It's Chubb. And the quality of it, the certainty of it, the
ability to grow it, that is what's meaningful. And so, I take that income-producing asset and
I think of that as levered over the tangible book value. And you start growing mid-teens
tangible book out of the gate. And so, that's how I thought in total and it all linked back to
me about that tangible book dilution of why you would do that.
I hear people talk about ROE and that it's not ROE-accretive. Well, that's because you
have to think a little differently. You've levered up your book value with an incomeproducing asset, that goodwill. But say, your ROE is necessarily maybe not accretive. But
your book value grows more quickly. So, when you think of the formula of price to book,
which is really about ROE against book value, book value grows more quickly where ROE
is less accretive. And you come to the same place in a price to book multiple. So, if that
helps you, that's the total of how I thought about it.

We'll go next to Ian Gutterman with Balyasny.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning, Evan. I wanted to address and Larry just stole my thunder a little
bit, but I wanted to address sort of the two objections I hear from people who are less
optimistic about this deal from investors and analysts and why don't we just continue the
tangible book theme because that's one that comes up a lot.
I agree with most of what you said. I guess I would add even further. I don't understand
why tangible book value is a good way to look at your company. And I guess the reason I
say that is because you could have paid $80 for Chubb and you still would have had
intangibles, goodwill of a few billion dollars. And in that case I think no one will say that is
bad will, if you will, right?

Page 22 of 27



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2015-07-22

And so, why should we assume any dollar paid above book value for Chubb is bad, right?
Isn't the real way to look at that is reported book value because if you overpaid, you will
have a low ROE and reported book value going forward. If you underpaid, you'd have a
higher ROE and reported book value going forward.

FINAL

So, why is tangible book value even a relevant metric for you, guys? You're not banks who
regulates your capital. I think reported book is a better metric.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

You know what, pick your poison. I think they're both good metrics. I agree with you that
you're just coming around, I think what you're saying to me is the same thing, that
goodwill is an income-producing asset and it's a very high quality. And I think that really
gets to be the question. Is it of low quality, would ultimately be impaired? And it's all that it
represents and I agree with that. I also agree that when you're looking at the economics
of these you got to look through a bit the accounting and the intangible amortization to
see the true wealth, economic wealth creation that is taking place.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the other side of the coin as an operator, I will say that tangible is your most
constraining factor. Everything comes off of tangible, and all leverage, your most
constraining is tangible. And we are a balance sheet business and you can only pay claims
out of tangible capital.
And by the way, regulatory and rating agency is about tangible capital. That's your ticket
to operate and to grow, and flexibility. And so, you can't ignore tangible. But I recognize
how you're thinking which is simply from a financial perspective, an investor perspective,
rather than an operating perspective, you got to think both.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Got it. Got it.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

So, I don't disagree with you, but I think you need to be balanced here, Ian. And also, I
think where people are coming from about the tangible, if you can say I'm growing at midteens, it's telling you that goodwill, which is so much bigger on the balance sheet, it is a
levered asset that is income producing. And that's what you have to square the circle
against those who then talk about ROE. Then again, as I said, versus a book value that
grows more quickly.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Agreed. And then, the other one I've heard a bunch is very few people seem to want to
give credit for future revenue synergy just because historically for most companies is that
that tends not to materialize as much as cost synergies. But the way I hear you talk about
it, and even in the slides and the release suggesting that the revenue synergies could be
in the same ballpark as the cost synergies by year five. Can you maybe just talk a little bit

Page 23 of 27



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2015-07-22

more about how confident you are in achieving that year five number and what the risks
are because I think people are kind of being a little too dismissive of that?

FINAL

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yeah. Listen. I understand the cynicism around it. And frankly, when I look at these things,
often I'm very cynical about them. The notion of, well, we'll just cross-sell a lot, frankly, I
think is generally wishful thinking. It doesn't happen the same way.
When we talk about introducing more product, to begin with, by the way, it's not simply
that we're going to cross-sell to the existing customer who bought three. They're now
going to buy four. Now, I don't see it that way. I see that here is a substantial distribution
with the brand name that we will have access to. And those agents and brokers that we
don't have big relationship with, they have those cohorts of risk on their books now. They
have those customers now. And as Chubb is able to introduce more product, we will write
more business from those agents that I feel confident about.

Bloomberg Transcript

Number two, I do think there is a certain amount of cross-sell. And I think it's because the
products are offered more in either a menu or a package and I think we can broaden that
up. I think they're buying. It's not a nice to have. They're buying it now from someone else,
and Chubb will be able to offer that.
Number three, I think the markets we're going to drop down into in customer segment or
go up to and broaden our product offering in the middle market – upper middle market in
U.S.A., I think is extremely real. I think the problem is, when you talk about this, you're not
going to do it out of the box year one when you're integrating. And you're setting things
up. I think you have to be willing to give it an amount of time.
The first three years is really about the expense synergies we're going to recognize. But I
can tell you, as we all sat down last week, even, to talk about what the future could look
like, where our minds were, our Chubb colleagues, their minds were in the same place.
And they recognize the same opportunities and we're both sober operators. We're all
about execution, recognizing that strategy is only 10%. The rest is about executing. And
we all pride ourselves on execution. We're all pretty conservative.
And so, are we all wrong? I don't think so. I don't think so at all. So, I actually do think one
plus one together is going to equal much more than the two separately. And by the way,
without being dismissive, disrespectful, anything, I believe that Chubb, a great company,
has underinvested in the last number of years. And that growth, a portion of that growth
comes from sort of correcting for that.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

Got it. So bottom line, you...

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Look, this will be a religious discussion, Ian.

Yeah.

FINAL

It's a faith until you see it.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Exactly (1:06:51). Right, right. But then you don't view that as a stretch goal if I ask you in
2020, did you get several billion of incremental premium? That's not a stretch goal, that's
something you think is right away achievable?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I do. We didn't put stretch goals in this. We pitched it up. We pitched it up the middle.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Perfect. All right. Thank you.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

You're welcome.

Operator, we have time for just one more person to ask questions, please.

Operator
Okay. Our final question, we'll go to our final question from Jay Cohen with Bank of
America Merrill Lynch.

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yeah. Most of my questions were answered. Just one maybe for Phil. Phil, can you give us
some range of premium contribution from Fireman's Fund to the next several quarters
just for modeling purposes?

A - Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

What I could tell you is that in the quarter, so the non-recurring – I mean the recurring
business in the quarter was a premium level in the neighborhood of $120 million.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Jay?

Very helpful.

Jay?

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yes..

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

That's going to spur questions from people of, wow, something happened. Where is the
Fireman's Fund volume? We're not going to go into this except what we're going to say is,
as part of this transaction, we purchased reinsurance, quota share reinsurance. And so,
that will square the circle for those who will say the recurring volume appears low to us.
Nothing happened. There is not some problem for any of that. Okay?

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Got it.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

But we're not going to go into detail, of course, about the reinsurance.
