Good day, and welcome to the CNP Assurances Interim Results 2016 Conference Call.
Today's conference is being recorded.

Bloomberg Transcript

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Antoine Lissowski, CFO and
Deputy CEO. Please go ahead, sir.

Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Thank you. Hello to everybody. We are here to commence our ﬁrst half 2016 ﬁnancial
performance, and I will go through the diﬀerent pages of the document you have in front
of you and reporting the page step-by-step.
Then, I start with the page ﬁve of the presentation with the key ﬁgures for this interim
period. The premium income of the company was up by 6.4%. I just mentioned the
changes in reported ﬁgures and not in like-for-like ﬁgures, except when I will explicitly say
it.
The new business margin stays at 11.9% now compared to last year's 14.5%. The combined
ratio of the company, which is published for the ﬁrst time in this ﬁrm, is at 85.2%, down
from last year's, it was at 86.1%. The revenues are at €1.700 billion, and last year, it was
€1.666 billion. Then, the change is 2.5% up. Where administrative costs are roughly at the
same level as last year, the EBIT now is at €1,280 million, up by 3.6%. The proﬁts –
attributable net proﬁt is at €620 million. The ROE of the company is 8.5%, right above last
year's. Our consolidated SCR coverage ratio is at 165% to be compared with 192%, which
we reached at the end of 2015. The operating free cash ﬂow by share is at €0.79 (2:50),
where it was €0.67 last year, and the net book value per share is at €21.5, where it was last
year at €21.1.

FINAL

Then, let's enter into the business of the company during the period, starting by France
on page six of the slide show. The premium income of the company in reported ﬁgures is
up by 9.7% with certain decrease in personal risk and protection business, which stays at
€2,128 million, and which is up 14.4% at €11,544 million for savings business.
The proportion of our savings and pension premiums represented by unit-links is stable at
15%, and the personal risk premiums were aﬀected by a change of scope. We extended
our business to diﬀerent subsidiaries of BPCE, starting business with Banques Populaires
and Crédit Foncier. And conversely, we sold the business made with La Banque Postale in
this ﬁeld when we sold the LBPP shares. And the global drive of a company in this area of
this business is to improve the underwriting results on employee beneﬁt contracts even
by giving up some of most costly contracts.
On page seven, you have the vision of new money on the period in France. Just two main
elements, the APE margin is now at 8.5% to be compared with 11.4% last year at the same
period. This decrease is entirely due to lower interest rates. And it is easy to imagine that
with such low interest rates, the APE margins on savings and pension business is, clearly,
much below last year's. And the new business value of this period is also down to last
year's at €111 million, where it was at €136 million last year. But we have, nevertheless,
posted a higher contribution from our operations.

Bloomberg Transcript

When you see the new money, the structure of sales and the sources of new money on
the left of the ﬁgure, you see that, globally, we have improved our mix by increasing the
net cash ﬂow in unit-links, net cash ﬂow of savings business.
On page eight, you have the views on operating proﬁt, with total revenues growing by
10.4%. If we except (6:44) own fund revenues, which growth is 2.1%, we focus on
operational revenues, savings and pensions and personal risk and protection revenues,
which were up by 15.5% at €731 million. The administrative expenses are roughly at the
same level as last year with €298 million, which results in an EBIT being up by 14.7% at
€825 million.
We have also given there a view on our cost-to-income ratio, which is lower than last
year's by important margin. We're now at 14.7% (sic) [40.7%] (7:42) in terms of percentage
cost to income, where we were at 43% last year and above 44% during the years before.
If we now turn to Latin America on page nine, we see the structure and the amount of
premium income. Here, it is justiﬁed to take into accounts the like-for-like ﬁgures, because
major diﬀerence between reported and like-for-like ﬁgures resides in changes in the value
of Brazilian real. And of course, regarding the premium income, it is fair to look at them in
like-for-like ﬁgures.
Then the growth was 11.6% and this growth was very high in personal risk and protection
business with €914 million, up by 13.8%. And also important, but less important growth in
traditional savings and pension business, which represents the majority, more than 50%
of the sales with just about €1 billion.

FINAL

If you look at APE margins, we have slightly the same APE margin as last year. The new
business value is very similar as well to last year's half of the 2015 year last year. And it is a
reminder that the Brazilian insurance market growth was up by 5.5% over the last 12
months, where Caixa Seguradora recorded 0.5 point increase in market share in the ﬁrst
half to 5.9% in terms of market share.
If we turn to page 10 with EBIT performance in this area, it is very strong in spite of
negative currency eﬀect. If you look at the like-for-like ﬁgures, we have the growth by
7.4%. And you see there that this growth is mainly due to our personal risk and protection
business, which grew consistently.
The administrative expenses are very well under control. We have shown there that the
cost of – adjourning (10:47) digital subsidiary in Brazil was taken into account. It represents
€9 million to be included in the global cost of administrative expenses in Brazil, which are
at €76 million reported. And the EBIT stays at €508 million in like-for-like ﬁgures, and in
reported €397 million, which represents, for like-for-like ﬁgures, a growth of 7.7%.

Bloomberg Transcript

If you look now at European business from page 11, the European premium income is
roughly the same as last year, just above €2 billion with APE margins staying at 17.30% and
the new business value slightly up at €33 million to be compared with the €27 million of
last year. There what is important to underline is the very strong performance of CNP
Santander Insurance, which premium were up 33.6% in ﬁrst half of 2016.
On page 12, you have diﬀerent ﬁgures regarding the revenues in this area, which are up
by 32% in like-for-like ﬁgures and 15% in reported ﬁgures. The administrative expenses
were also slightly up, this growth being due to reorganization costs of our activities in
Spain after the sale of Barclays Vida subsidiary, and EBIT of a company being, in reported
terms, up by 29.5% at €58 million.
I do not come to the page 13. I jump on it, because it just remind of diﬀerent ﬁgures,
which were already commented. And now, I invite you to go to the page 15 with diﬀerent
ﬁnancial elements regarding the business of a company with the level of EBIT indicated,
€1.280 billion. We have also to take into account slight growth of ﬁnancial cost, which is
attributable to the higher volume of subordinated debt we have to remunerate. The tax is
slightly up, but the average tax rate is the same as before. In fact, there was a slight
decrease of tax rate in France, yes, yes (14:14), and a slight increase in tax rate in Brazil, but
non-controlling interest are below. Of course, it is mainly due to changes in consolidation
perimeter of a company.
The recurring proﬁt then is at €600 million, €599 million, in fact, with a change of 10.3% in
reported ﬁgures and 18.9% in like-for-like ﬁgures. It is, obviously, a very good performance
if you take into account the shaken environment in Brazil, on one side, and the very low
interest rates and the impact in Europe, on the other side.
Then the group results, net recurring proﬁt is up. If you look at the lines below, you have a
much lower contribution of realized gain on equities and fair value adjustment. This is due
to the level of realized gain on participations, which were sold – which is much lower than
Page 3 of 15

last year. Last year, we sold, for €232 million of a gain, the subsidiary with Barclays. And
this year, we sold only the part of our subsidiary, LBPP, the La Banque Postale, which
brought only €161 million as indicated below. And added to that, we have had a negative
impact of fair value adjustment in 2016, where they were positive last year.
Then, the non-recurring items oﬀset this diﬀerence. And we have non-recurring item of
€67 million. These were allocation to the provision pour excédents, the PPE of CNP, which
is lower than last year's €216 million. Then, all that results in an attributable net proﬁt at
€620 million.
I was mentioning the PPE. The policyholder surplus reserve at the end of June is at the
level of €7.9 billion. It represents 3.4% of technical reserves, in fact, 3.36% of technical
reserves. And it seems to us important to have this increase.

Bloomberg Transcript

If now we turn to the page 16, you have a view on the operating free cash ﬂow and the
way it is made up. During the ﬁrst half of the year, we have made an operating cash ﬂow
of €541 million, which is to be compared with a global operating to free cash ﬂow of the
whole last year, which was €955 million. And these €541 million are also to be compared
with the cost of the dividend of the company last year, which was slightly at that level or
even below that level. That means what – that means that, clearly, there is no problem of
creating cash ﬂow at the level of company, and we will be able, at the end of the year, all
things being alike, to pay correct dividend and to make additional investments.
One of the issues of the period, in page 17, is clearly the investment strategy we can have
at the level of the group. On the left of the slide, you have allocation of new investments
made during the ﬁrst half of the 2016. You see that we allocated 71% of the investment to
bonds. And on the right of the slide, you have the split of these bonds between the
diﬀerent categories with sovereign bonds made on longer duration, but with relatively
low yield with banks' bonds bought at the duration of the maturity between seven years
and eight years with higher return, and corporate bonds with lower maturity and a return
of 1%. All in all, the average reinvestment rate in this period was 1.1% in Europe.
To continue on the left of the slide, you see also that we made an important development
in property and infrastructure investments, which part of the investments is 12%. It is twice
– more than twice the part of this investment in the outstanding assets of the company,
durable (20:02) assets of the company. Then we are in process of increasing the share of
these categories of investments in our assets. And it is the same for private equity with 6%
of our new investments. We are much above the allocation in terms of amounts which is at
1%.
Now, I give some explanations or details on that on page 18. Just to underline our eﬀorts
to diversify the asset allocation of the company, we continue to invest in equities. But
clearly, we have decided to focus a part of these investments in more defensive stocks
with low volatility equity funds, funds hedged against falling (21:01) stock prices,
convertibles and using also options – long-term options in order to protect the balance
sheet of the company in case of a negative move of the market. And we are refocusing
our investments from the U.S. stocks, which seemed to us relatively expensive now, in

FINAL

favor of European stocks with higher relative valuation. When the slide was made of
European stocks, we're encompassing UK stocks.
Regarding private equity, and we have an over-investments in non-listed assets. You have
the amount of our investments in real estate, in infrastructure and private equity during
the period. We've also the ﬁgure of the IRR, on historical average IRR in the portfolio of
CNP. It just a way to remind people that we have a longstanding policy of diversiﬁcations
and that we consider to have accumulated now a suﬃcient experience in these diﬀerent
categories of investments to be comfortable with very important amounts of investments,
which we make nowadays in this categories of assets.
And to ﬁnish with the asset allocation, we have 67% of assets in cash. It is clearly due to
market volatility, to our unwillingness to invest quickly in bonds, to the diﬃcult to ﬁnd with
a correct return the diversiﬁcation instruments, which can oﬀset the Solvency II cost of
capital attached to these categories of investment, then we assume to have a high part of
our assets in cash in a period where investment is under such culture, in general.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, on page 19, I come to the Solvency II coverage ratio. Our SCR coverage ratio is now
at 165%. It used to be at 192% at the beginning of the year. When you see how it is made
up, you immediately realize that the eligible capital decreased by roughly €2 billion and
that SCR increased by roughly €1 billion. These two moves are mainly almost utterly
attributable to the decrease of interest rates. This decrease has two consequences in
terms of the model.
The ﬁrst is that value of in-force is decreasing as the value of future results is clearly lower
than expected when the higher – when there were higher interest rates. And SCR, the net
– SCR, net of taxes, is of course increased because the deferred taxes on the future results
are reduced. And as it was net of deferred taxes, where SCR – apart the allocation of the
assets themselves, the net SCR is increased.
Then, this coverage ratio of 165% is the result of diﬀerent sensitivities. I remind you that we
have published in February the sensitivities of this SCR. We have immediately said that
this ratio, which was at high level, would be very sensitive. It is the case. And we can
analyze the decrease of 27% of SCR coverage ratio as a combination of the two
sensitivities, which we had published. 20 basis points are attributable to decrease in
interest rates and 4% are attributable to decrease – to the value of equities – volatility in
equities.
Then, there is no surprise from our side in this interest ratio, and we consider that it
doesn't inform, particularly on a diﬀerent structure of the company, of increased risks. The
risks are the same. The environment is diﬀerent.
Now – and it is the last page of the presentation. I come to the adaptation to the inﬂationfree environment. We here wanted to just to show few elements, to show the high
resilience of the company in this environment. First, the very low level of the yields
guarantees on in-force and on new business now. If you look at the in-force business at
the end of half year, we had a yield on ﬁxed interest rates assets, which stayed at 3.31%.
Page 5 of 15

FINAL

And the guaranteed yield represented the cost of 0.45%. Then the margin between the
yield on ﬁxed rate assets and the guaranteed yield is still very high for the company.
And what is more interesting is that the new business margin is also existing, of course, at
a diﬀerent extent. The yield on ﬁxed rate assets, which we have bought, 114% (sic) [1.14%]
(27:35), it is the ﬁgure before, is much higher than the guaranteed yield we have now
collecting, which the guaranteed yield is below 1 point – 0.5% (sic) [0.05%] (27:50) that
means that there is almost no guaranteed yield in the new business underwritten by the
company, and that even very low yield on the assets invested during the period doesn't
jeopardize the model and the risks of the company in short term.

Bloomberg Transcript

And the last element is the growth in policyholders' surplus reserve. I already mentioned
the extent of this policy or (28:25) the surplus reserve. And we just underlined the fact that
when you look at this ﬁgure, you have to think in terms of how many years of policyholder
dividend can be paid by this reserve. Of course, when we were at the end of 2015, the
average rate of the market, the policyholder surplus dividend of the market at that time,
was about 2.3%. And the policyholder surplus reserve of CNP, which was around 3%, was
representing one year and a half, roughly, of policyholder surplus dividend.
Now, with €7.9 billion and 3.46% of mathematical presence (29:18), we are much above
expected policyholder dividend. Expected means that we think that it should decrease
more dramatically than last year, and we have indicated the French investors and the
French market that we anticipate to decrease it more, the policyholders' surplus dividend,
to decrease it more than last year. Last year, the ﬁgure was a decrease of 30 basis points.
We think we will do better this year in order to preserve and protect the balance sheet
and the capacity to have returns on long term.
Okay. Now, I am at your disposal, with all my colleagues, which you cannot see, but we
have very prestigious and numerous people around this table. And I will be very happy to
give them the ﬂoor to answer to your questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. Our ﬁrst question today comes from Michael Huttner of JPMorgan. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Fantastic. Thank you very much. I listened with the interest also the French – the webcast.
There was one point from Solvency II, and a mention was that you would consider using
negative interest rates in the modeling of Solvency II going forward. And I just wondered
whether you had an idea of the sensitivity, which this would introduce to the calculation.
That would be my ﬁrst question.

Page 6 of 15

And then, the second is you mentioned – although your CEO and, I think, you also
mentioned the potential desire to cut policyholder crediting rates in this company. And I
just wondered what is the ﬁgure you had in mind and what it would do to the metrics? We
see the IFRS metrics. Would it have any impact at all? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Okay. Michael, on the ﬁrst question, it is a right question that we have no negative rates in
our models so far, and we are committed to diﬀerent stakeholders and to auditors to use
negative rates in the modernization (32:02) at the end of 2016. Then, it is a commitment I
take to you to provide you with the ﬁgures including that. And of course, I cannot so far
elaborate on the sensitivity on the ﬁgure, which I do not know now. But it is clearly the
next technical challenge for a public company to redesign some of our models in order to
be able to take it into account.

Bloomberg Transcript

On your second question, what we have in mind, if you've heard well what the CEO of the
company has answered to that question, the answer was clearly we have nothing in mind
precisely. We are just saying that it would be necessary to decrease more dramatically and
more signiﬁcantly the dividend, the policyholder dividend, this year, and the fact that the
30 basis points of last year would not be enough.
For the rest, it is a message we are sending to the market, ﬁrst, that clearly the CNP in
itself is not at danger in the current environment. And I think that the level of our reserves
with yield guarantees and so on are absolutely not diﬃcult. But what we want to send as a
message to the market, of which we are one of the major actors, and to our diﬀerent
partners is that it is not reasonable in an environment with no inﬂation to continue to pay
more than 1.9%, as it was the case before. Shall it become 1.4%, 1.5% or below that, I don't
know so far. And we have a whole process of negotiation with our partners before this
ﬁgure is decided at the end of the year.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thank you. And just a quick follow on, and I'm sorry (34:21), you said – at what stage
should we become more concerned about the potential impact on the dividend of these
low interest rates?

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

The impact on which dividend?

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Your dividend. Your dividend.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Well, usually, when I am asked about dividend in December or January, I'd say, okay, let's
wait for general assembly with the board and so on. But in July, clearly, my short view is
simply to go on holidays tomorrow. The question is clearly (35:03) not in my mind.

Our next questions today comes from Rötger Franz from Société Générale. Please go
ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Rötger Franz
Yes. Hello, everyone. Just a couple of questions also to your Solvency II ratio, especially as
it declined 27 percentage points. You said that you're going to decrease the policyholder
crediting rate that will support the Solvency II ratio. But can you give us some kind of
sensitivity of the Solvency II ratio to the change in the policyholder crediting rate? And are
you considering any other countermeasures to support the Solvency II ratio? And also,
what would be the level where you would get a little bit uncomfortable with the Solvency
II position?
And, ﬁnally, after the – or can you give us an update on the Solvency II sensitivities? I
remember, in the full year earnings conference call, you mentioned the convexity in the
sensitivity of the Solvency II ratio. So, it would be good to have kind of an update. Thank
you.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Okay. I give ﬂoor to Marie Grison on that topic.

A - Marie Grison

{BIO 15895562 <GO>}

Okay. On the impact of decrease of policyholders' dividend and potential increase of
reserve on that, yes, more reserve has a positive impact globally on the coverage ratio.
But the exact impact depends on the environment condition. So, we don't have a precise
sensitivity to give to you.

Page 8 of 15



Company Name: CNP Assurances
Company Ticker: CNP FP Equity
Date: 2016-07-28

FINAL

On the global issue of sensitivities, the fact is that there is some convexity and cause
(37:12) eﬀects on sensitivities and also on the shape of the curve. And clearly, one can
understand that when you have lower interest rates, your sensitivity is bigger because
you're more near to the integrated options in the models. So, that's what we can answer
on that.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

We will update the sensitivities for the annual publication, but we do not update them
now.

Q - Rötger Franz
Okay.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

And regarding are we comfortable? Yes. We are very comfortable with the present level of
Solvency ratio.

Q - Rötger Franz
But where is the level where you get uncomfortable with that?

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Do you imagine us to become an uncomfortable?

Q - Rötger Franz
So, would you still be comfortable with a Solvency II ratio of, let's say, 140% or so? How far
down would you go before taking decisive measures?

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Well, when we depict what we are doing on our business, on crediting rates and costs
and so on, it is just a strategy, which is consistent with the idea to maintain the safety of
the company on long term, the economic safety of the company of long term. In other
terms, we are not managing the ratio for the ratio. We are managing the business model
of the company in order to provide the customers and the investors with a very solid and
long term company, where the question of managing the ratio in itself is really completely
secondary from our point of view.
What is important is that the ratio is completely under control. What is measured at the
ratio level is what could have been expected using the existing sensitivities which we have
published three months or four months ago. Then, so far, the system works as we
expected, and we control and we completely are consequent and consistently
comfortable with the way it works.

FINAL

In other words, for us, one part of the problem, the major part of the problem, is
economic model which is clearly moving from the former model completely concentrated
on traditional savings to more diversiﬁed model that is at work. And the second problem,
which is completely minor, is to manage the Solvency ratio and it will be done by diﬀerent
elements, but we've no speciﬁc concern from our part.

Q - Rötger Franz
Okay.

Operator
Our next question today comes from Ralph Hebgen from KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Hi, guys. Ralph Hebgen from KBW. Two things. First is the revenues on the own
funds backing shareholders' funds and a proportion of BPCE. I was wondering, I believe,
within that is also realized capital gains. And I was just wondering whether you can give us
a feel of how much that was or, perhaps, about your philosophy of gains harvesting this
year versus last year. It is, I think, common to be opportunistic, of course, in this. And
sometimes you would focus most of the gains of the year in the ﬁrst half of the year,
sometimes in the second half of the year. So, some color on your thinking there would be
appreciated. So, that was the ﬁrst one.
And the second question relates to the Solvency II ratio as well. And as a follow-up to
what we just heard, it would still be interesting to explore whether you have like a view
relating to certain levels of solvency below you do not wish the Solvency II ratio to fall.
And what you would do at levels above certain upper band. So, what I'm saying is many
of your competitors have this kind of disclosure. If it falls below X%, then we will protect
the ratio; if it goes above Y%, we will do something with the surplus funds. So, maybe
some interpretation of that as well. Thank you very much.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Okay. On the second question, I'm sorry I cannot add very many things to what was
already said. I think that we will do something if we reach 100%. It is possible to do
something if we reach the 100%. For the rest, when we discuss Solvency ratio at the level
of audit committee of board of the company, there is absolutely no concern raised by
anyone on that. Management explains more precisely when it can do it to all the investors
how this ratio is moving and what our view is on that. And nobody is worried at the end of
terms (43:17). Then, in fact, wait, the 100% in order – until we start to react.
Regarding your ﬁrst question on the own fund return, I read some things you have written
about that this morning. I want to be very clear. We have – with this own fund contribution,
we have a target, which we set at the beginning of the year, compounded with a return on
the diﬀerent categories of assets, return of bonds held in these portfolios and the returns
on diﬀerent other (44:01) assets and capital gains program.

Page 10 of 15



Company Name: CNP Assurances
Company Ticker: CNP FP Equity
Date: 2016-07-28

FINAL

These diﬀerent programs are not modiﬁed so far, and we have been optimistic in terms of
market timing of diﬀerent realization of capital gains. But we have not deviated from our
budgetary target on that respect, either on the target of global contribution of this
compartment of reserves (44:35) or the way it will be made. Meaning, the part of capital
gains which have to be included to do that.
Then, this management is, I would say, more than the others even, completely centrally
held by the company, driven by the company. And we will be exactly where we want, and
it is not an issue so far to – current level of the markets at least, it is clearly not an issue.
The own fund management is not under pressure for the year. It is clearly an issue as for
the rest of the investments to know how to manage the asset allocation of that part of our
balance sheet for preparing the future, but it is clearly not an issue for 2016.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Yes. So, thanks very much. Just to clarify what I meant by this, it is of course entirely
legitimate to look at the performance of investments and then decide, in light of what you
see, how much capital gains to realize at the given time. I was just wondering how this
compares with last year where I believe that you realized more of the yearly gains
harvesting in the second half than in the ﬁrst half. That's all I had in mind.

Well, to be frank, I have not in mind speciﬁc move between the two half years, last years. I
will check it and we will write an answer on the website if – just to compare the amount of
capital gains which were made at the ﬁrst half and second half. But I have no ﬁgures in
mind and I don't want to misinform you now.

As there are no further questions in the queue, I would like to turn the – pardon the
interruption. We do have a follow-up question from Ralph Hebgen of KBW. Please go
ahead, sir. Your line is open.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

I'm sorry, it's me again. There were two other things on the Solvency II ratio, which I
wanted to ask you about. The ﬁrst one is just in conﬁrmation. I believe you issued some
debt at the start of the year to reﬁnance maturing debt, which comes out at the end of the
year. So, I believe it is correct to then say that, currently, your level of solvency is
supported by the, let's say, temporary presence of sub-debt in the eligible own funds.
And I estimate that to be an equivalent of 70 (47:49) percentage points. So, would you be
able to conﬁrm that indeed...

Ralph, I conﬁrm this decision (47:58)...

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Okay.

FINAL

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Your ﬁgures are right.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Okay. Perfect. And the second thing I wanted to just ask is, are you now matched from
perspective of duration?

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Well, we have...

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Or (48:19) duration gap?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Well, we are monitoring the duration gap at the level of the risk group. We have a risk
committee at the level of CEO of the company, and we have had a look on the duration
gap during one of last meetings of these groups. And we are correctly hedged in the
diﬀerent compartments of our activity. Then there's no speciﬁc issue on the hedging of
duration of losses and liabilities. And it is clearly a source of, I would say, of work. Why?
Because under Solvency II, as you know it well, there is a cost, if you are not correctly
hedged on this respect. And we are monitoring it closely and it is – we're correctly
hedged and there is no speciﬁc concern about it.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Okay. Many thanks. Thank you very much.

We will now take another follow-up question from Michael Huttner of JPMorgan. Please
go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Just on the duration, just want to follow up. I heard – from the
French conference call I was listening, I heard the asset duration, I think the ﬁgure was ﬁve
years or six years. The feeling I had was at the liabilities duration, and I know it's diﬃcult to
calculate because there's no – then you have to assume how policyholders behave, is a
little bit longer. Is there a ﬁgure somewhere where we can say, well, it's more than the

ﬁgure you've previously published or less than the ﬁgure you've previously published?
Just to get an idea.
And the other question – and it's really kind of ﬁshing on the dark here, I think last year or
two years ago, there was – the question was at what stage you would renegotiate the
distribution agreement in Brazil? And I just wondered what the mechanics of that would
be when it could happen, and it would stay, so we can start considering what the amounts
might be?

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Could you remind me, your ﬁrst question was about?

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

The ﬁrst one is has there ever been a duration number published and can you say
whether we're now bigger or smaller. And the second one is about Brazil and the
negotiation with the distribution.

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Okay. Regarding the question of duration gap, well, it was clearly a sort of
misunderstanding between what was said this morning with – what was said this morning.
Then we checked the things, and my former answer was, clearly, the outcome of this
check. When I say that we are comfortably hedged in terms of duration, it is after having
checked the diﬀerent ﬁgures, which were mentioned this morning. Then, I conﬁrm that
the sensitivity on the savings business is very close – the asset sensitivity and the liability
sensitivity are very close to each (51:49). Regarding Brazil, there is, in fact, nothing
speciﬁcally new in terms of this negotiation. We have received a visit of a new CEO of our
Brazilian partner. It is the ﬁrst time he paid a visit to CNP – any (52:12) CEO of Brazilian
group pays a visit to French CNP, when he is appointed.
He was there in Paris two weeks ago just for one meeting. And he said – he told us that he
was very interested to discuss with us in due time – we don't know when this time comes,
but in due time – to envisage the extension of our partnership on long term. It was purely
political message without any technical or ﬁnancial over speciﬁc messages. But the fact
that he provided it in Paris in the course of a speciﬁc travel was in itself interesting.
For La Banque Postale (53:10) just a thing. This new CEO of Caixa Econômica Federal
knows pretty well the insurance subsidiary, which we have together, because he used to
be, at the Caixa Econômica Federal, manager of one of the regions of Brazil. And as – in
his tenure, he won prize as one of the best sellers of life insurance contract, and he
traveled in France at the expenses of our company. He spent a week a few years ago in
France. It was his only week in France as head of one of the most eﬃcient commercial
divisions of Caixa Econômica Federal.
Then he has a good taste of what the corporation with the French company can bring. I
think he was involved doing (54:17) something like that, and he seems to have kept a very
good souvenir of this corporation.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Brilliant. That's Excellent. That's helpful. And then the last – and I wonder if you – and this
is really theoretical, but I was looking at the websites, Googling in general. I'm trying to
understand how the – if you were to reduce the policyholder participation signiﬁcantly,
where does that money go and how does one calculate it? My colleagues here, when I
said, oh, this is what they're mentioning, they said, oh, you can't do that, it's not
discretionary. And I said, no, no, it's not discretionary, there's a rule. But then I didn't know
what the rule was. I thought it was 85% or something, but then I got lost. I just wondered if
you can explain how this kind of transfer works.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Under the current regulation, this money goes to the PPE – the excess, which is kept, goes
to the PPE, I mean, under the current regulation, because if the regulation was to change,
money could go in another provision or something like it, but it is not existing now. And
why I do mention that? Because we are lobbying on the idea that the PPEs or another
provision should be used to help our customers to choose our products by paying an
extra return on other producers, which are of more interest and more value for the
customers and for us on long term.
But under the current regime, all the moneys go to the PPE. And after the PPE has been
used to pay the current contracts of the company or at least the contract, which exist
when the PPE is taken back by the customers, which are the customers of this contract.
What we are trying to obtain is a possibility to transfer this excess money, kept by the
company, to consumers, which accept to have longer contract or more risk or something
like it. But it is just a wishful thinking of a lobbyist, I mentioned now, and it is not a
regulation, which is already existing.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Brilliant. And the rule for general allocation is 85% of the ﬁnancial income.

Yes. Hi. Me again. Just one last thing, could you update us on the development in Brazil
relative to the planned IPO? Is this back on the table or do you know whether it will be

FINAL

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Well, we are condemned (57:31) to read the Brazilian press and the public issues made by
diﬀerent oﬃcials. And we understand that the intent to do something in terms of
privatization and that our business from their point of view is among those who could be
privatized, partly privatized at least. But so far, we have not started to make any diligence
in order to make it possible.

Q - Ralph Hebgen
