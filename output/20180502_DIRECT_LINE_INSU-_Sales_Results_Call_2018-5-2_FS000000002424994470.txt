Operator
Hello, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the DLG Q1 2018 Trading Update Call. My
name is Abby, and I will be a coordinator for today's conference. I'm now handing you
over to Paul Geddes to begin today's conference. Thank you.

Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Thanks and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for this brief trading update
on what has been another busy quarter. You have seen our trading statement this
morning. So, I'm going to give you a bit more color on those highlights and then open up
to questions. As usual, I'm joined by members of the management team here with me
today.
Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we're making on our strategic goals and on how
we traded this quarter, growing our direct own brand premiums by 4.7%. It was an active
quarter in respect to weather events, and I'm really proud of how our people supported
our customers, again, demonstrating the value of our insurance coverage and service.
After a very strong 2017, Motor margins are returning to more normal levels. Home remain
competitive, although we've navigated this well, while both Green Flag and Direct Line for
Business had another good quarter overall. I'm pleased to say that our Direct Line brand,
particularly Motor and SME, drove much of the growth.

FINAL

So, now, onto performance of the individual categories, starting with Motor where we
continue to make good progress. At a market level following strong pricing in the ﬁrst half
of 2017 prices started to reduce and now have returned broadly to pre-Ogden levels as
yesterday's ABI survey showed. This should be seen in the context of the favorable claims
environment we saw in 2017, together with the positive news on Ogden and whiplash
reform. Next, we judged the market has behaved rationally.
Against this rational backdrop, we grew our own brand policies 5% compared to Q1 last
year and our own brand premiums 5.3%, with growth in both direct and PCW channels.
And whilst margins were below the supercharged levels of 2017, they are in line with
target levels, and our longstanding focus on value remains.
Importantly, we also took a step forward strategically by writing our ﬁrst policies under the
Volkswagen contract. In Home, you'll recall our nationwide contract ended at the end of
2017, which drives the headline ﬁgures.

Bloomberg Transcript

Own brands grew in-force policies 1.8% compared to prior year, broadly in line with our
expectations. And the work we've done on our digital capabilities helps grow in-force
policies through our Royal Bank of Scotland partnership. The ﬁrst quarter-on-quarter
growth we've achieved since 2012 and reﬂects the great progress we've made here.
After two benign years, it won't have escaped you that it was a cold quarter. The freezing
weather had an impact across the business and we estimate that across Home and
Commercial, we've used the group's full annual weather budget of £75 million primarily
as a result of the freeze, which equates to about £50 million net of tax and proﬁt
commission. Aside from the weather, the actions we've been taking on underwriting,
claims and pricing mean we are currently on track with underlying Home proﬁtability.
Turning to Commercial where we had another good quarter, growing in-force policies
4.7% versus last year. As you know, Commercial has two distinct stories within it. Direct
Line for Business or DLB is already highly proﬁtable, has been growing and adds to the
overall Direct Line franchise. And in Q1, it grew in-force policies 8.1% and premiums 8.4%.
In our broker business, NIG, we've been continuing to move returns towards the group's
target levels and continuing to prioritize value over volume. We're making real progress
here and saw some good rate in the quarter. In Rescue, our direct business, Green Flag,
grew premiums 9.6%, helping to partially oﬀset the decline in our partnerships. Overall,
we continue on our path of improving the value of the business in this portfolio.
Turning to the balance sheet, I can conﬁrm our yearend 2017 solvency capital ratio actually
came in 165% which is 3 percentage points ahead of the estimate we gave at our
preliminary results.
So, a brief wrap-up before questions. Our multi-brand multi-channel strategy that
succeeded in 2017 has given us momentum into Q1 2018. Overall, we've navigated a
complex trading environment well and we reiterate our ﬁnancial targets adjusted for
normal weather and assuming no further change to the Ogden discount rate.

Q&A

FINAL

Operator
Okay. Okay. So we've got the questions coming through. So, the ﬁrst question comes
from the line of Thomas Seidl. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. Three questions, if I may, the ﬁrst one on Home. Last year, you
and others reported high claims inﬂation and the need to take price action. Now, it seems
in Q1, we didn't see any price increases, if not, perhaps, price decrease. Maybe you can
comment on the pricing in Home and the competitiveness there.
Secondly, NIG, you said you took price action. And as a result, you continue to lose
market share. My question there is, do you expect this to continue? Is there some hope
that you reach a sort of bottom in terms of volume and the rest of the market also start to
take price action, or is it just you taking those price actions?

Bloomberg Transcript

And ﬁnally, a brief one on Motor, the 5%, 5.3% growth in own brands compares rather
high to the 2.9% for the total portfolio. Does this mean that the rather small partnership
business has seen a substantial drop in volume?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Very good. Thanks, Thomas. Very easy one to start with your third question, yeah,
Sainsbury's, we've stopped writing, so that explains that diﬀerence. NIG, yeah, listen, the
target is to improve the returns, not to reduce the volume. Now, where we have a choice,
it'll be a volume hit. But we also have some self-help initiatives in there. So, I think broadly,
we would hope that it will be relatively stable in the coming period depending on,
obviously, how the market behaves. Penny, Home?

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Yes. Hi, Thomas. Home pricing, so, we think if we look at the market, that probably overall
rates are around ﬂat. But within that, there's a bit of distortion because there are one or
two players putting through quite sharp decreases and most people actually are putting
through rate increases.
If we look at our book, we've actually got some pricing away across the channel. But what
you're seeing is average premium come up a little due to risk mix. So, overall, the margins
are, if anything, a little up compared to previous quarter.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Okay. So, the average premium you say is mainly mix, not that you - also saw (00:07:34)
price decreases?

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Yeah, we're getting positive rates but the risk balance is pulling the average premium
down.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Okay. So, the next question comes from the line of James Shuck calling from Citi. Please
go ahead.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Good morning, James.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So I just had two relatively simple
ones for you, I think. Firstly, just keen to think about the bodily injury claims trends in the
year-to-date, we've had some data, I think from the Department of Work and Pensions
suggesting that we've seen a sharp reduction in that year-to-date. And this is even ahead
of the whiplash reforms. So, perhaps, you could just comment on what your experience
has been year-to-date, please.
And then secondly, I'm just interested to hear a bit more about the Home partnership.
Most of that is with RBS and you've returned to growth, as you say, for the ﬁrst time for a
while. Just to kind of know about the functionality and the modularity of what you're
actually oﬀering to customers and how successful you see that growing from here. Thank
you.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Great. Penny, do you want to do the Home one ﬁrst?

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Yeah. So, Royal Bank of Scotland, NatWest primarily, as you say, it's been in decline for
several years now. What we think has turned it is we're using APIs on the front-ends
(00:09:05) customers, so we can use RBS data to sort of pre-populate and all of that and
makes actually the customer journey much, much easier. And that's really been the driver.
At the moment, the increase is small, but it reversed the trend that we've seen several
years. So, we're really, really pleased about it.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. On bodily injury, listen, we are seeing some more encouraging trends. I
think we talked about 2017 being a good year overall. And we said, at the time, we
thought some of that might be the ﬂow through of the previous government reform,
Page 4 of 15



Company Name: Direct Line Insurance Group PLC

Date: 2018-05-02

FINAL

things like MedCo (00:09:40) and the Jackson reforms and the abolition of referral fees.
So all of that we do think is contributing. We also do think that potentially some early
signs anticipating the future whiplash regime, that might be somewhat reshaping the
response of the legal industry. So again, that might also account for some more positive
bodily injury trends which we're seeing, slightly harder to read actually in the ﬁrst quarter
because claims trends have been a bit aﬀected by the weather.
So whilst actually Motor is not that expensive in terms of the eﬀects of the freeze, it slightly
changed which perils that the claims have come in on. So, we probably need a few more
quarters to get under the skin of it. But we do think good BI trend is part of the reason we
say it's a benign and favorable claims environment and that explains why we're saying
that these pricing reductions that we've seen have been rational.
And I think actually, listen, if prices had gone up against those trends improving, I think
that would have been quite reputationally damaging for the industry given that we've
encouraged the government to go and do reform. The quid pro quo is that savings
should ﬂow through to consumer and I think it's entirely right and predictable if prices
should have come back.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Would you say that – there's obviously a big rise in whiplash claims over a prolonged
period but more recently there's no real evidence that whiplashes has been increasing. It
looks like it's actually been decreasing across – for the industry. Does that undermine the
eﬀorts to get those kind of reforms through with the Civil Liability Bill?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

I guess what I'm saying is some of it might be – the legal industry anticipating those
changes and there has been less activity in terms of marketing to consumers. So that
might be an early beneﬁt of the proposed changes. It might be coming through already
and then the last changes we think potentially are working things like Medco (00:11:41)
and we think that working and being passed on to consumers should encourage the
government to actually enact this legislation. So, I think there's a kind of positive
reinforcement story happening here. And I think it's a good news story and people
shouldn't be, therefore, spooked by premiums coming back. I think it'd be dangerous if
they weren't coming back.
Now, obviously, that gives us a little bit of challenge on our expenses and we're obviously
up and planning on meeting that challenge. Hence, reiterating the target which includes
expense ratio reduction.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

That's great. Thank you very much.

Okay. So, the next question comes from the line of Arjan van Veen calling from UBS.
Please go ahead.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

FINAL

Good morning.

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

Thanks. Morning. Just to follow up on that. Can you just – at the end of last year, you saw
claims frequency also improve other than bodily injuries. Can you just maybe comment
on the rest of the claims environment other than bodily injury?
And the second question I had was around pricing. You're saying it's rational. One of your
peers reported recently and said that it was more competitive in January, February and
getting more sort of normalized in March. I'm just curious if you're sort of witnessing
similar trends?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, I think we're not seeing, at the market level, the same gradation or improvement
within those two two-month periods. Obviously, competitors move around their
competitiveness and, therefore, their volumes. So, some competitors clearly will be more
competitive January, February and March and April. Also, remember the backdrop, which
is the market does have some normal seasonality, which is price tends to be a bit higher
at the end of Q4 and then come back a bit in Q1.
Overall though, we're saying that based on what we're seeing as industry level claims
data and industry level pricing (00:13:30), we still think the two are kind of moving in the
same direction. We are actually quite pleased with our own performance. If you looked at
the ABI data yesterday, whilst their headline was 3.1%, if you adjust for IPT, that takes the
industry average premium to plus 1.1%. As you can work out, our average premium was up
a little bit ahead of that 1.3%. But we're also saying that actually we have some mix going
in our favor.
So our actual pricing was somewhat ahead of that, and part of that is reﬂecting the fact
that we're still behind where we were on young drivers as a result of how we repriced
young drivers post Ogden which we still feel happy with. So, we are quite happy with our
own performance. But standing back, we don't think that the industry had acted
irrationally. Now, of course, that's a backward-looking statement. And I make no forwardlooking statements.

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

And then just outside BI (00:14:25) in terms of just (00:14:25).

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Page 6 of 15



Company Name: Direct Line Insurance Group PLC
Company Ticker: DLG LN Equity
Date: 2018-05-02

Yeah, other trends continue. I think the accidental damage trends that we said which is
that is an inﬂationary line driven by both especially by the cost of repairing cars and with
sensors and people took the trip to the garage (00:14:41), remember how complex these
cars are now and how much the cost of repair and that's an ongoing underlying trend.

FINAL

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

And just to clarify, you said before that the 1Q abnormal weather didn't impact Motor that
much. You didn't see increasing frequency on that?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

No. A bit, we'll get over it.

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

Okay. All right. Thank you.

Operator
Okay. So, the next question comes from the line of Edward Morris from JPMorgan. Please
go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Edward Morris

{BIO 16274236 <GO>}

Hi. Three questions for me, please. First is just coming back to these comments on pricing
and claims inﬂation. On the one hand, you sort of seemed to be describing a fairly
rational market. On the other hand in your comments, you mentioned last year being a
very good period for proﬁtability. And I just wondered if you could sort of reconcile those
two things. Are you referring to any component reserve releases, or is there something
underlying that was materially better than expected last year?
The second question is on solvency. I wonder if you could just explain the 3% increase,
please, where that came from and if there's any further color there. And then the third is
on the VW partnership. I wonder if you could give us any detail on how signiﬁcant that is
in premium terms, perhaps. Thanks.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yeah. So, the kind of supercharged nature of 2017, part of it was we are not assuming all of
the positive experience will trend. So, we are going to say it might be just a lucky year.
Secondly, Ogden was largely paid for by the reinsurers. So that was helpful to industry
proﬁtability in 2017.
Solvency, Penny?

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Yeah, no great stories. We do an early estimate when we come out with the reporting
account. The process continues from there. All the validation routines continue and some
Page 7 of 15



Company Name: Direct Line Insurance Group PLC
Company Ticker: DLG LN Equity
Date: 2018-05-02

of the model runs are still running. So there's really no great story in the three points. It's
just the conclusion of the process. I think over time (00:16:40) we've run Solvency II, those
sort of estimates will get tighter and tighter but no great dramas or (00:16:46) risk proﬁle
changes to report.

FINAL

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yeah, VW in the next few quarters won't move the needle that much because it's a new
book and it will build up, but it's helpful. And of course this is quite a long-term ambition
that we have, to work with them, to really crack car manufacturer selling insurance which
has been a bit, we think, is a channel with opportunity. So, as we go forward, we'll tell you
more about it but we've got fantastic strategic alignment with their top team. They're a
great brand, doing really well, and lots of exciting propositions, I think, ahead for us to
jointly develop.

Q - Edward Morris

{BIO 16274236 <GO>}

That's great. Thank you.

Operator
Okay. So, the next question comes from the line of Greig Paterson from KBW. Please go
ahead.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning, Greig.

Q - Greig Paterson
Good morning, everybody. Can you hear me ﬁne?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Very well.

Q - Greig Paterson
Good. Good. Just probably some numbers. I was a bit confused from your last results
release, so maybe you can just help me with some numbers or make more comments. In
terms of UK Motor and the overall book, what was the year-on-year rate increase and what
was the mix impact? That's question one.
And question two is just remind me in terms of numbers what you thought the inﬂation
was in 2017. And I remember in March, you made some comments about what you
thought it would be in 2018 in terms of your 3% to 5% range thereabouts (00:18:17), et
cetera. Just if you could remind us of those and, I mean, excluding any excess of loss
costs when you're talking about the claims inﬂation.

Page 8 of 15



Company Name: Direct Line Insurance Group PLC
Company Ticker: DLG LN Equity
Date: 2018-05-02

FINAL

And then thirdly, in weather, how much weather – how many points do you think weather
cost or weather aﬀecting the Motor line in terms of increased frequency, assuming you've
excluded it from the previous one. And then ﬁnally, just – I think you did say this but I
might have got it wrong. What was your actual year-on-year rates in Home versus the mix
impacts just in terms of numbers.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Okay. So, Greig, just on the – we're not, certainly on the quarters breaking out rate and
mix, but we're giving you a directional sense. So, what we're saying is our headline
average premium of 1.3% year-on-year, that mix is going – as in we're getting (00:19:17) – is
less risky because we have particularly few young drivers. So the fuel price is somewhat
ahead of the 1.3%, materially ahead of the 1.3%. So, that's the ﬁrst question.
Similarly, we didn't give a number for inﬂation last year but, I think, we indicated it was
below the 3% to 5% and really quite favorable. Again, we're only a little bit cagey on this
because we think it is commercially sensitive what our inﬂation numbers are. Weather...

Q - Greig Paterson
That is gross of excess of loss changes. Well, obviously that was the (00:19:52).

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Weather.

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Weather...

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

...on Motor.

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Weather on Motor. So, I think weather on Motor very small really. So, it tends to change
the nature of the losses rather than the actual volume of them. So, a little bit, but not
worth taking into account.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

And I think your last question was rates price on Home which again we're not going to
give you numbers for but directionally...

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

But directionally, rates are directly oﬀset by mix. So, all of the ABP (00:20:29) is the oﬀset
between the two. So, we're comfortable with rate going up oﬀset by mix but...

Page 9 of 15



Company Name: Direct Line Insurance Group PLC
Company Ticker: DLG LN Equity
Date: 2018-05-02

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

So, Home and Motor, I think, yeah, the underlying like-for-like pricing is better than the
ABP (00:20:38) would indicate.

FINAL

Q - Greig Paterson
But you mentioned something on – you said your average premium was up 3.3% in Motor
early on, and now you've said it's up 1.1%.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

So, ABI market headline up 3.1% including IPT. ABI market including, adjusted for IPT up
1.1%, average plus 1.3% but risk adjusted better than 1.3% materially.

Q - Greig Paterson
All right. I wrote down 3.1%. Sorry. Dyslexic. Apologies.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

No worries.

Q - Greig Paterson

Thank you.

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Operator
Okay. So, the next question comes from the line of Andrew Crean calling from
Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Good morning, all. A couple of questions. Firstly, your Solvency II coverage ratio at 165%
is now 5 points, so about £67 million above the 160% which is where you tend to judge
excess capital and return and do special dividends. Does that mean, therefore, that we've
got about £67 million of surplus capital return moving into 2017 regardless of what
happens this year? And then secondly, could you talk a bit about Motor PCW. I know
you're trying to get the volumes growing there with the second pricing algorithm. Could
you update us on that, please?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Very good. Yeah.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Hi, Penny (00:22:21).

FINAL

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

I think for Solvency rate (00:22:22) in terms of coming into the year with ﬁve points and
that kind of headroom, the only thing I'd say is we've said we'll be around middle of the
range. So, don't take 160% as absolutely literally to the point. And it's early in the year but
yes we entered the year in a strong position.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Conceptually, maybe balance that in your mind against the weather. So, it's obviously up
to the board as well. Yeah, Motor, we're getting slightly ahead of ourselves with that
particular initiative helping us with (00:22:53) PCWs. We're still in development on that.
Very excited by it but it's – as we said once we've got the model, we need to deploy a test
(00:23:01) customers we expect (00:23:03) the accidents that we expect. So, that's going
to be within our somewhat medium- to long-term chart if you remember last time. But
generally, on PCWs, we're competing well. We're kind of particularly focused on it. And
so, we'll be talking about I would say more as we go forward.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

When do you bring the pricing algorithm in?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Let's be a little bit cagey. But I'm looking at the team doing – actually, I'm trying to get a
signal. Let's say, it's not that far away. But the ﬁrst thing we'll do is really just DRIPs
(00:23:38) and policies on one comparison website into the market. So it's still in R&D
mode, but we're excited about the opportunity, but it really probably starts to move the
needles in the medium term of the plan but we're still very excited about it because it
could be quite big in the future.

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi. Good morning. Good morning. Wajahat from Deutsche Bank. I have two questions for
you. So ﬁrst is on risk mix, so you have been reducing risk mix consistently for a while
now. And I think going back to the full year presentation you talked about steady footprint
expansion. So, I was just trying to gauge that looking forward, would you be putting risk
mix back on once your new pricing model is up and running, or is there a fundamental
reason why you're reducing your risk mix on the Motor book?
Secondly, can you provide more color on the market dynamics since the Civil Liability Bill
announcement came out? Are you still seeing a rational pricing environment in the
market? Thank you.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good questions. So, on risk mix, it's kind of the mask (00:24:49) that reduced our risk
footprint as we think scientiﬁcally priced the Ogden impact that has made us less
competitive for young drivers. So, it's not a desire to reduce young drivers, it's just mask
have driven it (00:25:02). And you're right, net, we would like to see – over time, we've
got (00:25:07) an appetite to write that sort of business, but we'll underwrite it when the
computer says yes to it.
So, we're not constraining anything. And yes, we do have some initiatives on who might
move to (00:25:19) stop pushing that out. So, yeah, it would be very favorable right. It
would be very helpful in this pricing environment and claims environment to be pushing
that out but we obviously won't – we won't drop our value obsession in order to do that.
So, it would be nice to see it happen, but it will only happen when the computer says it
should.

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

It makes sense.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yeah. And I think in the pricing environment, we're saying it has been rational. Obviously,
the market has got to make an assessment of – Ogden will be – it's once a year, you need
to make a decision when you see the reinsurance prices. But on the whiplash reform, we
have to make an assessment of likelihood of that be (00:26:00) happening, timing of it
happening, impacts of it happening. And we obviously have weightings of the three of
those. And then as you approach next April, it's obviously an increasing part of your
calculation. So, today, it's only a month of the premium that we need to get it right, and
then it will grow.
So, I'm saying our majority bet is that it will happen, and we hope it will happen in April.
There's lots to get done by April. There's a portal to build and test to make sure it works.
And then obviously, the impact depends on the exact wording of the bill and, of course,
how consumers and lawyers respond and adapt what they do. So, there's a bit of
unknowns in all of it. What we're saying is, as we see it today, the existing claims
environment that we're seeing and the future anticipation creates a claims level that we

think is supporting current pricing in the market. So, that all goes into this use of the word
rational.

FINAL

Assuming it stays rational, we'll be doing what we're doing. If it goes irrational, we will
keep our value focus very ﬁrmly on, and that will give us more challenge on the expense
ratio and expenses, and that's a challenge historically we met.

Excellent. Thank you.

Operator
Okay. So, we have no further questions in the queue. Okay. So, we just had another
question come through. It's from Greig Paterson from KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Greig Paterson
(00:27:41).

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Very good.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Greig Paterson
Just a quick – just interested in updates on the retail IT platform, where we are, timing, et
cetera. Is it going well or are we going to have another write-down at the half year?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

So, I'll be astonished and disappointed if we did. So, I don't expect that. Now, I think on
track, on plan, working hard, lots of people doing lots of work, pleased with progress on
track.

Q - Greig Paterson
Perfect. Thank you.

Operator
Okay. And the next question comes from the line of Dom O'Mahony. Please go ahead.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

FINAL

Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I've got three here. The ﬁrst one,
just on the normalization of margins in Motor. Can you just conﬁrm that, that comment
relates to the accident year rather than any reference to prior year?
The second, just on the Rescue and other personal lines item. I just wanted to sort of
understand what's really driving the sort of the long-term decline in partnership Rescue.
And also, just to hear if you have any comments on the (00:28:50) and the other sort of
the non-Rescue component of that. Any movements of note in that line?
And then thirdly, just a sort of a detail question. In a normal year, what proportion of your
weather budget do you normally expect to use up in Q1? Clearly, it's a big quarter for
weather but just is it half of the budget or is it more? Thank you.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. So, ﬁrst question, yes. So, Rescue is last time at the full year, we talked about kind of
three channels and we talked about partnerships. And the role partnerships have for us in
Rescue is purely volumes. It's very, very marginally priced (00:29:31). So, we don't really
have the proﬁt. We do it because having more drivers means we can have more vans and
we can be in the highlands and we can be near motorways more quickly. So it's not that
meaningful. That reduction is largely driven by the reduction in package accounts volume
where (00:29:48) it's a feature of package account.
So that's that. Elsewhere, there are some good business stuﬀ (00:29:55) in there. At some
stage we'll come talk to you about (00:29:59) business yesterday, we've got an
opportunity (00:30:01). There are some gems within that but we'll – that's forthcoming
attractions, I would say. We'll come and talk you about that. Penny, on the weather?

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Yeah. On the weather, I mean, we don't – we allocate the load but we don't really think
about it in those terms when the business is kind of helping people through the big issues
when they happen. We just don't know when those spikes will occur. So, I wouldn't have a
particular view on how we spread it across the year. It's academic. We load the ﬁrst and
fourth quarter slightly but it's not I would say particularly meaningful. We had two very
benign years last year where we took next to no weather losses, so just this quarter's term.

Q - Dominic O'Mahony
Thank you.

Operator
I guess we currently have no further questions, so I'll hand you back to your host to
conclude today's conference.

Well, terriﬁc guys. So, at some stage feedback on our new shorter format would be
appreciated. I hope you liked it with a new shorter call, so hopefully that's met your needs
and hopefully got a good understanding of how we are moving ahead.

FINAL

We can't aﬀect the weather. We can't aﬀect the Motor cycle but everything else within our
control I think we're doing well into plan. So thank you very much for your time and speak
to you again soon.

Operator
Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your handsets.
