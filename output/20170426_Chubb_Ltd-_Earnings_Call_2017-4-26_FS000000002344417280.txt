Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, Chubb had a very good start to the year
with strong results. After tax operating income for the quarter was $1.2 billion or $2.48 per
share, compared to $2.26 per share prior year, up nearly 10%.
As a reminder, we closed the acquisition on January 14 last year. So our 2016 first quarter
results excluded two weeks of Chubb earnings. For comparison purposes, adding those
14 days back in the last year's first quarter, operating income per share this quarter was
up 8%.
When discussing our underwriting results and premium growth, I will occasionally use the
term as if to compare our results to last year's first quarter as if we were one company for
the entire quarter and excluding merger-related accounting and underwriting actions. I
expect, as the year progresses, we will reduce the need to reference as if for quarterly
year-on-year results comparisons.
Our combined ratio for the quarter was simply excellent at 87.5%. That compares to 90%
last year or 88.9% as if we were one company for the full quarter. Total P&C underwriting
income of $783 million was up 28% or about 9% as if. The underlying current accident year
combined ratio, excluding cat losses, was simply outstanding at 88% and better than last
year, driven by a strong performance in our core global P&C business in particular.
Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $836 million, in line with the guidance
we gave you last quarter and up 9% over prior year or 3% if we include the investment
income from the 14-day stub period.

FINAL

Chubb's strong earnings produced a good operating ROE of circa 10% for the quarter,
while book and tangible book value per share were up 1.7% and 3.1% respectively. From
post merger closing to this March 31, book value per share has increased over 9.5% and
tangible book has increased about 16%. Bill will have more to say about investment
income, tangible book value, cats and prior period reserve development.
For the quarter, premium revenue growth was about in line with our expectations and
what we described last quarter. The same themes prevailed: strong retentions of
business; growth in new business over last year's first quarter, but constrained
nonetheless due to market conditions; a contribution of new business from cross-selling
and the strength of the organization; and a reduction in revenue due to merger-related
underwriting actions, including the purchase of additional reinsurance.
As a reminder, the impact from these last items, which, this quarter, amount to about 3%
of PNC net premium, should ameliorate as we move through the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

For the quarter, P&C net premiums were up about 13.5% in constant dollars. Foreign
exchange had a 0.5-point impact. On an as if basis, P&C net premiums were up over 2%.
The commercial P&C insurance market is soft globally, and conditions varied depending
on the territory, line of business and size of risk. Rates are flat or declining depending on
class of business, size of customer and territory. The rate of decline is slowing because
pricing in many classes has reached or is reaching unprofitable levels.
On the other hand, there are a few stress classes where we're able to achieve or hold
rate. Market terms and conditions continue to soften in a number of classes. At the same
time we are discussing rate and term movement, keep in mind that for the industry claim
inflation is hardly non-existent and pricing hasn't kept pace, contributing further to industry
combined ratios under pressure. And as you have noticed, in fact, loss cost inflation has
increased in certain classes, while overall reserve adequacy is starting to come under
pressure.
As noted in prior quarters, large account business, particularly shared and layered, is more
competitive than mid-sized, though middle market is incrementally more competitive,
particularly in the U.S. and Europe, as companies stress about growth and reach more
aggressively. Wholesale again is certainly more competitive than retail. Again, like last
quarter, certain markets are noticeably more competitive than others. London, Bermuda
and Brazil by example are particularly competitive, while in the U.S. and Continental
Europe, competition is a little less ferocious and a bit more orderly, but soft or softening
nonetheless.
Globally, new business remains harder to come by in what simply can be characterized as
a hungry market. Competitive new business conditions are ameliorated for us to some
degree where the power of the organization is brought to bear for a client or producer.
Also, our total capabilities in terms of product, ability to serve many different types of
insurance customers, our deep distribution strength and expensive geographic reach
means our optionality or ability to capitalize on opportunity is exceptional.

FINAL

And by the way, we'll only improve with time. Rate movement for the business we wrote
in the quarter varied by territory and market segment. Renewal pricing was down about
0.5% in our U.S. middle market business with exposure change of positive 0.5%.
In our U.S. major accounts business, renewal pricing was down about 1.5% with exposure
change of positive 1.2%. In our international retail commercial P&C business, pricing was
down 2%. By major class of business, beginning with North America retail, general and
specialty casualty-related pricing was down about 1%.
Financial lines pricing was down about 0.5% and property-related pricing was down about
3.5%. Internationally, general and specialty casualty-related pricing was down 1%. Financial
lines pricing was down 1% and property-related pricing was down 2%.
Now, with that as context, let me give you some more detail on our revenue results for
the quarter. In our North America commercial P&C business, net premiums were up over
19%. Normalizing for the 14 days in January and the impact of merger-related underwriting
actions, net premiums were flat.

Bloomberg Transcript

The renewal retention rate as measured by premium was 88.5% with middle market and
small commercial at about 87% and major accounts at nearly 94%. It is worth mentioning
that while the overall market is competitive, there are a few classes such as property and
casualty coverage for real estate-related risks, where one or two companies, simply for
volume, defy any logic and are writing at terms that will produce very large underwriting
losses in the future.
In these instances, we just walk away. On the other hand, where there is a flight to quality
advantage and the strength of our firm stands out, such as in our risk management
business, renewal retention could be as high as 100%. Overall new business writings for
North America commercial lines were up 16% over first quarter 2016.
In our North America personal lines business, net premiums written were up 13%. On an
as if basis and excluding the 5-point impact of additional reinsurance, growth was about
6.5%. Rates were up over 2% and exposure change added 3%. Retention remained quite
strong at over 95%.
Turning to our overseas general insurance operations, net premiums written for our
international retail P&C business were up 10.5% in the quarter in constant dollars or nearly
6% as if. Growth for our global A&H business was up more than 5% in constant dollar or
1.5% as if made up of 4.5% in North America, which includes combined insurance and our
group A&H business, and about 1.5% in international.
John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, and Juan Andrade can provide further color on the
quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends. I want to say a few words
about integration. Operationally and financially all areas of integration are on track or
ahead of schedule. Integration-related savings are directly contributing to our margins in
the face of declining rates and continuing loss cost trends, while giving us room to invest
in our competitive profile, including our technology, talent, product expansion, and future
Page 4 of 22

FINAL

operating efficiency. Total integration-related savings impacted our combined ratio by
about 2 points.
In closing, there is a combination of strength and stability in our company that is highly
attractive to our distribution partners and customers. Our people are intently focused on
execution of strategies. We have a lot of energy in the organization right now and a great
deal of optimism and passion. Personally, I am confident in our people and capabilities and
in our prospects near and long term.
With that, I'll turn call over to Phil, and then we're going to come back and take your
questions.

Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

Thank you, Evan. Chubb's overall financial position grew stronger in the quarter as we
continued to generate substantial capital and positive cash flow. Among the capitalrelated actions in the quarter, we returned $460 million to shareholders, including $320
million in dividends and $140 million of shares repurchased.

Bloomberg Transcript

Year-to-date through yesterday, we have repurchased $200 million. We also paid off
$500 million of debt that matured in the quarter. Our $1 billion of 2007 hybrid notes
converted to a floating rate earlier this month, which, at current rates, will reduce our 2017
interest expense by over $30 million.
Investment income was $836 million and was within our expectations. While there are
always a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income, we expect our
quarterly run rate to remain in a range of $830 million to $840 million.
Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $360 million, primarily from our
investment portfolio and principally due to decreases in interest rates. Foreign exchange
had a positive impact on book value of $118 million and a small unfavorable impact on
operating income of $3 million. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $1 billion.
Net loss reserves decreased $191 million for the quarter on a constant dollar basis. This
primarily reflects a seasonal decrease in our crop reserves, favorable prior period reserve
development in the quarter, and the amortization of the fair value liability adjustment
established in purchase accounting. After adjusting for these items, net loss reserves
increased by $319 million.
The paid-to-incurred ratio in the quarter was 91% after adjusting for the items noted
above. We had positive prior period development of $231 million pre-tax or $155 million
after-tax. This included $41 million pre-tax of adverse development related to the change
in the Ogden discount rate in the UK, which impacted our casualty-related exposures.
We also had favorable development of $79 million related to the 2016 crop year loss
estimates. The remaining favorable development was split evenly between short-tail and
Page 5 of 22



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2017-04-26

long-tail lines with the long-tail coming from accident years 2013 and prior.

FINAL

Our catastrophe losses in the quarter were $206 million or $164 million after-tax,
compared to $258 million or $204 million after-tax in the prior year. Catastrophe losses
this quarter were primarily from North America weather events and Cyclone Debbie in
Australia.
During the quarter, P&C premium growth was negatively impacted by incremental
merger-related underwriting actions and additional reinsurance of $187 million, impacting
growth by 3%. In addition, the alignment of accounting policies related to the timing of
recognizing premiums in 2016 for certain of Chubb Corp's foreign subsidiaries adversely
impacted the quarter by an additional $73 million or 1.1%. When considering these items,
P&C premium growth was 2.2%.
As Evan mentioned, our integration efforts are either on track or ahead of schedule. Total
incremental integration-related savings realized in the quarter were $124 million, leading
to total cumulative realized savings of $449 million.
On an annualized run rate basis, savings through March are $710 million. The operating
income tax rate for the quarter is 14%, which is below our expected range of 16% to 18%,
primarily due to a tax benefit related to our employee benefit programs, including the
required adoption of new accounting guidance on stock compensation.

Bloomberg Transcript

With that, I'll turn the call back over to Helen.

Helen M. Wilson

{BIO 2078659 <GO>}

Thank you. At this point, we'll be happy to take your questions.

Q&A
Operator
We'll have our first question from Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you. First question on the cost savings side (17:41) contribute 2
points to the P&C combined ratio. I just wonder do you see potential upside to the $800
million target and how much of that will flow through bottom line versus reinvestment?

A - Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

Upside to the $800 million.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

FINAL

We're right now ahead of schedule in our realization of the $800 million on both an
annualized and realized basis. We're thoughtfully reviewing where we are and we will
update our views about expense savings we will realize, both annualized and realized, at
the end of the second quarter when we do the second quarter call. At that time, I expect
we will upsize the $800 million, but beyond that I'm not going to give you any guidance.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

And how much was that flow through the bottom line?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

We're not – you know what, Kai? We're not going there. Substantial portion will flow
through to bottom line. It's offset by natural rises in our operating expenses. We're a very
efficient company. As you've noticed over the years, we control expenses well, but you
still have natural inflation in expense, then we have investments we're making in the
company in technology in particular. So I note that it seems that there is a
misunderstanding about how that works. Those are capitalized expenses, so you have a
timing question. And we hardly – like anybody, we hardly layout a model of here's how our
– here's the detail how our expenses look. So you'll figure that for yourself.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay, great. My follow-up question is if we step back, look at your earning growth
potential, you see your combined ratio is very good and already very good and premium
growth probably is limited given the pricing environment and buyback could help EPS a
little bit probably a couple of points. What do you see could drive the EPS higher from
here and what do you see as the sort of the earnings power for this franchise?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Well, I'm quite bullish about the earning power for the franchise. Margins as you saw this
quarter, the loss ratios naturally rise as you're in a pricing environment that is soft and you
have loss cost inflation. And that's ameliorated for us by both portfolio management
choices we can make in terms of where we grow our business, because we have far
greater optionality in that regard, which helps to mix loss ratio. And then, as you know, we
have substantial expense improvements that help margin.
Secondly, the organization did grow. The underlying – when you account for the
underwriting noise due to the merger and the accounting, underneath it all, we did grow
and that growth was pretty broad based. And in spite of the world we see, I see
momentum (21:50) what we can do internally, the part we control, I see that part only
improving and momentum building as time goes on, particularly in that middle market and
small commercial business in pockets around the world, our A&H business and our large
account business, which had frankly quite good growth.
If you look at our risk management business this quarter, it stood out because of slate
quality (22:24) and capability and stability that Chubb presents that frankly is a standout.
And then you look at our personal lines business that actually showed underlying growth in
the quarter. I am quite bullish over time about our capability to produce wealth creation.

Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. I first had a question, the cat losses unscreened pretty low this quarter
just given the size of the industry losses that we saw in the U.S., so I was wondering if you
can comment just on your exposure and did the greater reinsurance that you guys
purchased last year, did that help to alleviate some of the cat losses in the quarter, and so
when we think about Chubb is your kind of quarterly cat loss load lower now than it
would've been for each of the legacy companies?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No, the additional reinsurance that we have purchased really didn't have an impact on
ameliorating cat loss in the quarter. We set our appetite on cat losses as a percentage of
capital in particular. And frankly, the cat losses in the quarter, it's geographic, it's where do
they hit, and they happen to hit where we had less concentration.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. And then, can you provide – in your opening commentary, you spoke about
higher inflation for the industry. Can you give a little bit more color by line where you're
seeing greater inflation and what prior period would you potentially compare the
inflationary levels we're seeing today within the property-casualty industry?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yeah, I'm not going to go on that part. But, look, you could see it pretty simply. You see it.
Anything with wheels on it has inflation. That doesn't take a genius. And professional lines,
I would call out in particular, where D&O is experiencing more inflation and you're seeing it
in security class action in particular, merger-related objection in particular, employment
practices liability in particular, there is inflation. And you don't just see it in the United
States, you see it on other geographies around the world such as Australia, such as
security class action beginning in Europe in the UK, you're seeing more of that. So those
are two examples for you.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then just, Phil, the Ogden charge in the quarter, did that hit both
overseas gen and reinsurance?

Okay, great. And then, do you have a share repurchase update as of quarter-to-date?

You're welcome.

Operator
We'll go next to Jay Gelb, Barclays.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks very much. Evan, I had a couple of follow-ups with regard to your annual letter. In
2017...

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

You read it, did you?

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

With great interest. In 2017, you – I think – I believe you said we should expect growth from
Chubb in constant dollars even while taking to account the soft market conditions. I know
you touched on in your prepared remarks, but if there's any other insight you could add
on that, that would be helpful. Thank you.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yeah. I said to you that in the last earnings call, I believe that, look, first quarter would look
to a degree like fourth quarter. You'd begin to see the amelioration of some of the
underwriting actions we took, et cetera, and that minus 1.9% or 2% was less than you saw
in prior quarters.
Secondly, the normalized for all that and I hate as if and I hate noise. You want it just as
published and we're getting there. But the underlying of 2% growth is an improvement
and it's pretty broad-based to me when I look at by region, I look at the P&C business
broken down between its various segments, between its various lines of business, and I

Page 9 of 22



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2017-04-26

see a building momentum in that regard but offset by what you have to do in underwriting
to maintain margins.

FINAL

I'm not looking for this company to be publishing mid-90s combined ratios. And that
means you – on various portfolios, as pricing or terms reach a point, you have to be
disciplined and trade growth for underwriting discipline.
I think that we're showing great restraint and great discipline in that regard of underwriting
and, at the same time, getting more and more after the growth opportunities that you
put them all together and that you can produce combined ratios like that and grow on the
underlying at 2% or greater. That's a pretty good trick to me. And I expect, as I say, in
certain areas where we really see opportunity for that to continue to build momentum.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

It's helpful. Thank you. The other area of the letter that really caught people's attention
was the unfavorable comments on the insurance brokers. Can you give us some insight
there in terms of what issues you see as most problematic?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. You made me win the – I won the bet because of your question. I do – I believed this
question was going to come up. Look, I want to put a little context around this, and then I
want to just expand on my comments. And this is hardly some cause célèbre for me. It
was one comment out of a letter that commented on many things in the industry and
beyond the industry.
Chubb is an agency and a brokerage company. We are not a direct writer. This is our
chosen form of distribution. One of the reasons, one of the main reasons, I am a firm
believer that brokers and agents, intermediaries provide a necessary role in the selection
and market making function in our business. And if they didn't, then frankly, there wouldn't
be – there wouldn't long term be a place for them. In a market-based economy if you
don't really have a role that's necessary, you soon disappear. I believe it is a vital role in
our business.
And agents and brokers are our partners. In brokerage, it's more ambivalent. It's by the
nature of brokerage. They represent a client, an agency. They truly are an extension of us,
they represent us and they are our partners. My comments came about because I've
been in this industry for over 40 years. I care about this industry and I care about its longterm health.
I was referring in particular to the facilitization of business that I see predominantly, that
we see predominantly, but not exclusively, in the wholesale markets. And I think some of
that behavior has gone beyond what is reasonable. How does it work?
A broker, particularly in the wholesale area, will box up (32:32) – will collect a class of
business for efficiency sake into one portfolio; business that was placed as one-off risks,

Page 10 of 22



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2017-04-26

FINAL

particularly smaller or mid-size risks, but not exclusively. It could be just simply a class of
business. But they bring it all into one place and so there's a lot of volume.
And so, in the first instance, it's spoken of as efficiency, but that volume is used to attract
underwriters who no one comes with clean hands, who, for the sake of volume, will do
things to pricing and terms and conditions that aren't that prudent, that aren't sustainable
and that they otherwise wouldn't do when it's one-off risk plays. And then for the sake of
efficiency, it is more efficient for the broker to place it this way, more efficient for the
underwriter in some cases to receive it this way, but not in all cases.
Compensation goes up; price goes down, compensation goes up. What's the logic of
that? And frankly, in this world today, a digital world where there is greater efficiency and
greater transparency, what industry or business do we know about where prices are going
down, but an intermediary percentage of the dollar of what's being placed goes up and
that's what's occurring in the facilitization of the business.
I don't think it's advisable. I don't think it's in the long-term interest or even in the mediumterm interest of our business, of our industry. I don't think it's sustainable. I say it because I
care about the industry. And I think, like every other industry, those who are
knowledgeable of markets, who are knowledgeable of how to use technology in markets,
they will notice this, and change will come without a doubt in my mind.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Thank you for that. And if I could just focus on one separate issue given your position in
the industry, given the media speculation on the CEO transition that looks like it's
forthcoming at AIG, any perspective you'd like to provide on that?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No, I wish them well. I'd like to see a healthy AIG and I can guarantee you Chubb's ability
to thrive and to execute our strategy is hardly based around a competitor stumbling or
not thriving. And I'd like to see a healthy company. So I wish them well in their selection.

We'll go next to Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yeah. Couple of numbers questions. So I believe you said there was an accounting
adjustment on the premiums of $73 million. I guess it was a negative. Does that continue
going forward or was that a one quarter issue?

A - Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

It looks like it would also recur in the fourth quarter in the neighborhood of $50 million, but
the second and third quarters are immaterial impacts.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. And then beyond this year, there's no impact?

A - Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

No. That's correct. It will all be over this year.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

That's helpful. And then, secondly, on the administrative expenses in both U.S. personal
and U.S. commercial, that number dropped quite a bit from where it had been running for
the past couple quarters. And obviously, you're recognizing some synergies, but it was a
pretty notable drop-off. I understand that there was a pension benefit essentially versus a
year ago. And I'm wondering if you could break that out. We want to see how much the
number came down beyond just a pension change.

A - Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The expense savings, the incremental expense savings over the first quarter of last year
was $124 million. The pension change was not included in that number. That's an additional
$28 million that's been allocated to the units.

Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the call. We're past – a year past the deal between ACE and
Chubb and we have an ongoing soft market, what does that mean from a capital
management perspective? Would we see continued higher dividends and perhaps more
stock repurchases as the benefits of the deal come through?

Bloomberg Transcript

That's right, there is – Paul, maybe to go a step further, there was no surprise to us in the
landscape you just painted; there hasn't been a change to us. It's a year since the merger.
It's gone well. The market is soft. The market was soft, the market is soft; that's exactly
within our expectation. And so, actually, there is no change in what we see internally and
expected of ourselves, and there is no change in what we expected to the external
environment.

Q - Jon Paul Newsome

{BIO 3522950 <GO>}

That's great. What about the M&A outlook at this point? Again, you're through a good
chunk of the merger integration, do you think – should we expect to see you more active
in the market?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No, I'm not comment – I'm not going there. I'm not commenting on that. We have plenty
to do in not only completing integration, but in unlocking the power and potential we see
of this organization. And if we never do another deal, the value creation potential we have
in our hands is enormous, simply enormous from both the product, geographic, customer
perspective. God! Don't lose sight. This is – P&C industry is what? About $2.5 trillion a year
of business? We write about 1.5% of it, almost a rounding error.
And we have what? Something like 10 countries that we do over $400 million a year in?
Hardly excessive market penetration. And the opportunities when you put together, the
capabilities and knowledge of both organizations is simply stunning, and the only thing
that stands in the way is, you got to maintain – you got to balance it with underwriting
discipline when people are doing dumb stuff.
So, over any period of time, I look at this organization, we're going to win, and we're
going to outperform. And there are going to be moments in every micro market and in

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah. A couple of quick question for you. First one, I'm just curious, on the home owners
business, how much of the growth that you're seeing right now is rate versus unit volume
growth? Because I know you've been taking pretty substantial price increases on the
Fireman's Fund business.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

So, we told you – in my commentary, I told you 6.5% growth normalized and that there
was 3 points and 2 points between rate and trend. So rate and trend was about 5%
together and, overall, we're up 6.5%.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, just unit growth. Great.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

And Paul Grump – hang on. Paul Krump is going to expand on that a little bit.

Hi, Brian. It's Paul.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Paul J. Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

And just a couple of thoughts there; just want to note that the first quarter growth was a
little bit higher than the previous run rate because there were some timing issues related
to the integration and some of the impacts from ending the Fireman's Fund conversion.
So I think that the run rate is really long term, I think, right now. We're seeing around 3%,
4%.

follow-up on Jay's question; so the pension's all going through the admin line right now,

respect to kind of reallocation of kind of expense this year versus last year versus loss in

A - Philip V. Bancrof t

There was, there was. There's about $24 million that moved from administrative

Hi. Good morning, Evan. I guess I was hoping you expand...

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Good morning, Ian.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

... I was hoping you could expand a little bit on the comments on incipient loss cost
inflation and just what drivers you're seeing in the environment? And I guess if I tried a few
maybe to prompt a response, is this the delayed impact of more liberal judges
appointed? Is it the populism we've seen across the country showing up in the jury box or
is it something more close to home to the industry, meaning, say, terms and conditions
have deteriorated and things that wouldn't have prompted a lawsuit, now that plaintiffs'
bar sees a hole they can drive through and take you to court?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yeah. I'll come to that. Let me go a step further beyond professional lines and commercial
auto. We regularly look at portfolios and it happened just last week, we – a group of us
spent many hours doing a deep dive with our casualty folks from around the world, going
Page 15 of 22



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2017-04-26

FINAL

through all casualty portfolio, and giving updates on what we see in pricing and trend, and
our updated look at trend right now would say the casualty-related trend primary is
running around 4%, and so you'll say, well, that's not 5%. And we see the same thing in
comp by the way.
And so that's not zero. And that's my point, while it's still a little tamer than what we had
seen historically in the past. You take 4% that goes year over year over year over year,
and you got prices that are flat or down, well, do the math of what happens to loss ratio?
And you know what you do with the risk selection, et cetera, and portfolio management
or terms to alleviate that plus expense or your anecdotes. But other than that, it does
grind.

Bloomberg Transcript

When it comes to professional lines in your question, it is about the external environment
and I'll ask maybe John Keogh and John Lupica, who both grew up in the business to
speak, maybe give you a few comments, but I would tell you this. It's not that we're
seeing populism. Remember, this doesn't happen on a dime or appointments of judges
recently.
Appointment of judges that has occurred for the last eight years, you've stocked a more
liberal court on one hand. But what we're also seeing is a change in the plaintiff bar
environment. There are more plaintiff bar law firms, more boutique law firms who are like
ambulance chasers and out to make a buck, and it's a tax on society by the way. It's a tax
on corporations and it's a problem, where anything that represents any kind of bad news
that is natural exposure to any kind of business. And by the way, this is not restricted to
one industry like healthcare or – I read some of that and that's just not right. It's very broad
based. And there is not a merger that goes down where there isn't a lawsuit filed on both
sides; you pay too much, you pay too little.
And do these get settled, they settled for nuisance money, but it's still money and it
increases the frequency. And then security class actions around absolutely everything. And
then employment practices liability as an example has found its way into higher paying
jobs when it seems its part of layoff today that, okay, another retirement benefit you get
or another benefit you get is a payment from an EPL suit. That's the kind – that's just
what's going on. Now, I'll ask my colleagues if they want to add to that.

A - John W. Keogh

{BIO 2104739 <GO>}

Great. As usual – this is John Keogh. As usual, Evan, you kind of covered it all. I would just,
for color, make the point that when I was deep in the D&O business 15 years ago, there
were a handful...

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Did you say 50 years ago?

A - John W. Keogh

{BIO 2104739 <GO>}

15. Not that bad. It feels like 50 though. 15 years ago, there were a handful of plaintiff
firms that drove all the litigation at least here in North America. Today, when you look at
Page 16 of 22



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2017-04-26

FINAL

the list of plaintiff firms and most of whom are led by people who worked at those
handful of firms have gone out on their own. There are dozens of firms today, all of whom
are going to work every day with the ambition to make money and find ways to create
new theories of litigation, new theories of liability against corporate America.
And I think that is a fundamental change in the business that we're witnessing in terms of
the frequency of claims in the D&O business. That is not in my mind a temporary change,
it's a secular change. This is going to be with us and probably if there's a dozen more
firms the next five years that won't surprise me that are making living doing this.
And then outside of the U.S., in Australia and UK, they see what goes on here, the
lawyers. They see an opportunity and the thing I would add that Evan did not mention is
litigation funding. Whether it's here in the U.S. or in UK or in Australia, there are funds that
are attracting some serious money to fund the litigation in the D&O world, which
obviously creates more both frequency and severity in this business than we've seen
before.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Got it. Thank you. And if I could sort of tie that in and have...

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

(51:09).

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

I think you guys got it. Just to tie that in, Evan, with your comments in the press release
about the softening market, and when I think about sort of a true soft market bottom, I
guess I think more than just price. I think about terms getting worse and winning business
through that. We've seen, obviously, maybe one example is a program business where
are lot of people are starting to get burned and I kind of wonder if that's terms of
selection.
And the other is reserves. And just when I look at reserves, you see across most liability
classes and professional lines, a lot less IBNR than you would've seen three years ago,
five years ago. Do you look at those type of signs and say, boy, it's really maybe it's not
1999, but it's the seventh inning or the eighth inning and all the same things are repeating,
and it's more than just price or is it really just we're still on that pricing stage, and the rest
of it doesn't worry you as much yet?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Ian, I have been saying for five or six quarters or more now that I've mentioned terms and
conditions softening.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Right.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

FINAL

And I have mentioned the insidious nature of that because there's a lag before you feel
the claim effect from that. That impacts both frequency and severity. We see it beginning
to show up in claims around the industry. We see claims that wouldn't have been covered
by wordings in the past that all of a sudden become claims now because the wordings
have been broadened and we can see that in both short-tail physical lines and we see it in
– particularly in various casualty-related classes.
I think the impact of that is more in front of us, but the notion, when I say soft market, I am
not simply at price, I am right on term and condition. Remember, what we do for a living is
manage exposure and that's how we think about it. So wording and coverage, that's part
of what drives your view of exposure, then you're putting pricing against that.

FINAL

I can't respond with specificity, but I'd say this. We have needed tax reform for so many
years and American business requires tax reform, and if we do major tax reform, i.e. if we
move to a territorial system and we lower the rates, even if we lower the rates to 25%,
20%, it's going to have a major stimulant – and it's done the right way, it can have a major
stimulative impact on our economy. Not simply the cash that comes home but the
eagerness to invest. And growth, we ensure growth and exposure. Faster the economy
grows, the better it is for the insurance business, because exposure grows.

Meyer Shields, KBW.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. Evan, I want to jump off that recent comment. Are you seeing signs yet of more
new business in the U.S. from economic growth?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No. Not really. I don't – I think there was a – animal spirits were obviously awaken by the
policy direction of the new administration, policy direction that I personally endorse when
it comes to deregulation of business; less regulation. God, get government out of our
way.
When it comes to tax reform, when it comes to infrastructure, which will simply have a
multiplier impact on our ability to grow efficiently in productivity and the economy, those
are great things. I think that the reality that is setting in is that stating policy and
implementing policy are two different things, and it will take time to implement policy.
And at the same time, I personally and I know many were cautious about the stance we're
going to take regarding trade because that can have, depending on the stance we take
and the approach we take as a country, that can have a negative impact on economic
growth. And I think, right now, it's natural. The moment of euphoria is passing and I think
we're at a moment where there is a sense of realism. And so, therefore, I'm not really
seeing a pickup in economic activity that – a trend change that is impacting our business.

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Hey, thanks. So I just had a follow-up I guess just thinking about expenses. And I guess,
thematically, and you can correct me if I'm wrong here Evan, but is it right to think about
the integration processes, the job at year one was about the making the cost base more
efficient and then years two and three perhaps is investing to position the enterprise for
future growth. And then I think sort of – that's not the right assessment, okay. So, I need
to...

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No, absolutely not. The expense efficiencies that we're gaining from integration synergies
and all of that, that we told you how that plays out between – we gave you a schedule and
showed you how that plays out between 2016, 2017 and 2018. And that is on track or
ahead of schedule. What I said to you was on this call is that may get – that we're looking
at that right now. We could very well upsize that and we'll talk to you about it in the second
quarter. So, no, it's not like you put it in these neat packets.
The investments we're making, we began making them – ACE was making investments all
along and Chubb, in some ways, was starved for investments. And we're making and we
began, and I was very clear about it and I was clear about it to you on calls and I was clear
about it in the shareholder letter. And that is that we have been making investments and
continue to make investments in expanding product, in digitizing the company, and in
putting in place foundational technologies that will give us greater flexibility to move in
many directions, including lower cost. So, no, it all goes on at once, that's more how a
corporation works.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Okay. Understood. So, in the letter, the comment about the investments in digitalization
was not really referencing an acceleration of investment, just an ongoing part of an
investment cycle?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yeah, except that got a much bigger company now with more opportunities to invest in.
And as I said, some who were starved for investment. So, we are upsizing investment.
But, at the same time, given all the efficiencies we gain, we have tremendous flexibility to
