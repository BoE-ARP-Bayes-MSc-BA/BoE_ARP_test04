Well, thank you, Gabby, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.
By now you've seen our second quarter results, and as you can see from the release it
was another strong quarter contributing to a very strong first half of 2015.
We reported operating income of $806 million and an operating return on equity of
14.2%, bringing our year-to-date results to $1.6 billion in operating income and a 14.3%
operating return on equity. We achieved these results through strong underwriting
performance and solid investment performance, consistent with our expectations. Most
importantly, our long-term average annual operating return on equity now stands at
13.4%, well in excess of our cost of capital. This quarter is another brick in the wall of
exceptional long-term performance.
For all of the recent market commentary about the industry, our experience remains
business as usual. At the point-of-sale where businesses actually conducted, that is one
agent, one underwriter dealing with one account, things are very stable and just fine. In
fact, the commercial insurance marketplace dynamics over the last six months have been
remarkably consistent with what we believed would happen and have been far different
from the historical conventional wisdom. We continue to believe that the amplitude of the
cyclicality that our industry will deal with is much less than would have been the case
historically, and you can trace that comment back to our Investor Day in May of 2007. And,
of course, while things can change, so far so good.

Anticipating that some of you are going to ask us about our take on the recent
consolidation in the primary P&C industry, let me make a few observations. No primary
P&C insurer has come together over the past two decades through acquisition activity
more than we have. We're very good at it, and while we haven't announced any mega
transactions in a number of years, our shareholders should expect that we are aware of
the possibilities and that we are expert at evaluating them. That evaluation comes down
to determining the best way to create shareholder value. The return driven strategy that
we've been executing for nearly a decade now has been highly successful in creating
shareholder value. Our total return to shareholders over virtually whatever period you
want to pick is at the top of the heap.

Bloomberg Transcript

So when we evaluate M&A opportunities, which we do all the time, we evaluate them
against that standard. As it relates to Chubb, when we considered the modest
opportunity to improve the performance of an already high-performing company with
some of the best people in the industry, the high degree of risk inherent in combining two
successful but very different cultures and the significant impact on returns on equity from
the combination of the premium we expected would be required as well as all of the
required purchase accounting adjustments, the return just didn't measure up.
We have the luxury of a plan A that sets a very high bar, a strategy that comes from
having highly differentiated competitive advantages and highly successful business
franchises with industry-leading product breadth. Again, we believe that our total return to
shareholders over the recent past as well as over the longer term speaks for itself, and
we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver superior returns, but we do keep
looking at M&A opportunities, and when we believe there is a transaction that contributes
to creating shareholder value, we will make every effort to complete it.
Other than addressing the potential market implications of the transaction, which Brian will
do, I hope this addresses your questions on the topic. We really don't expect to comment
further on that recently announced transaction.
And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Jay Benet.

Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Thanks, Jay. As Jay said, we are very pleased with our second quarter results, operating
income of $806 million, up 20% from the prior-year quarter and operating return on
equity of 14.2%. Current quarter operating income was driven by a very strong
consolidated combined ratio of 90.8%, which was 4.3 points better than the prior-year
quarter due to strong underlying underwriting performance, continued net favorable
prior-year reserve development and lower catastrophe losses, as well as the inclusion of
a $32 million benefit from the favorable resolution of prior-year tax matters.
Operating income was also driven by solid net investment income consistent with our
expectations, although lower than in the prior-year quarter. Brian, Alan, and Doreen will
talk more about underwriting results in a little while, so let me say a few words about NII.
As was the case in the first quarter, current quarter net investment income is being

Page 3 of 24

FINAL

compared to a very strong quarter last year. Fixed income NII of $431 million after-tax is
down $32 million from the prior-year quarter, principally due to what we have been saying
for many years, securities that have higher book yields have runoff during the past 12
months and have been replaced with securities having lower yields due to the current
interest rate environment.
Another contributing factor to lower fixed income NII was the modest reduction in
average investments that resulted in part from the company's $579 million first quarter
2015 payment to settle the Asbestos Direct Action Litigation. Non-fixed income NII of $79
million after-tax was down $16 million from the prior-year quarter due to lower returns for
energy-related private equity investments. These investments produce negative NII of $9
million after-tax this quarter, which was better than the negative NII of $21 million in the
first quarter as compared to positive NII of $11 million after-tax in the prior-year quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

As I mentioned, earnings continued to benefit from net favorable prior-year reserve
development, which amounted to $207 million pre-tax this quarter, up $24 million from the
prior-year quarter. In Business and International Insurance, net favorable development of
$103 million pre-tax resulted from better than expected loss experience in several
different product lines, including workers' comp for accident years 2006 and prior, GL for
2008 through 2013, Lloyds in Canada, and property in both CMP and the property
product line for more recent accident years, partially offset by a $47 million after-tax or $72
million pre-tax increase to environmental reserves.
In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $40 million pre-tax resulted
from better than expected loss experience in contract surety for 2010 through 2013. And
in Personal Insurance, net favorable development of $64 million pre-tax resulted from
better than expected loss experience in homeowners and other liability for 2011 through
2014 and for non-cat weather-related losses for 2014, as well as better than expected
loss experience in auto liability for 2012 through 2014. On a combined stat basis for all of
our U.S. subs, there were no accident years or product lines that had any meaningful
unfavorable development this quarter or year-to-date.
Second quarter operating cash flows were also strong at $676 million, up $51 million from
the prior-year quarter, while holding company liquidity ended the quarter at over $1.7
billion, and all of our capital ratios remained at or better than their target levels. Net
unrealized investment gains were approximately $2.1 billion pre-tax or $1.4 billion after-tax,
down from $3 billion and $2 million, respectively, at the beginning of the year due to the
recent rise in interest rates, causing book value per share of $77.51 to grow by only 1%
from the beginning of the year.
Importantly, adjusted book value per share of $73.09, which eliminates the impact of
unrealized investment gains, grew by 3% during this time period. We continued to
generate much more capital than we needed to support our business, and consistent with
our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned almost $1 billion of excess capital
to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $194 million and common share
repurchases of $801 million, bringing total capital returned to shareholders to almost $1.85
billion year-to-date.

Before turning the microphone over to Brian, there is one more topic I'd like to cover, our
cat reinsurance coverage. As you may recall, effective January 1 of this year, we
significantly increased the attachment point of our gen cat reinsurance by replacing our
previous gen cat treaties, the $400 million cat aggregate excess of loss treaty, which
expired as scheduled on December 31, and the $400 million gen cat treaty, which our
reinsurers agreed to terminate early as of that date, with a new aggregate XOL treaty
that provides coverage for both single events and accumulation of losses from multiple
events, $1.5 billion of coverage, part of $2 billion excess of $3 billion after $100 million
deductible per occurrence. By doing this, we retain the same broad peril and geographic
coverage as the former gen cat and XOL treaties, while positioning the coverage layer to
provide a significant buffer between earnings and capital.

Bloomberg Transcript

During the second quarter, we reposition our Northeast-specific cat coverage, lowering its
attachment point from about $2 billion while maintaining its maximum recovery. Our
current combination of two Northeast cat bonds and the new Northeast gen cat
reinsurance treaty attaches at $1.058 billion of covered losses and provides $1.4 billion of
coverage through $3.1 million, the point at which the gen cat aggregate XOL treaty takes
over. Taken collectively, we increased our potential reinsurance recoveries and
repositioned the attachment points to more closely align with the risks in our business
while spending essentially the same amount. A more complete description of our cat
reinsurance coverage, including a description of new earthquake and international
coverages, is included in our second quarter 10-Q, which we filed earlier today, as well as
in our 2014 10-K.
So with that, now let me turn the mic over to Brian, who's going speak about underwriting
results.

Brian W. MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Thank you, Jay. Alan and Doreen will go over the segment details, but before they do I
want to make a few comments about the macro environment. Echoing Jay's comments,
we're certainly very pleased with our results, both in the quarter and for the first half of
2015. We're at a 90% combined ratio year-to-date, very strong retention, stable renewal
price increases, and no major surprises in our loss trend. In fact, results like this are what
we spend our careers hoping to achieve, and here we are. But importantly, we didn't get
here by accident. We did it with relentless and consistent execution on our strategies and
by investing in and developing a broad breadth of products and services and other
meaningful, sustainable, competitive advantages in the markets we serve.
But while we feel great and want to talk about how well we're positioned, I suspect many
of you are also interested in our thoughts on the impact that the ACE-Chubb transaction
may have on the marketplace, so let me share a few thoughts on that. First, we already
compete against these two companies, more so Chubb than ACE, given our business and
geographic focus, and we don't anticipate a lot of difference in competing against them
as a single entity. Any company that is large enough can disrupt the market if it's willing to
accept meaningfully lower returns over time. But both ACE and Chubb were probably
large enough to have done that before the transaction, so we don't see that risk being
any different going forward.

FINAL

Second, we have great long-term and trusted relationships with our important broker and
agent partners, and we don't see that being disrupted. We remain a leading independent
agency commercial insurer in our principal market, the United States, and in Personal lines
we are the leading independent agency market in the homeowners business, and we
don't generally compete in the high-end home product, which is Chubb's primary Personal
lines focus.
Third, having completed a number of large-scale transactions ourselves, we know that
there inevitably will be disruption and dislocation of people and business. This will likely
create near- and medium-term opportunities, and it's possible we will benefit from these.
Obviously, only time will tell what the long-term impact may be, but as I said before, we
feel great about Travelers. We remain very pleased with how our business is performing
and, more importantly, how well we are positioned for opportunities in this marketplace
going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

Before I turn the call over to Alan, I'm sure that many of you have seen that recently we
made some senior-level organizational changes, and I want to recognize a few of those
folks on their new responsibility. Greg Toczydlowski, who has done a fabulous job
managing our Personal Insurance business, is moving over to Business Insurance to
oversee our small commercial operation as well as take on responsibilities for technology,
operations, and business platform across all of Business Insurance.
Michael Klein, who had been managing our Middle Market Commercial business, will take
Greg's spot in Personal. Michael has had a broad range of experiences in his 25-plus years
with the company, and his management skills, knowledge of analytics, and our products
make him perfectly suited to run the Personal business.
Marc Schmittlein, who for the last 12 years has led our Small Commercial business, will
take on the role of coordinating our Cyber Insurance efforts across our business. We see
cyber coverage as an important opportunity in the marketplace.
Scott Higgins will assume leadership of our Middle Market Commercial business, and
Behram Dinshaw has been appointed Chief Operating Officer of Personal Insurance.
We're thrilled that we have this depth of management talent and the collaborative culture
in which great people can thrive. After all, in this industry, when we talk about competitive
advantages, we start with talent and culture, and to succeed, you need both of them.
With that, let me turn it over to Alan to cover the Business Insurance and International
segment.

Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Thank you, Brian, and good morning. We delivered another quarter of strong
performance in Business and International Insurance with operating income of $543
million. Our underlying combined ratio was relatively consistent with the prior-year quarter
at 93.1%, reflecting attractive and stable product returns. In terms of the top line, net
written premiums decreased by a little over 1% from the prior-year quarter. This was
Page 6 of 24



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2015-07-21

FINAL

driven by our International business where net written premiums were down 15%, primarily
as a result of the adverse impact of foreign exchange. Domestic Business Insurance net
written premiums were up about 1.5 points.
In terms of our domestic production results, as Jay said, we remain pleased with the
stability of the market as evidenced by historically high retention and positive rate change.
We've commented for some time now that as pricing has improved more of our portfolio
is generating attractive returns, and our objective has been to retain more of that
business. We've now posted a very strong 84% retention for two consecutive quarters. As
you can see on slide nine, excluding the impact of our large account Property business,
which I'll get back to in a minute, positive renewal rate change in Domestic BI was
unchanged from the first quarter. Our ability to deliver these results comes from the
excellent execution by our field organization of our very granular account-by-account and
class-by-class strategies.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to slide 10 in the webcast, in Select retention hit a six-year high while renewal
premium change moderated only slightly. In Middle Market, we posted a very strong
retention and steady sequential renewal premium change. Notably, within renewal
premium change, renewal rate change has been remarkably steady over the past five
months. In terms of retention, we're retaining around 90% of our best-performing
business while achieving renewal rate gains in excess of loss trend on our worstperforming business.
New business in Middle Market was down year-over-year. While we like the marketplace
stability, one consequence of a stable market is that submission flow is down somewhat.
In other domestic Business Insurance, while renewal rate change turned negative this
quarter, as you can see on slide 12 of the webcast, the decrease is driven by national
property, our large account Property business. Excluding the impact of national property,
renewal rate change in other domestic BI would've been a positive 1.9%. To put it in
context, national property accounts for about 25% of the net written premium in other
domestic BI, but only about 5% of the net written premium in the segment. Even with the
rate change in national property, current pricing levels and returns in that business are
attractive, and accordingly we have successfully driven retention to near record levels.
In our International business, retention continues to be strong and steady at 82% while
renewal premium change of 1.5% was consistent with last quarter. New business is down
over the prior-year quarter, primarily as a result of disciplined underwriting and a
competitive environment in Lloyds, and the impact of foreign exchange rates.
To sum it up, we're pleased with the stability in the marketplace and the results we
delivered in the quarter, and with the depth and breadth of our talent, particularly in the
field, our deep analytical capabilities and our market-leading products and services, we're
well-positioned to continue to deliver superior results.
And with that, let me turn it over to Doreen.

Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Bond & Specialty Insurance had another
strong quarter with exceptional financial returns. For the quarter, operating income was
$151 million, a reduction from the second quarter of 2014, driven by a lower level of net
favorable prior-year reserve development, partially offset by a favorable resolution of
prior-year tax matters. Underlying underwriting results remain very strong and well within
our target. As for top line, net written premiums were generally flat to 2014. Across our
Management Liability businesses, retention and new business premiums ticked up
modestly while renewal premium change was down slightly. So great results for this
segment.
I'll now turn to Personal Insurance, where we also had another terrific quarter with strong
underwriting results in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners & Other. For the
segment, operating income for the quarter was $174 million, up significantly from the
second quarter of 2014. Due primarily to lower cat and non-cat weather and higher net
favorable prior-year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio improved by
more than a point from the prior-year quarter, driven by favorable non-cat weather. We
continue to feel great about the margins in this segment.
Looking at Agency Auto, we once again delivered strong top and bottom line results for
the quarter and continue to be very pleased with the performance of this business. The
96.5% combined ratio for the quarter included 2.5 points of favorable prior-year reserve
development, which was driven by better-than-expected severity in bodily injury. The
underlying combined ratio of 96.9% continues to run in a range we are comfortable with
given current market conditions. This result was up modestly from the prior-year quarter
due to a variety of small items including non-cat weather, which although materially
favorable for homeowners was slightly adverse year-over-year for Auto. Our loss trends
remain consistent with recent quarters.
Production results also continued to be strong, driven by Quantum Auto 2.0, where we
are now coming up on two years since the start of the rollout. New business premium was
37% higher than the second quarter of 2014, and we continued to grow policies in force,
which increased more than 35,000 during the quarter. Net written premiums increased
7% from the prior-year quarter. So by all measures, great results for Auto for the quarter.
Turning to Agency Homeowners & Other, we once again delivered strong financial results
with an underlying combined ratio of 77.5%, a four point improvement from the prior-year
quarter, driven by relatively benign non-cat weather. Margins in this business remain well
within our return expectations.
As for Agency Homeowners production, we're very pleased with the progress we're
making. New business premiums were up 33% from the prior-year quarter and continue
to trend favorably while retention remains strong. Policies in force have leveled off, and
net written premiums are essentially flat from the prior-year. So the book has stabilized.
As we said in prior quarters, this is an area of high focus for growth, and we're
encouraged with the positive results we're seeing. So to sum up Personal Insurance,
another great quarter.

Thank you. We'll now take questions, please. Before we start, can I remind you all to
please limit yourself to one question and one follow up? Thank you, Carlos. Go ahead.

Q&A
Operator
Our first question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets. Please
go ahead.

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

Hey, great. Thank you very much. So Travelers has followed kind of a moderation in price
decreases we've seen across commercial lines, and so I was wondering if we could go a
little more into detail and what you're seeing out there. What's causing that headline
pricing number to moderate more as it approaches the zero level?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Randy, is Alan Schnitzer. I'll take that. You guys focus on the headline rate number a lot
more than we do. We're looking at this on an account-by-account basis, and it will build up
to whatever it builds up to. And at least in our performance, I think what you see is, as
more of our businesses reaching rate adequacy, our objective is to keep that business,
not to continue to necessarily get price on it. So it really is a function of more of that
business going over four years of rate increases to rate adequate for us. And what you
see in the headline number is just the aggregation of all those individual transactions.

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

But is there – I know we focus on that number. But it's important for us. Is there more – is
there kind of more consistency or more rational behavior in the environment? Is there
less? I mean, I know Travelers is a big company and there's a lot going on, I mean like
property for instance. But is there kind of less bad behavior out there in the most recent
quarter compared to maybe what we saw later last year?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah, so, Randy, I didn't mean to suggest that the number's not important. I'm just
suggesting we focus on it differently than you do because we're executing really on a
very, very granular basis and we're looking at it one account at a time. But to get back to
your other question, I think when we talk about the market among ourselves, and we talk
to our field organizations, we would say that, by and large, it does appear to be a pretty
rational marketplace, and it appears that there's a real return focus in the industry.

A - Jay Steven Fishman

FINAL

Yeah, this is Jay Fishman. I think that's absolutely right. And Brian spoke about it as well. It's
– any one company if it's large enough and is willing to accept subpar returns over time,
can affect the marketplace from a pricing perspective. That's not been the case. It's not
been the case for a long time. And now why that is, I actually think a lot of it is data and
analytics, and the fact that people actually understand their returns better than they did 10
years ago. No one would open knowingly say, well, I'm pricing this to produce subpar
returns. I think that happened to some extent accidentally, not intentionally.
And so, I think the data is different in the business. It's been different for some time. I get
asked all the time, are we pleased or not that other people seem to be getting good at
it? I think it's great. I think the more people understand the cost of goods sold in our
business and the risks associated with it, the more we look like a normal financial services
business, and less of one that's operating in the dark. So I think that we may have led this,
and I'm sure we did, but the fact is that you see it in virtually everyone's reporting, a
greater reliance on analytics and return focus. And that's I think what's causing it. We're
allowing it to happen perhaps is a better expression.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And, Randy, the other thing I'd point you to is that the rate at which insurance companies
by and large are returning capital to shareholders, and if you look at that trend over a long
period of time, I think you will see a lot more capital being returned. So to the extent
capital can't be deployed at acceptable returns, I think you'll see a trend towards getting
it back.

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

All right. Thank you very much.

A - Gabriella Nawi

{BIO 2211991 <GO>}

Next question, please?

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you. The first question regarding to the pricing trend. Just wonder if
the trend stabilized, will we see the margin also stabilizing at this level, or there could
potentially be some margin pressure relatively to the loss cost trend side?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah, Kai, it's Alan. Let me take that as well. And I guess it depends on how you look at it.
So let's just say rates are 1 point or 1.5 points at the moment. We've said that loss trend is
running at about 4 points. So if you're looking on a very narrow basis at the relationship of
those two things, maybe you'd say that rate isn't covering loss trend. But there's obviously
a lot more in margins. So you've got volume, mix, claims handling practices, underwriting
Page 10 of 24



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2015-07-21

initiatives, expenses, weather, all those things come through the margin every quarter and
there's always going to be movements in those things. So I would say that where rate and
loss trend are sort of too close to call where margins are going to drift over time, given
the current relationship of those two things.

FINAL

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

So non-cat weather benefits the quarter overall?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Non-cat weather in – well, weather overall in the quarter compared to the prior year was
favorable if you take cats and small weather. Small weather was about the same yearover-year.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay, great. Follow-up question...

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

You know what – Kai, I'm sorry about that. I was looking at the wrong number. There was a
benefit in the quarter in small weather.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Great. A follow up question on management succession. Jay, you have been running the
firm fabulous, well, like for the past 10 years, and you also like some management change
recently show you have a deep bench there. I just wonder, at least, what's broader
consideration about management succession planning?

A - Jay Steven Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Actually, thank you for asking the question. I'll actually answer it a little bit broader, just in
case anybody really wants to but is uncomfortable, because it's a perfectly reasonable
question given our announcement a year ago about my health status to ask about what's
going on. So first, I observed that we've been, I would say, as open as anyone can be
about my own personal health status, and more importantly, perhaps most importantly,
I've kept my partners and the board of directors here completely apprised and
knowledgeable as I've done along in that process. I'm very much on the job and fully
engaged. And at least from my own perspective, there's no decline in my cognitive skill.
Maybe others around here might disagree, but I don't feel that I'm struggling in that
regard.
Now we've always taken succession planning seriously, whether it was five years ago
when I was 57, if I did the math correctly, or now that I'm going to be 63 and dealing with a
health issue, it's no different. We take it as seriously now as we did then. And there is
absolutely a plan in place with certainty, I will tell you that, and for the moment, all good.
And when we have more to say about succession, and given the fact that I'm going to be

we're doing just fine.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. I guess one question may be for both Jay Fishman and Jay Benet, on the
capital generation, capital deployment side. I mean recently you've been deploying more
cash than you've generated when we look at operating cash flows and the deduction for
dividends and buybacks. Is that something that you expect to continue to do just given
capital efficiency that you're generating? And when we think about potential M&A or
capacity for M&A, or maybe a desire to do something, to bolt something on, does that
pattern need to change to be able to create more of a base to start from? Thanks.

A - Jay Steven Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

We're both going to answer that, because I think there are parts of it that are relevant to
both of us. I just couldn't have imagined accumulating cash over the last 10 years hoping
that there'd be an acquisition opportunity that would make that judgment with hindsight
look thoughtful. You all would have been highly critical I suspect of that, and our returns
would have been considerably lower. And one of the things I learned from working with
Sandy (33:17) for as long as I did is that if a transaction makes sense, you get it financed,
and that treating your shareholders' money like it's a bank account to just sit on is really
not appropriate. So I think we've done exactly the right thing, and when there is a
transaction that we want to do, we will do it. We will go ahead and we will do it. So I'll let
Jay speak more to the capital and it's timing, but philosophically we've done exactly what
we wanted to do.

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

And Jay said the key word, timing. In any quarter, our share repurchases are going to be
based upon what our views of prior capital buildup has been. So just because in one
quarter or series of quarters it's higher than what the earnings look like, is really not an
indication of a fundamental change in philosophy. It's still being driven by the creation of
operating income and therefore capital in excess of what's needed to support our
business. We will look for opportunities to organically grow our business, which will require
capital. There may be, as Jay said, some M&A activity that requires capital like we did in
Brazil or with Dominion. But overall, it's a matter of finding those opportunities that
Page 12 of 24



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The

provide the appropriate returns. And where we don't find those opportunities, we return
the excess capital on a real-time basis to you.

Thank you. My first question is just a follow up on the potential for industry consolidation.
The last major deal, I believe, that Travelers had completed was the St. Paul merger
around 12 years ago. And I just wanted to clarify that if there's a large deal that presents
itself strategically and financially, Travelers feels the right deal to do that, the company
would be willing to issue stock for that.

A - Jay Steven Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Yes, no question about it. I would observe by the way that Dominion was – for most
people, that would be considered a not insignificant transaction on its own. But I grant you
that the kind of mega transaction dates back to that one, yes. (36:56).

Q - Josh Clayton Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Good morning, and thank you for taking the call. So I wanted to talk a little bit about not so
much ACE and Chubb, about the company and so on and so forth per se, but just
generally, as the market evolves, if there's going to be more concentration in the
independent agency market, there's maybe some more competition that comes from
people that have to drive growth to pay for the revenue synergies that they promised.
How does that play out? You obviously have a bunch of claims capabilities and pricing
capabilities and you're sort of number one or number two with most of your agents. But is
there going to be sort of a strategic need to get larger to drive either greater market
power or expense leverage or something like that? Or should we just imagine that this is –
there's a lot of different companies and you're going to basically stick to your knitting,
looking at one policy at a time, and sort of keep doing what you're doing?

Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2015-07-21

Yeah, it's Jay Fishman. You answered the question at the end there. It's exactly right.
We're going to keep doing what we're doing. There isn't anything that we expect will
happen or contemplate will happen that would require any kind of change in our own
strategy. Now having said that, there's lots of companies that are out there, not just new
ones, but old ones too. And each of them operate every day and present their offerings
to agents and their services and their people, and we compete against all of them, and
we expect we're going to continue to compete against all of them, and I really don't
anticipate any change.
The funny thing, as I reflect on it often, about taking a lower price to drive revenue
synergies, is that the arithmetic doesn't really work. If you cut your rate, your premiums go
down. You want to raise premiums, you've got to do a whole lot more new business at
lower levels of profit just to get back to where you were. So the simple arithmetic of
taking a lower rate on a large book in the hope of driving revenue synergies is often a
fool's errand. Now it is a way some people can do it perhaps elegantly, but there haven't
been too many of them. So I suspect that the market will continue to think about interest
rates and weather and the cost of capital and all that it seems to be incorporating as it
prices its product with an unknown cost of goods sold. I don't expect a lot of change. I
could be dead wrong, but that's one person's view.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Josh Clayton Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

That's helpful. That's helpful. If I could honestly ask a sort of similar question but at the
other end of the spectrum, so six months or so ago, one of your big monoline
competitors in the auto side got announced the deal to get into the homeowners
insurance business. And, obviously, it's probably not material yet, maybe won't be for
some time, but this is a big business for you guys, the source of margins and it's been a
place you really invested, you build a franchise, but I'm wondering if there's some risk year
here either from losing some of the value you have with agents from having the bundled
offering and the market share that you do or I believe you guys distribute a lot with some
other with at least one or two other direct insurance companies, and I'm wondering if
there's a risk that you would lose some of the business if it becomes sort of popular to
bring the homeowners business back in house.

A - Doreen Spadorcia

{BIO 4883600 <GO>}

This is Doreen. I'll answer your question. You know, we've, as we've stated before, our
business strategy is based on account business and overall service to consumers to the
extent that certain company is acquired a homeowners capability. We think that that's
probably a good thing for them if we were looking at it. It's smart, but it's a startup, it's
very small. And I think you heard Brian or Jay's points in the beginning that we're the
number one homeowners franchise with independent agents. We don't take that for
granted. We're going to be very, very aggressive about maintaining that position, and so
while I think it's an interesting twist to things, I think it more validates what our view is
about the importance of the product to the customer.

A - Jay Steven Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

I would add one other. This is Jay Fishman. I'd add one other point. We really like the

We really do. We're not in it reluctantly, quite the contrary. The record that we've posted
there is really remarkable. I think if you look over the past now even 11 years or 12 years,
there was one year we had a combined ratio in the homeowners business in excess of
100% and that was actually 2011. It was Tuscaloosa and it was Joplin and it was Irene.
Other than that, we've been subpar 100% every year, and I – so we're in it because we
like it and we think we're real good at it. So it's okay. We'll keep going.

30 seconds. These are hard to do. They're hard from the human side of the news. People
get concerned about their own jobs, their families, their positions, all legitimate concerns
and lots of really good talented people, and it's hard. The people side of this is a very,
very hard thing to do, and that's kind of my experience. I never rely too much on revenue
synergies. I used to worry a lot about revenue loss. Our goal was to keep it intact. If we
thought if we could keep it intact, we were actually doing pretty good given some of the
pressures that emerge from it. So synergies, I have absolutely no idea. But, yeah, it's hard.

Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Please go ahead.

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, a couple of questions. First is, in the 10-Q, you give kind of an outlook for 2016
margins. I think that's the first time you did that in the business, kind of the underlying
margins. And you're suggesting relative stability as you go into 2016. I guess to read into
that, is it fair to assume you believe pricing will remain relatively stable through at least the
first half of next year?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah, Jay, it's Alan. So embedded in that outlook in 2016, we think there will be some
improvements in the large losses and the weather. But in terms of pricing, I direct your
attention to another part of that outlook where we do talk about renewal premium
change. We don't get into the distinction between exposure and price. But we do give
you a sense there of relative stability in renewal premium change.

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

That's great. And then maybe a question for Jay Benet. You talk about potential M&A and
that you mentioned that you could be – you would be able to finance it and not worry
about excess capital and holding onto it. But what kind of leverage do you think you could
deploy if it was a good, solid acquisition?

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

We operate at the holding company with a leverage target of somewhere in the 15% to
25% range relative to total capital. And we're running a little under 22% at this point in
time. That's consistent with our ratings objective. It's consistent with the discussions we
have with the rating agencies. If there was some transaction that caused it to go to the
higher end of that target range, I would think the rating agencies would be very
comfortable with it. I think that you could probably go a little higher if you had plans to

Page 17 of 24



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2015-07-21

bring it down over a period of time. There's some flexibility there, but that's the general
characteristic of a leverage ratio that we think of.

FINAL

A - Jay Steven Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

I actually agree, and I think that you could – of course, Jay is smiling that I agree with him.
I'm just going to make a little bit of a different point. I think you can take it somewhat
above the limit, recognizing that you would not be in the share buyback position for some
time. It would not make sense to be out issuing shares and then turn around very quickly
and be buying back. It doesn't make a lot of sense. So redirection of cash flows gives you
some leverage capacity as well.

Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Just a little bit of clarity on the net non-cat weather
comments, specifically in Personal lines. The year ago non-cat weather, if my memory
serves me, was a bit worse than what you might characterize as normal. So recognizing
that this quarter was better than a year ago, was it also better than what you would
characterize as normal?

A - Doreen Spadorcia

{BIO 4883600 <GO>}

I think for homeowners, it was. For auto, it was slightly negative.

A - Brian W. MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

So aggregate for the segment.

A - Doreen Spadorcia

{BIO 4883600 <GO>}

A - Brian W. MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Q - Larry Greenberg

{BIO 1712308 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. And then just to talk a little bit about the expense ratios, and I might be
microscoping things a little bit too much here. But it looks like in business and Personal
lines, the expense ratio has been trending a little bit higher this year. I know the year-ago
first quarter had some unusual workers' comp stuff in it, so that was exaggerated, but
adjusted for everything, it looks like expense ratios are marginally higher, and I guess I
Page 18 of 24



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2015-07-21

would have thought with Quantum and Personal lines and maybe the continued
integration of Dominion on Business and International that expense ratios might be
trending down at this point, so just wondering if there's any thoughts on that.

FINAL

A - Brian W. MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Well, Larry, this is Brian. It's really two different stories, but why doesn't Alan do the BI
piece in that segment and Doreen can touch on Personal lines.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Sure. Larry, let me start with that. So in the quarter, expenses did tick up a little bit, and I
would caution you that every quarter there's going to be things that sort of come and go
in the expense line. This quarter, we had a little bit of expenses – I mean technology
expenses running through, but I think what I would really point you to is the expense ratio
for the first half of the year, if you're looking for what we would consider, broadly
speaking, as sort of a reasonable run rate number, but again, I put a corridor around that
because there's always going to be things that come and go.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Doreen Spadorcia

{BIO 4883600 <GO>}

And I'll move to BI for a minute. So you know that we set out to take $140 million of
expense out so that we could price Quantum 2.0 at a competitive level. And that was
made up of separate pieces, so you don't – we won't see everything in the expense line.
We had about one-third of that from ULAE, a one-third from commissions, and then the
other one-third was our own operating expense. And I think what we're seeing with some
of that not reducing, is that we had a higher level of growth in a good way than we had
planned, so your acquisition expenses in terms of report ordering and inspections, all of
that really are upfront costs, and we also are having such a good property year that we
contributed to our contingent commission. So I think they're all explainable, and I will just
say that the things that we've done have allowed us to compete from a new product
perspective, so. Oh, and just to reiterate, I think we did a reconciliation for you at the end
of – for the fourth quarter and we did achieve the $140 million in savings. It's just those
other...

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks. So one question here. Looking at your underlying combined ratios in the
business, insurance area, pretty profitable, loss cost pretty benign right now, rate activity
is pretty consistent. I'm just curious, why aren't we seeing market share gains out of
Travelers at this point? And what are you doing to potentially pickup some market share? I
think this would be a perfect time to do that and maybe not so much with price but
maybe with risk appetite as well.

A - Jay Steven Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I love that you – it's Jay Fishman. I'll turn it over to Alan in a second, but your last line there,
I think, is right on. We just don't think that on the margin you can grow market share by
trying to fine tune a modest reduction in price. We don't have a price lift. And it's individual
underwriters with individual agents and individual accounts, and they bring with them
every day a philosophy, a perspective, and you can't say to them, I want you to cut price
by 1.5 points. They wouldn't understand 1.5 points from what. It wouldn't make sense. And
so the notion of fine-tuning pricing to achieve market share gains is an illusion. It's just –
we don't know how to do it. I'm not sure anybody else does either.
Now if someone is willing to accept materially lower returns, not only on new but on
renewal, because it will bleed over, you begin getting exceptionally aggressive on new
business, and what you'll find is that agents will get exceptionally anxious about their own
renewal book. And so you can do that, but it will have a meaningful, really meaningful
impact on profitability. So – and we've seen plenty of companies do that, grow revenues
with meaningfully declining, meaningfully declining profitability. Not a, we don't think, a
successful strategy. So we focus on product, we focus on people, we focus on technology.
We focus on doing, making it easier to do business with agents as growing our market
share. So if you look at our Middle Market business over the last – and I'm really going
from memory here, over the last I think 10 years, Middle Market went from $2.2 billion in
premium to $3.2 billion in premium. That's substantial growth in that segment as we did
that.
Now we've had other segments that have shrunk, and they've shrunk to some extent
intentionally. When we hit the financial crisis we took a very hard look at our Surety
business and our Management Liability businesses. And we had some, because we didn't
do everything perfect. I think about our attempt to raise rates in Quantum – pre-Quantum
2.0. So it's a very granular analysis, and I'll actually direct you to the Investor Day
presentation that we did, I'm going to say two years ago, where we presented an analysis
of individual lines of business and how they have grown, and others and how they have
shrunk. So we're always interested in growing. We're just interested in growing in ways

Page 20 of 24

that are intelligent and actually create value over time. And we work at that relentlessly. I
don't know if you want to chime in?

FINAL

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Not much to add. I guess I would point to things like moving Marc Schmittlein over to take
on the cyber project. That's an example of something we see as a real potential
opportunity. And when we find those opportunities, and we do spend a lot of time looking
for them, we will make every effort to try to make hay out of it.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Right, but I guess maybe where I was trying to go with this, Jay, a little bit is, is at this point
where we are in the cycle and where pricing and stuff an appropriate time to maybe dip
down into the E&S markets, an area that maybe you're on the borderline standard E&S
and try to get a little bit more risk appetite from that perspective, given where loss trend
is right now?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jay Steven Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

So, first, Fred is encouraging me to say, I said Middle Market in the numbers I gave you. It's
actually commercial accounts, so that $2.2 billion to $3.2 billion, so the record is correct in
that regard. The notion of the E&S market as a separate distinguished risk pool is just
something that we struggle with a little bit. We're always trying to push our risk appetite
out. I think about what Marc Schmittlein did in Select as he broadened the account,
broadened the profile of the business that we're trying to do. I think about what we also
did in Commercial Accounts as we broadened out the programs and products there. E&S
market, I'll let Alan speak to that more directly, but it's – we're always trying to push our
risk profile comfortably, and when you don't push it comfortably you don't bring
knowledge. You get bad results.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

I agree. We will push ourselves on a risk profile, but we will be steadfast on the return
focus. So whether it's E&S or anything else, we're certainly looking for the opportunities.

And the only – the reason it's not 100% is because there are some states...

Exactly.

...that simply don't allow Quantum 2.0 as a model – as a pricing model. So...

Q - Charles J. Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Where would those be?

A - Doreen Spadorcia

{BIO 4883600 <GO>}

Well, I'll tell you, we just rolled out California and Massachusetts. It's a new product, but it's
not Quantum. And we've got a few other states, North Carolina; we have to build
something separately for that. But even in California and Massachusetts, which we were
happy to bring them a new product because they didn't even get Quantum 1.0, it's a light
version in terms of what the regulators allow us.

And that's largely because of the inability to use credit...

A - Doreen Spadorcia

{BIO 4883600 <GO>}

Credit, that's right.

FINAL

Q - Charles J. Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Thank you. Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off. One additional question. I guess final, on the
M&A and the consolidation front, and how you guys think of opportunities for growth
internationally relative to the U.S. If I look at your book and the market share, market share
position leaders that you have in a lot and the recent transactions with Dominion or South
America, do you feel that the book or your business is more conducive to international
opportunities? And how do you weigh that on a longer-term perspective given the need
for return profile and the other things you previously outlined?

Charles, it's Alan. Let me start with that, and then maybe Jay will follow up. We certainly
applied the same standards outside the United States as we do inside the United States.
So the question is always, is the transaction going to contribute to our ability to create
shareholder value over time? So same lens for evaluating all of it. Given our profile in the
United States, given market share, the franchises we have, that same analysis might apply
differently outside the United States where there's just more GDP that we're not currently
accessing. So we like the opportunity in Brazil long-term, we like the transaction in Canada
with The Dominion, and we'll continue as we've been on this journey to export our
competitive advantages from the U.S. to other markets.
We'll continue to build on a platform that's scalable, and as we find those opportunities,
we'll again make every effort to complete those transactions but, so we're certainly out
looking for them, and it's the exact same standard we would apply to a transaction in the
U.S.

A - Jay Steven Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

And I'd just add one comment because we'd take it for granted. Sometimes you will
forget. We are not a Fortune 100 or 200 guaranteed cost casualty underwriter. We're not
a liability writer broadly, general liability to what we would call global companies. So when
we talk about outside the U.S., we're talking about local business. This is now Brazilian
companies or Canadian companies. We're very focused on the local environment. So
where the local environment has characteristics that would allow for another – either
another competitor to come in and succeed or an acquisition opportunity where that local
environment holds promise, we're ambitious for that. No issue at all. But it is a very local
evaluation, not an evaluation of kind of the global insurance market.

Q - Charles J. Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Does your product portfolio, and how you analyze the business within the U.S. lend itself
to being able to do that internationally in the same way? I mean, do you get the same
access to information and underwriting ability? Are there differences that have, I guess,
held you back from expanding more broadly or rapidly internationally?

FINAL

There are certainly differences between marketplaces, but we think our fundamental
approach to the business being disciplined about returns, being strong underwriters, all
those cultural attributes do translate. And we think that given the sophistication we have in
this marketplace, there's opportunities for us to deploy that sophistication in other less
sophisticated markets and make a difference but there are definitely differences market
to market. I wouldn't say that necessarily holds us back, but it is one of the things that we
assess and evaluate.
But I would also observe that there are differences in the states – in the United States.
Doreen just talked about our Quantum product and how we've got to tailor that to
different markets in the U.S., and we really take that same skill set of assessing our
competitive advantages and figuring out how to deploy them in markets around the
world. So that's what we've done in our existing footprint, and that's what we'll continue
to do, whether it's in that footprint or in new geographies.
