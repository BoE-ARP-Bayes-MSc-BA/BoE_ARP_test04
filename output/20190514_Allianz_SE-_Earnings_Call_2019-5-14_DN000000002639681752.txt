Thank you, Brian. Yeah, good afternoon from my side as well. And welcome to our
conference call. I keep it brief and over directly to Giulio.

Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Hi good afternoon and good morning to everybody and thank you for joining the call. I'm

Page 3 of the presentation.
As you can see we had a good growth, internal growth with 7.5% and this was driven by
the Life segment and also by Property-Casualty, and Asset Management. We had a
reduction of the revenue. I'm going to come back later on this development. But in total,
at least the growth rates of the revenue for further grow very positive, the operating proﬁt
is also up. This is mostly driven by the underwriting improvement in P&C as a
consequence of lower natural catastrophe, and then when you look at the net income is
also up compared to the level of the prior year period.
As you know, our outlook for 2019 is an operating proﬁt of EUR11.5 billion. So with an
operating proﬁt of EUR3 billion in the ﬁrst quarter, we are well on track to achieve the
EUR11.5 billion by the end of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now if you go to Page 5, we have here the development of the IFRS equity and also the
Solvency II. On the IFRS equity clearly we see nice increase of EUR6 billion, which is
mostly driven by the change in annualised gains and losses on investment, because of the
market environment in Q1. More interesting, I think the development of the Solvency II
ratio, which went down by 11 percentage points.
If you all remember, we didn't have the deduction for the buybacks in the numbers of
2018, and also we had anticipated 3% to 5% of model changes, so just adjusting for these
two eﬀects, the solvency ratio at the end of 2018 would have been closer to 20. So in
reality to the moment between 2019 the ﬁrst quarter, and 2018 is mostly explained by
these two developments. I'm going to come back one second anyway on these numbers,
are anyways on these slides. I'd like to draw your attention to the sensitivity, especially to
the equity market sensitivity and the interest rate sensitivity. For the equity market
sensitivity, we don't see any signiﬁcant change compared to what we've had before.
In the case of the interest rate sensitivity you can see that the interest rates sensitivity
down is more pronounced now, compared to what we disclosed at the end of 2018 and
then the major divider for that is the convexity on the current solvency requirements. And
if we go now to Page 7, I can come back again on the development of the Solvency II ratio
as I said before, because of the model changes we lost about 4 percentage points of
solvency there you can see the operating Solvency II generation, which is 6% pretax and
pre-dividends.
If you deduct the dividend and the taxes, you come up to a number of 2%, which is
somehow lower compared to the 3% we usually would have expected, but the main
driver for this is the higher growth that we experiencing. So in reality it's very much in line
with our expectation based on the growth that we are seeing right now, especially in
property casualty.
The market impact was minus 3% if you adjust for taxes that will be minus 4%, and this is
deﬁnitely a little bit higher compared to the sensitivity that we had estimated at the end of
2018. So, that will be the only thing where there was a little bit of a deviation from our
expectations, and then on the Capital Management, the minus 7% is mostly explained by
Page 2 of 25

FINAL

the dividend and by the buyback. So in total, we have a Solvency ratio of 218, which is a
very comfortable level.
So from a capital ﬂexibility point of view, we have clearly the same capital ﬂexibility that
we had before and again, the majority today the delta compared to the end of the year
was largely anticipated due to the buybacks and the model changes. And now we can
turn the Page 9, where we show the numbers for Property-Casualty, and we see on a total
Property-Casualty level that we have an internal growth of 4.6%. This 4.6% internal growth
-- 40% is driven by price and 60% is driven by volume. Second point is, we can see that
practically growth across the board, I will say, except for a few entities all companies are
growing. And also when we look at the pricing environment moving forward, in general
we dealing with pricing environments which is either stable or positive, so from that point
of view, the pricing environment should support our performance as we go through the
rest of 2019.

Bloomberg Transcript

At Page 11, we show the development of the operating proﬁt. And as you can see the
operating proﬁt increased by 14%, and this is driven by the development of the
underwriting results and to be more speciﬁc by the improvement in the combined ratio,
which is mostly driven by the NatCats-- loans, which is lower compared to what we had
last year. Also we have an improvement of the expense ratio, as you see, the runoﬀ is
stable. What went against us in Q1 was the development of the large losses. When we
analyze the numbers we removed the impact of natural catastrophe or large losses and
weather-related losses. The real attritional loss ratios are pretty much stable compared to
the level that we had one year ago.
So all-in-all, anyway the combined ratio, which is positive compared to what we had last
year, not just because of the natural catastrophe. But we continue to work also on our
expense ratio. Moving to Page 13, we can see the breakdown of the operating
performance by entities. We had very good performance in Germany and improvement is
driven not only by lower natural catastrophe, but also a better development of the
expense ratio and also lower large losses. In France, we see also numbers moving in the
right direction. In the case of Italy where you see an improvement compared to the prior
year period.
This improvement is all explained by the removal Genialloyd, which is now part of Allianz
Direct. Adjusting for that combined ratio in Italy will be for be ﬂat and at a very low level.
Then, in the case of Spain, you can see a swing and that's due to positive annual growth in
2018, which is now turning negative in the ﬁrst quarter. And then when you go down the
list in Turkey, you can see a higher combined ratio, but this is all driven by the inﬂation
environment, which is oﬀset in the investment income and then the AGCS looks worse
compared to last year but we need to keep in mind that last year, at year-end the
combined ratio AGCS was over 100%.
So from that point of view this is the level of performance that we are currently
experiencing at AGCS. And then, very good results both at Allianz Partners and especially
at Euler Hermes. So all in all, I will say that our numbers sound positive. Some room for
improvement, but in general our portfolio is doing pretty, pretty ﬁne. At Page 15, just a

Page 3 of 25

short comment on the investment income-- is resilient. In reality it is even going up a little
bit in the ﬁrst quarter '19 versus the level of last year.

FINAL

So the resilience, and today we are welcoming because we always anticipating some
reduction of the investment results, but for the time being, we see that is more resilience
in this position, than usually we tend to anticipate.
And with that I will come to Page 17, to speak about our Life segment. First of all on the
production, you can see that is a nice increase in the present value of Business Premium,
which is about 17% -- 18%. It is mostly driven by Germany. And also we had a very good
growth rate in the USA. Also in the Benelux, we had a nice development.

Bloomberg Transcript

And just in Italy, in Asia Paciﬁc, we had some reduction of production. But in general,
we're very, very pleased with the growth that we're experiencing in the life business. And
what is also important is the margins going up, so we had also an increase in margin by
20 basis points. And as you can see the margins going up also, or at least stable in all
segments within the Life business.
If we go now to Page 19, you see the development of the operating proﬁt, which is up to
2.5%. As you may remember, our outlook for 2019 is EUR4.2 billion so we have an
operating proﬁt of EUR1.1 billion. We are good on track to get to the EUR4.2 billion by the
end of the year, what you can see in the waterfall is a reduction of the investment margin
which to a certain degree is also expected, and this is more than oﬀset by loadings and
fees. And also we have a positive impact of change in Deck. Here there clearly many
drivers, but one driver is that in the benign environment of Q1, the VA business in the US
is performing pretty, pretty nicely. And this is, this is leading to positive Deck to up
because of the capital market performance.
So in all EUR1.1 billion. So good operating proﬁt for the quarter. If you move to Page 21, on
the value of new business, you can see an increase in value of new business of 25% which
is clearly the consequence of the higher production and also improved new business
margin. When you look at the single entities, you can see widespread improvement on
the value of new business. And when we look at the operating proﬁt we will be focusing
only on the three largest, if you want, the three top companies on the table. In the case of
Germany Life you see there is more reduction, this is more a normalization, because the
operating proﬁt level in the ﬁrst quarter of the last year was higher than what we would
normally expect.
In the case of the USA it is the opposite, you're seeing an increase because the operating
proﬁt was too low in the ﬁrst quarter 2018. Then in the case of Asia Paciﬁc you can see an
improvement, which is was driven by the growth that we have in Asia, but then also driven
by the fact that we don't add the drag of the legacy book in Taiwan anymore. And with
that at Page 23, we have our regular, if you want, deep dive on the investment margin.
When you look at investment margin, ﬁrst of all, you can see that the current yield is going
down just slightly and more or less in line with the minimum guarantees, so from a spread
point of view, there is a lot of stability, what has gone up in the ﬁrst quarter 2019 versus
what we had last year is the proﬁt sharing. So, to this point this is always a metric that to a

Page 4 of 25

FINAL

certain degree, we can't control, because we are not necessarily crediting at the minimum
policy. We are not at a maximum policy or the participation, especially in the German
business. Also there is this a bit in the US business.
When we look at the '19 basis points of investment margin. This is slightly below, if you
annualize the number, our guidance of 80 to 85 basis points for the year. Here we need to
see two things, ﬁrst of all how this is going to develop in the following quarters, but I will
also like to draw your attention on that the aggregate policy reserves have increased
substantially. So from a from a volume point of view, there is oﬀset that we have a higher
exit basis if you want, which should not shouldn't be neglected, because at the end of the
day what counts is the multiplication between the asset base and the investment margin.
And with that, we can move to Asset Management at Page 25. As you can see the assets
under management for third-party have increased by about 8%, and clearly here both the
improvement due to the market, including the F/X eﬀect and the consolidation of Gurtin
have played a role in bringing the number up, but also you can see, we had positive
inﬂows of about EUR18 billion, slightly negative with AGI but largely positive over EUR20
billion PIMCO. So that's a nice development, but you remember that the last quarter of
2018 was kind of challenging for PIMCO, but we were always conﬁdent about the ﬂows
moving forward. So we see, we saw a nice ﬂows at PIMCO in the ﬁrst quarter 2019. When
we move to Page 27, we see that the revenue is stable, but if you adjust for the F/X eﬀects
we are down about 5%, This is driven by PIMCO, and here we have also a one-oﬀ. I'm sure
you're going to ask me a few questions about this one-oﬀ in the Q&A. So I'll leave it to
questions I'm going to get. And also, we should not forget that the asset basis in 2019 in
the ﬁrst quarter was slightly below the level of last year, because of what happened
during the fourth quarter and then there are some other technical eﬀects explain the the
drop in revenue on the-- adjusted for F/X eﬀect at PIMCO.
The investment margin, or the fee margin is also a little bit lower. Here there is also the
impacts of the technical eﬀects and one-oﬀ, I was referring to. In reality, if you adjust the
fee margin for these eﬀects it's pretty stable compared to the level of last year. With that
we can go to Page 29. So the operating proﬁt for the asset management segment is about
10% below the prior level, if you adjust for F/X eﬀects.
This development is all driven by PIMCO and here, there are three eﬀects, at the end of
the day. One is the one-oﬀ, which is by the way, a good thing because is going to
produce revenue and proﬁt moving forward. Then we have also the Fed -- the revenue
basis was lower because of the lower asset bases. And then the cost-income ratio in the
ﬁrst quarter 2018 was with 56.6. if you want, a little bit too low compared to what will be a
normal expectation for PIMCO.
So in total anyway for the segment we have about EUR600 million operating proﬁt. Our
guidance for the year is EUR2.5 billion of operating proﬁt, and we feel pretty conﬁdent
that we're going to achieve that EUR2.5 billion, considering that the asset base as we're
going into Q2, is higher compared to the level that we had in Q1. Considering that the
famous one-oﬀ I'm referring to is going also to create revenues starting in Q2, and also
considering that performance fees, which are a driver performance for our Asset
Management operations are coming usually later in the course of the year. So we are
Page 5 of 25

FINAL

pretty conﬁdent we're going to achieve our EUR2.5 billion of operating proﬁt for the
segment.
Page 31 is just the development of the corporate segments which is getting slightly better
compared to the prior period, and I will say we can go straight to Page 33, where we show
as usual the development of the non-operating items. I will say there is just two
comments, one is the realized gains and losses are lower compared to the prior year
period, and impairments are stable. So there is no speciﬁc reason for the lower realized
gains and losses compared to the prior year period. And then on the tax rates, you can
see it is at 25% which is somehow at the low end of our range of 25% to 27%.
All in all, with the net income to almost EUR2 billion for the quarter I would say we have a
very strong bottom line results, which is mostly driven by the performance -- the operating
performance that we discussed before.
So the last slide is just a summary for you. So good revenue growth, good operating proﬁt
growth, so we can see a lot of strengths in many KPIs and in a lot parts of our business. So
we are looking forward to a good 2019. And with that, I would like to open up to your
questions.

Questions And Answers

Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We'll now take our ﬁrst question from Peter Eliot from
Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead, your line is open.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. I have three questions please. The ﬁrst one Giulio, was on the
solvency development. I mean, you mentioned the two reasons that I guess the ratio
missed lots of our estimates, which was the convexity of the sensitivities and also the
operating result. I mean on convexities, the interest rate sensitivity is now back up to your
targets of 11 percentage points. I'm just wondering to what extent the does the sensitivity
increase for even lower rates and on the operating, I'm just wondering if we could have a
little bit more color. I mean, you mentioned the growth in non-Life being attributable, but
actually the growth is less than it was across 2018.
The guidance seems to have come down a little bit, but not massively considering you're
basically guiding to 8 percentage points for the rest of the year. So I'm just wondering to
what extent is what we're seeing in Q1 sort of one-oﬀ eﬀects and to what extent is it
ongoing? That was the question.
This question is much shorter. Second question was, I was intrigued by the impact of
Allianz Technology. I, just wondering if you could elaborate on that, whether it has helped
the corporate segment. And the third question, Asset Management ﬂows -- Just
wondering if you could give us an update on Q2-to-date. Thank you very much.

FINAL

Okay. Thank you, Peter for your questions. Maybe we can start from the Asset
Management ﬂows and then we go way up to the ﬁrst question. Asset Management ﬂows,
we are seeing good ﬂows also in the second quarter. So on a net basis, we should be
about, about EUR10 billion net ﬂows, which are mostly driven by PIMCO.
So we see nice ﬂows in the ratio of PIMCO. In the case of AGI we are still not in the
positive area, but in total for the growth we are speaking of positive net ﬂows of about
EUR10 billion for the ﬁrst six weeks of 2019 for the second quarter. For the Allianz
Technology, the question about the Allianz Technology. Yes, the numbers are getting
better. So this is the driver for the improvement in the corporate segments. Allianz
Technology is the company that has been carrying out a lot of our projects and
transformation projects, and clearly when you do these transformational projects, you
cannot always capitalize all kind of expenses, so now is that was a drag in the past. And
now we see that this drag is coming down, because now Allianz Technology is more
getting the revenue out of the transformation project instead of being heavily in the
investment phase.
So that just is a natural development, if you want into the business model of Allianz
Technology. Then you have the question on the Solvency II or two questions on the
Solvency II. One was on the capital generation -- organic capital generation. And on that
one, I will say ﬁrst of all that is also one one-oﬀ that is included in the capital generation, is
the development of the risk margin, which is in the P&C side, which is going up and that's
driven by the change in interest rates, we are not showing these impacts needing a
sensitivity and we are not showing markets impact, we're showing these in the organic
capital generation. So this is nearly something which is costing and little bit of the capital
generation for the quarter on the operating side, but then I would also say that we have
reﬁned our also calculation for the business evolution. So right now, what we do
consistently, we apply a 30% charge to our premium.
So it is if you will, a growth in premium. So in the future going to be able to track, very
easily cut clear consumption on the P&C side. This is consistent with the, how we
addressed the issue in the Capital Market Day. So there is, from that point of view also
some reﬁnement we are doing to the methodology.
If the growth rate is going to go down from the almost 5% level that we see now to the 3%
level, you're going to see capital generation back to the 3% level. This said, honestly
speaking, we have a 3% capital generation per quarter, or 2% capital generation per
quarter-- it doesn't make a big diﬀerence. And if I have to choose, as long as a growth that
we do is proﬁtable, I'd rather go for the proﬁts than having 8% or 10% capital generation,
or 11% on the Solvency II per annum, doesn't make honestly speaking a big diﬀerence. So
we are happy to the growth, and we have a little bit less capital generation those
additional that's that's totally ﬁne. And then you had a question about the convexity. Yes, I
would say if rates go down, further, you will see the convexity picking up. The convexity is
constantly picking up and usually go down as the rates are going down. The only point to
note is the boons was at minus 9 basis points at the end of Q1. So there is most likely a
limit to how much the interest rates can go down. So I will not exclude it can go down a
little bit further. But I believe we are approaching the limit to how much down they can
Page 7 of 25



Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2019-05-14

that can go. But technically speaking, yes the convexity is picking up as we go down the,
that is the interest rates are going down, you can see that those in our sensitivity our
sensitivity or the way down was minus 4 at the end of the year, and now we're basis on
minus 8.

FINAL

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

That's great, Giulio, thank you very much. I completely agree on the capital generation.
Can I just quickly clarify on the Allianz Technology, it sounds like that result is fully
sustainable and might actually even improve from here, going forward. Is that the right
interpretation? From what you've said?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yes, the interpretation of the reality, yeah. We want to improve the performance of the
Allianz Technology over the next two, three years. So absolutely the direction should be a
positive direction from here.

Q - Peter Eliot

We will now take our next question from Michael Huttner from JPMorgan. Please go
ahead, your line is open.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thank you so much. This is a bit boring for you probably. On the solvency, I just wanted to
clarify because I missed I missed a bit, the guidance at the moment, for the year is 8% and
if we were to have lower growth, we would go to 11. That's the question. And the other
one is I am a little surprised at this slightly lower guidance given the life business is
producing so much new business value that I think is included. I think it's EUR100 million
higher this year than last. So I am wondering if I'm missing a moving part, a negative
moving part to explain this lower guidance?
And then just a little bit of color on the German Motor my favorite topic. Can you say
speak a bit about maybe the pricing and competition environment. The reason I ask, is I
think for you, the pricing was positive. But all your peers well, some of your peers -- AXA
and Amex, reported negative and I'm a bit surprised. Thank you.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yeah, so on the Solvency II ratio. I will say that's assuming that the current kind of growth
rates and also adjusting for the risk margin, I would expect that by the end of the year, we
Page 8 of 25

FINAL

might be at the 10% level. So that will be still my by guidance for 2019, then depending on
the acceleration or deceleration of the growth rate, we might end up a little bit better or
worse than that.
So fundamentally the guidances still for 10% but eventually wouldn't be a drama if we end
up with a capital generation of 8% just because we are growing very strongly. But the
guidance is about 10% for for 2019. Then you had a question about the German Motor. So
I can just tell you that deﬁnitely, we saw some more competition in in the German Motor
business. Our combined ratio, we ﬁgure it anyway, rates improvement. In the reality we're
pushing a few less on growth, because clearly we are always adjusting our appetite
depending what the market conditions are.
So if you're looking in detail our growth in Motor this year is less compared to the growth
in Motor we had last year because we are not focused on growth for the sake of growth,
at the end of the a day, we want to have a proﬁtable growth and the combined ratio I can
tell you, is pretty, pretty solid.

We will now take the next question from Vinit Malhotra with Mediobanka, Jeﬀ. Please go
ahead, your line is open.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes, good afternoon. Thank you very much. So, just coming back on the growth topic. If I
can ask one on Life, one on P&C, and then also on a third question on AGI outlook please.
First, on the growth in German Life I mean the kind of numbers you're producing in the
savings and annuities and not in capital eﬃciency are quite remarkable. Seems to be
coming from corporate business, but not aﬀecting the new business margin as well.
So is this in some kind of a new initiative, or is it-- and also, could you comment on-- well it
is large corporate, it's not aﬀecting NBN. Then in B and C there is in Italy a remarkable
8.4% growth number which we found quite exciting. Could you just help us understand
because it's obviously not coming from the direct side and traditional Motor, looks like,
can you comment on that? And then on AGI outﬂows. I mean, you said there was a small
outﬂow, but it was one of the biggest outﬂows in many, many quarters now. How is it? Is it
performance induced? And because actually it was very strong the increase in AGI ﬂows
was strong-- and just help us understand how that is? Thank you.

Yeah, so I can start from the life growth in Germany is not a new strategy and we have
situations where in the quarter, we might have more large contracts. So this has happened
also in the past in the past I believe. What is kind of eye-catching now is that you had the
combination of natural growth also in our Capital-Life products. And on top of that, we are
getting also these large contracts, but there is no new strategy. I also believe that in the
course of the year, you're going to see some sort of normalization. With respect to the
performance of this business-- the business margin is still healthy. We are still making our
target pricing, which is in this business.
So we are not sacriﬁcing performance, and one thing that you need to consider is, every
time we are the growing also the where we are. There is also a cost advantage. Right. So
the get also better cost margins. So the end of the day, always think that's the proﬁtability
of our Life business is not only driven by the investment margin, but there is also a
technical component. The cost component, that's the reason why it's absolutely proﬁtable
growth. What we are getting in Germany. And also think about that. We even adjusting for
these gross costs, our growth rate will be north of 20%. So what will be the reason to
chase big contracts if we are anyway growing a lot.
So I would not have any concern on the proﬁtability of business for Germany Life. In the
case of P&C and Italy, you notice the 8% growth, which is driven by an accounting change
on the way we book the premium. Because in the Italy premium paid on a monthly
installment basis were not accounted right away, but they were accounted over over the
time. So this is creating clearly a growth rate for the quarter, which is exceptionally high. In
the internal growth of 4.7, we have adjusted for that eﬀects. So when you want to look at
the yield growth in Italy, look at the internal growth, which is adjusted for these
accounting eﬀects, and that's also adjusted for the disclusion of Genialloyd. So that's the
real number you should look at. It's still very good because the growth rate of 4.7 is is
good, and in the case of Italy is driven by Motor and that's also driven by volume, by
price. But clearly, when you have a combined ratio at the level that we have, I think price is
more than ﬁne. And to come back also to the question, Michael, before in Germany is the
opposite.
When you see what is driving the growth in in Germany, is price and not volume. So just
to give an idea how we are moving diﬀerently country by country, depending on the
competitive environment, the level of performance. Then clearly our subsidiaries are
going to react, subject to the market conditions. There you had a question, the AGI,
noticing that the inﬂows were kind of weak for the quarter. The driver for the quarterly
development of the inﬂows is-- half of the outﬂows were driven by Asia where a big
distribution partner didn't like the concentration the had because there were selling a lot
of AGI products, and this has been clearly a headwind for us. So half of the outﬂows
driven by this distribution partner, trying to reduce the dependency on AGI, and the rest
is coming from a slowdown in sales in retail in Europe. So these are the two eﬀects that
explaining the outﬂows. I will say, the Asian one is a little bit if you want, of a one-oﬀ. And
the retail headwinds in the Euro, then we need to see how this is going to play out in the
next months.

We will now take our next question from Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Please go

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi there, hi Giulio. Two quick questions. Spain used to be the golden child running in the
low '90s or high '80s combined. What happened in Q1. I'm particularly interested in
reference to reserve strengthening in the commentary just maybe just give us a bit more
color on that please.
Second question, given the interest rate environment has kind of deteriorated a fair
amount year to date in terms of benchmark yield curves falling. We've always been a
accustomed in the past to Allianz being fairly proactive in terms of management actions
that you take, particularly in respect to ALM positioning, Solvency II model. Is there
anything because of the sort of tougher, back to this lower-for-longer-forever interest rate
environment, is there anything that you've done proactively as a group, particularly in Q1
to reposition for that? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yes. So maybe let's start from the Solvency II question. So we are always doing-- yeah we
do some-- always some capital management. There was nothing now very pronounced in
Q1 that we did on this side, also considering that when you have a solvency ratio which is
at the 220% level there is no point for us now to overreact to movement. But clearly, so if
you look at our position assuming we will get uncomfortable with the levels of Solvency II,
which we are not, there are things that we can do, we can deﬁnitely change our duration
proﬁle.
So from that point of view, always keep in mind every time we speak about our
sensitivities we are now considering for, capital management action -- for management
action, but clearly this is a tool that we have at our disposal, and this can be also very
eﬀective to manage the Solvency II ratio. Also changing in the derivative strategy for
equity hedge and this can be very eﬀective and clearly, you need to consider that, what is
the impact on other KPIs.
But we started just point of view there we have a very healthy level of solvency. We expect
that we're going to generate solvency capital moving forward because of the organic
development. So from these points of view, clearly we're going to evaluate what we can
do on the duration side, but we are not really agonising here thinking that we have a
Solvency II problem at all. So I say we are very comfortable with the level of Solvency II. If
the markets have changed signiﬁcantly and we have a diﬀerent level of Solvency II then
we must think about diﬀerentiation, but at this point in time, we feel good about where
we are and that's also very important.

FINAL

All the ﬂexibility for doing what we need to do from a capital management point of view,
the sales are growing our business, we're doing buybacks looking M&A at opportunity,
has not changed a bit because of the number that we had, we were anyway expecting to
have a Solvency ratio closer to 220 as we were adjusting for the buybacks and also for the
model changes.
The other question on Spain, and I will say what happened is Spain is usually the-- I will
say the Accident year performance is more or less the same level as last year and the
sense of the loss ratio is deteriorating a little bit. And this is driven by-- a little bit by the
Property portfolio, a little bit by the Motor portfolio, but on the other side, the expense
ratio is going down because we are taking measures on the eﬃciency side. Although
Spain was always a very eﬃcient company.
So from the Accident year performance is pretty much stable and then we see a swing in
run oﬀ, which is mostly coming from the Motor business, we are looking. There were
claims at the end-- were related claims in property at the end of last year and now we see
that somehow we are getting some negative development out of those claims.
So this is something that we're going to watching now. I believe that for this year we still
might have a few challenges in Spain, but by 2020, I'm rather conﬁdent we are going to
be back to a good level of performance because of the actions we are undertaking.

We will now take a next question from James Shuck from Citi. Please go ahead, your line

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. Three questions from me. Firstly AGCS, it's had another
diﬃcult start to the quarter, combined ratio, close to 100. I appreciate that's impacted by
large losses, but there's also no real impact from that CATS and in 2017 and 2018 also
around 100% level. You're growing volume at about 11%. So can you just shed some
insight please into the future direction of travel around that combined ratio. I think it's a
very low ROE business as it is, if you just update on what you're doing in terms of capital
eﬃciency on that side, please, that would be helpful.
Secondly, just interested to see the new disclosure for Allianz Direct. So there's 103%
combined ratio with an expense ratio of 18% or 17.8%, it sort of seems to imply you're
writing sort of a very high loss ratio on the direct business and most of that direct business
should actually be quite mature now, particularly given Genialloyd that's been an asset for
many years. Just, shed some insight on to that loss ratio for me, please.

And ﬁnally, really just a clariﬁcation, I think Giulio -- you mentioned that the capital set
aside for P&C growth was 30% of premium. I was just looking back to the Investor Day in
November, you were pretty clear then that the capital set aside with 35% to 40% of
premiums. I just want make sure if you change your modeling in terms of the capital
required for the growth. Thank you.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Okay. Yeah, thank you for the question. Maybe you can start from the last one. Yes, we
had 35. This was the pretax number. And now we put on the ACR, we are putting directly
the tax impact into the business evolution, then we give you the number 2 is net of taxes
from both sides. So the 35% was pre-tax 30%, it's an after-tax number. One thing which is
important for you, because we're going to add these again in the future. So, want to set
expectations. The way we running in our business evolution calculation is we look at the
portfolio movement. And then we establish a sort of-- based on analysis, a rule of thumb
of Premium, are going to add this kind of premium charge.

Bloomberg Transcript

New Business is going to add a sort of new business charge and the run-oﬀ of the in-force
is going to add these kind of runoﬀ charge. Then on the -- we use this charge on a custom
basis and then time by time we reevaluat the charges. We do the analysis and there we
might change depending on what we see the numbers, so you might have situation
where we are going to have at some point in time, maybe slightly diﬀerent factors and
these could drive a little bit of the diﬀerent development compared to what we discussed
before. But we are going to be also transparent, if we have signiﬁcant changes in the
factors you're going to see that.
I believe this is a very good way, if you like to run around these numbers is very
transparent and very easy to have the communication with you guys. But I just want to
explain to you how we are doing this calculation now. This was not the way we were doing
the calculation at midpoint last year. So this is a change that we introduced to have better
stability and better clarity on these ﬁgures.
Then you had a question about Allianz Direct. You will notice that the combined ratio was
103. And you also made a good comment about the business, of Genialloyd should be
mature. Indeed Genialloyd has a good combined ratio, but that's the only one. And the
other three companies are still pretty small and -- the is more in the combined ratios are
very, very high. But that's exactly the reason why we decided to get into a diﬀerent
direction on it because at the end of the day, it doesn't make sense to run a small
operation with very high combined ratio, and not just because of the scale, but also
because of the kind of underwriting performance. That is one thing anyway that has to be
appreciated. Especially when you add companies which have mostly new business. Their
combined ratio is going to be higher. The new business comes always higher and the
combined ratio.
So I would say in the case of Genialloyd, yes the companies between inverted comma
"mature", but still I will say still not as mature as the seasoned business of Allianz Italy in
general, and then if you remove Genialloyd, which has anyway good combined ratio.The

FINAL

other entities are really not at a mature stage. That's the reason why you see the
combined ratio that you see, but that's also the reason why we're doing well we're doing.
There you other question on AGCS. Your comments about the large losses are high but
the natural catastrophe are low is a fair comments. So the reality is over the last three
years AGCS has performed a combined ratio of 100% or more. and one quarter might be
that the the large losses are high. Then the next of course it is going to be the natural
catastrophe. At the end of the day, the bottom line is always the same.
So from that point of view, clearly, we are taking actions from the portfolio. You might
have also seen that the rate environment is getting better, I think this was overdue and I
would also tell you that. So what we are seeing now is a positive development, but may
not be enough because that is also claims inﬂation, so the end of the day, this should just
be the beginning of a journey of a stronger hardening, as opposed to a just a short-term
correction.

Bloomberg Transcript

So that is deﬁnitely improvement in the pricing which is needed, and this applies to the
whole market, not just to us Because our performance in the totally ﬁne compared to the
market. Because the whole market needs repricing. Clearly that is that we can do, also to
improve our underwriting and also look at the diﬀerent books. You have come
commented about the growth steadiness. There is no correlation between the loss ratio
that we see, the combined ratio that we see and the growth in the sales. Or we are having
these kind of numbers, because we are growing in the wrong line of business.
So from that point of view I believe the performance you see right now is just a reﬂection
on what the market environment is. Then you had a comment on the ROE. Yes ROE I will
say, clearly when you have a 99% combined ratio, we cannot be that good. In reality, and
that can be fascinating. To get to an ROE of 10% in a AGCS you need only a combined
ratio of 97, which is kind of interesting, so that you can discuss whether the 10% is a good
ROE. The amount of 97 will be the combined ratio where the ROE gets to 10%. And we
are looking at its capital eﬃciency in this, as you might have known, we had been looking
how we can create more synergies between Euler Hermes and AGCS, s we discussed that
I believe also in some meetings.
So I think we're going to have the possibility over the next two, three years, by changing
some structure reinsurance program to get some additional capital eﬃciency in AGCS
sales. So the bottom line is, if we achieve our target to bring the AGCS combined ratio to
90-96, which is still our target for 2021, and we also work on the capital eﬃciency, then
our ROE should be deﬁnitely north of 10%.

FINAL

Hi (inaudible). Thanks for the -- Just want to go to ﬁrstly to the UK. Okay, so you're
building potentially a the higher stake in LV for this year for Q4 and potentially more if
they'll be put to the year after. I was wondering about your appetite now for the retail
market in the UK, particularly in the context of the regulatory review there on pricing and
whether you are looking to build up further scale beyond kind of motor insurance in the
market.
Second point is, could you talk a little bit about how the European Direct platform will
support the proﬁtability in the Direct business. What tangible beneﬁts will that have
maybe on loss ratio or expense ratio? And then lastly, just a clariﬁcation on Allianz
Technology, based on a question that was asked earlier. I just want to make sure you're
not suggesting we take the Q1, corporate number and multiply it by four. Thank you.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Maybe I'll start with the last one. No we don't do that because that is not just
technology in those numbers. Although I could say the expectation is that's you know
over time because our guidance for 2019 for the corporate segment is minus EUR900
million and there might be a conservative guidance and over time I can deﬁnitely see the
performance of the corporate segment, it deﬁnitely being better the median guidance
and going into the EUR800 million below. So, but for the time being, I will not do for this
year adjusted calculation.
We're going to end up signiﬁcantly below EUR800 million threshold and for the time
being, I will say, you should assume that we might be better than our guidance but don't
get too excited for 2019 yet on that. On the European data platform. You know I just, just
tell you in the next years the European Direct platform is going to be a drag on our
combined ratio. And by the way, this is something that we had known as we gave our
gave ourselves the target of being a 93 combined ratio by 2021. And deﬁnitely in the
short term the European Direct platform is not going to contribute to get to the 93, it's
going to be a drag that we need to somehow oﬀset with stronger performance
somewhere else. Eventually, clearly the expectation is that Allianz Direct platform is going
to contribute to our combined ratio.
And as you can imagine once we get to 93 we would like to at least stay there. So
eventually they need to contribute to these kind of ﬁgures. If you remember the Capital
Market Day, we have indicated and expense ratio of 12%. Even assuming the expense
ratio could be little bit higher than it is. A large loss ratio that you can still tolerate and get
to combined ratio which are very good, but over the next two or three years honestly
speaking Allianz Direct is going to be a drag, and the best way to assess the performance
Allianz Direct is going to be to see how much Premium growth we are getting and also at
what kind of combined ratio we are going to get that growth. So if you tell me if we can
get growth with a combined ratio of about 100%. I will say that will be a very good
outcome.
So if we can get healthy growth and keep the combined ratio on that, that would be my
opinion, --good question.

Then you had a question about the UK and yes okay, by the end of the year we are going
to be at 70% for the LV business, which means also that the point in time, we can start
thinking seriously about integration. Your question was whether that we have potential for
further acquisitions in and the UK, you were referring clearly to something which is not
Motor. So I cannot speak too much into that because you're a smart guy, so you're asking
asking me that question, but it's a loaded question.
I can just tell you that we don't need necessarily to acquire additional businesses in the
UK, but if there is good opportunity at a good price, I think we can, we can go for that.
Your question about how we view the UK because of the regulatory uncertainty, I would
just tell you that the UK tends to be a little bit of a more challenging market compared to
what we see in Europe. But eventually I believe there is more of a cycle, if you want, in the
UK. But eventually in the UK, I believe if you have a good platform you can create value
over the cycle, but deﬁnitely there is a little bit more volatility in the combined ratios in the
UK compared to what we see in Continental Europe, but there, deﬁnitely we are
interested in getting strong presence there with the LV acquisition, I think we have
accomplished a goal and we have some opportunities, we are going also to strengthen
our franchise there.

We will now take a next question for the Nick Holmes from Societe Generale. Please go
ahead, your line is open.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Just a couple of quick questions. Apologies, ﬁrst on capital
generation coming back to that subject, you said the reduction to 2% was due to growth,
but my question is how much was due to business mix within that growth? I mean you've
gone from 15% in 2018 to annualized 8% in Q1, obviously you're expecting better than
that. And would you say for example that, more than half of that diﬀerence was due to
business mix change and writing more traditional stuﬀ than unit length? That's the ﬁrst
question. Then second is just on US variable annuity sales. These are booming again.
Wondered, can you remind us of the guarantees that you're oﬀering on these products.
Thank you.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

So starting from the capital generation, I don't think mixes making any signiﬁcant
diﬀerence, also when we look at, let's say, let's see what's happening in Q1. Yes, we had
more guaranteed business. But eventually if you run the math we might have had let's say
EUR500 million of new business premium, of additional guarantee business and even if
Page 16 of 25



Company Name: Allianz SE

FINAL

you apply, let's say, to be conservative -- very conservative, the eﬀect of 3 percentage
point on that, that will be well EUR15 million. So it's really not that material.
So I will say, the growth in P&C is deﬁnitely see is one of the drivers. And as I was saying
before, 18 months ago, we were not necessarily calculating the business evolution in the
exact same way we are doing now. Now we have established is kind of rules of thumb
which are giving us a better view also on the capital generation, but growth in P&C is
deﬁnitely a driver of higher or lower capital generation. Also one comment, also on the
guarantee business, even assuming and that's a little bit of conservative assumption, that
the capital requirement is 3% of premium, we are making 3% of value on the new
business there, margin. So from a solvency point of view, there will be, even if you want,
equalization, where there is enough capital generation as much as capital absorption.
You wanted to ask a question?

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Yes. Sorry, no Giulio that's incredibly clear and useful.Just one quick follow-up, which is,
you mentioned P&C a lot. Would you say the P&C is more than half of the --

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yeah, I can tell you. -- Sure (Multiple Speakers) Yeah, we look at the --

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

It really isn't as important as that? Okay.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Okay. I'll give you the numbers. Yeah, I can tell you. The EUR300 million business
evolution over EUR200 million are coming from P&C and then the rest, which is less than
EUR100 is coming Life. Well also, to be very speciﬁc is in the ﬁrst quarter of 2019 we saw
little bit less release of technical provision for the in-force, but these kinds of can be
chunky. But you know here we speaking really about of EUR20 million - EUR30 million
more or less. So at the end of the day, the main message is, of the EUR300 million, two
thirds is coming from P&C. And that's really an easy calculation you take the premium on
the 12 month rolling that you apply a 30% charge, and this may seem so-so. The P&C
business is capital-intensive, more than people might think.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

That's very clear. Thank you. And then the --

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

So it's a diﬃcult question to answer, because there are diﬀerent, depending on the
product you might have products with a roll-up of 7%. So, i.e. right now, I would tell you
that I can give you just a high level answer. We not concerned about the level of
guarantees and especially the assumption that we had in our VA business. So from that
Page 17 of 25



Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2019-05-14

FINAL

point of view, I would just tell you, ﬁrst of all, we are now selling VA now since few years.
The majority, I will say more than 50% of the block maybe 60% of the block should be
now the business sold after 2008 the ﬁnancial crisis. And from a guarantee point of view
there is not an easy answer, like you might have for the ﬁxing this annuity block. But
fundamentally, I would tell you there is no concern about the reserve level. I will call it this
way.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

And you say there's no concern because you are hedged, is that right, the guarantees are
hedged, is that right?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, because we, yeah, but also at the end of the day, the reality, the assumption you
need to look at when you look at the VA business is the lapse assumptions because for
the end of the day, as long as you're going to get the lapses that you think you're going to
get, then you have set your expectation of the guarantee at the right level. Because if
people are not lapsing that's where you're going to see that there is more business which
has a guarantee compared to what you thought. So we don't see any negative
development on the lapse assumptions.
So from that point of view, we are seeing the bookings perform as we expect. And then in
terms of the hedging, we are hedging the delta, we are hedging also the gamma. So we
also hedging for the gamma and then we are hedging the interest rate, at least for the
business we see subject to interest rate sensitivity and IFRS, which is the majority of our
business. So the hedging program is functioning, and from a ledger assumption point of
view our utilization assumptions for these kind of things, we see they are behaving as we
expect.
Also one thing to keep in mind for the business , which we wrote after the ﬁnancial crisis
2008 we had the possibility to increase fees, which means if we see a negative deviation
in the assumption we can increase the fees. Which also means if we see a positive
deviation we can decrease the fees. And the last action from the company was indeed to
decrease the fees because the assumption was becoming more favorable.
So in this case, to be fair to their policy or they are moving the fees down and if we see
one day that he goes into a diﬀerent direction we can change the fees up but I will say the
variable annuity business in the US, our variable annuity business is kind of limited and I
would also say that we don't see any kind of negative development on this business at the
moment.

Well then, thanks. Thanks. So two quick ones from me, please. So solvency and capital
generation. I know the guidance is clear for FY '19. But what are the moving parts that we
should be thinking about beyond 2019, please? Will they stay around the 10 point mark,
unless growth slows or is there anything else picking up?

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Secondly on pricing in P&C, we're still running at good levels at 1.8%. It's pretty robust at
that. That's sort of the area. Where is claims inﬂation in respect to that pricing movement
that you ﬂagged higher claims inﬂation on the US commercial lines, any color to that
would be great. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yeah, so on the ﬁrst question about the 10% guidance. Absolutely, I would say this could
be a good level guidance also moving forward. And then on the pricing environment,
there was a general question, like on the pricing environment in -- yeah -- in general and
the claims inﬂation. On the claims inﬂation I always look at claims inﬂation and also it's
frequency across the portfolio. And clearly the situation is very diﬀerent country by
country and line of business by line of business, but in general, I would say that we don't
see a pressure coming from the loss trends compared to the pricing we are getting. So in
general I then the situation can be a little bit diﬀerent in one line of business versus the
other, and the only thing that we see sometimes in some of our companies which is
slightly diﬀerent, we might see a pickup in large losses in commercial business decisions
in that we have seen in diﬀerent companies, but this is in my opinion, nothing to do with
the increasing trend in in in severity in general. And on these cases, clearly, we need to
look deeper at the underwriting and determine whether there are underwriting issues as
opposed to be normal volatility. But fundamentally from a claims inﬂation point of view, I
will say the situation is pretty, pretty stable compared to the pricing we're getting.

Q - Analyst

ahead, your line is open.

Q - Michael Heap

{BIO 19955103 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good afternoon to everyone. Two questions on Allianz Leben. The
Solvency II ratio which you disclosed in the SFCR reports on the solo entity level improved
signiﬁcantly from 403% to 478% at year-end 2018, despite lower interest rates in Germany.
To my understanding this was also driven by the change in the ZZR requirements.

Bloomberg Transcript

Maybe you do not know. But can you tell us how much the impact of the relaxed ZZR
methodology was on the Solvency II ratio of Allianz Leben. My second question, also on
German Life Insurance. I read that you increased the policyholder participation in
Germany. And I wonder what is the motivation of this step is this is a step, which you were
forced to do or which you deliberately did so, is it just in IFRS accounting issue-- just
interested to know.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yes, I will stand but it's participation is more an IFRS translation in IFRS and also you know
on the quarterly basis even local accounting can be diﬀerent. But fundamentally we are
not increasing the participations of the policy holder. My point is there any way that we
know that we are crediting the policy holder, although we give you more in there what the
minimum participation might be so fundamentally we are wrong there.
But for the time being we are keeping the same the exact policy and there is no change in
the participation not negative or positive on a local basis and then you have the question
about this obviously to ratio development, at Allianz Leben, and I can tell you that the
majority of the improvement is being driven by the change in ZZR. So I will say this is
pretty much accounting for the big jump that you saw in solvency ratio that you saw 2018.

Q - Michael Butler

{BIO 16381409 <GO>}

A second option (inaudible) sorry it's really quick question. You know the-- and you kind
of addressed it in many diﬀerent ways. The attritional loss ratio in Q1 61%, sorry -63% to
63.9% Q1 '19, out of that the large losses. The ones we know about, about 80 Bps. But
what I'm a little bit surprised by, no fundamental improvement in that ratio. So even if I
strip out those large losses kind of ﬂat or slightly worse. Can you talk a little bit about that
please?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. So the additional loss ratio. I would say ﬁrst of all, if I look at the traditional loss ratio
clearly there is no improvement, I will say right now compared to what we had the end of
the year. But I'm looking clearly just your the numbers which make sense. But maybe I'll
give you a diﬀerent perspective because perhaps I can see numbers that you cannot see.
But I can give you a little bit of a hint. If you take our combined ratio in ﬁrst quarter '19
which is 93.7. And then you adjust for the natural catastrophe that would be just rounded
up, that would be 95. And then if you put the runoﬀ on top, there will be about 98. So that
could be the the combined ratio before-- I know if I adjusted for Natural Catastrophes,
and this is exactly the level that we had at the end of 2018, if you do the calculation.
So from that point of view, what you see in the Q1, is a lot of currencies, let's see with the
numbers that we had for the full year. So when we also look at the attritional loss ratio
there, the one adjusted for Natural Catastrophe, weather related large losses compared to
the Q1, 2018, I can tell you the numbers are very much consistent. So if you ask me the
book is performing right now the same way I saw it performing in the course of 2018 ,
which makes sense. Because we are just in the ﬁrst quarter of the next three year period
so clearly we want to go to 93, but is not going to happen in the ﬁrst quarter of 2019, this
should come over time.

We now take our next question from Drew Gallant from HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line
is open.

Q - Drew Gallant

{BIO 20017472 <GO>}

Hi, thanks for taking the question. I've just got one left in terms of the PIMCO. Could you
talk a bit more about this new fund you've launched, this closed fund, how big it is and
what the revenue margin is on this.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yeah. So this fund is a closed-end fund, which is specialized in this is a ﬁxed income
specializing credits and also in energy sector and the fund is is a size of about EUR800
million. And the fee margin is about 130 basis points. So at the end of the day if you run
the math about the payback period is about two to three years. That's how much we need
to get our investment back. So if you ask me, it's a great business case. The only drawback
on the business case is that because of some arcane accounting, you cannot capitalize the
initial expenses, that's the only drawback. And we might see some other these kind of
transitions in the future, but the business cases are very, very strong, very, very solid .
So from that point of view, it's a transaction that we like a lot. But they might cause some
sort of volatility in our quarterly results.

{BIO 20017472 <GO>}

We'll now take our next question from James Shuck of Citi. Please go ahead, your line is
open.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hi yeah, thanks for taking my my follow-up. I just had a couple, please. So Giulio I just
wanted to check my understanding what you're saying about the Life increase in the SCR
of the business evolution for Life. So thank you for the split between P&C and Life, you
mentioned $100 million as the business evolution for life, there's the capital requirement
is 3% of the PVNBP -- So that's around EUR500 million.So just ﬁlling in the gaps. Should I
assume that the capital release from the back book is EUR400 that gets me to a net
EUR100 and if that is right, what is the trajectory for that capital release over time please?
And second question just on, just on AGI, I know you have a target for cost income ratio
below 70%. The costing income ratio, in Q1, was around 73% and I think all the
explanation about the high cost-income ratio ratio in Asset Management was really
relating to PIMCO. So just wondering about the trajectory that for AGI please. Thank you.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yeah, so on the new business evolution, the 3% that was quoted, there will be and
number for the guarantee business but I also tend to be very conservative. Just to make
the point when we have our calculation, we are applying, indeed it to the entire business --and business premium we are playing a ratio of about slightly north of 1%. So that's what
you can apply to the present development in the business premium and just 3% is more
me saying okay, let's pursue on that on this guarantee business. The capital consumption
is way larger. Let's even go for 3%. How much can you be a reality in the numbers, but you
can use more good 1% on the presently available business premium. To be very nitty-gritty
and they always tell me not to be very nitty-gritty, and from the presently available
business premium to the OEs, which are not included in Solvency II at all. But this is

FINAL

getting really nitty-gritty too, but somehow, you can use about 1% of our presently
available business premium and this gives you a sense of the business evolution. Then
you had a question regarding the AGIs. Yes, keep in mind that in the ﬁrst quarter the cost
income ratio with AGI tends to be higher. Also because the performance fees are usually
coming towards the end of the year. So if you look at the cost income ratio of AGI in the
ﬁrst quarter in the ﬁrst quarter of '18 was also about 73%, but then by the end of the year I
believe we were below 70%.
So you should assume that in the course of the year, we're going to see any way an
improvement of the cost-income ratio because of the performance fees also keep in mind
that we have been able to reduce the cost to income ratio in this quarter compared to the
last quarter, despite the asset basis being lower. So I would say that should take a full-year
view, you can see that our ambition to achieve this 67% is deﬁnitely achievable.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

And just quickly on the capital side of things, I guess if it like, if I just one percent of the
PVNBP, that's going to be EUR176 million or so you said the business evolution is 100. So I
mean very-- and obviously there's fewer ROEs in then as you just mentioned. It doesn't
look like then of this material capital release from the back book, I missing something on
that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Yeah, depends on how much reserves are running oﬀ. For example in in the ﬁrst quarter
the runoﬀ reserve was about EUR4 billion and the full quarter 2018 was about EUR8
billion. So 7, so depending on-- now the reserves are not oﬃcially yearly on a linear basis.
But really, look, we look at this number inside out, as you see and I will really say that we
can over analyze this number at the end of the day, we are it's about whether we're going
to add 3 or 2.5 of capital generation. I believe you if you have a good capital generation
we have a good solvency ratio. Yes, we can deﬁnitely analyze this number further but
yeah, I'm not so sure whether this is really helpful.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay, that's great, thank you very much.

Your line is open.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Hi I had a question on the Solvency II. Sorry if it's a little early on and if it's on Q1 results,
but the, just if you could just share with us if you, if you have it, the impact you would face
in case the last liquid point was moved by 10 years, which is one of the options that is
being looked at and is there any other topic in the Solvency II review that in your view
could be important dynamic relative to just anything that you watch particularly closely?
Thank you.

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, so on the, Solvency II, I view clearly the move in the last few key points is a key topic
and that will be, by the way negative for us. Which I will say that could impair the solvency
ratio by about 10 percentage points. On the other side, there are positives that might
come into play which is the treatment of the volatility adjuster. That's always something
that we are pushing very strong because we believe that right now Solvency II is a good
framework but one of the weaknesses is indeed in the treatment of the credit spreads.
And then also, there is also a conversation, which is maybe less crucial important, which is
about the risk margin and what is the cost of capital that you apply to the risk margin. And
so this could be too positive on the other side. And the on last key points, clearly might
be there will be a negative and then clearly the point is also not to only if you move the
last key points then lastly if you play in, but also what the convergence might be.
When we put together and by the way on the last key points the negative impair might be
slightly higher than 10 percentage points, when we put the positive and negative together
there might be a wash in our case, but we don't know, eventually, what is going to
happen.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Thank you very clear.

Thank you very much. My last question I promise, and thank you. And they've simply
simple questions just numbers and on your non-Life premiums, your P&C portfolio, how
much of the business these premiums would you classify as property?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

So how much will it's probability? Which I will say the probably about 20% of the
business, but we numbers have the numbers, give me one sec.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}
