FINAL

Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

Thank you very much, James. Welcome to everyone on the call on my behalf as well.
Zurich's operating results for the Third Quarter of 2015 are a disappointing outcome for
the Group. As we announced on September 21, results for our General Insurance business
have been impacted by adverse claims experience in certain portfolios, including a
further increase in large losses in comparison to the ﬁrst half of the year, negative prior
year development in some portfolios in North America and $275 million in claims relating
to the Tianjin port explosions.
These factors have in aggregate led to our GI business reporting a loss of slightly less
than $200 million and a combined ratio of around 109% for the Third Quarter. While we
are not satisﬁed with the outcome, this result is in line with our preliminary
announcement.
In response to the recent performance issue within General Insurance, we commenced an
operational review of the business in early September. This review has led to an agreed
set of comprehensive actions to improve performance and to get us back on track.

Bloomberg Transcript

Kristof will give you more information on this review shortly but I am very encouraged by
the response of the business and I'm absolutely convinced that we have the actions in
place to start rebuilding the credibility of our GI business with investors.
Equally, while we need to improve proﬁtability in certain parts of General Insurance, this
should not detract from the good progress in other parts of the Group or from our
continued capital strength and excellent cash generation track records
.
For the nine months ended September 30, our life business has reported 18% growth in
both business operating proﬁt and in new business sales at constant currency. And at
Farmers Exchanges, which we do not own, modest but steady growth in gross premiums
is starting to translate into higher revenues for Farmers management services.
In terms of our ﬁnancial position, solvency as measured by the Zurich economic capital
model was slightly above the top of our target range at the end of June. While this is likely
to have dipped slightly due to the weak Q3 results and the recent market movements, we
continue to be in a very strong position. In addition, while GI's challenges will likely have
some impact on cash remittances in 2106, we still expect to generate in excess of $10
billion of cumulative cash remittances in the three years from 2014 to 2016. This is more
than $1 billion ahead of our target.

These strengths enable us to reiterate our commitment to deploying $3 billion excess
capital by the end of 2016 and this remains a key step in how we will improve returns and
achieve an ROE within our target range of 12% to 14% next year.

FINAL

As mentioned in the results commentary, we will set out how the $3 billion of excess
capital will be allocated between organic or inorganic investment and cash returns to
investors above our ordinary dividend with full-year results.
And with that I will hand over to Kristof now who will give you some more details about
the outcome of his review of the GI business. Thank you very much.

Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

Thank you, Martin. Now as highlighted earlier, the recent performance of our GI business
has been disappointing and the review we initiated in Q3 built on some of the actions that
were already underway at the half-year. Now this review focused on ﬁve elements, from
understanding the ﬁnancial strength of the business all the way to governance. However
the two most important elements that we focused on were the improvement of our
underwriting performance and an accelerated drive towards greater eﬃciency.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now while the underwriting review is broad in nature, the immediate focus has been on
the 16% of our business that is generating the largest underwriting losses. For these
portfolios we've put in place some very concrete actions for underwriting improvements
with detailed weekly tracking leading up to the January 1 renewal.
Let me also stress here that this is not just about exiting underperforming portfolios; it is
about focusing our eﬀorts and taking tough underwriting actions where it makes sense,
while considering achievability and the long-term customer relationships.
That being said, we have made decisions to exit portfolios where we think it is not realistic
to turn them around. Some of these we've already mentioned, for example the US
trucking business and the standalone global corporate boiler and machinery line.
Now within the overall targeted portfolios we will be focusing on achieving rate and/or
lift, recognizing that in some markets and lines of business rates are still softening. This is
where tiering will be a key lever, with particular focus on ﬁnding a better balance between
risk levels and pricing. And for some of the bottom tiers of our underperforming
portfolios this will mean some very signiﬁcant rate increases, often at the expense of a
signiﬁcant drop in retention levels.
Now while the core focus is on restoring proﬁtability, inevitably we will see an impact on
top line but this is not about shrinking to success. We are taking a targeted and
diﬀerentiated approach and we will continue to invest in those areas where we are getting
traction and delivering top line at the hurdles we expect. Examples of this are our Swiss
business and our North American commercial business.

FINAL

Now with regard to eﬃciency, there are a number of actions already taken which we
expect to start showing through in 2016 and continue beyond. Some of these initiatives
address the layer of expense above the businesses in both the regions and at the center
but we are also reviewing our footprint and reassessing some of the investments that we
have made or intended to make.
And ﬁnally, we'll continue to reduce our expense base beyond 2016 as part of the
Group's overall ambition to reduce expenses by at least $1 billion by the end of 2018.
With these actions I believe we can achieve the required short-term proﬁtability
improvements while positioning the business for long-term success.
And with that, led me hand over to George.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Kristof. And before we turn to the questions let me make a couple of quick
comments on the results. As you all have seen, the results for GI are in line with the
preliminary indications although there are some changes in the mix of the numbers. To be
more speciﬁc, we'd incorporated an expectation of normal nat cat losses for September in
the preliminary indication but in the ﬁnal event we've actually had very limited nat cat
losses in September.
We also took the decision after the end of the quarter to be more prudent in one speciﬁc
sub-portfolio of our construction liability business in the US. These two items oﬀset each
other.
I'm well aware that the second step will further fuel the debate about the overall reserve
position but of the choices available to us this seemed to me to be the best one.
I want to reiterate a couple of points about the reserve position. First there are a number
of well known one-oﬀ factors in Q3 but most portfolios are showing expected modest
releases. Secondly, we believe we have prudently reserved and our reserves are set
above the midpoint in the range. Third, we believe the reserving process is robust and we
have multiple levels of both internal and external reviews in place with a generally
consistent view of overall reserve strength.
Obviously we need to demonstrate a more consistent track record in the coming quarters
and to actually deliver PYD within the 1% to 2% range that we've guided to. Of course no
one can predict how our reserves will evolve precisely but with the actions taken in Q3 I
believe we're in a stronger position and with lower levels of expected volatility.
Together with the underwriting expense actions that Kristof highlighted, we are conﬁdent
that we can improve our combined ratio by 2 to 3 points in 2016 from the adjusted
starting point of a 99.5% combined ratio, taking into account expectations for top-line
evolution and what we can see today in the external market environment.

Questions And Answers

FINAL

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Farooq Hanif, Citigroup.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi there. Thanks very much. I'll just keep it to two. Can you talk about the top line? In your
pre-prepared statement you use the word modest top line decline and it just seems to
me, especially from what you're saying now as well, that if such a large proportion of your
portfolio is making 140% plus or whatever combined ratio that it seems to me that the risk
there is quite signiﬁcant that you see quite a more major drop in top line. So could you
just talk about why you think that might not happen?
Then secondly, how conﬁdent can you leave us that you don't need to extend this review
of businesses to other areas such as EMEA. I know the ratios right now are good and
therefore you need to -- evidence is that they're working well. But given the history of the
Group, why are you not extending that? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

Maybe let me take that question. So ﬁrst of all on the top line, as I said, we will have a very
diﬀerentiated approach and clearly some of the areas that are underperforming will see
the business shrinking in the single-digit percentages probably. I don't have an absolute
top-line number for the business for next year. The key focus really is on getting the
proﬁtability, the underwriting proﬁtability of the business ﬁxed.
Now again even within some of the portfolios that are underperforming we are very
diﬀerentiated. We look at lines of business as part of an overall client relationship from a
distributor angle as well and we'll take very diﬀerent actions on the bottom tiers of those
portfolios than we will on those that are actually performing.
So I think in aggregate a modest decline is probably still the best shoe that we have. That
being said, clearly the focus will be on proﬁtability and restoring the business to
proﬁtability.
Now on extending the review, I want to make thing clear. While we talk about 15
underperforming portfolios, the underwriting review that we did was broad in nature and
covered all of our portfolios. Now the actions are targeted towards those 15 portfolios but
we are comfortable with what we're seeing in some of the other portfolios.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks very much.

FINAL

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. Two questions please, the ﬁrst one on the competitive situation in
global corporate. Some of your peers know that this remains an intensively competitive
area so your combined ratio forecast, what sort of rate changes are embedded for 2016,
especially in global corporate and North American commercial?
Then the second on M&A, I think in one of your earlier comments you mentioned that the
most likely development of deploying excess capital is a combination of bolt-on
acquisitions and cash returns. So how do you see the M&A market these days and where
do you see opportunities?

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Let me take the ﬁrst question on the competitive situation in global corporate. So it is true
that this is a competitive market. There's quite a bit of capital available within this market
and so the pressure on rate is likely to continue. As I said before, the impact on our
portfolio will be diﬀerentiated. And given some of the underperformance in some of our
global corporate business, particularly on the property portfolio and in North America,
that is very likely to see some signiﬁcant impact.
The improvement of the portfolio is not dependent, just dependent on rate. A lot of the
improvement we are likely to see from lift, which is really a shift in the proﬁtability of the
portfolio through the tiering exercise, because I think it is unlikely to see a big change in
what the market will tolerate in terms of rate increases going into 2016.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Daniel, on the second point on M&A, just to reiterate that the priorities for us for the use
of excess capital haven't changed. So ﬁrst of all growth, organic and inorganic. And then
second to return to shareholders the excess that we can use in supporting the growth of
the business. As you've seen, we've set a clear time horizon for us to reach a conclusion
on that so it has an impact in 2016.
From an overall M&A market perspective, I think it's very hard to judge. You can see the
transactions that I can see taking place. I guess what's most important to us is that if we
did commit capital in M&A we'll apply the discipline that we've talked about before. So
the level of return that we achieve on the invested capital is very important to us and the
benchmarks that we use to establish those returns are also very relevant. Of course, one
of the most important ones is around share price.
So more than that in terms of the likelihood or not (technical diﬃculty) I can't handicap for
you.

Andy Hughes, Macquarie.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Hi, thanks very much, guys. I guess the ﬁrst question was on the increased reinsurance
you're planning to buy on the global corporate business, does that have a beneﬁt to the
capital position? And also is there a cost to that or is that oﬀset by the falling reinsurance
prices?
And the second question was on the commercial auto business. I guess peers have seen
similar problems in commercial auto so I was really surprised when you talked about a 4%
rate increase. I thought it could be a lot more than that. So I guess I'm interested in how
much the transportation book has caused of the losses you can see on slide 25. Does the
business look very diﬀerent ex the transportation book? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On the ﬁrst one, I guess just to avoid that I give the signal to insurance partners that we're
willing to buy reinsurance at any price, we're evaluating the risks, the pros and cons of
buying more reinsurance. But again, given the accumulation of large losses, some of the
things that Kristof has talked about is actually focused on the incoming business to try and
reduce the exposure that we have to some of those. Then beyond that we would like to
try and reduce the volatility generally and I think in that way reinsurance can play still a
role.
Then I guess the challenge is that doesn't come free of cost and I think obviously the
market is softer than it (technical diﬃculty) it would come with some marginal costs overall
would be a best expectation at this time.
On commercial auto, obviously commercial auto is one of the triggering points for the
preliminary release of the Q3 that we made in September. It was a large (technical
diﬃculty) of the $300 million charge that we identiﬁed then net in the GI business. And in
fact about $140 million of it was driven by commercial auto.
If you go back to some of the comments that Kristof made about particular lines of
business, obviously you'd expect that there are some sub-segments of the commercial
auto market where we see the most signiﬁcant negative loss cause trends are going to be
very high on the list of priorities for us to target. We have a particular exposure on some
of the larger trucking end of the market and that's an area that we're going to tackle with
vigor before we enter next year.

So again I think through a combination of that and pushing across the board in
commercial auto we expect to see a signiﬁcant improvement.

FINAL

On the rates that you're seeing, remember that the rate picture is obviously backwards
looking. The exact extent of the issue that we face in commercial auto I think became
clear to us during the quarter. You're going to see more radical action from this point
onwards.

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi there. I wonder if you could just give us a bit more detail. One of the points of the nonlife review was on organization and governance and I wonder what was the weakness
identiﬁed in organization and governance and how do you think you've solved it?
Because I guess there's not a lot of detail on that and I'm just curious to know what was
the problem identiﬁed.
Then in terms of the speed of any improvement, on the portfolio you've identiﬁed, the 15
portfolios, I think commercial auto is about 40% of the loss within those portfolios. And I
guess ﬁrst of all what is the tail and the speed of any likely improvement in commercial
auto? I'm assuming it's not that short tail, the auto liability. And of the other 60% of losses
being generated in those portfolios, is it property, is it liability business? What is the tail
and the speed of improvement that we should think about for those books? Thanks.

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

Hi, Andrew. Maybe let me start with the organization and governance part of the work
stream. Really two pieces within that. One is we looked at the overall set-up and as part of
that we actually are driving a reduction of the number of people that we have sitting in the
global layer. And we announced a number there, a reduction of 200 positions. The basic
principle is that we want to put accountability back in the front line, put it within the
market. And I actually I don't believe that the size of the organization that we had at the
top was commensurate with what needed to be done. And that does not mean that we're
not at the same time strengthening the control environment.
I think what actually -- if you go back to the governance and what has happened, I think it
is more around the right focus and the right strategic steering. And I think in some areas
we have just pushed growth over proﬁtability. And that's an area where we need to
intervene.

Page 8 of 25



FINAL

Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity

I think actually making things simpler at the top and with a smaller team I think will
actually be much more focused on a holistic picture of what needs to be done and
understanding the trade-oﬀs that need to be made between growth and proﬁtability. I
don't think this is a fundamental issue when it comes to technical excellence. The
information is there; the KPIs are there. We are doing a full review on what some of the
leading indicators are that we can better assess some of the portfolios that are trending
away from us. But by and large we didn't ﬁnd any major gaps in the control framework;
it's much more around having the right accountability in the right place and having the
right focus in terms of what we're trying to accomplish and making the trade-oﬀs.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

So the information was there, it just wasn't linking strongly enough to the front line. Is that
a good summary?

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

So I think there's a little bit of that and then I think on the large losses we have probably
been somewhat slow in recognizing what was a trend and not a one-oﬀ. So that's been an
area and that is an area where we've done a deeper dive and we've made some of the
points around reducing our exposure, being careful where we actually allocate capital.
We're having a look at what retentions are we willing to take on standalone risks but also
for relationship. So these are all things that we're looking at. But I would say by and large
this is not an issue of not having the right information.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

And this governance review has happened across all the units of GI?

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

That is correct.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. And on the tail of the business you need to improve?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Andrew, why don't I take that? So if you look at GI overall and our expectations of the
improvement we expect to see for the plan, the largest single theme is actually large loss.
I think it's over one-third of the improvement that we expect to achieve. Some of that will
come from commercial auto but the vast bulk of it comes from property. So the points that
Kristof made at the beginning around how we approach underwriting, risk acceptance,
accumulation, these are actually expected to have a much larger and obviously a much
more immediate impact on performance.
Beyond just the issues that we have in the US and Canada, which is obviously where we're
the main focus is, the team are working hard to be set up for January 1 renewals in a
number of European markets on some of the retail lines where we also expect to have a

Page 9 of 25

signiﬁcant impact. So even though commercial auto stands out as one of the major
challenges, it does have a longer tail line which means it takes longer to eﬀect the
change. It isn't going to be the key source of the overall underwriting improvement.

Hi there. Good afternoon. So actually my question has sort of been answered so I'll still
put it just out there. The link between reserve issues and expenses, we have seen expense
cuts -- and yourself you just mentioned the fact that control was not a problem. But is it -this is the same problem that happened or a similar problem happened in the German
(inaudible) lines where the people who were watching the claims were not there because
of cost cuts. So if you can just -- if you could just reassure me once again -- I apologize for
repeating the question but this has been a problem and even in the reserve, reserves are
not part of this review but we still do feel surprises. So if you could just clarify and repeat
(inaudible) that the people who watch these reserves are being carefully -- or that process
is complete. That's my ﬁrst question.
And second question is just back on this NAC, could you just also reassure us that the -NAC also does a lot of the car dealers in America and could you just reassure us that the
portfolio there is okay and doesn't need any further reserving actions? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I'll start on the ﬁrst one and Kristof will take the second one. So on the reserving side of
things, if you look at the way the Group's allocated resources, reserving is actually one of
the areas we've invested fairly signiﬁcantly in the last couple of years. We have an
ongoing program to improve the consistency of the reserving process globally and while
it wasn't completely untouched by some of the eﬃciency eﬀorts we've had last year and
this year, the impact of that has been very modest on reserving.
I mentioned in the introduction to the call that I think we feel comfortable that we have a
good reserving process. I think some of the steps that we've announced around trying to
focus a bit more on the large loss side of things. So I think if we're not so deep in the tail
and not looking to accept quite so much volatility, it makes some of the decisions that you
have to make about whether something is bad luck, good luck, much more easy to deal
with.
So from an expense cut perspective or an eﬃciency perspective I don't see that that's had
any impact on the reserving process and if anything we're looking to obviously further
strengthen the reserving process.

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

So just to reiterate on the ﬁrst question on governance, I don't think this has anything to
do with lack of transparency. Again I think it is about having the right focus, the right
strategic focus, making the right trade-oﬀs between growth and proﬁtability and
intervening more quickly. I think on the large loss side, there I think it is a trend we're well
aware of and we're taking the actions to address it.
Then on your second question around the impact on direct markets, I think some of the
strengthening in the US order book was (reg markets) but that is much more a part of the
overall strengthening that we did in Q3.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Right. Thank you, Kristof.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. Two questions. The ﬁrst is on the P&C target. I think you acknowledge
now that the baseline is one percentage point higher but you're still conﬁdent that you
can improve 2 to 3percentage points. You also say that rate changes are 1% to 2% which is
claims inﬂation level, plus you say because of low volumes expense ratio is not improving
and expense ratio, if I remember correctly, after H1 was the main driver of the 2 to
3percentage point improvement in the past. So those two factors fall away so how do you
want to achieve the 2% to 3%? If you want to do this with just 16% of the portfolio that
would mean roughly a 15% improvement of underlying margin. With this business how
realistic is this? That's my ﬁrst question.
Second question is capital. I wondered a little bit about the considerations you had on this
$3 billion excess capital. In September the stock price was at a fairly low level compared
to recent history so what kept you from buying back then? Is it that you mainly expect to
deploy into organic and inorganic growth? Or what other thoughts have driven this
decision?

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

Let me take the ﬁrst question. So on the eﬃciency side, as you know, initially we targeted
$200 million of savings in 2016. That number will be higher and is likely to exceed $300
million in 2016. The reason that it won't have the impact as anticipated on the eﬃciency -on the expense ratio is because, as we stated before, we're likely to see a modest top line
decrease. However the targets we've set for the local business units are very much on an

FINAL

absolute expense basis because I want to make sure that the focus really is on proﬁtability
and not volume.
On the second part of your ﬁrst question, we're not just tackling the 16% of premiums that
are in those 15 underperforming portfolios. We are taking actions across the board and
while rates may be diﬃcult in this environment, a lot of the combined ratio improvement
and loss ratio improvement will actually come from lift, which is the improvement in loss
ratio because of growing disproportionately the better tiers and taking some very
signiﬁcant and tough actions on the bottom tiers of the portfolio.
So even with a low rate increase assumption, I think that 2 to 3 points improvement in
combined ratio is still an achievable target for 2016.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

But this is -- now just to be absolutely sure, this is now exclusively coming from the loss
ratio improvement, the expense ratio we should expect to stay ﬂat?

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

I think the majority will come from the loss ratio. The expense ratio will probably be
roughly ﬂat or marginally improving.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thomas, on your second question on the capital side of it, obviously we're in a fortunate
position from a balance sheet perspective that we have a very strong capital position and
we still estimate that we'll have $3 billion available to us to deploy through the end of
2016. What you've heard from us today is that we'll resolve how that will be done with the
full-year results in February and we'll give clarity to investors as to how we'll do it.
I guess if you look back, as we entered September I guess our intentions were clear at that
point that we had intended to apply it inorganically. I guess today it's less clear exactly
how that would be done but we'll look at it as we go through the year end. The most
important thing for us is value. So given the choices that would be available to us, where
do we see the highest possible return for the beneﬁt of our shareholders. And that will
drive the allocation in the end.

Hi there. Thank you very much. Two questions, the ﬁrst is coming back, sorry, yet again on
the expense ratio. I just wondered, I'm curious that you're not increasing the $1 billion cost
reduction target. I think you said you'd take the $200 million next year up to $300m. Why
not take the $1 billion up because clearly top line is going to be under pressure?

Bloomberg Transcript

Then second question is coming back on the $3 billion of capital and M&A activity, would
you be able -- do you feel that you can make a bold statement like you would rule out a
major M&A transaction or is that like RSA was? Or is that something that you don't want to
say at this stage? And could you elaborate more on the bolt-ons that you might be
contemplating? Thank you very much.

A - Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

Hi, Nick, let me come ﬁrst with the issue on our eﬃciency program. The plan remains to
drive eﬃciency and cost savings through the organization of $1 billion plus. So it's got to
be more than $1 billion by the end of 2018. With the review we have taken in GI we have
also stated that we look to accelerate and reprioritize some of those investments or as
well saving initiatives. I think we have shown with the comments from Kristof that this is
happening, particularly as well with regard to some of the headcount reductions.
The other initiatives ongoing with regards to continuous streamlining of the organization
and with that we want to deliver ﬁrst on these targets before we have additional cost
savings program on top of it. I think that's the key priority.
With regards to the M&A, I hand over for that to George.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Hi Nick, it's George. So I think we've actually made that bold statement already. I think
that's really what happened in September. Given the challenges we face in GI, we've
made it clear that that's the number one priority for us. So for me now to turn around and
now open up the possibility we would execute a major acquisition, that would be really
odd. So September was a statement of intent from us around what the number one
priority would be.

FINAL

As regards how we might deploy it between bolt-ons and capital return, again I won't go
into that in depth today, other than to say value is the key driver for us. If I look at the
transactions that take place in the market today -- you've seen some recently -- it strikes
me they take place at levels that are above that which would give us the indicated return
that we believe we would need for deployment of the capital. It doesn't mean it's
impossible but we're certainly very well aware of what the current clearing prices are. It's
diﬃcult to make things work at those levels.
We continue to look; we continue to look for opportunities to deploy capital for the
beneﬁt of shareholders. But value is the number one driver.

A - Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

Just to add to that, Nick, obviously given what we just have said with regards to the
initiatives in General Insurance, it is somewhat unlikely that we will deploy signiﬁcant
capital in organic investment. And given as well the outcome on the discussion we had on
RSA, inorganic opportunities are going to be likely to be bolt-on in nature as you're
striving and you will not deviate from that in the past. But you've got to understand that
we will not be in a position to talk more into that than where we stand at this point.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Thank you very much for that. Can I just follow up just with another angle on this which is
that with the bolt-ons, I think with the RSA acquisition you said that the timing was not
right, the GI business was not in the right condition. Now with bolt-ons, is the GI review
making it more or less likely that you might make bolt-ons? Because bolt-ons I guess
could actually help you in some ways and I just wondered if you had any thoughts on
that?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Maybe the one ﬁrst comment I'd make, Nick, I think when we spend ﬁve minutes
discussing bolt-on acquisitions we leave people with the impression we have a giant list of
bolt-on acquisitions that we're just waiting to use the $3 billion on. I don't want to leave
people with the impression that that would be the case.
I think when we consider adding to the portfolio that we have, it has to follow the strategic
direction we set in the past. So it would have to strengthen strategic -- distinctive positions
that the Company has. It has to meet the ﬁnancial hurdles. There's a number of signiﬁcant
challenges that we would apply to the use of capital in any inorganic form.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Fantastic. I'm going to ask the same question, sorry, I really apologize for that. But good
for you for having -- saying you're going to cut premium volume. There is one
inconsistency which is that you're saying the $3 billion growth, then deals, then return
money, even though your language at the moment is more value, which I take to return
money. Then on the non-life side you're saying, oh the problem was we didn't focus
enough on proﬁt and we focused too much on growth. So I detect there an inconsistency
and I want to be really, really sure that the message internally is indeed proﬁt, not growth.
There's a mixture there which I'm wondering about.
Then the other thing which is really for George Quinn because you're much better at this
than I'll ever be. But you said or somebody said that the cost of capital for the decision to
allocate capital was partly dependent on the share price. So let's assume that as you pay
your lovely 17% dividend, the share price slides as it normally does after December, let's
assume the share price now is $300. At $300 would you imply the same discipline which
you're talking about at the moment, which is really to really brush aside deals is the
feeling I'm getting and focus more on value, which I take to mean capital return? Or is
$300 the level at where you think, oh things look better now, the cost of capital is down,
investors love us, we can go out and spend a bit of money? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thank you for the questions. On the ﬁrst one, I guess maybe we separate a bit what's
happening operationally and the imperative that we have that Kristof's talked about, to
improve what's taking place at the front line. There's no one there where we've said to
them we've got some money we'd like you to go and spend. They're all under a clear
instruction from Kristof and the GI leadership that the priority is proﬁt.
On the second topic, I guess -- and you'll understand this even better than I would -- that
basing the hurdle rate on the opportunity posed by your own stock means that that's
always a dynamic process. I think I wouldn't react and we've tried not to react to shortterm changes in the share price. So if it goes signiﬁcantly up, I don't think we'd
automatically assume that the cost of capital had signiﬁcantly fallen.
And in fact I think if you go back to the last two investor presentations we've given, we
could debate what the cost of capital was when we gave those presentations. But we set a
threshold of 10. And I think that generally in most cases, even if the cost of capital
appeared lower you'd have to be very, very careful about deciding you wanted to deploy
capital at levels lower than that.
But having said all of that, obviously it's our aim to try and drive value overall for
shareholders. If we see the share price rise to the kind of levels that we've discussed. And
hopefully it follows the improvements that we've made, then that decision would be a
luxury problem for us to be frank.

Q - Andrew Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions please. I think you've said that you are setting absolute
cost levels or targets for the divisions within the GI. Could you just explain what the basis
for those targets is, whether it's arbitrary x% cuts or whether it's more fundamental in
terms of what's the competitive cost base for that line of business?
The second question is just on the slide six which shows the underperforming portfolios.
My question is, this is as at year to date. I'm always a little anxious for companies where
there's been a radical management change that there is -- or within a business unit that
there is an overreaction on near-term problems which perhaps look slightly diﬀerent over
longer term. And you end up just chasing the last trade if you like. What do those charts
look like? Are they similar? Have you looked at them on a 3, 5, 10 year view? And if so -and as a follow-up to that, you mentioned that you'd identiﬁed that Zurich had been slow
to recognize some of the large loss trends. I just wondered whether you could just
articulate what those trends were or whether they were simply within certain business
units?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

Okay. So let me take those two questions, Andrew. So on how we set the cost targets -and let me make a distinction between 2016 and then the longer-term objective that
we're trying to accomplish. So for 2016 we have set some absolute cost targets. These
were a combination of some of the initiatives that are already underway, whether that is
lean, some of the centralization of the functions. And a combination then as well on the
assumptions we made on volume and the required resources for that.
So where in smaller parts of the portfolio we exited lines that clearly has an impact on the
resources that are required and some of those actions we have taken immediately. So
that's how I would categorize 2016. So it was a detailed assessment of what is required,
what are the initiatives that are already underway to make this business more eﬃcient.
Now on your point around the longer term on eﬃciency, it is clear that for us to be
competitive in this industry in the longer term we need to continue to focus on eﬃciency.
We do look at where we stack up competitively and that is also how we set the strategic
long-term target of achieving at least $1 billion of cost savings by the end of 2018. As you
know, GI is the largest part of that. That should get us to a competitive cost position.
So that's on the ﬁrst question. On your second question on page six on the portfolios and
the short term versus the longer term, if you would actually look at previous years, some
of the portfolios that are in the red bucket would have been underperforming, not to the
same extent. And depending on the year. 2014 was actually in hindsight for some of these
portfolios a relatively benign year in terms of large losses.

Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG

FINAL

So it is important to take a long-term view. What we have seen though is a signiﬁcant
deterioration in 2016 that has accelerated in the ﬁrst half and then growing into Q3. When
we talk about some of the things that we were late to spot, I think in particular that goes to
the large loss piece. That is one where I think we have been too slow to react. That is a key
focus area. I think with the actions again that we're taking some of the volatility, some of
the exposure to large losses should absolutely come down. And I think that is the right
thing short term but also longer term.

Q - Andrew Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

Just on that last point, Kristof, I guess I don't feel -- you said that 2014 perhaps some of
these -- had been benign for these and said that it accelerated in 2015 and got worse.
That feels like a very short time period to me making a decision and it doesn't sound like
a trend to me for a business that has a multi-year pattern. So I guess -- and also on the
large loss points you're making, are you able to articulate fundamentally what those
trends were, whether it's from lines of -- very speciﬁcally trends within the line of business
that you just don't you can overcome or trends in terms of your lack of your capabilities or
scale or technological capabilities or digital capabilities? It's just not clear to me that
they're -- you say they're trends but I'm not sure I totally understand what those trends are
given that they're not coming from long-term trends in the business.

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

First of all on the views that we said that we took, we've taken a 3, 5 and 10-year view on
some of these portfolios and when we look at the volatility and the returns that they are
generating, I think it is the right strategy going forward to reduce the exposure and
reduce the volatility.
When you look at the trend in large losses, I think there are a number of factors that are
playing here. There's the interconnectivity of risks, there's the aggregation across diﬀerent
lines of business that plays a role here. And that is where some of the fundamental
analysis we are doing in terms of the large losses, some of the events that we've seen,
should give us the right tools going forward to reduce that volatility.

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Hi, guys. Just to keep you on slide six to begin with, obviously that 143 is not a great
number but to be honest I don't think that 94 is a great number either. 94 is a decent
combined ratio for a lot of your peers in a normal year but this is for the portfolio
excluding all the bad stuﬀ in what is actually quite a nice favorable weather year. So I'm
wondering what makes you think that you don't actually need to improve the rest of the

Page 17 of 25



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG

Date: 2015-11-05

portfolio by quite a bit as well, because it seems like quite a lot of the actions are focused
on the orange bit that you've highlighted there?

FINAL

That's the ﬁrst question and then the second question is on reserves. Could you just tell us
a little bit more about this reserve increase in construction liability, what it relates to,
whether it's an industry issue and maybe what underwriting years it comes from as well?
Thank you.

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

So Sami, let me take the ﬁrst question and I'll let George comment on the reserve. So just
to make it very clear, the underwriting review that we did was very broad. It covered all
portfolios and we have speciﬁc actions across all of our portfolios. Because you're
absolutely right; we are not going to get to the required combined ratio by just
addressing the 15 portfolios. The reason we've highlighted the 15 portfolios is that some
of the tougher actions we're taking where we're exiting lines of business, where we're
willing to see very signiﬁcant drops in retention will clearly be focused on those 15
underperforming portfolios.

Bloomberg Transcript

But for the other $17.7 billion NAP with the 94 combined, you're absolutely right, that
combined does need to improve. And that will again be a combination of looking where
do we need some rates; tiering is something that we apply across the entire portfolio and
the extent of the actions that we take will probably be a little bit more moderate there
than on the underperforming portfolios but by and large the underwriting review covered
the entire book, because clearly our combined ratio is not where it needs to be.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Is the philosophy the same in the other portfolios as well of kind of prioritizing margins
over volume there?

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

Yes. In general you can absolutely make that statement. Across the book margin is the top
priority over volume and that does not mean that some parts of our book will not
continue to grow because we see continued good proﬁtability in parts of our book. But as
part of the rest of GI, that $17.7b, there will be parts of that book as well that will see some
shrinkage and will require some rate as well.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Okay.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Sami, on the second part of your question on this sub-portfolio of construction liability, it's
not a particularly large product line for us; it's less than $200 million of earned premium.
But it's been signiﬁcantly impacted particularly in the 2012 and 2013 years for claims from
those two periods.

FINAL

The preliminary announcement that we made in September had already contemplated an
increase. As I mentioned earlier, given the outcome that we had for the quarter, we also
felt that we should take a more prudent view in this part of the overall portfolio. We are
market leader in this relatively small segment. The claims are quite lumpy so they tend to
be quite large in nature. So it does pose some reserving challenges. But given what we've
done, we feel we're in an appropriate position for reserves for this line of business.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Do you think it's fair to say that your conﬁdence level on those reserves is quite a bit
higher than what it is on average across the whole book?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

It varies from area to area. In fact if I looked across the book, the areas that would typically
cause you more concern typically are like APH, A&A, workers comp, those types of things.
But these have all performed within our expectations. With the things we've dealt with,
obviously the steps we've taken here improves the conﬁdence we have in this particular
line. And in fact that's also true for what we've done in commercial auto in the Third
Quarter.

Ralph Hebgen, KBW.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Hi, guys. Ralph Hebgen from KBW. I've got three things. One is back to the reserve
increase in the construction line I'm afraid. I would just like to understand perhaps better
your thinking of why you needed to increase these reserves following a proﬁt warning in
September where you knew you had to strengthen reserves but in other lines of business.
So in other words, I'd just like to explore what is behind your reserving philosophy now? Is
that particular reserve increase which we have known about now a sign of increased
prudence or is it a sign of a heightened understanding of what your claims experience is
like and therefore was made necessary by developments which you became aware of
only after September 21?
That was the ﬁrst question. The second question relates to cash targets. You conﬁrmed
again today that you stick by your target of more than $3.5 billion of remitted cash in 2015.
That number of course is now after a $800 million proﬁt warning. I'm guessing there's an
underlying operating remittance of about $2b. So I'm just wondering where does all this
cash come from? Well that's really the question. What speciﬁc items are there that you are
conﬁdent must emerge before the year is out which support this level of cash to this order
of magnitude?

Page 19 of 25

split between prior years and current years on the various reserve increases which you
have conducted? Thank you very much.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thank you, Ralph. So if you don't mind, I'm going to direct your number three to the IR
team. I'm sure they can give you some assistance and --

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Okay that's cool, perfect.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

-- break down the numbers. So on the other two. So on reserving I guess I've tried to say
as carefully but as clearly as I can today that essentially the way the process has worked
for us, we reviewed the reserving position, I think we mentioned already that we had the
beneﬁt of the reserving process actually running in the few days prior to the September 21
announcement. We reviewed all of the areas that we felt were relevant and we came to
various conclusions.

Bloomberg Transcript

And arriving at the number that we publicized in September, we allowed for what would
be a normal month of September for nat cats. As we've now closed the quarter, we don't
have a normal month for the month of September; it's much lower in fact. I think it's -- I
think from what we had assumed, it's close to zero impact.
At the same time we've looked again across the portfolio and we've decided to increase
the prudence that we have around this particular topic. It was one of the things that was
actually in the estimate that we had in September but we have increased it. Overall, as I
mentioned earlier, the two items oﬀset and we end up back almost exactly the same
position that we had led investors to expect.
Now again I think I said in the intro to the call that -- I think I was well aware when we
made that decision that that would trigger additional questions but of the choices that
were in front of us, the one that we opted for seemed like the best one for me then. And
to be honest, it still seems like the best one to me today.
On the cash, the cash, well, I was going to say that it's not very complicated; it's always a
bit complicated. So for 2015 I guess the good news is that the drivers of what drives cash
for this year are largely in the bag already. So it's cash remittance that we've had from
subsidiaries during the year. And the challenge of what's happened at the end of the year
is more likely going to aﬀect dividend ﬂows in 2016.
But the reason that you see the conﬁdence not only around cash for this year but also
conﬁdence that we can continue to achieve the $10 billion that we talked about at Q2,
which of course exceeds the target level by about $1b. That's driven by a number of
things. The very basic thing it's driven by is when we gave the $10 billion number we had
Page 20 of 25



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2015-11-05

FINAL

an expectation that we'd be well above the $10 billion number. And even if I knock oﬀ the
after-tax proﬁt warning, it brings me down to a level where we're still conﬁdent we can
deliver the more than $10b.
Practically what drove that higher number? One of the things that would certainly drive it
is Farmers. I think as everyone is well aware, we've had a program led by Jeﬀ and the
team to discuss with the key stakeholders a reduction in the capitalization of Farmers Re.
I'd say that the team have executed that extremely well and over the course of the next 12
to 18 months, as we've said previously, we expect to extract the vast majority of the capital
in Farmers Re.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Can I just follow up on that on the cash? It's still the case that you have about operating
cash about $2 billion now for 2015 which means that we have $1.5 billion at least in
speciﬁc items topping that up. But where does this come from? Is this already some of the
Farmers extraction, not only from Farmers Re but also from the ﬂoating rate note included
in the solvency of the exchanges? Are you making more progress in the extraction of that
not quite $1b?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We're making exactly the progress that we had planned for. So again I think we said I
think in the early part of this year that we expected to extract all or almost all of that over
the next 18 months. I guess I'm trying to signal as much as I can that our conﬁdence is very
high given the stage of completion that we're at with the various key stakeholders.
On top, it's not just Farmers, we also have -- the GL team have been doing good work.
You've seen what we've done earlier this year around the annuity transaction and of
course that helps, it's a one-oﬀ. We sold an asset manager in the UK; that again helped.
And in fact GL also has a target to reduce utilization of capital in some areas over the
course of the next 18 months. So a combination of all of these things more than oﬀsets this
short-term weakness in the operating performance because of the proﬁt warning this
year.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Okay and just one follow-up on the heightened prudence relating to your reserving
decision. Can we expect that this heightened prudence in reserving philosophy will also
aﬀect other areas of the business as you go forward and issue or conduct your regular
reserve reviews?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I guess all I could really do is repeat what I said at the introduction to the call. So I guess,
as everyone knows by now, there are no absolute guarantees in reserves. These are based
on judgments of individuals looking at the facts before them. In this particular quarter
we've taken a decision to be more prudent around this particular line. We do not
anticipate that we'll make further changes in what's been a very consistent reserving
process.

Mark Cathcart, Jeﬀeries.

Q - Mark Cathcart

Yes hello. Back in 2003 I think under Jim Schiro we had a presentation which introduced
the Zurich Way and one of the notions was driven by losses of the World Trade Center
where you had I think 12 contiguous buildings, in other words concentration of risk. And
we were assured in that presentation that under the Zurich Way there'd be no such
concentration of risk ever again. So I just wondered if you could talk about Tianjin? Surely
that was a huge concentration of risk. You've talked about volatility of risk but that seemed
to be high concentration. You've had losses way larger than any other insurer or reinsurer
in that region. So what has actually happened? You talk about governance issues. Did the
Zurich Way book gradually get torn up page by page? What has actually happened?

A - Kristof Terryn

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 1891927 <GO>}

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

Let me take that question, Mark. So no, the Zurich Way book is still very much there and
it's still what our underwriters use and the Zurich Way of underwriting is still very much
how we drive underwriting excellence. When we look at concentration of risk I think
where we have been particularly strong is when it comes to managing the aggregations
of our property portfolio. I think the interplay between business interruption and property
risks, cargo, etc., I think that is where I want to do a deeper dive and understand whether
we have the right accumulation management across all the diﬀerent lines of business in
place.
Now that being said, we are one of the biggest players in the OEM space and you would
have expected that we would have had a disproportionate share of the Tianjin loss.

Q - Mark Cathcart

{BIO 1891927 <GO>}

But it was still, wouldn't you argue, too large a risk to take given the resultant loss?

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

Well this goes back to my comment on our large losses and the increase of large loss
frequency across the portfolio. When I look at the proﬁtability. And again going back to all
the diﬀerent historical views, I don't think we're getting the right returns on some of our
large loss exposures that we're having. So I would say more in aggregate across the
portfolios. And this is particularly global corporate issue, we're not seeing the right
returns on the large loss exposures that we're writing. So the strategic review of looking at
retentions, accumulation of retentions, reductions of lines and the use of reinsurance I
think is the right answer to that issue.

But you can say that since the Zurich Way was installed there's been no lowering of
standards, underwriting standards, within the Zurich Group that it's been adhered to?

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

That I can absolutely say yes.

Q - Mark Cathcart

{BIO 1891927 <GO>}

So what's the governance issue then?

I think it goes back to more how we strategically looked at the portfolio and how we were
pushing growth, not always at the right levels of proﬁtability. So for me this is much more
around how we steer the business, how we set priorities and being realistic about what
we can achieve in what is a softening market environment.

Q - Mark Cathcart

Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

Good afternoon, guys. Just a couple of questions. Firstly, just going back to slide 6, could
you give some ﬂavor in terms of how the 15 underperforming portfolios are split between
the diﬀerent regions in terms of international markets, Europe etc. or US?
Secondly, also the other operating business line this year is running lower than expected.
How should we think of this in 2016? And also could you give the gross exposure to
Tianjin for you guys as well? Thanks.

Drew, it's George. So on the ﬁrst one can I ask you to again go back to IR? They can help
you with (multiple speakers).

On the OOB side of things, if you look at the traditional pattern that we exhibit, the costs
in OOB tend to be weighted to the second half of the year. I think from what I've seen of
the analyst estimates, certainly in prior periods, people understand that and estimate it I
think pretty well.
OOB, we said earlier in the year that I think we were expecting something in excess of
$900m. We're going to be lower than that this year and that's partly driven by what we'd
started to do in response to the eﬃciency program that we announced back in May. But
we've also had a number of beneﬁts that I guess we couldn't claim complete ownership
of so we have lower ﬁnancing costs in there and our hedging program has also generated
in the year to date about a $75 million gain. So you need to back that out (multiple
speakers) OOB's performance. But that's clearly an area where we're going to target to
drive further eﬃciency into 2016.

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

So what do you think the running would be, if I could just follow up on that? What do you
think the running run rate would be going forward?

The only reason I'm hesitant is in fact I have a meeting with all of my corporate center
colleagues on Monday when we're going to discuss that particular number for next year.
So I expect us to be able to bring it down but I don't have a precise ﬁgure I could guide
you to yet. That discussion is about to take place.

A - James Quin

{BIO 18345789 <GO>}

Thank you, everybody. We are aware there is a few more questions out there.
Unfortunately we don't have any time to take them right now. The IR team will deﬁnitely
give you a call. Thanks very much for dialing in and goodbye.

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, the conference is now over. Thank you for choosing Chorus Call
