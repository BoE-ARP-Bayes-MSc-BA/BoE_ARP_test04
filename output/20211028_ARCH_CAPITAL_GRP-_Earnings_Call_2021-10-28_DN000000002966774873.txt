Thank you, Liz. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We are
pleased to have delivered solid results this quarter as our operating units generated a
9.3% annualized operating return equity and a 12.5% annualized net income ROE despite
an active catastrophic -- catastrophe quarter, sorry guys. Premium writings and rate growth
remains strong in our P&C unit driving solid fundamental earnings while our mortgage
insurance unit again produced excellent results.
The current market conditions allow us to demonstrate the value of our diversified
platform and underwriting strength as they provide us with plenty of opportunities to
deploy capital and generate an expected return on equity in the mid teens. And the
broader P&C arena, we continue to see the market hardening along with ample evidence
that our industry is addressing the adequacy of pricing across most sectors. The trajectory
and market acceptance of rate increases reinforce why we remain optimistic that
improved economics in the P&C market will be sustainable for some time. As you know,
the P&C industry is facing many degrees of uncertainty, heightened cat activity and for the
last five years, rising inflation, COVID ongoing influence on a global economy and
enduring low interest rates.
One faced with escalating risk underwriters need both rate increases and conservative
loss estimates in order to build adequate margins of safety into premium levels. With our
agile underwriting established teams and strong capital position, we are well equipped to
grow into this improving market.
Turning now to our operating units. We'll begin with insurance where our early focus on
strengthening our underwriting capability and seizing recent market opportunities is
working. Gross written premiums continued to grow substantially up 32% over the same
quarter in 2020 and our accident year combined ratio ex-cats improved to 90.5%. This is
another indication of the progress we have made in our specialty insurance business.
We've been leaning into this hardening market for two years now as rate increases
remain well above the long-term loss cost trends and have spread to more lines than last
year.
Overall, 2021 rates are up around 10% compared to 2020 and we expect that the benefit
of higher premium levels will be realized well into 2023 enhancing our expected returns
for that period. This quarter had many bright spots including positive rate increases have
accelerated the lower limits account. These lines had previously lagged the increases in
larger accounts, that is no longer the case. Two, our early focus on Lloyd's and business in

the UK has improved our scale and our economics in this market. Three, some of our
business lines that were most impacted by COVID like travel are recapturing some of the
lost volume as both business and consumer travel increases. In summary, our Specialty
Insurance Group is making the most of the current opportunities.
Pivoting now to our reinsurance group. We delivered strong growth in the quarter with
gross written premiums up nearly 25% over the same period in 2020. On a net basis
reported growth was only a modest 3% versus the same quarter in 2020 due to a catchup in sessions to Watford following the purchase of the company with our partners at July
1.
Francois will provide more detail during his comments, but absent this one-off transaction
reinsurance net written premium growth were still very strong at 30% and our outlook
remains favorable as similar to instruments. We are experiencing broad rate increases in
our specialty and casualty reinsurance lines.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the quarter, our reinsurance segment reported a combined ratio of 106% reflecting the
effects of the third quarter cats primarily Ida and the Central European floods, but
reinsurance's accident year combined ratio ex-cat is excellent at 83.2%. There are signs
that property market rates could adjust higher due to cat fatigue as you've likely heard on
other calls this quarter. The recent five-year period of elevated losses from catastrophes
proves an important insurance adage, losses don't know the level of the premium.
There are also early indications that retrocessional an aggregate excess of loss
protections are becoming increasingly hard to come by and we believe that this will be
reflected in higher property rates broadly. As you know, we weren't remain judicious in the
deployment of our cat PML, which was effectively flat in the third quarter. At less than 6%
of our tangible equity, we remained underweight in net property cat exposure and we will
deploy more capital to the line if expected returns improve above our target. It's too early
to make a call on a January 1st renewal process, but pricing in this sector is heavily
influence of the margins and if ILS or other capacity phase there is a possibility for
significant rate corrections and increase engagement on our part.
In the meantime, our reinsurance teams are demonstrating their agility and like insurance
are leaning hard into the markets where returns are most attractive. Thirdly, our mortgage
group continues to deliver exceptional returns. It generated $234 million of underwriting
profit in the third quarter and continues its impressive rebound from loss concerns
associated with the pandemic.
A September 30 insurance in-force of $457 billion for the segment was up modestly.
Further good news is that notices of default have declined to pre-pandemic levels at
September 30, which is a good indicator of improved conditions. Additionally, loans in
forbearance continue to decline as federal programs conclude and we remain cautiously
optimistic that most of these loans will ultimately cure. Rising home prices have broadly
increased homeowner equity and you will recall our position that equity levels are the best
indication of whether a delinquency will ultimately result in a loss.

FINAL

We estimate that 98% of our loans in forbearance today have at least 10% equity
providing significant protection against potential losses. Overall, the MI market remains
competitive but rational and our business continues to generate returns on capital in the
mid-teens. Mortgage originations continue at a pace similar to last year's record
origination volume and credit quality remains excellent.
As you know, in all of our operations, we actively manage capital to enhance shareholder
returns. The strong results in our mortgage segment have enabled us to optimize our
capital structure, the increased reinsurance cessions through our Bellemeade mortgage
insurance linked notes as well as traditional reinsurance. Additional reinsurance purchases
enable us to reallocate capital towards faster growing areas in specialty property and
casualty lines while enhancing our return profile in MI by reducing required capital. MI
remains a very attractive business for us. Now a point of pride and interest to us and
perhaps to you all is that last Saturday, October 23, Arch celebrated its 20 year
anniversary. So I want to say to our investors thank you for believing in us and to our
employees past and present. Thank you for your contributions to Arch for last 20 years
and our clients for showing support and conviction in our capacity to provide products to
you.
Finally, the PGA tours in Bermuda this weekend. So Golf is top of mind. A golf tournament
is interesting in that it takes place over several days and therefore consistency is critical.
You have to be sure to pick your spots and lower your score. But if you want to make the
cut, you have to limit the bogey's early, so that you can play more aggressively in the
stretch. And then once you get to the weekend, you can play with a bit more freedom
and really try for the birdies and Eagles. At this point in the cycle, we feel we've made the
cut and now were focused on really taking advantage of our positioning to make sure we
end up at the top of the leaderboard. Francois.

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Thank you, Mark, and good morning to you all on this first day of the Butterfield Bermuda
Championship here in Bermuda. Thanks for joining us today. Before I provide more color
on our solid third quarter results, you all have observed that while our earnings release still
makes a distinction between core and consolidated for purposes of -- comparison to prior
periods, there is no difference between the two presentations this quarter. As we
discussed on the last call, the closing of the Watford transaction on July 1 gave rise to a
reconsideration events and as a result of our updated VIE analysis we no longer
consolidate the results of Watford in our financial results.
Our 40% share of Watford results is now reported in the income from operating affiliates
line and there is no longer a need to make a distinction between core and consolidated
results in our financials. As Marc shared earlier our after-tax operating income for the
quarter was $294.7 million or $0.74 per share resulting in an annualized 9.3% operating
return on average common equity, and book value per share increased to $32.43 at
September 30, up 1.3% in the quarter. A very solid result in light of the catastrophe activity
that was much higher than the long-term average for this quarter, which we estimate at
over $45 billion in insured losses for the P&C industry apart, approximately three times
the average third quarter cat losses observed over the last ten years. This quarter, I

FINAL

wanted to first give you some additional detail on the results of our reinsurance
operations, which were impacted by the Watford acquisition, especially on the top line.
As part of the agreement signed at the beginning of the year with our co-investors in
Watford, we committed to seeding varying percentages of the premium written by our
Bermuda and US treaty reinsurance operations to Watford effectively enhancing the
existing business model to also serve as a sidecar for Arch, while the retrocession
agreements were effective as of the start of the year, their signing was contingent on the
transaction closing, which delayed their recognition in our income statement until this
quarter. As a result, the third quarter ceded written premium reflects a catch-up of
approximately $161.2 million from the first half of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

The impact of the premium catch-up adjustment on underwriting income for the
reinsurance segment was minimal. Growth in gross written premium remained strong at
24.6% on a quarter-over-quarter basis and growth in net written premium would have
come in at 29.5% adjusting for the Watford catch up. The growth was observed across
most of our lines, but especially in our casualty other specialty and property other than
property catastrophe lines where strong rate increases and growth in new accounts help
increase the top line. The segment's accident quarter combined ratio excluding cats
stood at 83.2% compared to 83.1% on the same basis one year ago.
On a year-to-date basis, the ex-cat accident year combined ratio has improved by
approximately 250 basis points over the same period last year, reflecting the improving
underwriting results in most of the lines in which we write them. In the insurance segment,
net written premium grew 40% over the same quarter one year ago and the segment's
accident quarter combined ratio excluding cats was 90.5% lower by approximately 360
basis points from the same period one year ago.
Excellent results across the board, which demonstrate the progress our Insurance
segment has made over the last three plus years and improving its performance and
provide us with optimism on the underlying quality of our franchise going forward. Losses
from 2021 catastrophic events in the quarter, net of reinsurance recoverables and
reinstatement premiums stood at $335.9 million or 17.4 combined ratio points compared
to 12.5 combined ratio points in the third quarter of 2020. As noted in our pre-release, our
P&C operations were impacted by hurricane Ida, the European flooding events of July as
well as a series of other events across the globe. Our mortgage segment had an
excellent quarter with a combined ratio of 26.2% reflecting favorable prior year
development of $48.4 million, about half of which came from USMI from better than
expected cure activity in pre-pandemic delinquencies and recoveries on the second lien
loans and the other half from our CRT portfolio and international MI.
The decrease in net premiums earned on a sequential basis was primarily attributable to
lower levels of a single premium terminations in the quarter for USLMI business and to a
lower level of call the CRT transaction than what was observed in the second quarter.
Recalled the second quarter benefited from higher earned premiums due to an unusually
high number of CRT transactions being called, which we highlighted as effectively being a
non-recurring event.

The delinquency rate for USMI book came in at 2.67% at the end of the quarter, a material
reduction from the peak we observed at the end of the second quarter, one year ago.
We had another solid quarter in terms of production, mostly from the purchase market
and with refinance activity coming down from prior levels, the insurance in force for our
USMI book grew slightly. The increase from last quarter in the insurance in force of our
international mortgage unit is mostly the result of the acquisition of Westpac Lenders
Mortgage Insurance Limited in early August. Although income from operating affiliates
grew significantly to $124.1 million, it is worth noting that approximately $95.7 million of the
total is attributable to a one-time operating gain resulting from the acquisition of a 40%
stake in Watford, which was offset in part by a realized loss upon the deconsolidation with
the resulting net income gain of $62.5 million. The remainder of the operating income
from affiliates represents our share of the net income generated this quarter by our
operating affiliates, which consist primarily of Watford, Coface, and Premia.

Bloomberg Transcript

Total investment return for our investment portfolio was de minimis on a US dollar basis
for the quarter. Net investment income was $88.2 million during the quarter, down by $1.2
million on a sequential basis driven by lower coupons on fixed maturities and lower
income on consolidated funds. The duration of our portfolio remains low at 2.68 years at
the end of the quarter, reflecting our internal view of the risk and return tradeoffs in the
fixed income markets.
Equity in net income of investment funds accounted for using the equity method
produced $105.4 million during the quarter, more than half of the total income generated
by our investment portfolio and a key contributor to the growth in our book value. As we
discussed on prior calls, we have increased our allocation to alternative investments in the
last few years, and these funds now represent -- represent approximately 12% of our total
portfolio at the end of the quarter. We are also very pleased with their performance so far
this year, which stands at 13% year to date.
Of note, had we included income from funds using the equity method in our definition of
operating income. Our reported operating ROE would have increased by 3.2% on a yearto-date basis to 13.3%. While these funds returns are potentially more volatile and core
fixed income strategies, we believe the incremental recurrence they provide more than
compensate for the liquidity constraints and volatility that are usually associated with
them.
The effective tax rate on pretax operating income was a benefit of 0.7% in the quarter
reflecting changes in the full year estimated tax rate, the geographic mix of our pre-tax
income and then 8.2% benefit from discrete tax items in the quarter. The discrete tax
items in the quarter primarily related to a partial release in a valuation allowance on
certain UK deferred tax assets.
Now a quick comment on the two acquisitions we closed on this quarter, Westpac and
Somerset Bridge. You all have seen that in accordance with purchase GAAP we
established approximately $337.4 million of intangibles and goodwill this quarter, most of
which will be amortized through our income statement going forward. To help with
remodeling efforts, we now expect our amortization expense to be approximately $25
million in the fourth quarter of this year and $21 million quarterly throughout 2022. On the

capital front, we redeemed all of our outstanding Series E non-cumulative preferred
shares for $450 million on September 30. Separately, we repurchased approximately $9.7
million common shares at an aggregate cost of $386.9 million in the third quarter. If we
include the additional common shares we have purchased in the fourth quarter, the yearto-date totals are now approximately $24 million shares or 5.9% of the common shares
outstanding at the beginning of the year for $917.7 million. Some of the additional share
repurchases in the fourth quarter were effectuated under the new share repurchase
authorization of $1.5 billion approved by our Board of Directors earlier this month.
As we have said since our formation 20 years ago, our core operating principles are
anchored in active cycle and capital management. We believe this quarter results
demonstrates our ability to execute on this philosophy and leads us to invest in
opportunities where we believe the returns are most attractive. At recent prices and with
the prospect of improving returns, we believe buying back our shares continues to
represent another compelling value proposition for our shareholders without
compromising our capital flexibility nor lessening the quality and strength of our balance
sheet.
With these introductory comments, we are now prepared to take your questions.

Questions And Answers

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, thanks, good morning. My first question. Marc, you're talking about the mortgage
business. You talked about buying, buying more reinsurance. So it was more capital for
growth on the P&C side, which I found interesting in the past you've spoken about
mortgage running at around a 15 plus return and P&C at kind of 10 to 12 has the dynamics
change that that caused you to kind of buy some more reinsurance to pursue more
growth on the property casualty side?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah, I think our opportunities on the P&C side just have improved right over the last
couple of years and I think we're even more convinced of the length and that has, that has
legs for for the foreseeable future. So that makes us be more proactive, to balance, if you
will, to capital allocation between more than one year, I mean we did rely heavily on a
capital deployed in MI for quite a while because it returns in P&C as you know at least as
attractive. But now that we have a new attractive and increase and improve returns in the
P&C it behooves us to, to balance the risk profile of the portfolio and that's one of the
reasons why we would do some more reinsurance and again the reinsurance also helps,
helps our return on a net basis as well, which is also another benefit.

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}
Page 7 of 22

But I'd return numbers I gave still kind of where you see the three businesses of 50% plus
and then 10 to 12.

FINAL

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yes. I would say on the P&C side. Elyse, I would say it's getting up, is north of that now. I
think we have our prospects closing, closing, the gap is closing between MI and P&C, if
you will.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

So North, a higher than 12%?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I would agree. Yeah, we think it's the case. Yes.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

And then in terms of capital you guys put in place a $1.5 billion authorization. It sounds like
you bought back a little bit under that so far this quarter going through the end of next
year. I know obviously what you buyback depends upon the market also will your shares
and the trading over the course of the next year, but when you put that in place. Was that
designed to set a mark of what you will buyback or are there other factors that could
cause you to either fully buyback that level or maybe come in lower.

Bloomberg Transcript

Just help us kind of think through that as we think about capital return through 2022.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Well, I mean, two things, we bought were close to a billion dollars this year. So we don't
want to go back to the Board every three months and ask for more. So we thought
okay,.what may we need, could we need by the end of 2022 over the next 15, over the
next 15 months effectively, $1.5 billion is just a number that nice round number. Nothing,
nothing special about it. But are we committed to that number. The answer is absolutely
not. If the market keeps improving and we have the ability to deploy your capital, all the
capital and then some in the business, we may not end up buying anything back. So it's
really again a function of the market conditions and vice versa. Right. If the market doesn't
really generate give us a lot of opportunities to grow, we might be in a position where we
buy back more than that. So it's really again it will be a function of what we see in front of
us over the next 15 months.
And if we end up going through the $1.5billion sooner than the end of next year then we'll
do something else. So again, it's very dynamic, very real time I'd say. And we'll see where
things take us.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, thanks for the color.

Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. So first I've a question on just what you're seeing in terms of pricing,
both on the insurance and the reinsurance side. And to what extent do you think price
increases are going to hold versus may be especially on the reinsurance, market seems
like things have been getting a little bit softer over through the course of the year. But
how does, how do recently high catastrophes affect your view of one-one notes.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Right Jimmy, if we bifurcate the market into property cat, you agree, I would tend to
agree with you that property cat raise did not increase as much as we had hoped
collectively as an industry we see not only at Arch is going to be single Arch phenomenon,
therefore that's why you saw us write less property cat over the next, over the last nine
months.
Assuming that reaction to those rate level, I would the -- it's still early. Like we said, like I
said in my commentary, but I think we should have a repricing, definitely repricing in
Europe and in the US even for the layers that have been impacted. That's for sure. And I
think it would start to spill out even on to those that have not sustained a loss because I
think there is a recognition of heightened cat activity and I think that the market is sort of
bracing for that as we go forward. I think it's going to be a matter of degree. On the rest
of the marketplace, I think that overall since if you look at the liability lines in general,
overall you'll see -- you can think of in terms of the quarter share if you like quota share of
casualty or liability lines, you are benefiting from the rate increases in the business and I
think the ceding commissions, which were maintained, held high for in 2020 are starting
to come down a little bit.
So there is a recognition that, so there's a bit of an improvement from that perspective
on quarter share, on the excess of loss in general for liability. The raise are stable to
somewhat, more stable, but again you apply those raise against a base that is increasing
in premium level, so they are also getting some price uplift. And I think that big as soon, I
mean the reinsurance market. Jimmy fees off of the insurance market right.
In a positive way I want to express a positive message. We actually, we only receiving in of
a portion of what the insurance market rights, and to the extent the interest market rights
premium at a higher level, we are benefiting from those -- from those rate increases.

Okay. And then can you quantify how much you've got in terms of COVID reserves
especially for business interruption and I'm assuming they're mostly still IBNR as you had
been quantifying last year. And just discuss what the process would be in the timeline
would be for release than these given that for the most part, it seems like the courts have
been fighting with the insurance companies at least thus far in the US.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah, I'd say, I mean we're still very much a lot of IBNR in our COVID reserve is more than,
more than half, 60% or so. I'd say of our of -- our call it COVID reserves on the P&C side
are still IBNR. So -- and how quickly well, we know, we're not know whether we'll need
those reserves, time will tell. I think it's where we sit. Yes. I don't disagree that. So far,
there have been a couple of positive developments from the courts, but it's going to take
a while.
I truly think this is, I mean, very complicated and issue that will take years to resolve. So I
wouldn't expect us to really take dramatic action on the level of COVID reserves on the
P&C side for some time.

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

And Jimmy in our industry and insurance, you could win 95 lawsuits and lose 96 and it
changes everything. So there's a lot of uncertainty in our space. Even though we've been
at good streak, one change could change everything so (inaudible) good.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

And what is the rough number of -- what rough dollar amount of reserves.

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

That's a good question. I don't have it in front of me. We can circle back with you, I know
we booked a few hundred million dollars last year and we paid some of that I don't have
that current figure, but we can give you that.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

We haven't changed ultimate Jimmy over the three quarters.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

But it's not something like that's more maybe 2023-24 as opposed to 22 in terms of its
potential releases on these.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

But there are releases. I will, to it will probably take another year, year and a half and we
might hold a little bit more longer for the reasons I just mentioned in terms of court
decisions.

Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Wolfe Research.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 22348763 <GO>}

Hey, great. Good morning. I guess in some of the prepared remarks when you guys were
talking about the primary insurance segment, talked about kind of seeing rate
acceleration, actually in the lower limits, kind of the smaller commercial space. And any
theories on what's on why that's happening, is it you don't loss cost trend, increasing
because we're kind of, you're seeing a fading of rate a little bit of deceleration and in the
large account space. So kind of curious, if you guys have any views, maybe broadly to on
kind of loss cost trend, given all the uncertainty during the pandemic, on the primary
insurance side?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The loss cost trend as we observe it and it might change, is still roughly in the 3% to 5%. It
depends on the lines of business but we have already changed our view on this at this
point time we had a loss reserve review, I believe, couple of months ago.
So is it's not changing. Although we are putting in our loss ratio pick an extra level of
margin safety to make sure we wouldn't be missing because it could be higher. As you
know, inflation is certainly another concern that we all have collectively as underwriters. In
terms of my theory about why the smaller accounts, get those rates right now, it's just
that it's the market is a human psychology market and the pricing get more acutely
needed in the larger capacity play, this is where the market starts focusing its first effort
as the market hardens and this is not a news, this is not unusual. This is a very, very normal
phenomenon in the hardening markets. So you will tend to try and fix those are more
important, meaning if you put a $10 million to $15 and $25 million limit, these are the ones
you're going to trying to fix right away because presumably those will have caused you a
bit more pain over the last three years, we expecting more things coming from that
portfolio and it's just a matter of time before people start looking sideways as to what
other lines of business needed rate and then you start dipping down into your overall
portfolio and seeing where the liability trends for instance might else will be impact and
this is sort of a sort of a second-round sort of a rippling effect from the main capacity
providing players into the ones who have a lower price. And at the same time. To be fair
and to be I mean to be truthful. You also have development in ongoing happening on the
smaller accounts at the same time, this is just not as acute and as glaring and as obvious
early as a larger capacity play that's why.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 22348763 <GO>}

That's interesting and helpful. Maybe switching gears to the mortgage segment. Just
curious, I know the forbearance levels continue to decrease, if you could remind us, I
believe there is some extensions to the forbearance program or maybe even new kind of
Page 11 of 22

enhanced programs where the P&I could be reduced, the payments can be reduced by
up to 25%, is that correct.
And if so is are you seeing your borrowers utilize those options.

FINAL

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. So right now the the the program is done expires of 09/30, expire in in terms of
foreclosure right. So, but I don't, the forbearance, I'm sorry, the foreclosure, it's still
unclear right because they could also come back and extended further if things were to
change and the CFPB is also involved with the FHFA's saying that we don't want to have
anymore. There is a moratorium on a foreclosure process as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

So I think both federal entities are trying to push to go back to your last point of your
question, push the, the mortgage to loan or the mortgage originator and provider of
providing solutions to the borrowers who are still in forbearance or not current on their
payments and to your point, a lot of it is going to be continuing the same payment. Most
of it is going to be continuing the same payment at prior to the COVID forbearance
program and is attaching at the end, towards the end, the lack of what wasn't paid what
was accrued as unpaid at the end of the loan.
So this is roughly what it's going to look like, but it's going to be another another three
quarters before we have more visibility because even though the forbearance program
stopped in 09/30 and people should come now to the banks And you know the
mortgage originator and trying to remediate their position from the forklift from a
forbearance perspective, it's still going to take another six to nine months. And I think the
agencies are watching carefully. So everything is is heading towards a happy resolution, if
you will, of the overall forbearance programs like everybody is focusing on this as this
point in time.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 22348763 <GO>}

Okay, great. And one last one on are sticking to mortgage, and I can take this offline with
but with (inaudible) but just want to the increased seeded, premium seeded as
percentage of gross, is that due to Bellemeade and I guess if it, if it is. Can you guys
continue to upsize the reinsurance usage in the segment if you thought opportunistically,
you want to shift more growth towards other lines of business?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Yeah, that's very much in that vein, I think Marc made the point earlier, we were always
looking to optimize the portfolio and certainly a lot of that is focused on capital
deployment, I think made the point last call that we had increased our quota share
percentages on the USMI book at 7.1. So that's starting to play through basically in that,
that is reflected. We also. We still very active in the Bellemeade space, so we are, we're
purchasing quite a lot there as well, and I'd say, those two things combined really explain
why we have more ceded premium starting this quarter.

Got it. There is more appetite if you decided to do more either quota or Bellemeade,
both in the future. Are you kind of reaching kind of a max.

FINAL

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I mean, I'd say we certainly do a lot of Bellemeade as it is. So I don't want to say we
wouldn't do more, but it's, I mean we already are very active in that space and made big
placement. So I wouldn't expect us necessarily increase that that vehicle of -- that
mechanism to transfer risk a whole lot. And on the quota share. I mean work. Yes. Can we
see more, we could, but then it's the risk return trade off and whether the economics
work are reasonable or work in our favor to. So right now we're happy where we're at. But
if things change in the market gives us better opportunities we could conceivably see it a
bit more. Yes.

Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yeah, good morning everyone. And this may not be the best math, but it's gross, I think
you guys, the inventory of COVID era mortgage claims about 120,000, you've had about
90,000 cures, I'm estimating that you guys have about $20,000 up or notice right now in
the portfolio may not be exact, historically, you've had about an average of $5,000 up are
noted, it seems like the reserves are stuff particularly as you tell us that 90% of -- 98% of
the clientele, at least $10,000 in equity, so I mean I'm trying to rectify all this, I think, can
you explain to me I feel I've asked this question before, I just don't understand what's
going on there.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah, I think the answer is going to be very similar. So, very good question. Hopefully
you're not taken by the police, back there. If you look at the average case reserve per
annual these are, it's actually 23,500 I believe is in the supplement, you can look at and to
it and you're right, it was, it went up from last year, the run rate pre COVID was roughly
10,000,11,000,12,000, so it did increase and about was about 110,000 claims that we've
got as well a COVID in the forbearance and about 78% of them by cured so far, so we're
about 20,500. So better than that we have about 31,707 I think is a number in terms of
NODs outstanding when you multiple by through, you're right, it would look on the high
side.

Page 13 of 22



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2021-10-28

FINAL

A couple of things I will say here. Number one is, the average face, the average severity
of the policies that we are facing the COVID 19 are starting from 18-19 We have a higher
face than the one we had as NODs back in 2019 why those in 2019 were largely pre 2008.
So yes, adjust for the level of coverage that has increased over the last 10-12 years. So
that explains one why 23 would be higher than the 11-13 historically.
The second part of your question which where should it go and this is where it's more art
than science, Josh. We hear you. We are up cautiously optimistic that it may not come to
pass in terms of meeting the reserves and hopefully some of it will cure better than we
anticipated, but I just want to remind everyone at call and as we remind ourselves all the
time, it's that this is a political positioning right things could change very quickly from the
FHFA, the GSEs or the housing department. So we need to be really careful and we've
never been through that kind of event. So we are Arch, as you know and we will take a
cautious prudent approach to reserving. And if we happen not to meet those reserves as
we do, typically will be taking them by the hands from the liability side down to the capital
side.
Were not going to then stranded for a long time, but again so much, so many
uncertainties, Josh, we understand you're puzzling. And this is a very unusual situation for
the industry. Therefore, we have to, and that's why we appear probably to be a little bit
unusual in that reserving it.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And my second question, unrelated, can you talk about the differential. I guess, the new
business NLC between new business you're putting on the books and legacy customers.
So you have a deep sense of their, of their -- the risk factors on those accounts, is there a
gap is the business that you're renewing at better margins, what you're booking at new
business given that you know more about the business you already have.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I believe, Josh, you're talking about P&C Right?

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yeah, this is totally primary P&C not more of.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

It can make sense to me. So it's a really a very astute question Josh because we're
keeping track of the renewal rate versus a new business rate level and symptomatic or as
a representation of the hardening market, the pricing of the new business is coming
higher than the renewal business, and that's sort of speaks to the fact that they need a
new home and need to be repriced and people sort of get, you get tired of that
relationship. And it goes back thrown back into either the E&S or the admitted market. So
right now, we're still seeing on average the new business, price better the renewal
business.

Our next question comes from Tracy Benguigui with Barclays.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

Thank you. Just a big picture question a seamless quarter with you and your closer peer
group, is that the insurance growth is outpacing the more primary market focus players
without reinsurance arm. Are you seeing a lot of market dislocation where you feel like
you just do a better job assuming displace rest that still meet risk adjusted return hurdles.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Would like to think we're better than the average guy out there, but -- but Tracy I think
overall the dislocation was much larger in 2020. I think you were still seeing some
dislocation right now and certainly not, there's still some repositioning of limit provided
the market by a lot of players still as we speak. And I think what, what explains our ability
to grow is first We have a really well established presence and we were really on the
weight, Tracy, historically. We're really, really good market for people that want a good
security for products such as D&O, for instance, right. We are really good home for
someone to take on new as an insurer, and we're sort of, sort of, we're definitely
benefiting from that as an incumbent in a good, with a good quality, good reputation as
we do.
Also I think, the other thing that I want to mention, we had said that last year we were
suffering a little bit from some of the travel and travel -- lack of traveling that impacted our
travel portfolio. So that's certainly helps by treating the fact that economies reopening
and people are traveling a bit more that also helps explain why we're able to, to grow a
bit more than probably and meet the average -- within the average would. Lastly, I would
say that beyond just new business funding new homes. I think the programs, we also
growing in programs, as you see, this is very specialty smaller risk. I think that again
another, another example of programs finding a new home, going away from the existing
incumbent possibly because of better results and finding a new home and we definitely
are receiving end of that relationship.

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Yeah. And one thing I'll add quickly, I think both depending on the mix of business of what
you call the more established in the traditional insurers, I mean workers' comp and
commercial auto typically will make up a bigger shares of their, of their portfolio. Auto is
moving up nicely, but I would say that certainly comp as and had a really good period of
excellent results so rate increases on the comp side has been pretty flattish.
Page 15 of 22



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2021-10-28

So again that's probably worth adjusting for comp because it's such a big line for some of
these carriers.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

FINAL

And I'm wondering how much of that is structural in nature, like other is raising attachment
points and you're lowering attachment points are offering lower deductible?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

No. We don't, we don't do that. No, we don't play that game. I think we would just be
replacing most of our play typically on specialty lines Tracy is mid excess versus second,
this is sort of what we play a lot of times and high excess of course in certain areas. So I
know we put a record. We're not seeing any of the deductible being played out in the
marketplace and that's in fact there are deductible increases if anything else and we just
see a lot of shortening of limit toward on in the stacking. We saw that in 2020 is ongoing
as we speak instead of having stretch of 25, talking about the larger placements you have
stretches of ten or five or five or ten really in 15 perhaps still staying, but there's a lot
more players needed to to fill up the towers, that's definitely happening more. So it's still
continuing to some extent lesser than 2020.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay and then just shifting to reinsurance, where are seeing your favorable reserve
development coming from.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah, I mean the vast majority and we'll talk to it and obviously in the queue at vast
majority is in short-tail lines. I mean, I'd say probably 80% in short tail lines, mostly
property, other than cat where we've grown a lot in the last couple of years and while the
tail is always a bit longer we think it should be. It's still, we have a pretty good idea, two,
three years out after writing the policy or the account and we're seeing a lot of that
coming through in this quarter, a bit of favorable development on prior year cats as well
and a bit on trade credit and surety from a few years ago where we had some reserves
that proved out to be a bit work required. So we released those this quarter.

Page 16 of 22



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2021-10-28

Thanks. This is, cycle management question I guess for Marc, when if ever do we decide
that there is never going to be an appropriate hard market and property cat just get out
of the line.

FINAL

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I think that by virtue of, well, first, I'm an optimist, right. I've always been an optimist, I've
heard so many times over the last 27 years from some of our own underwriters that they
will never be a hard market again. And when I hear this, it's music to my ears. Because that
means we're cruising for bruising. So I think that things will -- things will get better and cat
at some point, it may not be this quarter, Meyer, at some point numbers speak for
themselves. If you lose money every year people just get get the some chanted then just
walk away from it. It happened after storms in Europe 92 Andrew's, earthquake in
California 94, terrorist attack, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma and there is always changes and it's
not I rattled by five or six of them and you got to believe that the world is a dangerous
place, Meyer. So I think something will happen and again losses don't necessarily change
the market, the market pricing, but perception of risk will and would, so maybe we're in
this place where people said, you know what, why bother and if that's the case, and that
in the demand for cat, as you know, protection is inelastic, so if supply shrinks then
demand will stay as is and pricing will therefore increase.
So I'm an optimist, so I'm not sure when it's going to happen, but I believe it will happen
at some point.

Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes, thanks. Couple of quick questions here for you. First, I just want to follow up on the
comment about new business pricing better than renewal pricing. And I have heard that
from other curious. I'm just curious when you actually go to book the margin on that new
piece of business are you booking a better margin than perhaps that renewal piece of
business or do you have to build in some level of cushion because it is new.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Well, it's a very good, but I think the latter part is what we would do, but even we would
also take a higher level of cushion on margin safety, if you will not reserving even in our, in
our renewal business. I think that we are, as you know, reserving wise and loss ratio pick
wise at Arch, we tend to be more conservative and hope for the best and hopefully good
Page 17 of 22



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2021-10-28

news come down later. We are trying to figure out, but we need to have as much cushion
as we can early on, so that we're not surprised down the road. That's not changing. I
would say, it's the same approach renewal or new business. Right. How much of the
change.

FINAL

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Not much of a change. Got you. Okay. Second, just quick question here. Are we still seeing
admitted market shed business to the E&S market or is that slow.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Slowed down little bit, but it still happening. We're not seeing a return back to the end of
the market quite yet. It's going to take a little bit longer, we think.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. And then one kind of bigger I guess philosophical question for you. I think with
the MI business, clearly, you've demonstrated that it is not a big of a volatility business, it
maybe some of the perceived just given the results we've seen through this recent crisis,
if that is indeed the case in the amount of cash that business throws off because it's not a
growth business, I guess I see you guys using share buyback as your means of capital
management and I completely get that where your stock is trading now, but what about a
dividend and maybe remind us about your philosophy with respect to to a dividend.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Well, I mean, I'll take that. Brian, I think it's something we talk about with the Board and
between ourselves all the time, we had a pretty long discussion at our last board meeting
on that, it's always on the table. I'd say right now. I mean I think it's, it. I mean the share
buyback that we went through this quarter were very attractive to towards the economics
were very much. I think they are easy to justify -- justify sorry, but could we ever introduce
a dividend. Certainly that's on the table, not saying it's imminent. But it's something that
we evaluate pretty much, definitely regularity and we'll keep looking at it.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, thanks. Just one additional question on you guys spend time highlighting that session
to Watford in the quarter, given that that transaction closed. So my sense is there going to
Page 18 of 22



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td

Date: 2021-10-28

FINAL

become more Arch like in terms of the business that you're seeding to them versus prior
to this transaction. So as you think about your 40% stake, can you just help us think about
the earning stream there because I would think that as we go through next year that that
could become a meaningful contributor to your earnings as the underwriting income of
Watford for pick up from what we're used to.

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

I think the 40% share would grow at an average sort of reinsurance market results
because we are writing business on the balance sheet of Watford. So you would expect
that. I think that what you would also see is our collecting fees or for our efforts and
compensation for our efforts for Watford that would be for the 100%. So I think that the
overall return would be slightly better even though at least as you could appreciate with
the accounting rules it might not show as such, but I think that our results will be as good. I
would hope for if not better than our overall results. So it's definitely an accretive return
generator for reinsurance platform. It's going to be hard harvested

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

That should pick up within that other income line as we move to the next year:

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. So a couple of. Yeah. The 40%. Correct. The other income line is well the fees are
picked up by the reinsurance segment because they, it's for the underwriting services
they provide to Watford, but you're correct in saying that the net equity pickup of the 40%
that we own in Watford, if you're modeling what kind of combined ratio is it going to
operate at, what kind of premium or are you going to see in terms of the volume, I would.
You're right, I mean it's probably more and more over time is going to look more and
more like Arch Re, the reinsurance segment, the percentages we see to Watford are not
uniform across all our divisions. But directionally, I think that's a good way to think about it.
And the other thing, too, which has somewhat been an issue with Watford is the
performance of the investments. Right. And that has, that is being a little bit as being
addressed as we speak. I think there are, there is a process underway to reduce the
volatility from the investment portfolio of the investment strategy at Watford. So think of it
more, yeah -- a more less volatile stream of income with more reliance on underwriting
income and less so investment income and hopefully that gets you in a good place to
start modeling out how offer is going to play out for us the 40% for Arch by going
forward.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

And then maybe I'll squeeze one last. And I'm not sure if you provided an updated tax
guidance, if so I missed it, if you can just let us know that and we've heard about some
potential tax changes whether in the US and also abroad in relation to Bermuda, you guys
are just any on any kind of prospective tax loss and just some of -- what we're hearing in
the market and how that could impact Arch.

FINAL

Yeah, I'd say, first of all, that question, fourth quarter, we're still on the 9% to 11% kind of
tax rate for for Arch in the fourth quarter for 2022 and beyond and Marc will chime in, it's
way too early and fortunately we track, we look at all developments, very carefully. We're
on top of things. And the reality is they change daily. So it's very hard for us at this point to
give you any kind of guidance or any expectations on what we think 2022 is going to look
like, we'll be more than happy to have good discussion at our, on the next call. But for now
it's, we feel it's just premature because we really don't know.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

And it leases to make the point about daily literally last night our Tax Director or this
morning just sent us like there's a new proposal on the hill that brings back shield and
then corrects other things and then dispenses of other areas of the tax proposal in the
year, we see. So again a moving target, it's politics. We'll react to it when we do, when we
see it.

Our next question comes from Matt Carletti with JMP.

Q - Matt Carletti

{BIO 5249827 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks, good morning. I think I just wanted to circle back on the discussion about
pandemic reserves and Marc you're pretty clear on the P&C side in terms of getting 95
good outcomes with the 96 can change everything, how about MI. I mean, it kind of
follow-up for Josh line of questioning like things like pretty conservative there. Can you
help us with a little bit the timeline by which if things can kind of continue to unfold well,
would be the timing by which we might see things on line.

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Well, let me start, I'd say we may see a little in the fourth quarter, but that will be, I don't
think everything will be resolved. But I truly think that the first half of 22 is when you'll see
most of the, of the movement or the corrections in our assumptions and cure rates and
mediation right. So I'd say we're going to start seeing some some data as early as this
month internally and the number of cures and people moving out a forbearance, but I
think the way it's going to flow through our numbers again given some of the
uncertainties that Marc talked about I think will be first half of 22.

Page 20 of 22

FINAL

And the reason, also, that is, has to be said and understood is that they had 18 months of
forbearance, worst when you get to forbearance earlier in 2020 and some of them went
into forbearance, came out of forbearance and went back in again. But they still get to get
to do to benefit from 18 month worth of forbearance, that's why some of them will
coming out of their 18 month in the fourth quarter. And many of them in the first and
second quarter. Next, so it seems like some of them were able to get, get back current
for four, five months and went back to forbearance program.
That's why we have this lengthy adjustment period.
