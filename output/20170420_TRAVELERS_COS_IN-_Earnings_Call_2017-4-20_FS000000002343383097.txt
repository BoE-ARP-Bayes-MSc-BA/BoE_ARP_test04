Before I turn it over to Alan, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note
included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking
statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves
risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may
differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due
to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in
our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to
update forward-looking statements.
Also, in our remarks or responses to questions we may mention some non-GAAP financial
measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial
supplement, and other materials that are available in the Investor section on our website.
One final note before I turn it over to Alan, as a result of recent SEC insurance industry
guidance relating to the use of terminology, what we previously referred to as operating
income, we now refer to as core income. As we explained in the press release, we have
also relabeled related terms. To be clear, this is a wording change, and there were no
changes in the calculation of these amounts.
And now Alan.

Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This
morning, we reported core income of $614 million and core return on equity of 10.8%,
both of which are impacted by $226 million of after-tax catastrophe losses. About half of
those losses arose out of storms occurring in the last two weeks of March. That kind of
weather volatility is certainly in our playbook, but we normally expect it a few weeks later
in the second quarter.
To give you some context, according to the National Weather Service reported hail,
tornado and wind activity in the quarter was almost 2.5 times higher than the five-year
average. The quarter also had 12 PCS wind and hail cat events, an all time record for Q1.
That surpasses the record that was set just last year. As sometimes happens in this
business, the weather in the quarter obscures what was otherwise a very good start to
the year.

FINAL

Our underlying combined ratio was strong at 91.7%. Importantly, our personal auto bodily
injury losses were within expectations and the same is generally true for loss trends
across all our businesses. In addition to underwriting profitability, we were also pleased
with our investment results this quarter with net investment income increasing 9% over
the prior-year quarter.
Turning to production, for all our business segments we were pleased with our execution
in the marketplace, including the record level of premium we wrote in the quarter. In our
commercial businesses, the markets in which we operate remain stable. We continue to
achieve historically high levels of retention of 85% in domestic Business Insurance and
88% in Bond & Specialty Insurance.

Bloomberg Transcript

Renewal rate change improved somewhat over recent quarters, and as always, what's
important is the texture underneath the headline numbers. For example, in our core
middle market business, renewal rate change improved more than 1 point compared to
the first quarter of last year. And during the current quarter, middle market renewal rate
change was positive on 59% of our accounts compared to 53% of our accounts in the
prior-year quarter. This is the result of our efforts to seek rate selectively and thoughtfully
to meet our return objectives in light of the persistently low interest rate environment,
and the fact that rate change has been below loss trend for a few years now. It's a similar
story in our management liability business.
Contrast that to our select business, where rate change has been positive and stable for
three quarters, but modestly below where it was a year ago. Given the returns in this
portfolio, we were comfortable with the renewal rate change and pleased to see
retention in new business levels up both sequentially and year-over-year.
In Personal Insurance, we are encouraged that so far we have been successful in
implementing the pricing and underwriting actions that we discussed with you last quarter
to improve profitability in our auto business, and we were very pleased to have
maintained momentum in growing our very profitable homeowners business. All in for the
company, net written premiums were up 5% compared to the prior-year quarter.
Brian will take you through the production data and top line results in more detail, but I'll
note that to a very large degree the growth reflects a combination of higher levels of
retention and higher renewal rate change. That speaks to the quality of the premium
growth.
During the quarter, we were pleased to have announced our agreement to acquire Simply
Business, a technology company and a leading digital provider of insurance to small
businesses in the United Kingdom. In addition to a number of immediate benefits, like a
profitable and growing business in the UK and access to talent with leading expertise in
digital commerce in our industry, this is a medium and long-term strategic transaction for
us. It's about building important capabilities. It's digital R&D that will give us important
insights into serving our customers and working more efficiently with our distribution
partners. It's about making sure that we're positioned to serve the customer however,
whenever, and from wherever they choose to engage with us.

We would've undertaken to develop these capabilities in any event, and teaming up with
the company and people that have been at it for over a decade, and that are leading the
way, gives us an important head start. Our agreement to acquire Simply Business is an
example of our investing thoughtfully and strategically in the business, building on the
meaningful competitive advantages that have enabled us to deliver industry-leading
returns over time. And just as we have for more than a decade, we'll make investments
like that for the long term, and continue to right-size capital by returning excess capital to
our shareholders. There's no change in our capital management philosophy.
While Jay Benet will have more to say about our capital management, I'm pleased to
report that as a reflection of confidence in our business, today, our board of directors
declared 7.5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.72 per share. This marks the 13th
consecutive year of dividend increases. Our board also authorized an additional $5 billion
for share repurchases.
So wrapping up, weather was a factor this quarter, but the underlying results of the
business were strong, we're well positioned for continued success over the near term,
and we're excited about the investments we're making for sustained success over time.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay.

Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Thank, Alan. Core income was $614 million, down from $698 million in the prior year
quarter. And core ROE was 10.8%, down from 12.5%. There were several moving pieces
this quarter, so let me spend a few minutes providing you with some further insight into
these numbers.
I'll start by saying that the absolute levels, as well as the reductions in core income and
core ROE were not driven by underlying performance, rather they reflected the relatively
high level of tornado/hail that Alan discussed, along with the impact of the so-called
Ogden rate adjustment, the UK Ministry of Justice's decision to reduce the discount rate
applied to lump sum bodily injury payouts from a plus 2.5% to minus 0.75%.
Beginning with underwriting, cat losses were $226 million after-tax, $19 million higher than
the already high $207 million after-tax in the prior-year quarter. Page 4 of the webcast
provides an analysis as to how our first quarter results compare to analyst estimates, and
as best as we can tell, analyst estimates for cat losses appear to be significantly lower
than what actually occurred, which more than accounts for the difference.
Net favorable prior-year reserve development, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly, was
$44 million after-tax, which was $75 million less than the prior-year quarter, mostly due to
Ogden. While remaining strong, as evidenced by a 91.7% underlying combined ratio, our
underlying underwriting gain was lower than the prior-year quarter, primarily due to two
things: the first was normal fluctuations in non-cat weather and other loss activity, and the
second, as we had anticipated, was the timing impact of personal auto bodily injury loss
estimates that were consistent with the higher loss trends that we had recognized in the
Page 4 of 25

Company Ticker: TRV US Equity

FINAL

second half of 2016. Partially offsetting these reductions in the underlying underwriting
gain, but not impacting the combined ratio was a $39 million tax benefit from successfully
closing out our federal income tax exams for 2013 and 2014.
Turning to investment results, which were strong, net investment income of $480 million
after-tax increased by 9% or $41 million, as compared to the prior-year quarter. Non-fixed
income, NII, increased by $59 million after-tax, primarily due to strong private equity
returns, more than offsetting the fully anticipated $17 million after-tax decrease in fixed
income NII that was driven by the continued low interest rate environment.
Consolidated net favorable prior-year development was $81 million pre-tax, driven almost
entirely by Business and International, as compared to $180 million pre-tax in the prioryear quarter. The quarter included the previously announced reserve increase of $62
million pre-tax that resulted from the Ogden rate change. Since this reserve increase
primarily related to our public liability and commercial auto liability lines of business in the
UK, approximately two-thirds of which are in runoff, any impact of this Ogden rate change
on our future operating results is expected to be insignificant.

Bloomberg Transcript

Excluding the impact of Ogden, Business and International had net favorable reserve
development of $133 million pre-tax, up from $93 million pre-tax in the prior year quarter,
and driven once again by better than expected loss experience in workers' comp and
general liability.
Bond & Specialty had net favorable development of $10 million pre-tax, while Personal
Insurance had no prior-year reserve development, which was an improvement from the
unfavorable development we experienced in the two most recent quarters.
On a combined stat Schedule P basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years across all
product lines in the aggregate, and all product lines across all accident years in the
aggregate developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development this quarter.
Operating cash flows of $775 million remain very strong, and we ended the quarter with
holding company liquidity of $2.1 billion, up from $1.7 billion at year-end 2016, and higher
than normal for us. This increase in holding company liquidity resulted from moving the
excess capital that was generated by our highly profitable fourth quarter 2016 from our
operating companies to the holding company, coupled with our decision to moderate
share repurchases in first quarter 2017 to provide financing flexibility for our pending
acquisition of Simply Business.
As Alan said, there was no change in our capital management strategy. In the coming
weeks, taking into account then current capital market conditions, we'll finalize our
financing plans for Simply Business, which will likely include some combination of debt and
internal resources, and once we've made that determination, we'll return remaining
excess capital to our shareholders.
All of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized
investment gains were approximately $1.3 billion pre-tax or $0.8 billion after tax, up from
Page 5 of 25

FINAL

$1.1 billion and $0.7 billion respectively at the beginning of the year, while book value per
share of $84.51 and adjusted book value per share of $81.56 increased 2% and 1%
respectively from the beginning of the year. We continue to generate much more capital
than we need to support our businesses, allowing us to return $476 million of excess
capital to our shareholders this quarter.
We paid dividends of $190 million and repurchased $286 million of our common shares
this quarter, including $225 million under our publicly announced share repurchase
program, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, and $61 million to
partially offset shares issued under employee incentive plans, mostly to cover employee
withholding taxes due upon the vesting and payout of performance and restricted stock
awards. And, as Alan said, the board raised our quarterly dividend from $0.67 to $0.72 per
share and authorized an additional $5 billion in share repurchases.
With that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian.

Brian William MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Jay. Starting with this quarter's results in Business and International Insurance,
segment income was $468 million with a combined ratio of 96.3%, a strong result even
with the impacts of above average catastrophe losses and the $51 million after-tax related
to the Ogden rate adjustment.
The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior-year reserve
development, was 94.5%, up a little more than 1 point compared to the first quarter of
2016, due to normal quarterly variability in weather-related and other loss activity, along
with loss cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing.
Net written premiums for the quarter of over $4 billion, a record level, were up 3% yearover-year. Domestic Business Insurance premiums were up 2.5 points, driven by strong
production results in select and middle market. International net written premiums were
up 6%, due primarily to the timing of certain adjustments in the first quarter of both years.
Turning to domestic production, our focus continues to be on retaining our business. And
accordingly, we were pleased that retention for the quarter of 85% remained at
historically high levels. Renewal premium change came in at 2.8 points, up 0.5 points from
the fourth quarter of 2016, and included positive renewal rate change of about 0.5 points.
New business was $532 million, down from a very strong prior-year quarter.
Looking at the individual businesses, beginning with select, where we continue to make
product and technology investments to drive growth, and we're pleased with the
progress we're making as evidenced by this quarter's production statistics. Retention of
83% has remained at historically high levels for three consecutive quarters, renewal
premium change was over 5 points, and new business premiums of $121 million was the
highest level since the first quarter of 2012.

FINAL

In middle market, our results reflect a continued stable marketplace, retention of 88%
was at historically high levels, while renewal premium change was nearly 3 points and
included about a point of renewal rate change. Our new business writings continue to
reflect our underwriting standards and return objectives, and although down from last
year, were in line with our expectations. The combination of strong retention, positive
RPC, and solid new business levels resulted in meaningful premium growth during the
quarter.
In other business insurance, renewal premium change was up slightly compared to the
fourth quarter of 2016, with renewal rate change that was flat. Retention came in at 79%,
and new business premiums were $121 million. In International, production results were
very strong in the quarter, retention improved to 84%, while renewal premium change
was slightly positive, and new business volumes were strong. So all in for the segment, it
was a good start to 2017.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'll now turn to Bond & Specialty Insurance where segment income for the quarter of $129
million was strong, though down somewhat from the prior year, driven by a lower level of
net favorable prior-year reserve development, partially offset by the segment's portion of
the tax item that Jay mentioned earlier. The underlying combined ratio of 81.1% was very
strong, and unchanged from the prior year.
As to the top line, net written premiums for the quarter were up slightly for both surety
and management liability. In our management liability business, we continue to execute
our strategy of retaining our best-performing accounts, while writing new business in
return adequate product segments, so we couldn't be more pleased that retention for
the quarter, again, came in at historically high levels at 88%, while we continue to add a
substantial level of new business. Renewal premium change of 4.4 points was up from
recent quarters, reflecting a modest increase in average policy duration, along with
improvement in the rate component of RPC.
Shifting from the financials, I'd like to comment on two things that we did in the quarter to
advance our product offerings. First we added to our expertise in surety by bringing
onboard Family Business Institute, a specialist in strategic planning services for closelyheld construction businesses.
We also entered into an agreement with Symantec Corp. to provide our cyber
policyholders with leading cyber risk services. These actions will allow us to deliver
additional value-added services to our customers, further enhancing our industry-leading
product portfolio. So Bond & Specialty results remain terrific, and we continue to feel
great about the segment's performance and our position in the market.
Turning to Personal Insurance, net written premiums for the segment grew 12% in the
quarter, with a combined ratio just under 100%. As you've already heard, there was a
historically high level of tornado/hail activity in the quarter, and as a result, catastrophe
losses of 10 points were significantly higher than our expectations. Excluding the impact of
cats, the underlying combined ratio of 89.5% was in line with our expectations. Weather
aside, both agency auto and agency homeowners got off to a good start towards

Page 7 of 25



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2017-04-20

FINAL

achieving the goals we laid out in the fourth quarter earnings call. The agency auto
combined ratio for the quarter was 101.1%, and consistent with the segment, the cat
component was larger than we would normally expect in the first quarter with catastrophe
losses accounting for 2.5 points. The underlying combined ratio came in at 98.6%.
Excluding cats, first quarter auto loss experience was in line with our expectations.
Compared to the first quarter of 2016, the underlying combined ratio is up 4.6 points, as
you can see on page 18 of the webcast, 3.2 points of the increase was due to the timing
of the higher run rate of bodily injury losses that we recognized in the second half of 2016,
and that Jay mentioned earlier. The remaining 1.5 points was primarily due to the
additional impact of tenure, which resulted from the earning in of the increased levels of
new business that we wrote last year. As we explained a couple of quarters ago, while the
higher level of new business is creating loss ratio pressure in the short-term, we believe it
is a good thing for the long-term economic value of the portfolio.
As we mentioned last quarter in response to the higher bodily injury loss levels, we're
taking actions to improve profitability, and our primary response is to improve the pricing
of the book. Renewal premium change ticked up in the quarter to 5.9%, reflecting some
of the impact of rate changes that have been approved thus far.

Bloomberg Transcript

As additional rate filings are approved and impact policies at the renewal date, we expect
RPC to increase sequentially each quarter, likely approaching double digits in the third
quarter. The rate of PIF growth both sequentially and year-over-year slowed modestly in
the quarter, while within the quarter, the monthly rate of growth decelerated, reflecting
our efforts to manage growth, while profitability improves.
As we said last quarter, it will take time for the actions we're implementing to fully earn
into the portfolio, but the first quarter results are on track with our expectations.
Turning to agency homeowners and other, we believe the quarter's results once again
reinforced the value of providing portfolio solutions. In a quarter when our combined ratio
included 19 points of cat losses more than double our expectation, we still posted a 96.7%
combined ratio. The underlying combined of 77.6% was a little more than 1 point higher
than the first quarter of 2016, due primarily to higher levels of non-cat weather.
Importantly, net written premium and policies in force both grew at an accelerating rate in
the quarter, despite moderation in the growth rates for auto. The 4% growth in net
written premiums was the strongest result since 2011. We've said in recent quarters that it
was important for us to maintain focus on generating growth in our homeowners book,
and we feel good about the results so far in 2017. So for the segment as a whole, we're
encouraged by our first quarter results.
Before I turn it over to Gabby, I'd like to comment on a change in the reporting of our
segment results going forward. Effective April 1, 2017, the company's results will be
reported in three business segments, Business Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance, and
Personal Insurance. With this change, the company's international businesses, which were
previously reported in total within the Business and International segment will now be
Page 8 of 25



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2017-04-20

disaggregated amongst these three newly aligned business segments. This change
doesn't reflect the shift in strategy, but given the progress that we have achieved within
our international businesses, we believe that the newly aligned segments will allow us to
more effectively engage the product capabilities and talent across both our domestic and
international operations.

FINAL

With that, let me turn it back to Gabby.

Gabriella Nawi

{BIO 2211991 <GO>}

Thank you. We're ready to start the Q&A portion of the call.
Before we do that, if I could please ask you to limit yourself to one question and one
follow up. Thank you.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie. Please
proceed.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 16979665 <GO>}

Thanks, and good morning. Two questions. The first question is – I guess going back to
the discussion on the personal auto book, you talked about the higher underlying loss
ratio, which is not a surprise. I'm curious, how should we think about that loss ratio, either
stabilizing at the current level or ticking up or down going forward based on the market
environment?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Good morning, Amit. It's Michael Klein. So, in terms of the underlying, you see the 3.2
points on page 18. When we talked about that last quarter, we talked about the fact that
the full-year impact of that in 2016 was about 3.5 points. The fact that that 3.2 points
versus 3.5 points, there is some quarterly fluctuation in what that number will be quarterto-quarter. But underlying coming into the year, we've got a 3.5 point gap that as we
talked about last quarter, we're working to close. The amount to which that starts to get
reduced will, again, as we talked about, sort of earn in over 18 to 24 months as the rate
comes through, so there is a couple of things going on there. The rate that we're taking
that will eventually eat into that 3.5 points, but there is certainly an unfavorable year-overyear comparison for the first three quarters of this year because we don't have the full 3.5
points recognized till you get to the basis of the full year 2016.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 16979665 <GO>}

Okay. The other question I had – and this is switching gears on – I guess the broader
reserve releases and some of the questions we've gotten from investors have obviously

Page 9 of 25



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2017-04-20

FINAL

focused on the lower level of reserve releases. Bond & Specialty was higher in Q1 2016
due to the AOY experience back in 2016. I'm curious, was that sort of a one-off benefit
we got in Q1 2016? And hence, we should be careful how we think about reserve releases
going forward? Or am I over thinking the meaningful decline in reserve releases this
quarter?

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Hi, this is Jay Benet. Let me start by saying what we always remind people of, that is that,
every quarter we're looking at, literally, all the reserves, doing lots of analysis and when
there's an indication that the reserves need to change, we make those changes. So, we
always try to get – always get our best estimate of what those reserves are on a quarterby-quarter basis.
We've seen things take place in all of the segments that in different quarters have led to
mostly favorable development, although we did have a little unfavorable development in
Personal Insurance last year. So, I don't look at the reserves and try to predict anything in
terms of patterns, in terms of intent, in terms of how things are going to emerge. I think
of it more as episodic. And that we had larger reserve development in Bond & Specialty
last year versus a smaller amount this year I just look at, that's just what the data said and
we'll see what the data brings in subsequent quarters.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 16979665 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks for the answer. I'll stop here. Thank you.

A - Gabriella Nawi

{BIO 2211991 <GO>}

Next question, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please proceed.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Thank you. Can you hear me okay?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah, we can, Jay.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Thank you. For personal auto, I was a little surprised at the persistent high level of policy in
force growth at 12%, given the efforts to fix profitability there. Can you give us a bit more
insight on that?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Page 10 of 25

FINAL

Sure, Jay, this is Michael Klein. So, the one thing I would point out about policy in force
growth, particularly if you're looking at that 12% year-on-year number, that's really a
lagging indicator of growth. So think of the 12% as the 12-month weighted average of the
growth we've seen over the last 12 months, right. It's this year's policy in force in the
quarter relative to the first quarter of last year, so there's – built into that 12% number,
primarily is the growth we saw last year.
That said, Brian mentioned growth decelerated within the quarter. So what you'll see as
you look forward and what we expect is that annual policy in force growth number will
come down, but it will come down relatively slowly, again, because of sort of the
embedded volume already in the back half of 2016.
To Brian's comments about growth decelerating in the quarter, we've seen, and you can
look at it in the production statistics, a bit of a drop in renewal retention in response to the
rate, but also importantly, we're essentially where we expected to be. We continue to see
win rates come down as we put rate into the marketplace, and then equally importantly,
we talked about at-bats last quarter, the efforts we have undertaken to take underwriting
action and manage the flow of quote volume into the business have started to take hold.
And so we're actually seeing our quote activity and our win rates come down consistent
with expectation and the growth continues to moderate.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Jay, it's Alan. I would just emphasize what Michael said, that we were generally able to
achieve what we wanted to achieve, and we generally are where we expected to be. So a
quarter past, we talked to you about last quarter, so far so good.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

I appreciate that. And then my follow up is on the buyback and how the Simply Business
acquisition affected that. So, in the Q, it says the Simply Business acquisition was total
consideration of around $490 million. I thought an acquisition of that size might not have
slowed the pace of buybacks in the quarter. I'm just trying to think about what the
implications are for buybacks going forward.

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi Jay, this is Jay. The way we manage capital, as you recall, we're preserving capital
for organic growth in our business, and for any kind of activity that would add to
shareholder value over time. So, what we looked at here was a relatively modest
acquisition, given the size of Travelers, but it does impact the resource base that we have.
So in this particular case, what we decided to do in the first quarter was just to hold back a
little bit on share repurchases. We know we have an obligation that this thing will close
later in the year. We never rely on capital markets being favorable or open or whatever.
We take a very conservative look. So what we've done is held back some funds to be able
to unequivocally close on the transaction.

As we said before, as we get closer to finalizing our financing plans for it, which will be a
combination of debt and some of the internal capital, we'll make a final determination as
to what the capital level should be, and then return the remaining excess. So I wouldn't
look into it as anything other than some cash planning on our part and no change
whatsoever in the whole capital management strategy of the place.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. Could you talk about what you're seeing in terms of loss trends in
Business Insurance? Do you expect any upward pressure there? I know last quarter you
talked a little bit about how the propensity to litigate in auto had spread to small
commercial.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Sarah, good morning, it's Alan. I would say, broadly speaking, we haven't seen any
significant changes in loss trend in really any of our commercial businesses. And I think you
mentioned propensity to litigate. That's not exactly right. What we've seen is a little bit of
an increase in attorney representation, and that actually, we're typically seeing it at smaller
less complex cases, so not necessarily increased litigation, just to factor that it takes
longer to settle the cases, and sometimes results in ordering more medical diagnostics,
things like that. That's impacting severity. But that's actually not new. We've been seeing
that manifest itself in our commercial businesses probably over a couple of years. But I
would say broadly speaking, Sarah, no real change in what's been a pretty favorable loss
trend environment.
Now, in terms of the way we think about that and price and set reserves, we always
assume things will return to longer-term normal, but I would say, maybe with the
exception of auto that's been persistently difficult, really no change.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thank you. And then in Business Insurance, you've been taking modest
renewal rate increases for the past two quarters, but you mentioned it's still below loss
trend. What would need to happen for you to take rate to keep up with loss trends?

FINAL

Well, first of all, we'd have to keep going. And I guess I'd step back, Sarah, and I would say
that what we were able to do in the quarter reflects what we were trying to do in the
quarter. It was very small, very thoughtful, very subtle shifts, and it's just a reflection of
what we thought we needed to do given what's happened to interest rates, and where
pricing has been relative to loss trends over a couple of years now.
And so, we were really encouraged by what we were able to accomplish, and we'll see
where that goes in the future. I would point out that we've told you in Business Insurance
broadly loss trend is about 4%. Rate would not need to get to 4% in order to be flat
because, as we've said before, there's real economic impact from incremental exposure
that we're getting. And there's other levers we can pull to improve profitability. And we've
talked about this before, terms and conditions, mix, expenses, claims handling, other
strategic investments. So, all those things add up, Sarah.

Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Good morning, and thank you. First question, just follow up on the personal auto side. The
140 basis point deterioration, if you are excluding the re-estimates, that's assuming
mostly coming from the new business track or tenure impact. If your PIF growth is
gradually slowing down, is that impact will drag on for a little bit longer?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Sure, Kai, this is Michael. Couple of comments, and one just to remind everybody, there is
also seasonality in the overall underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance. So, the
98.6% for the first quarter is reflective of, generally speaking, a lower underlying loss ratio
in the first quarter than for the balance of the year. So, I just wanted to clarify that point.
In terms of the 1.5 point or so drag from tenure, you are right, that will mitigate over time,
but remember that it's not just the new business we've just recently written. It's the
cohorts of business we've written over the last couple of years earning their way through
the book. So as we've talked about in the past, the reduction in the tenure impact is
something that we measure in years not quarters, so it will take a while for that to roll off.

FINAL

Okay. Great. My follow up question is on Simply Business. So, Alan, I just wonder, could you
explore a little bit about the strategic rationale behind it, and why do you do that in the UK
rather than do that in the U.S.? And do you expect to expand that platform in the U.S.
market, because you have a dominant, kind of like a leading position in small business
insurance here?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Sure, Kai, good morning, thanks for the question. We've been thinking about everything
changing in the world for a long time. And clearly, one of the things changing most
significantly and maybe poised to have the biggest impact on us is the world becoming
more digital and more mobile.

Bloomberg Transcript

And so, every aspect of our business has to get more digital and more mobile. And so
that's the way we engage with our customers, the way we engage with our agents. We've
got to be there when and however they want. It's the way we manufacture our products
and underwrite our risk. It's the way we market our products. It's the way we manage our
internal operations. It's about creating a better experience really for all of our
constituencies internally and externally.
We've got to be faster, we've got to be more efficient, and we've got to be more
flexible. So, we look around the world and we think, how are we going to develop those
capabilities? And we've got two choices. We can develop it internally or we can see who is
great at it, and see if we can bring that expertise in house. And so you scan the world, and
we see Simply Business. They've been a hugely successful, customer-focused technology
company for a dozen years. So, it's not a startup. They've been at this a long time and
they've got a real demonstrated success in this. They've got technological capabilities,
they've got know-how, a winning approach to innovation, all things that we think that we'll
benefit from.
And so we were going to develop these capabilities, as I said, one way or another. And it
turns out that we thought that the best solution for finding those capabilities and bringing
them in house in terms of where they resided, a great cultural fit, and who we actually
think the market leader is, it was Simply Business and they happen to be in the UK. That
fits nicely with us. We've got a business in the UK, we've got a very small budding, direct
small commercial business there, fits nicely. And even before we had started
conversations with Simply Business, they had made a decision to bring their model to the
United States. So that's even before early stage. I would say that's just getting started. But
our ability to help them accelerate that in the U.S., I think, was really attractive to them.
And the capabilities they bring to us is attractive to us. So, it started in the UK and we'll
bring it to the U.S. and potentially other geographies.

Q - Jon Paul Newsome

{BIO 3522950 <GO>}

Good morning. I'm curious about the change in the international business, could you – in
one sense you said that the strategy isn't changing, but it sounds like there is some
change going on there, either from a – who is in charge kind of position, or something
else that would drive the segment change. Could do you just give us a little bit more color
on what actually is changing from a business perspective as opposed to reporting
perspective?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah, good morning, Paul. It really is a way – this is completely borne out of the way that
we plan to manage the business, and really it's the opportunity we think we have to
leverage our terrific know-how and capabilities in the U.S. to deliver those capabilities
outside of the U.S. It's really – not that that's not significant, but it's nothing more
significant than that. It's not a different approach the way we think about the opportunity
outside the U.S., it's just a different approach to how we think we can best deliver our
capabilities.
And we've been on a journey for eight or so years now in trying to invest in and improve
our international businesses. We've invested in technology, we've invested in talent, we're
running the better railroad. And we've had a lot of success. And so the leadership that's
brought us there will continue to be actively involved in managing those businesses as a
portfolio. We'll have an ongoing obligation to manage those companies on a standalone
basis because we've got regulated entities in the various countries, and we'll continue to
do that with the great leadership that has always done that. But we've got an opportunity
with our – the talent and the capabilities in the U.S. to just do a better job of leveraging
that outside of the U.S.

Q - Jon Paul Newsome

But there's nobody – is there actually a change in who reports to who or anything like that
in those segments?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

Well, it's – we've always had a matrix reporting structure, and we'll continue to have a

will continue to report to Kevin Smith and he'll have responsibility for that. But beneath

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

Hey, good morning, thanks. I had a follow-up to Amit's question earlier. The question is,
how are actual severity trends developing relative to the assumption you made, call it late
last year? And if there's commentary on frequency as well, this is in auto, of course. I'm
just wondering, I know that you are repricing against elevated trend, but anecdotally, we
all observe, I think continued challenges in auto accident frequency and severity. So, the
question is, how is the actual loss environment developing relative to that repricing
assumption that started late last year?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Yeah, so, Randy, it's Michael. The actual development is consistent with the repricing
assumptions. Whether that's the 3.5 points of elevated bodily injury losses that are now in
the underlying, or whether it's the elevated level of loss trend that we talked to you about
in the fourth quarter that we added to our pricing. So, as we sit here today, the
experience in the first quarter of 2017 developed consistent with those expectations.
The only thing I just want to add a point back to the question from Kai, and I think it was
implied in my answer, but the 1.5 point of tenure impact that we're talking about year-onyear, is year-on-year, and therefore that's not the full amount of tenure impact, right?
There was tenure impact in the base in 2016, the 1.5 point – an additional 1.5 point on top
of that, just to clarify. But to your questions, the experience thus far this year has been
consistent with both the elevated starting point and the elevated trend that we factored
into our expectations.

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Great. And then I guess the follow up there is understanding that and
understanding the price that you're moving, you're putting into the market, do you see
Travelers as an auto insurance company that's going to gain market share because of the
dislocation out there with some of the mutuals really having to push very high pricing? Or
do you see yourself, kind of in the middle or potentially losing market share as we see
market share dislocation in U.S. auto insurance?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Sure, so just a couple of points. First of all in 2016, we gained share ever so slightly, 0.1%,
based on the growth that we experienced last year. Certainly, coming into this quarter,
you see the PIF growth at 12%, you see the period-to-period PIF growth at 2%. We would
view in the first quarter, our growth probably outpacing the market. That said, our
objective is to improve profitability and manage growth.
So our – the glide path we're trying to move the business down is, one, to reduce the
growth rate, but continue to grow as we manage profitability. What that amounts to in
terms of market share, really depends on what happens with the other players in the
marketplace. We would tell you that the pricing actions that we're putting into market,
again, consistent with our view of the loss trends being environmental, we're not alone in
terms of driving rate, but what that ultimately amounts to in terms of share, we'll have to
wait and see.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

And Randy, we don't really manage to market share. We manage to return to profitability,
balancing that with growth, and market share will fall out of that.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

Hi, good morning. First question, I was hoping to get some additional color on your
outlook for the Business Insurance pricing environment. In the Q, you guys point to the
Page 17 of 25



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2017-04-20

renewal premium change basically being consistent with the Q1 for the balance of the
year. So, I mean, how do you view pricing compared to expectations for any changes in
the U.S. economy when you came to that outlook for the RPC?

FINAL

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

So, Elyse, RPC obviously includes rate and exposure, and so it's a broader measure, and
there is obviously a corridor around the words broadly consistent. And so we're probably
not going to break that down into pure rate and exposure. We'll – obviously we thought
we needed to get more pure rate in the first quarter, and as I said, we were encouraged
we were able to do that. I will say that the trends that led us to do that, namely lower
interest rate environment and where rate has been for a while relative to loss trends,
those trends still persist out there, and so we'll have to take that into account. And so
we'll take it from there. Obviously, we operate in a competitive marketplace, and so that
will be a factor. So we'll – we're encouraged and we'll see where it goes.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thank you. And then just a couple of numbers questions, and going back to the
personal auto book. If I look at your underlying loss ratio this Q1 compared to the adjusted
last year, it seems like there is about 2.5 points of deterioration. You guys said year-overyear the delta was about 1.5 points the change from tenure. So, what else am I missing
when I look at that calculation, since it's adjusted with the elevated trends last Q1?
And a second part question in terms of the auto margins. Your expense ratio in the
personal auto book came down in the fourth quarter, and then also was at that kind of
lower level this quarter. How do you think about the expense ratio for the auto book when
you think about your margin outlook for that business for the balance of 2017?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Yeah, so, Elyse, it's Michael. To your point – so, I'll start with expense ratio. We continue to
manage expenses on a pretty disciplined basis inside PI, and we're enjoying the benefit
of the increased volume over relatively flat expense base, and that continues to be our
plan going forward.
In terms of the other components of loss ratio, it's really normal period-to-period
fluctuation. There's nothing – there are some puts and takes underneath that, but it's
really normal period-to-period fluctuation, explains those other changes in the underlying.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

FINAL

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Hey, thanks, good morning. I guess my first one was just a follow-up on Alan's comments
about in domestic, the positive rate indication this quarter on 59% of the book versus
53% a year ago. And I guess just thinking a little bit more granularly, what is leading to the
upward rate indication? Is there pressure on certain accounts or is it – I think the point you
made, just several years of rate running below loss cost trend?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, good morning, Ryan. So, we manage the business on a very granular level with a
return objective in mind. And we had a bunch of years going back to 2010 or 2011, where
we had a rising rate environment and that put us in a very good position in terms of where
our earned and written returns were. And since, I don't know, beginning of 2014 or so,
we've been in an environment where rate's been below loss trend, and we've had a
continued low interest rate environment. I think the tenure this morning was slightly over
2.2 or something like that.
And so, over time those things have an impact. And while today we're satisfied with our
written returns, we look out the windshield into the future and see where things are
going, and it causes us to, again very selectively, very thoughtfully in a way that we think
makes sense given our portfolio, our returns, working with our distribution partners in a
way that's never intended to be disruptive to them or our customers, we try to improve
the return outlook. And not everywhere, I made the point our select business was in a
different position from a return perspective, and we were happy to take the rate where it
was, where it's been over recent quarters, and so it's just very granular execution with a
return objective in mind.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Thank you, that's helpful. And then, I guess just following up on the line of questioning in
auto. And I guess, thinking about weather in Q1. It seemed like January, February weather
was somewhat benign. You had warmer temperatures. I'm wondering how you'd
characterize the impact of weather on auto in 1Q, in the first quarter. I think the way to ask
it is, how did frequency trend year-over-year?

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Yeah, again, I would say broadly speaking, frequency and severity in the first quarter came
in consistent with our expectations. I think we talk about the impact of the weather, and
we'll talk about warm temperatures above freezing in cold months can give you
sometimes higher speeds and higher severity. Cold temperatures below freezing will give
you ice and will give you more high frequency low severity bumping into things. But you
see those period-to-period fluctuations, and again, that's part of my point in the response
to Elyse is we've got just normal period-to-period fluctuations. But we didn't see anything
in the first quarter significantly different than our expectations.

Good morning, and thank you. Just staying on auto, are you seeing anything new in how
you think about the long-term value of the business that you've put on in the last couple,
few years? Probably undeniable that you'd like to have repriced some of that a little bit
earlier. But are you seeing anything new that would support or refute that this is business
that you ultimately want, and will be value-enhancing over the long term?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

No, Larry, we're not. I mean, as we've talked about over the past several quarters, we are
slicing and dicing it 18 ways to Sunday. But from a quality perspective, the quality of the
business, the profile of the business is very consistent with what we targeted when we
designed and developed and launched the Quantum Auto 2.0 product.

the business is tenuring consistent with our expectations. And so to your point, from a
long term value economic perspective, it's tracking with our expectations. Again, we
would have liked to have charged more for it, but that was really the primary conclusion,
and that's why the strategy to improve the profitability to go after it with base rate.

about the competitive dynamics right now in the workers' compensation insurance area?
Your premiums are down a little bit the last couple quarters. And are you seeing any
impact in the marketplace from perhaps a competitor having some issues?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah, so thanks, Brian. And I always preface our comments with we feel great about our
workers' comp capabilities. We clearly feel we're the industry leader. We've got, between
our underwritten book and our service book, the largest portfolio in the industry. So we
know the line well. We know the difficulty there can be with any long-tail line, and more
than any business we have, incredibly granular industry by industry, state by state, account
size by account size, so we look at that a lot.
Yeah, pricing is – so directionally, there is definitely good news on the loss trend side.
Now, it's a very long-tail line of business, so short-term movements in loss trend get
blended in as we look at long-tail loss trend. But loss trends have been positive, but
pricing is reacting and probably overreacting to that in the marketplace. So, we're looking
at it very closely. There's been some disruption with carriers out there in the market. And
we are looking at that business closely. It's still got to meet the economic hurdles that we
Page 21 of 25



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The

closely.

Q - Brian Meredith

Right.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And the numbers may be up, I would say as it relates to us, we've got a very diversified
management liability book. We manage positions in the tower and limits very carefully.
And the activity that we've seen that's been at elevated levels is in industries where we're
underweighted. It's been biotech, pharma, healthcare, and we're underweighted there.
I'd also add that, as you look at that commentary out there that suggest that numbers of
security class actions are up, sometimes the methodology in counting the cases distorts
the numbers. You got to look at cases that were previously brought in state court that are
now being brought in federal court for reasons you would have to ask the plaintiffs' bar
about, but you really have to look at the aggregate of those two numbers to see the
trends in claim counts.

Hey, Jay, this is Greg Toczydlowski. In the select business, just given the smaller nature of
those policies, we have a certain segment of the business that we call Express business,
and the CMP or the BOP portion has some inflationary guards inside there. So that's
automatically applied, typically, to the property line. So underneath the CMP or the BOP
product. So that's one of the drivers.
The other one is around workers' comp. Workers' comp, we continue to see the type of
mix that we're writing, some wage increases and some increases in payroll. So the
combination of the two is really giving us that exposure lift that we're getting in that
business.

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

And workers' comp, that has a bigger piece of the select business than it is of the overall
segment business?

Is the question as a percentage of the overall premium? It's got a similar mix profile, if
that's the question.

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Okay. I'll follow-up offline. That's helpful, though. Thanks, Greg.

A - Gabriella Nawi

{BIO 2211991 <GO>}

Great. And this is our last question.

Operator
Next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
Please proceed.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Great. Thanks, good morning. Very briefly, when you talk about reallocating the
international business to the individual segments, can you talk broadly about what impact
that would have on the reported underlying combined ratios?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Just procedurally, one of the things we're in the process of doing is reconstituting the 10K information, as well as the supplement. So just in line with your question, we'll be
providing this kind of data to you in advance of the webcast for the second quarter. We

expect late in the second quarter to get the information out into the public. But I think,
when you look at the overall size of the various segments versus the size of the
international operations, I think the impact on the combined ratios would generally be
pretty modest.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

And just to state the obvious. When you look at the consolidated number for prior
periods, there'll be no change, right?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Correct.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

It will be modest reallocation among the segments, but relatively small impact.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Right. No, that makes sense. And then the Simply Business acquisition, where are we
going to see those earnings in the segments in the income statement?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Simply Business, we expect it to be part of the Business Insurance segment. So it will be
there, but we'll see how we'll present that. I mean it will be part of the segment, it will be
wrapped in. But again, just in terms of the size of the Business Insurance segment, Simply
Business will be a pretty small piece of that.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thanks so much.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Gabriella Nawi

{BIO 2211991 <GO>}

Excellent. That concludes our call for today. Thank you very much for joining.

Operator
