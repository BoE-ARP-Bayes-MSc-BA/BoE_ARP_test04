Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited First
Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this
time, I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr.Jon Levenson. Please go ahead sir.

Jon Levenson

{BIO 18636999 <GO>}

Thank you, Nadia. And welcome to Everest Re Groups Limited 2020 first quarter earnings
conference call. The Everest executive leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President
and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and John
Doucette, EVP and President and CEO of the Reinsurance Division.
We are also joined today by other members of the Everest management team. Before
we begin, I need to preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest's SEC
filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements.
Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the
risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these SEC filings. Management may also
refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings
release and financial supplements.
With that, I turn the call over to Juan Andrade.

{BIO 16371272 <GO>}

Thank you, John, and good morning everyone. And thank you for joining the call. First and
foremost, I hope you, your families, your friends and your neighbors are all staying healthy
and safe. On behalf of our company, I want to offer our heartfelt condolences to all of
those, including many in the Everest family, who have lost loved ones during this difficult
time. Our sincere thanks go to those medical professionals and first responders who are
putting themselves at risk to keep everyone safe. Also to all of those who are working
hard to keep the supply chains going, the truck drivers, delivery drivers, grocery store
employees and everyone else, thank you.
I also want to thank all of Everest's employees, for their spirit and their unflagging
commitment to serve our customers. We took early proactive and decisive actions to
protect the health and safety of our employees, their families, and our stakeholders. As a
result, Everest continues to successfully operate remotely. We are doing our part in
support of the global economy, by serving all of our customers and stakeholders without
interruption.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our move to remote work was planful with a well-executed organizational resiliency plan,
and an underlying technology infrastructure that performs seamlessly, and an information
technology organization that has performed admirably. Our employees have been
flexible, resilient and productive. We have received accolades regarding our
responsiveness and our stability. We also continue to support our local communities
around the world in their pandemic relief efforts. These are leadership moments for
people and companies.
Our culture of collaboration, thoughtful assumption of risk, humility and relentless
execution are at the bedrock of our performance. I am incredibly proud of our people and
our company. Our diversified global platform with its broad mix of products, distribution
and geography, remains an important source of stable capacity to our broker partners
and customers. Our capital position remains a source of strength, with high-quality
invested assets, significant liquidity, and low financial leverage.
Despite the pandemic and the economic downturn, Everest remains profitable. As
reflected in our reported 98.6% combined ratio, or 89.9%, excluding catastrophe losses
and the pandemic IBNR loss provision. Additionally, Everest remains resilient, as reflected
by both our 21% growth rate in gross written premium, and by our capital position. We
have built a strong capital foundation over the years, holding $8.6 billion of shareholders'
equity at March 31, 2020.
While this is a decrease from year-end 2019, this decrease primarily results from one, the
sharp decline in the fair value of the investment portfolio, which has now substantially
recovered, since the end of the quarter. Two, share repurchases and dividends paid. And
three, the pandemic loss IBNR provision. Most importantly, our capital position continues
to exceed what we need to run the business, with excess capital relative to rating agency
and regulatory requirements.

FINAL

We have substantial liquidity from the cash we hold and the cash flow from operations,
which was over $0.5 billion for the quarter, were up 10% from 2019. We have significant
access to capital markets, including plenty of debt capacity, as we carry very little debt
compared to all of our peers, at less than 7% of our capital, when most of our peers
typically carry upwards of 20% to 30%. Lastly, our industry-leading expense ratio also
gives us operating flexibility, which is particularly critical in times of uncertainty.
Turning to the first quarter of 2020, Everest remains strong, and is well positioned with
broad capabilities and top talent. And we remain focused on solving our clients most
critical risk transfer needs in a disciplined and profitable way. We demonstrated excellent
momentum across both of our reinsurance and insurance businesses, with gross written
premium growth of 16% and 33% respectively.

Bloomberg Transcript

We also continued to benefit from improved market conditions during the quarter, which I
will discuss in a moment. Excluding catastrophes and the pandemic IBNR loss estimate,
our underlying combined ratios for the group at 89.9%, and each of our divisions,
Reinsurance at 87.7%, and Insurance at 95.6%, are reflective of the strong underwriting
performance across the group, and the earnings generating power of the franchise.
Underwriting profitability remains at the core of everything we do.
Our reinsurance division had a strong January 1 renewal season. We continue to judiciously
deploy capital, and we underwrote a high-performing book that is focused on strong
economic returns, while improving the diversification and balance of our overall portfolio.
We also saw stronger opportunities in several areas, such as retro and facultative risk. As
the quarter progressed, we saw continued momentum across the portfolio. John
Doucette will provide additional details on market conditions and the underlying growth.
Our insurance division's growth remained strong and consistent with recent quarters. The
drivers for this growth were, number one, strong and widespread rate momentum.
Excluding workers compensation, the rate increase was plus 24%, or plus 17% net of a
handful of large deals booked in the quarter, and over 12% including workers
compensation. This is an improvement from the fourth quarter of 2019 where the rate
increase was almost plus 12%, excluding workers compensation, and plus 4%, all in.
We also saw continued strength in the E&S space, with strong submission flow and market
conditions continuing to tighten in property and casualty, in both primary and excess lines.
We also have strong renewal retention in both our retail and wholesale businesses. We
had increased productivity resulting from additional underwriters hired in 2019 that are
now fully on boarded, and providing capacity to address the increased submission flow.
The insurance growth was also balanced and diversified across are many lines of
business. Strong rate and tightening terms drove the growth in the long tail line.
Despite the impacts of the pandemic in the quarter, our underlying insurance portfolio
continues to perform well, and we are seeing the benefits of our various investments in
portfolio optimization efforts, all of which position us well for this environment.

FINAL

Turning to investments. Net investment income of $148 million was up 5% from the first
quarter of 2019. Our investment portfolio had been and is defensively positioned, with
over 75% in investment grade fixed-income bonds, and less than 4% allocated to public
equities. Most of our risk is bond risk, and we also have the ability to hold bonds until they
mature. In addition, we have continued to further reposition our portfolio, moving up in
fixed income credit quality and reducing equity exposure.
As per our April 23 announcement, we have taken a $150 million IBNR loss provision in the
first quarter related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These losses relate to event cancellation,
business interruption and other coverages, such as accident and health, and workers
compensation. Our estimate was based on an analysis completed during the first quarter.
This analysis was a thorough cross-functional review of the in force portfolio, by line of
business, industry and geography. The review was completed by a team of professionals,
representing every area of the company.

Bloomberg Transcript

Given the fluid and continuing nature of this pandemic, this is an ongoing event and so is
our analysis. While our analysis looked at all aspects of our global portfolio, our estimate
does not take into account, legal, regulatory or legislative intervention that could
retroactively mandate or expand coverage provisions. As stated in our release, our
philosophy is to recognize and react to expected future losses on a timely basis. We will
be tracking pandemic losses separately from our attritional losses, and its an ongoing
event.
With regard to our specialty insurance business, we have a limited exposure to event
cancellation, accident and health workers compensation, and business interruption. Our
property policies have unambiguous policy language, that requires direct physical loss for
business interruption coverage to be triggered. Additionally, the majority of the property
policies in force contain a virus exclusion. Only a very small number of policies have
endorsed sublimits typically less than $25,000, and with short duration caps that would
offer BI for a notifiable human disease. These exposures have already been recognized
as part of the overall IBNR loss estimate for the quarter.
The majority of the IBNR loss provision was for the reinsurance business, given the relative
size of this portfolio compared to our insurance businesses. It is important to note that as
a reinsurer, we have contractual terms and conditions, such as retentions, limits, event
definitions, hours clauses, and other coverage provisions, that will apply to this ongoing
event. Thus, we do not simply follow the fortunes, it will be very fact-specific.
We have also done a thorough review of our mortgage reinsurance contracts. Based on
our view of the economic situation, that is aided by both external information and our own
proprietary internal modeling, we currently believe that our loss picks and reserves remain
adequate. We will continue evaluating this business, as the economic situation unfolds.
In summary, Everest showed forward momentum, resiliency and profitability in the first
quarter of 2020. We effectively transitioned to running our company remotely, and as
always, we'll remain a consistent and trusted provider of capacity to our customers. Given
the uncertainties in the current public health and economic environment, there could be

FINAL

an adverse impact on results for the property and casualty industry and Everest, for the
remaining part of the year. The impact is clearly dependent on the shape and length of
the recovery.
While the economic environment has changed, Everest remains a high quality franchise
with broad capabilities, a global platform, and top talent. We remain focused on solving
our clients most critical risk transfer needs in a disciplined and profitable way. We have the
right culture, the right platform, and relevance with our clients and trading partners, and
the capital base to see us through this time.
Now, let me turn it over to Craig, to provide additional details on the financials. Craig?

Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest reported net income of $17 million
for the first quarter of 2020, this compares to net income of $365 million for the first
quarter of 2019. Net income included $172 million of net after tax realized capital losses,
compared to $74 million of capital gains in the first quarter of last year. The 2020 capital
losses were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the public equity portfolio.

Bloomberg Transcript

Operating income for the quarter was $164 million, driven by strong underwriting results
across the group, stable net investment income and lower catastrophe losses, offset by a
COVID-19 pandemic IBNR loss estimate of $150 million. The overall underwriting gain for
the group was $29 million for the quarter, compared to an underwriting gain of $196
million in the same period last year.
In the first quarter of 2020, Everest saw $30 million of catastrophe losses related to fires
and hailstorms in Australia, and the tornado in Nashville Tennessee. This compares to $25
million of catastrophe losses reported during the first quarter of 2019. Overall, our prior
year catastrophe loss estimates continue to hold. The combined ratio was 98.6% for the
first quarter of 2020, compared to 88.7% for the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the
catastrophe events and the impact of the COVID pandemic, comparable combined ratios
were 89.9% for the first quarter of 2020, and 87.4% for the first quarter of 2019.
Excluding the pandemic IBNR loss estimate, the attritional loss ratio was 61.5%, up from
60.2% for the full year of 2019, primarily due to the continued change in business mix. For
the reinsurance segment, the attritional loss ratio excluding the pandemic loss estimate
was 59.8%, up from 58.2% for the full year of 2019. This increase was related to the
continued business mix shift toward more pro-rata premium, which carry a higher loss
pick, but allow us to benefit directly from the firming primary market.
Pro-rata premium is less volatile than excess premium, and we will see the benefit earned
into our results, as we lap the loss tax season over time. For the insurance segment, the
attritional loss ratio, excluding the pandemic loss estimate remains very steady at 66.1%,
essentially flat compared to 66.0% for the full year 2019. As you can see in the financial
supplement, we also experienced more growth in areas that typically carry a higher loss
pick, and the lower overall combined ratio.

FINAL

Our U.S insurance franchise, which makes up the majority of our global insurance business,
continues to run an attritional combined ratio in the low 90s, excluding the pandemic loss
estimate. The group commission ratio of 22% was down slightly compared to prior year.
The group expense ratio remains low at 6.3%, and was higher than last year, due to an
increase in non-recurring incentive compensation benefits and payroll taxes in the first
quarter, which will normalize during the rest of the year.
Before moving to investments, I'd like to point out that we are now reporting two
segments reinsurance and insurance, which is consistent with the way the business is
managed, and the way management views the company's results. For investments, pretax investment income was $148 million for the quarter, from our $20 billion investment
portfolio. Investment income was 5% above the first quarter of last year. This result was
primarily driven by the increase in investment grade fixed income portfolio, which had a
higher asset-base this year, and higher limited partnership income quarter-over-quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Since we report most partnership income on a quarter lag, the global equity market
performance in the first quarter will be reflected in the limited partnership investment
results in the second quarter. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 2.9%, about
flat compared to one year ago. For our investment-grade portfolio, the new money rate
was 2.7% for the quarter. Other income included $21 million of foreign exchange gains in
the quarter. On income taxes, the $60 million tax benefit for the quarter included a $31
million tax benefit related to the CARES Act, which extended the carry-back period for cat
losses to 5 years.
Excluding this benefit, the effective tax rate on operating income was 12%, in line with our
expected tax rate for the full year. Positive cash flow continues with operating cash flow of
$506 million compared to the $460 million for the first quarter of 2019. This increase
reflects a lower level of paid catastrophe losses in 2020 compared to 2019, and an
increase in cash flow from our ongoing growth in insurance and reinsurance premiums.
Shareholders' equity for the group was $8.6 billion at the end of the first quarter, down
from $9.1 billion at year-end 2019. The movement in shareholders' equity since year-end
2019 is primarily attributable to the sharp decline in the fair value of the investment
portfolio, and by capital return for $200 million of share buybacks, and $63 million of
dividends paid in the quarter. The reduction in investment portfolio valuation came from
the realized losses in the equity portfolio, and the $248 million mark-to-market impact on
the fixed income assets, resulting from the widening of credit spreads.
These mark-to-market adjustments have substantially recovered since the end of the
quarter. During the first quarter, we made some tactical adjustments to reposition the
portfolio, by moving up in credit quality, and further reducing our equity exposure. As Juan
said, our capital position remains a source of strength with high-quality invested assets,
significant liquidity, and low financial leverage in addition to our robust cash flow. The
strength of our balance sheet is critical to the success of our business. Thank you.
And now, John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.

John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Thank you, Craig. Good morning. As Juan did at the start of the call, I would like to add my
sympathies to our reinsurance trading partners and their families affected by the
coronavirus pandemic. Like the rest of the group, the reinsurance division, supported by
our dedicated IT colleagues and our newly completed next generation global
underwriting platform, was able to transition to 100% work from home, without missing a
beat. We are reviewing submissions, quoting and binding facultative and treaty business in
settling claims.
Now, I will review the quarter. During Q1, the reinsurance division increased our gross
written premium to a record of $1.8 billion, up 16% from last year. Q1 growth was driven by
January rate increases in loss exposed areas and retro, and writing more purple products
and casualty business, due to improving conditions there. Growth was widespread,
spanning territories and lines including the U.S, international, casualty and property, and
short and long tail facultative reinsurance.

Bloomberg Transcript

Excluding COVID-19 losses, our underlying reinsurance loss ratio was up by 2 points,
largely due to more pro-rata premium written over the last year. Pro-rata business directly
benefits from an improvement in original rates, while ceding commissions have generally
been stable, and in some cases, improved. Those improved original rates will take some
time to be recognized in our loss picks. Note that the volatility associated with the dollar
of pro-rata premium, is generally lower than a dollar of excess premium, and combined
ratio alone can obscure risk-adjusted returns.
We are pleased, both with our progress at building a more diversified profitable
sustainable gross portfolio, and that we are seeing some tailwinds in the reinsurance
markets, in casualty, property, retro, specialty and fac to help us achieve a stronger, more
profitable portfolio. Everest's facultative operations continue to see an increase in
demand. In the U.S and international, we are continuing to see significant double-digit rate
increases in short tail and long tail fac with dramatic increase in submission count. Given
that facultative renews on multiple inception dates, it is a good forward indicator of
reinsurance demand and pricing.
For our casualty business, original rates on certain lines have shown some increases, which
will earn through on our pro-rata premiums. As always, we are deploying our
shareholders' capital judiciously, seeking to build the strongest reinsurance portfolio
possible, while maximizing returns, while limiting our downside risk through increased
diversification and balance.
Now to comment on recent and upcoming renewals. April renewals showed continued
rate momentum in loss affected and capacity constrained segments. Japanese wind and
retro rates showed strong increases, consistent with the need to maintain appropriate
returns. Looking near term, particularly the upcoming June, Florida renewals, we expect
rates will be affected by limited capacity, recent losses, and the market's heightened
sensitivity to risk, due to climate change and social inflation.

Also, there is a strain on alternative capital, traditionally, large players in Florida. Therefore,
we continue to see upward pricing momentum in Florida, along with improved terms and
conditions. Now, turning to mortgage. With the ongoing economic disruption, primary
mortgage insurers could see increased losses along with regulatory capital pressure.
However, housing fundamentals are stronger today than they were, heading into the
financial crisis, with higher credit scores, tighter housing supply, and lower risk products.
Our reinsurance mortgage book is seasoned and pegged conservatively.
To give you some color on our mortgage book. By limit, our book is roughly 80% GSEs
and 20% mortgage insurance. Virtually all business we write, is on a QM basis. The
underwriting box we participate in, is very controlled and tightly underwritten, meaning,
our portfolio has no exotic products and has high FICO scores, particularly on the GSE
business. From the beginning of Everest entering the mortgage space, our pricing
assumptions were and remain more conservative than the external vendor models that
we use to validate our pricing assumptions.

Bloomberg Transcript

Regarding the MI treaties we reinsure, we effectively play in an excess position, thus
avoiding the working layer losses, and resulting in a meaningful buffer in gross loss ratio
deterioration, before we suffer any economic loss to our reinsurance treaties.
Deterioration in this buffer range decreases the size of the profit commissions, we would
typically pay to the MIs, but at no economic cost to us.
Regarding our GSE business, given our more conservative view of underwriting, pricing
and capital modeling, we preferred higher layers over lower layers in these programs,
and we have weighted our book to higher attachment points accordingly. Much of our
exposure has been seasoned for several years, which benefits from home price
appreciation. Going forward, credit standards at nearly all stages of mortgage origination,
are tightening and improving, therefore increasing the credit quality of borrowers in our
book. Additionally, early government intervention in the economic crisis to support
borrowers and lenders, including the broad offering of forbearance, will mitigate potential
losses and help keep people in their homes and avoid default.
We are continually re-evaluating the dynamics of this economically sensitive line, to
prudently manage our mortgage exposures now, and on a go-forward basis. Now, I will
give some comments on the overall market ahead. Despite the uncertainty the industry
faces, we cautiously anticipate that the reinsurance markets will remain healthy for the
highly rated traditional reinsurers, who can deploy capacity in multiple lines of business
around the world, while also meeting client's increasing counterparty credit requirements.
This view is based on current reinsurance industry dynamics, and the supply demand
curve.
Starting with the market supply, more stable capital remains in place, while some of the
opportunistic capital is exiting. Alternative capital investors are re-evaluating the thesis
that reinsurance is a non-correlated asset class. Potential uncertainty from COVID-19 and
the possibility of more trapped capital, compounds frustrations of these investors from
the last three years of cats, and subsequent loss creep from several events. This is in
addition to higher relative return hurdle requirements, given the increased price of risk
across virtually all risk asset classes.

On the demand side, clients have increased reinsurance purchases for risk management
and capital support, particularly, as some of them come under capital or earnings
pressure, given the volatile markets. The flight to quality continues as reinsurance buyers
and brokers are increasingly focused on the stability and quality of counterparties, to
protect program continuity and mitigate counterparty credit exposures in these volatile
times. The length of the economic downturn will ultimately be a key factor impacting
reinsurance demand. These market dynamics benefit Everest, as we deliver stable
capacity, with strong security, as a long-standing client focused partner.
Regardless of where the market turns, we will focus our capacity on those clients that
align with our philosophy of prudent underwriting and sound claims handling practices. In
summary, Everest was built to withstand volatility and uncertainty, such as we are seeing
now. We continue to prove our resilience, our solution driven partnerships with longstanding clients, and our ability to execute through these unprecedented times.
Thank you and now, I will turn it back over to Jon Levenson.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)
Absolutely. (Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Mike Zaremski from
Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Hi, good morning, and thanks for all the good commentary in the prepared remarks. My
first question, I'll go with the mortgage insurance. I think many investors feel that
ultimately the vast majority of mortgage borrowers who defer or miss payments will
ultimately cure, but it would be helpful if maybe you can help us size up where your
excess layers kind of kick in from a maybe a loss ratio standpoint? But some kind of
framework to understand if you guys kind of play on a 100% combined ratio and up on
when we're looking at the mortgage insurers or kind of how to frame your exposure
there?

A - Juan C. Andrade

{BIO 16371272 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks Mike, and this is Juan Andrade. Look, I think to echo some of the comments
that John Doucette made in his opening remarks, from our perspective I think there's

Page 9 of 19



FINAL

Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2020-05-07

really three things to consider. Number one is where we play as a reinsurer, and number
two, the fact that we see this more as a frequency driven event essentially driven by
unemployment and so that certainly helps our view of all of this. The other part of that is
that unlike the 2008 Financial Crisis, I think as we look at the mortgage products, the
better original underwriting I think here will pay off, there's also much early intervention by
the government, much tighter supply of housing. (Technical Difficulty) we also believe we
have some very conservative loss picks on this. But let me ask John to answer your
question more specifically on structure. John?

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks Juan, and good morning, Mike. Thanks for the question. So again, I think you
need to think of the world in two different buckets: One is on the mortgage insurance
side and one is on the GSE side. So on the GSE side, that's really more like a credit
mortgage catastrophe. And so it's hard to map that to a loss ratio, because as Juan said,
this frequency severity it's tied to different percentages of default, so it's not really a loss
ratio. On the mortgage insurance side, these are typically quota share deals, but then as I
mentioned, given the profit commissions that go back, it roughly -- it's effectively like an
excess deal that it catches at about an 80 combined ratio.

Q - Michael Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. And on the GSE side, is there a way to frame maybe what -- is it a cumulative loss
like 2.5% or any numbers you could put around on the GSE side that could help us?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Yeah. It'll very by layer. I would just go back to the point I did say, which is so some of the
GSEs have broad layers, so they offer one layer so it's in a much bigger stretch, other
ones have various layers. And where we had the opportunity, we would typically play
higher up on the further remote away from that. But it's hard to map it to -- there's a lot of
moving parts to the answer as to what the default rates are and things like that. And it's
very much a function of -- because the GSEs also have the benefit of an earned cover
from the MI. So if there's MI insurance on it, so there's a -- it's not a -- there's no simple
linear answer on that about what the default is. It depends on the type of the default, the
frequency, the severity, what drove it.

Q - Michael Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Understood. My last question, switching gears to primary insurance. I think one of the
most frequent questions we receive trying to understand whether each insurer has a
material amount of policies, property related business interruption policies that may not
have a virus exclusion specifically, and I know that part of the IBNR charge you took
included business interruption. But is there any way you could frame whether you a
portion of your book doesn't have a virus exclusion and whether you're reserving -making some reserves for those policies?

A - Juan C. Andrade

{BIO 16371272 <GO>}

Yes, thanks Mike, and I would go to this one and I would go back to my prepared remarks
where I basically said that the majority of the property policies in the primary insurance
Page 10 of 19



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2020-05-07

book do contain a virus exclusion, and we only have a very small -- frankly, its very, very
small segment where we do offer sub limited coverage. And I mentioned that its less than
$25,000 with very short caps on duration, and all of that is included in the estimate that
we put up for the quarter.

Operator
Thank you. We'll next go with that Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Thank you very much. First question probably for Juan. I think in your opening comments
you said that, limited exposures in the insurance segment to workers comp among
others. I was hoping that maybe you could help us or maybe explain how you come to
that determination in the context of workers comp premiums, I think accounting for about
one fifth of the segment GPW?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Juan C. Andrade

{BIO 16371272 <GO>}

Yeah, I'd be happy to talk to you about that. I would say number one is we really don't
have exposure to frontline first responders and very minimal exposure to the frontline
health workers -- healthcare workers in the portfolio. So that essentially is how we come
to that conclusion. So as we went through this very thorough process that I mentioned, we
looked at industry profile for businesses that we deemed essential and that's where the
IBNR provision really was put up for those kinds of businesses. But again, when you look at
those industries that would be most affected, healthcare workers, first responders et
cetera, we have very minimal exposure in the portfolio.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

And if you've broadened that the more broad category of essential workers, how would
you think about them?

A - Juan C. Andrade

{BIO 16371272 <GO>}

Yes, I think that's essentially the provision that is included in the IBNR that we put up for
the quarter. So if you look at our total workers compensation book, again, the exposure to
healthcare workers, first responders is not there when it comes back to what we consider
to be essential workers, that is really the provision that was taken for the quarter. So we
believe that it does, but we've already accrued for that.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes. Juan, let me just follow-up on that one. I know today that California came out and I
guess officially expanded Presumption of Coverage for employees there. So I'm assuming
that your estimate actually included the expanding Presumption of Coverage for workers
compensation?

A - Juan C. Andrade

{BIO 16371272 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No, it does not. So that's recent information, right? Look, our point of view on
presumption of coverage is that, it is something that needs to be taken very seriously,
obviously. Any broad sweeping presumption measures practically can cause long lasting
harm to the industry and don't make a lot of sense for a number of reasons. Retroactively,
restructuring the underpinnings of the workers compensation system to shift the burden
of proof of costs to employers and their insurers will be under -- undermines the spirit of
the workers compensation system, and that's not something that companies have
underwritten or priced for and it does materially weakens the system.
And so that is something that needs to be considered. It also violates well-established
principles for workers comp law that the claimant has the burden of proving his or her
claim, was it workplace injury and is a covered claim. And so that's the way we tend to
view this, but our estimate does not include an expansion of presumption at this point in
time.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning. My first question, we were given this stat on another call this
morning about the percent of -- the exposure to personal lines or homeowners type

businesses versus commercial lines within the property cat book. By client, could you
provide us with that breakdown?

A - Juan C. Andrade

{BIO 16371272 <GO>}

FINAL

Thanks, Ryan. Let me ask John Doucette to jump in and help answer that question.

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Yeah, good morning Ryan, and hope you're doing well. Look, that's -- we write $6.5 billion
of premium around the world, a good chunk of that is property, its going to vary all over
the place. By territory, within property, we write quota share per risk and catastrophe and
there's a mix and it'll vary within region in the U.S. as well so there's no simple answer to
that.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

And then my only one I guess is trying to think about -- I guess what I'm trying to think
about is if there's like a second wave later in the year whether or not that would constitute
a second event. So maybe trying to get some clarification, not sure how to ask the
question, but some clarification on -- what would a conservative reading be of the end of
this as an event from a reinsurance standpoint? Like what conservatively would, I guess
close the book on the losses associated with this first lockdown?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Juan C. Andrade

{BIO 16371272 <GO>}

Yes, Ryan, this is Juan. Let me jump in there and I'll ask John to supplement my answer. I
think this is where you come back to my comments that this is not a follow the fortunes
event for Everest, right? When you start looking at event definition including ours clauses
limiting the duration of an event, outlining the radius or the contiguous environment that's
involved, this is where all of that is going to come in and play for us, right? And so John,
maybe you can more specifically answer that also.

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Yes, thanks Juan. And I think it's important to point out that not only is the event going on,
but we have rolling inception dates that are happening all the time, and we've just
finished four ones where -- we had some five ones in the U.S. May 1, Florida is coming up
June 1, and then July we have a lot of renewals kind of all over the world and facultative is
ongoing throughout the year, many times a year, we have inceptions.
And one other thing to point out that I think is important is that, we are pursuing terms
and conditions that help narrow or exclude pandemic risk, and that will ripple into some of
the things you're saying about the go forward. And, that will help mitigate limit or exclude
the potential losses going forward. And, we're certainly not alone doing that. Other, while
we are leading the charge, many other reinsurers are doing it as well. And I think that will
help narrow whatever the scope of this turns out to be. But, there's a lot of economic
facts and things to come in terms to your question better than that.

Can you hear me?

A - Juan C. Andrade

{BIO 16371272 <GO>}

Yes Meyer, we can hear you.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, great. Good morning. I have a question on business interruption. I'm hoping you can
explain the position and maybe the reserving stance on the question of whether
commercial property policies that don't include a virus exclusion but require direct physical
damage, is it Everest's position that, that is still an absolute event? Or are there some
reserves that -- or some reserves that you established for that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Juan C. Andrade

{BIO 16371272 <GO>}

Yes. No, Meyer. So this is Juan. Look, I think as I said in my opening remarks, we absolutely
believe that physical damage absolutely is unambiguous in the coverage of this, right? If
you think about it, there is double triggers, right? Number one, there has to be covered
physical damage, which again I believe is pretty unambiguous in the wording. And
secondly, we also have virus exclusions on the portfolio. So I think that's the other trigger,
so the answer would be yes to your question, do we believe it would hold?

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. The second question, I was just hoping that given the comments that
Craig had made about moving up the credit quality curve since the end of the quarter, can
you give a sense as to new money rates?

A - Juan C. Andrade

{BIO 16371272 <GO>}

Sure, Craig, can you take that please? Craig?

Operator
Craig, maybe on mute.

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Thank you. Sorry. Meyer, I saw on your -- I mentioned in my prepared remarks that our new
money rate for the investment grade portfolio was about 2.7% on average for the quarter.
What we see was due to some of the widening of the credit spreads and some of the

Page 14 of 19

actions that we took in the quarter we actually saw better rate in March than we did for
the overall quarter. So they were higher and closer to the 2.9% range. On average, we
saw, across investment grade and some below investment grade, we saw a purchase
yield of about 3.2% for the quarter.

FINAL

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. That cover April investment?

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

I was wondering, whether that covers the April yield?

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

The April yield is probably, as I said to you, it's closer to the 2.7% on the investment-grade
portfolio. And then some of the high yield that we are seeing so far is still over 5%.

Q - Meyer Shields

Operator
Thank you. We'll next go with Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please, go ahead.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks. My first question, going back on the business interruption and COVID
discussion and just on the reinsurance side, I recognize -- I think someone else asked
about the commercial versus personal breakdowns as well. Maybe you can give us those
percentages. But is there a way for you to give us a high-level view of what policies could
be at risk in terms of accounts that have virus exclusions so they don't -- just as we kind of
think about this being an ongoing event and what additional losses would come to
Everest on the catastrophe reinsurance side?

A - Juan C. Andrade

{BIO 16371272 <GO>}

Sure, Elyse. This is Juan and let me start off with that. Look, this is still obviously a fluid and
ongoing event. And we put a pretty thorough process in place in the first quarter that, as I
mentioned in my remarks, on going as far as how we're going to be able to continue to
refine the estimates as we go forward. On the reinsurance side, that basically involved

Page 15 of 19

Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2020-05-07

FINAL

spending time with clients, brokers, essentially looking at some of the underlying contract
et cetera to be able to get a handle on that.
And what we know is that, the underlying business that we're protecting, the vast majority
of that requires physical damage before providing any cover on the business interruption
side of things. And also in the U.S. specifically, most of the underlying policies in those
portfolios that we're protecting also will include the virus exclusion. But let me turn it over
for John Doucette to give you maybe a bit more additional color on that.

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Yes, I would -- I don't really have that much to add. As we've said, we're also are topdown bottom-up review, we looked internally externally talked to a whole lot of brokers
clients, looking at a not just a catastrophe book, but our contingency book, and it just
across all lines of business. We did kind of first principles review of everything that helped
us get to the number that we got to. And again, kind of factor in retentions, deductible,
hours clauses, radius, contracts, some are on a named perils basis and other provisions
that vary. And again, we looked and across did a very thorough review, had a lot of people
looking at it and comfortable based on what we know today that we have put up a
reasonable provision for that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Thanks. And then my second question is on the retro side. Could you just give us a more
up-to-date view of the pricing within that business? And then this is more specific to your
outbound purchases, do you guys look to potentially buy less retro and keep more
business net and can we just have a current view of the pricing that's going on in the retro
market?

A - Juan C. Andrade

{BIO 16371272 <GO>}

Thank you Elyse. John, can you take that.

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks a lot. Yeah, thanks Elyse. Its good question. And so retro is predominantly not
exclusively a January 1, a lot of it covers a very solid majority happen at January 1. And so
we have seen a few that have come up the summer off cycle and do it March, April, May,
June. And I think so we have seen increased pricing there. And I think that the alternative
capital that I talked about in my prepared remarks, we're seeing and hearing a lot of noise
about redemption and again frustrations with the losses and kind of a comparison to
other places to deploy the capacity. So I think there's a lot of noise there that we think will
continue for a while, and that will have a direct impact on the retro market.
In terms of our hedges, we look at a whole suite of hedges and really try to build a holistic
program that has different attachment points, different product types, different
geographic coverages, different duration of how long they're in place. And as you will
recall, we renewed our catastrophe bonds, we have almost $3 billion in capacity bonds in
play. We renewed them in November, December, the ones that have expired we bought
lower down.
Page 16 of 19



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td

FINAL

And again, in hindsight, we're glad you took the capital that was available to us then, even
though there been a slight increase in rates. And those are multi-year deals and they'll be
in place for the next several years. And because the pricing's already locked in the cost of
that capital -- the cost of that or the rate change embedded in that on a go-forward basis
to zero. We also have Logan, our strategic partner and continue -- Logan is about flat from
January to now and continue to use that as a very important hedging mechanism.
And the cost of that goes basically, Logan rides up and down with us as they take quota
shares, different layers of and build -- we build portfolios for them where they help us
hedge. We do buy traditional reinsurance in retro, we will remain pricing sensitive to using
that as a form of hedge, and we also buy ILWs and we've been in the ILW market since
January looking and buying up ILWs as another way for us to hedge.

Thank you. We'll next go with Ron Bobman from Capital Returns. Please, go ahead.

Q - Ronald Bobman

{BIO 17308423 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks a lot. Glad to hear everyone here sounds well. I had two questions. One, trying
to get some handle around sort of the reinsurance buying demand from the market. I
guess I will sort of directed to John, principally. John, with primary property companies
presumably having some affirmative BI exposure and losses, and presumably some
amount unknown but at sort of tail risk, whether it be sort of judicial decision, litigation
oriented et cetera and the unknown and significant amount of that. What should a primary
company be thinking and sort of doing now if at all as far as buying additional reinsurance?
And when I'm really sort of thinking about a sort of third event cover, if some amount from
COVID is going to tap their first tower?

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Thanks. I Appreciate the question. So look, we are seeing a lot of interesting things about
demand out there, but I would broaden it beyond people are buying specifically for
COVID. People are looking because it's been a bumpy few years for the industry, and I
think people's view when it -- whether it's wildfires, Japanese wind, different exposures
that happen and the development that we saw, so I think that overall, there's a view of
derisking and a lower risk appetite and that was around and building before COVID.
And I think that today, people will be looking not just to how do I protect against COVID,
but how do I use reinsurance to help manage volatility in my earning from typical cover -typical perils as well as consider more capital protection. So, and I think, so we are seeing

Page 17 of 19



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2020-05-07

demand from larger buyers, we're seeing demand from smaller ones that are rating
sensitive or have ratings pressure and a lot of our clients had asset issues due to the
impact of the COVID environment which also drives reinsurance demand.

FINAL

Q - Ronald Bobman

{BIO 17308423 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. And then the $3 billion cap you mentioned isn't separately the ILWs. Do
those, if pandemic is named perils at those -- the tap ons, separately the ILWs would
provide protection for it?

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

They both -- the ILWs and the catastrophe bonds are named peril and a pandemic is not a
named perils.

A - Juan C. Andrade

{BIO 16371272 <GO>}

I'm sorry. One last comment I would add to Ron's question to, if you're also thinking about
Everest insurance, we also feel that we have a very good reinsurance program that's in
place with regard to all of this. So just wanted to finish that thought. Thank you.

Thank you. We'll next go with Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs for a follow-up question,
please go ahead.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Hey, thank you. I thought maybe I'd move away from COVID questions. I noticed there
was a little bit of an uptick in the accident year loss ratio in insurance. Can you maybe talk
about what drove that?

A - Juan C. Andrade

{BIO 16371272 <GO>}

Yes, sure thing Yaron. This is Juan. I think as Craig mentioned also in his opening
comments, when you look at the loss ratio for the quarter, very close or very stable to
where we were at the end of the year. There's really a main driver on sort of the uptick
and that really has to do with mix. We saw a bit more growth in A&H, in casualty and in risk
management, and those lines of business basically could carry higher loss picks than
some of the other lines of business. So I would attribute it basically to do the mix and the
growth in those specific lines.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

And is that mix also impacting part of the decline in the expense ratio?

A - Juan C. Andrade

{BIO 16371272 <GO>}

The expense ratio, exactly. That was primarily on the commission side of things, where
because we did write some more risk management business et cetera, you also had a
mitigating effect on that. So that would be correct.

Over the years our company has a built a reputation for strong operating performance
with a strong capital position built to withstand catastrophes, and while no one could have
predicted an event of this magnitude, we do stand ready to serve our customers and our
brokers and we will have the strength and stability that they will have come to rely on us
over the last five decades. So we will keep refining our estimates and we will keep
working on this, but we will also be there for our customers as they need us. Thank you
