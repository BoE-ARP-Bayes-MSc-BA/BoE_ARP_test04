Presentation
Operator
Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call of Everest Re
Group. Today's conference is being recorded.
And at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the conference
over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Elizabeth Farrell

{BIO 1986541 <GO>}

Thank you, Derek. Good morning, and welcome to Everest Re Group's fourth quarter and
full year 2017 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the
company's President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, Chief Financial Officer;
John Doucette, the President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino,
President and CEO of the Insurance Operations.
Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include
extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note
that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as
statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various
risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or

expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in
connection with such statements.
Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.

Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Thanks, Beth. Good morning, and welcome to the meeting this morning. We are pleased
to be able report to you today an excellent fourth quarter result. This of course comes
during the year that experienced a record level of catastrophe losses for the industry. It is
noteworthy that despite this level of losses, we were able to report a profit for the full
year and an ROE of 6% on the strength of the fourth quarter. This level of performance
for the year demonstrates the ability of our platform to sustain periodic events and yet
maintain an above-average industry return through the cycle. Our value proposition and
risk management has positioned us to succeed.

Bloomberg Transcript

No doubt, there will be questions today and beyond about rates, competition, alternative
capital and acquisitions. And while we readily admit these are certainly the issues of the
day, our value proposition is such, we continue to build diversification and scale that allows
us to take advantage of market dynamics. As you heard from us in the past and will
continue to hear from my colleagues today is the success we are having in achieving
profitable growth, both the new products and existing lines. We reached a record revenue
with over $7 billion in total gross premium written for 2017.
In 2017, our reinsurance portfolio grew 20% with much of that growth in lines other than
US property cat. Prop, casualty, non-US property, mortgage and other credit-related
business all exhibited meaningful growth during the year. US cat business grew in part due
to reinstatement premiums and backup covers and true growth was offset by cessions to
cat bonds and Mt. Logan. Therefore, there was no material change to speak of in our P&L
exposure relative to cat. All of this points to our reinsurance portfolio that is becoming
more diversified each and every year, thereby providing earnings resiliency with an
attritional combined ratio of 81%, which was stable year-over-year.
Further in this diversification is the continued growth in our insurance business to over $2
billion or 15% for the year, and 32% for the year adjusting for the sale of crop company.
More important in the growth was the continuing improvement in our attritional combined
ratio, as we expected. And due to legacy issues coming under control, we had reserve
releases come through in the fourth quarter. Those profit and growth trends are quite
encouraging and the ones that we expect will continue. Tribute to a great team that has
executed and capitalized on the brand, scale and financial strength of the franchise.
Another contributor to results for the year was our growth in investment income of 15%.
Certainly, asset growth is a factor, but the larger contribution came from the asset
allocation decisions made during the year, without meaningfully changing our duration or
risk profile. Combination of strong investment results coupled with our underwriting
results on an after-tax basis resulted in $375 million of operating profit, which given the
weather events during the year, we believe is an outstanding result.

FINAL

Book value per share rose by 4%, reflecting in part the return of capital to our
shareholders, both through dividends and share repurchases. So as we end the year and
move into 2018, I do so with optimism. Our talent, execution and platform have never
been better. We have a culture to take on new opportunities and be nimble, which is what
the current market dynamics dictate you must have. Our risk appetite is continually
evolving based on where the best risk adjusted returns are.
Pricing in property lines both in reinsurance and insurance are moving in the right direction.
At 01/01, the heavy reinsurance renewal date, PMLs in the US reinsurance book in
particular are down year-over-year, but the absolute margins are up. We expect that to
continue. Capital markets are still a factor and likely to continue to grow assets. However,
we do not expect this development to crowd us out, as opportunities for greater
economic growth, privatization of public risk and continued movement towards closing the
gap between economic and insured losses will all lead to the need for greater capacity.

Bloomberg Transcript

Equally encouraging is the casualty space, which has been soft for some time, but is now
firming to varying degrees in most lines. This will benefit both our reinsurance and
insurance operations. And while the standard lines will benefit from rate, there will also be
real growth, as more offerings have greater appeal with expanded margins. Furthermore,
the insurance team has even greater upside, as we continue to scale our platform. And on
the reinsurance side, we will continue to expand our newer product offerings, which will
further diversify our portfolio. These are all factors, which we feel will contribute to
growing success into 2018 and beyond.
Now, I will turn it over to my colleagues for further details about our results and our
journey. Thank you. And first to Craig for the financial report.

Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Thank you, Dom, and good morning, everyone . Everest had net income of $571 million for
the fourth quarter of 2017, with the strong underlying performance aided by reserve
releases that impacted both current and prior years. This compares to net income of $374
million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income for the year was $469 million compared
to $996 million in 2016. After-tax operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was
$556 million compared to $363 million in 2016. Operating income excludes realized
capital gains and losses and the tax charge related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act of 2017.
For the year, operating income was $375 million compared to $993 million in 2016. The
primary difference was higher catastrophe losses in 2017. In the fourth quarter, Everest
saw $184 million of gross current year catastrophe losses related to the California
wildfires. Net of reinsurance, the current quarter catastrophe losses amounted to $162
million. We lowered our pretax estimates for the third quarter 2017 catastrophe events by
about $100 million. This was primarily related to reductions for the earthquake in Mexico
and the third quarter hurricanes. The fourth quarter of 2017 also included $30 million of
favorable development on prior year cat losses, largely from the 2016 year. Therefore,
net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $29 million.

On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected net pretax catastrophe losses of $1.5 billion
in 2017 compared to $301 million in 2016. Excluding the catastrophe events, reinstatement
premiums and prior period reserve development, the underlying book continues to
perform well with an overall current year attritional combined ratio of 85% for the year,
down from 85.5% last year. On reserves, we completed our annual loss reserve studies.
The results of the studies indicated that overall reserves remained adequate. In the fourth
quarter, we booked $262 million of favorable prior year reserve development. This
included favorable prior period development for both the insurance segment and the
reinsurance segments. The insurance segment reported $65 million of favorable prior
year reserve development during the quarter, which was largely related to its workers
compensation business. The reinsurance segments reported $197 million of favorable
prior year development, reflecting $234 million of favorable development, partially offset
by a $37 million increase in asbestos reserves to replenish our position at the beginning of
the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

The $234 million of reinsurance favorable development during the quarter related to
casualty and property business both in the United States and internationally. These
redundancies have developed over time, but we don't react until the position becomes
more mature. We continue to hold our loss reserve estimates for the more recent years.
For investments, pretax investment income was $149 million for the quarter and $543
million for the year on our $18.6 billion investment portfolio. Investment income for the
year was up 15% from one year ago. The result was primarily driven by the increase in
limited partnership income, which was up $45 million over 2016. We've been able to
maintain investment yield without a dramatic shift in the overall investment portfolio.
However, we have gradually shifted allocations within our alternative investment bucket by
reducing exposure to high yield debt and public equity, while committing more toward
limited partnership investments.
The pretax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.1% and duration remained at just over three
years. Other income and expense included $25 million of foreign exchange losses for the
2017 year compared to $21 million of foreign exchange losses in 2016. Other income and
expense also included a $7 million from Mt. Logan Re for the year 2017 compared to $11
million of earnings in fees in 2016. The decline essentially represents the higher level of
catastrophe losses in 2017.
On income taxes, the tax benefit was the result of the amount and the geographic region
of the losses associated with the catastrophes this year and the income associated with
the loss reserve releases in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter of 2017 included a tax
charge of $8 million related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This
tax charge primarily related to the change in the corporate tax rate applied to the
company's net deferred tax assets.
Shareholders' equity for the group was $8.4 billion at the end of 2017, up $294 million or
3.6% over year-end 2016. This is after taking into account capital returned through $50
million of share buybacks and $207 million of dividends paid in 2017. The company
announced a 4% increase to its regular quarterly dividend and paid $1.30 per share in the

fourth quarter of 2017. Our strong capital balance leaves us well positioned for business
opportunities.
Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.

FINAL

John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Thank you, Craig. Good morning. Our operating themes following the 2017 catastrophes
and the January 1st renewals are resilience, adaptability and partnership. Resilience is
valued by our investors and is expected by our clients who depend on our financial
security, and they rely on our evergreen promise to pay claims, especially in times of
need. Everest has faithfully kept its promise for the last 45 years, through years with
extreme industry losses, such as 2017. Both sides of our balance sheet are built to
withstand shock losses, whether from actual 2017 cat events or worse hypothetical losses
had Hurricane Irma directly hit Miami as the cat 5.

Bloomberg Transcript

Supporting our strong conservative capital position on balance sheet, many levels of
hedges protect our capital and our promise to our clients. This includes $2.8 billion of
unexhausted catastrophe bonds and over $1 billion deployed at Mt. Logan, further
protecting us from even more extreme events than seen in 2017.
Following several major catastrophes in Q3, we are pleased with the strong profitability
generated by our reinsurance book in the fourth quarter, and the overall results for 2017.
In Q4, reinsurance generated $419 million of underwriting profit, 197 million from favorable
prior year development, offset by 33 million in net catastrophe losses this quarter. For Q4,
California wildfire losses were 156 million, offset by releases on prior period catastrophes,
including Q3 cats.
For 2017, reinsurance withstood $1.3 billion of pretax net catastrophe losses. Our 2017
combined ratio was 103%, including 29 points of cat losses, highlighting our robust
underwriting strategy, broadly diversified portfolio and strong risk management. Excluding
cats, reinstatement premiums and favorable prior year development, our attritional
combined ratio remained flat at 81%. Globally, Q4 gross written premium increased 21%
from backup covers and new capital relief quota shares and some multi-line deal. For
2017, reinsurance premium was up 20% to $5.1 billion with increased writings in property,
crop, financial line and mortgage.
Now for some color on 2017 by segment. In our US reinsurance segment, 2017 premium
was up 22% to 2.6 billion from increased property writings, reinstatement premiums,
backup covers, increases in property quota share, crop and mortgage. This segment
produced $30 million in the underwriting profit for 2017, despite $700 million of
catastrophe losses. The 2017 combined ratio was up 22 points, driven by the cats, while
the attritional combined ratio was relatively flat at 78.1%.
For our international segment, 2017 premium was $1.3 billion, up 7% with growth in several
regions, but only up 5% on a constant dollar basis. For 2017, cat losses were about $450
million, resulting in an underwriting loss. However, the attritional combined ratio was down

about 2 points due to a lower commission ratio and higher property excess of loss
writings.

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

In our Bermuda segment, 2017 premium was $1.2 billion, up 35% with growth from new
structured multi-line reinsurance and increased financial lines deal. The 2017 combined
ratio increased by 11 points to 98.5% from higher cash, but the attritional combined ratio
increased modestly to 89.5%.
As with any major disruption, opportunity follows for those well positioned for post-loss
execution. And that was true for us this renewal. During this pivotal 01/01 renewal season,
there were several disruptive contravening forces. One, large losses that impacted
earnings or capital of clients, reinsurers and non-traditional participants. Two, a new
market sensitivity to risk impacting managements and boards of both buyers and sellers,
views on pricing, accumulations, tail exposure and ERM. Three, significant amounts of
trapped capital and reloading of some of that alternative capital. Four, across all lines of
business, large clients, reevaluation of their ceded reinsurance strategies and in several
cases increased renewal sessions or placement of new treaties across several lines. And
five, governments and other economic risk holders de-risking and bringing new exposures
to the reinsurance market. With all of these market forces 01/01 was complex, as the
market tried to decide what it was and what it wanted to be. A purely capital markets
transactional marketplace with staggering velocity of capital formation or a market of
longstanding reinsurance relationship between buyers and sellers that understand each
other. Value continuity of trading relationships and agree that rates need to go up after a
loss. In the end, it was somewhere in between.
Although, the market rebound was less pronounced than in past truly hard markets, many
clients realized after several years of rate decreases and meaningful industry losses, rates
must increase. While the rate movement overall was less than originally expected, we are
pleased with the ultimate outcome of our 01/01 portfolio. At January 1st, our underwriting
discipline and market leadership manifested an improved risk adjusted returns
significantly above the market average. We re-underwrote several accounts, achieved
rate in loss affected areas and in most lines around the globe increased shares on deals
and layers we liked and also rode several new opportunities with our core clients.
Short tail business, retro and loss affected property cat treaties achieved increases well
into the double-digits. But we also re-underwrote portions of our property book and
declined many deals with unacceptable economic terms, then reallocated that property
capacity to core clients and better opportunities around the globe. The casualty market,
which was a bright spot in this renewal, showed some stabilization and improvement.
Ceding commissions decreased a few points and excess of loss rates had mid single-digit
improvements with differentiation between better and worse performing books.
We capitalized on our franchise and longstanding client and broker relationships. We
wrote a number of deals with better than market terms. In other times, we were one of
only three or four reinsurers approached to solve a clients' needs. These highlight are
superior access to business and reinsurance opportunities, particularly global clients seek
leading global reinsurers such as Everest for solutions across all lines of business. And as a

result, we were able to meaningfully expand our relationships with them, a trend we
expect to continue throughout 2018.
Our empowered underwriters excel as nimble creative reinsurance experts in their local
markets, listening to and understanding their clients' needs. Our clients and brokers
benefit from the direct interaction with the decision makers in our decentralized model to
access risk. This is done, while adhering to a consistent global view of risk across all
underwriters within every Everest division, including insurance and Lloyd's. In the end,
01/01 renewal was successful. Our premium is up by several hundred million dollars this
January 1 compared to last January 1, and our combined ratios are lower and our
expected profits are higher in 2018.

Bloomberg Transcript

The reloading of some alternative capital in addition to competition from traditional
players had a muting impact on January 1st renewals, highlighting that alternative capital
has become an enduring reality. While this threatens some traditional business model,
Everest is successfully addressing these challenges by utilizing alternative capital to
leverage opportunity, best match capital to risk and ultimately benefit Everest
shareholders.
Recognizing the market evolution between historical reinsurance trading relationships and
new capital markets innovation, Everest's strategic repositioning has been well underway
for several years. We continue to further develop our robust risk and capital management
infrastructure, while adapting our strategies to capitalize our market changes. With our
relevance as a leading global reinsurer, strong portfolio diversification across property and
casualty lines around the globe, best in class expense ratio, industry-leading earnings
power and approximately $13 billion of capital resources through equity, traditional debt,
Mt. Logan, cat bonds and other hedges, we have a competitive advantage in this dynamic
market.
In summary, as a resilient adaptable reinsurer focused on delivering client solutions and
building long-term partnerships utilizing efficient capital structures, we remain ideally
positioned to successfully navigate the waters of this ever changing market into the
future, and look forward to a strong 2018.
Thank you. And now, I'll turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.

{BIO 16652236 <GO>}

Thank you, John, and good morning. Our global insurance operations finished 2017 on a
strong note in terms of growth and more importantly profitability in the fourth quarter. As
shared in prior calls, we have been consistently executing on a multi-faceted strategic
plan, encompassing every dimension of our global insurance organization. As measured
by our key performance metrics, we have made considerable progress and are pleased
with our expanded operating platform and the growing depth and diversity of our
associated books of specialty business.

2017 concluded with record levels of gross written premium, the deepest roster of
actively underwritten specialty products in our history, 150 and counting, the broadest
geographic reach, 17 offices across the US, Canada and Europe for us to execute our
business from and the highest number of insurance teammates across disciplines who are
making all of this happen. This quarter's 36% growth and 80% combined ratio are further
testament to the corrective underwriting actions successfully executed upon over the past
several years and our conservative reserving position across the portfolio. At 2.1 billion in
2017 gross written premium, Everest Insurance is maturing into the global specialty
underwriting platform we had envisioned at the onset and is firmly positioned within the
top-10 of the global lead table for specialty insurance carriers. We remain encouraged
about our growing opportunity set globally and look forward to the many opportunities
ahead of us in 2018.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to the financial results, the global insurance operations produced a record 575
million in gross written premium in the fourth quarter of 2017. This is an increase of 153
million or 36% over fourth quarter 2016. The fourth quarter growth profile is generally
consistent with our experience over the last several quarters as the addition of dozens of
new products and the many talented underwriters managing their thoughtful growth
continue to make their impact. As mentioned, year-to-date, we achieved 2.1 billion in gross
written premium, again, another record performance. This represents growth of 272
million or 15% over 2016. A significant percentage of this growth is emanating from new
businesses and products incepted over the past three years, inclusive of our increasingly
relevant Lloyd's operation, which eclipsed 100 million in gross written premium in 2017.
Each of these products chosen for particular risk return characteristics is playing an
increasingly important role in our diversified portfolio.
Our net written premiums in the quarter were 451 million and 1.6 billion for 2017, which
represent increases of 33% and 18% respectively over the prior year period. Net earned
premium in the quarter increased by 73 million or 22% to 398 million. For the year-to-date
period, net earned premium of 1.5 billion increased by 170 million or 13% over 2016, each
of these are record highs for the insurance operation and provide a solid foundation for
growth into 2018.
The GAAP combined ratio for the quarter was 80.4%, benefited from 16 points of
favorable prior year development, which I will discuss later on in my remarks. For the full
year, the GAAP combined ratio was 104.8, which included 12 points or just over 170 million
of previously disclosed cat losses across our global portfolio emanating mainly from the
hurricane activity in the third quarter along with a minor contribution from the California
wildfires in the fourth quarter.
The attritional combined ratio in the fourth quarter improved to 97.8% from the 99.9%
experienced in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 2.1 point improvement. Year-to-date, the
attritional combined ratio also improved 2.4 points from 99.3% in 2016 and 96.9% in 2017.
The attritional combined ratio continues to improve as a result of the many underwriting
initiatives instituted in recent years. While improving year-over-year, we anticipate an
additional level of improvement around 2 points or so over 2018, as the impact of nonrenewed businesses continues to lessen.

FINAL

Turning to the attritional loss and loss expense ratio for the fourth quarter, the global
insurance operations produced a 67.1%, which is slightly improved from the 67.5%
experienced in the fourth quarter of 2016. This quarter's result also improved by nearly a 1
point from the third quarter attritional of 68.4%. Year-to-date, the attritional loss and loss
expense ratio also improved nearly 3 points to 67% from 69.7% in 2016. This despite
nearly 1.4 points of impact from non-cat related conductive storm activity experienced in
the year.
So again, we continue to see the steady and continued downward drift in the attritional
loss ratio, as a result of the strategic underwriting actions implemented over the past
three years, improved mix of business and benefits from increased scale of our new
business launches. As the impact of now divested businesses decreases, such as
Heartland, we further expect to realize the benefit of our newer portfolio.

Bloomberg Transcript

Looking at the expenses, the fourth quarter expense ratio came in at 30.7%, nearly a 2
point improvement in the prior year fourth quarter of 32.4%. For the year-to-date period,
the expense ratio was 29.9%, essentially flat with the 29.6% for 2016. An expense ratio of
roughly 30% remains very competitive in the specialty insurance segment. With respect to
the favorable reserve development, the conclusion of our customary fourth quarter
reserve reviews resulted in fourth quarter releases totaling approximately 65 million from
accident years 2013 and prior. Our workers compensation book predominantly
concentrated in California contributed materially to this, as it has been developing
favorably for some time. On a year-to-date basis, favorable prior period development
equated to 56 million. We remain confident in our overall reserve position across the
insurance portfolio, particularly in light of reserve actions taken over the last several years.
Turning to the operating environment, overall rate trends experienced during the first
three quarters gained some momentum in the fourth quarter, particularly in the property
lines. Excluding our workers' compensation and accident and health portfolios, overall rate
change for the North American P&C insurance operations, where the overwhelming
majority of our renewal book resides, ended 2017 at plus 1%. While only slightly positive, it
is the first time in several years that we have experienced positive aggregate rate in the
non-workers compensation lines of business. Inclusive of the workers compensation
portfolio, the overall rate change turned slightly negative to minus 3%, indicating the
continued mid single-digit rate pressure across the work comp line. This outcome was
fully anticipated and factored into our pricing and reserving decisions for the year.
Further, we have experienced a material improvement in our property portfolio in the third
and fourth quarters, where rates moved from essentially flat to plus 3% and plus 8% in 3Q
and 4Q respectively. As many of you know, the heavier cat exposed wholesale books of
business and meaningful part of our property book were new in the first and second
quarter of 2018, thus we have yet to see the rate influence from these renewals.
Additionally, the commercial auto segment of our portfolio continues to receive corrective
rate action, a trend that has now persisted for several quarters. Overall, we achieved
meaningful positive rate across this book in 2017, delivering plus 12%. As for the general
liability markets primary and excess, we also achieved positive rate in fourth quarter.

FINAL

Although roughly flat for the year, there are signs that this market continues to stabilize
and positive rate movement is expected.
Overall, across our portfolio we anticipate moderately improved operating conditions
throughout 2018 with some pockets lagging this broader trend as they are in need of
further corrective rate action. We will continue to focus our efforts and resources on those
areas and lines of business that present us with appropriate risk adjusted returns. In
conclusion, we are pleased and encouraged by our 2017 results. Despite a difficult cat
year, the progress we have made to organically build a top-10 global specialty insurer is
encouraging and deeply motivating to our colleagues. Our in-force book of business has
meaningfully improved on an underlying basis and we anticipate increased resilience in
our portfolio as our growth and diversification strategies continue building traction. Our
platform and growing range of capabilities are well positioned for future growth. The
Everest Insurance brand is strong and we look forward to updating you on our progress in
future calls.
Now back to Beth for Q&A.

Questions And Answers
A - Elizabeth Farrell

{BIO 1986541 <GO>}

Thanks, Jon. Derek, we are now open for questions.

Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Elyse Greenspan
with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. My first question in terms of the PML disclosure, at the top of the call,
you guys mentioned that your PMLs went down in US reinsurance. Is this after
reinstatement in taxes, I know you disclosed two PML figures?

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Elyse, this is Craig. Yes, that would be the same basis that we typically disclose our PMLs
on a net economic basis, so after reinstatement and after taxes, we do expect them to
stay, in relation to our overall capital, we expect them to stay relatively flat or even slightly
down.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

So then as we're thinking about the impact of tax reform and what that could have had -done to your PML, to keep your net PMLs -- to get your net PMLs to go down, was there
more retro that you were purchasing, if you can just talk to, I guess, how you changed
your PMLs following on tax reform?

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

FINAL

Well, after tax reform, as you know, the tax rate will go down. So the tax benefit for some
of the longer tail depends on the return period. So the longer return periods will get less
tax benefit, but we can cover that with other types of reinsurance purchases and/or
catastrophe loss.

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

And also Elyse, what we said was that our PML relative to capital is about stable. So the
word suggesting that the PML would go down necessarily, but just relative to capital, it
would be about the similar position.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then sticking with the taxes for a second. How should we think about your tax
rate as we think about modeling in 2018?

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

So overall, with the tax rate coming down in the United States, as you know we do
business globally around the world in many different jurisdictions. But with the tax rate
coming down in the US, we expect our overall tax rate to come down about a couple
points.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And then as we think about your outlook for the market for the balance of
the year, you guys obviously reloaded Logan, your own alternative capital vehicle to a
level well in excess of where it sat last year, so more than covering the losses. How do
you view the impact, I guess, it's a two part question of both alternative capital as well as,
as we see more of the insured losses for the third quarter events come down, how do
you think that that can have an impact on the market as we think to the June and July
renewals?

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

I still think that we feel the market was trending up in the property space, particularly
those areas that have been most affected. And we're not anticipating -- perhaps, the
alternative capital is having some impact on wild swings in rates. But generally, markets
are seeking some level of rate increase in those loss affected areas. And frankly, they
deserve it. So we don't expect -- we do not expect the reloading of alternative capital, if it
is even reloaded entirely to impact would have a rate decrease effect.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then one last question. You mentioned, I believe that some multi-year
coverage written in the fourth quarter. How big a multi-year cover is in proportion to your
reinsurance book?

Good morning, Elyse. It's John. That's one of the things we did and that incrementally
accounted for some of the premium -- I mean, across the entire $5 billion of premium, it's
not that material. It does -- it's in different classes of business, credit, mortgage and
different lines of business. There's a couple of property deals, but overall, it's not a very
meaningful part of our book.

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

So first question, just follow up on the January renewal. John mentioned that you guys had
improved your risk adjusted returns above the market. Could you quantify that just in term
of how much you see the market increase versus yours? And how the market would -dynamics would play out at mid-year renewals, is that -- would that rate increase sustain
or improve in the coming renewals?

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

So Kai, it's John. So there is a lot of moving parts and I don't know that we know exactly
what happened with the market. There's a lot of deals that are done in the market that
we decline and we don't know what the ultimate price that they were done at. And I think
that's one of the ways that we get better than market results is that we maintain our
underwriting discipline on deals that we don't agree with the absolute rate or don't agree
with the rate increase or flat or decrease, given the loss positions or the overall market
conditions. So it's hard for us to quantify that, but we are comfortable that we are building
a better overall portfolio that exists in the market, given our ratings, our global footprint,
our very broad diversified portfolio, frankly our fantastic underwriters around the globe.
And I think that just helps us. And as I mentioned, it helps us build relationships as we
continue, we are and continue to be relevant to many of our trading partners and one of
the interesting things this January 1st is we saw across a whole lot of operations, our
Bermuda, our London, Zurich, Canada, Miami, US, we saw many clients increasing their
participation with us. And that's across a lot of different lines of business. So that's

Page 12 of 21

FINAL

probably the most -- one of the most optimistic things we saw, it's just the increase in
demand for reinsurance, particularly with Everest. So we're very pleased with that. Again,
Dom alluded to the mid-year renewals, we don't know what it's going to be. We think
given the rate decreases that have happened and the losses, there should be upward
pressure on rates, but we don't forecast what we think it will be, we are confident that
we'll be able to execute irrespective of what the market conditions are.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, John. That's very helpful. My second question is on the reserve releases. If
you look at your fourth quarter, especially in insurance segment, that's a first meaningful
release in more than a decade. So just wondered, if you can give me more detail
regarding to how much of that -- how much has legacy book developed, what accident
years those workers comp release has been? And going forward, given you guys since
2010 have instituted more conservative reserve philosophy, will we see more reserve
release in the coming years?

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I'm going to let Craig get to the specifics of that. But first, let me say that you're correct
and that we haven't had an overall net reserve release in insurance for quite some time.
But we highlight the fact that it has been due to our legacy portfolio. And we have had net
reserve releases in varying lines of business in the insurance book, just that on a net basis,
they haven't come through because they've been overwhelmed with the legacy issues,
which we now feel we have under control.
But I'll let Craig get into some of the more specifics about your question.

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Yeah, Kai. That's a -- it's a good comment and Dom's comment is correct as well. We
didn't see any drag from the prior year run-off business in the insurance segment this
year. So what you're seeing is the actual results come through on a net basis you're
seeing favorable development. Primarily from -- as Jon Zaffino mentioned, it's from 2013
and prior and mostly in the workers' compensation area, but some other small lines as
well. What -- so that's the major difference year-over-year, but our process hasn't
changed. That conservative process that you mentioned since even as early as 2010
remains in effect and we continue to go through that same process each year. We take
our time to react to that favorable development and we don't release those
redundancies until they've developed over time and become more mature.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. Last one, if I may, on the tax rates. You said it will be a reduction about a couple
points, what are the starting points? And are you guys going to change your ceding
program, which is currently ceding about 40% of US premiums to offshore finance?

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Page 13 of 21



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2018-02-06

FINAL

So the answer to that, first of all is the starting point was our 2016 tax rate was about 10%,
that was last year. This year, as you know we had a tax benefit for the overall year, so that
the actual exposure that we had after the catastrophe losses for the year, but we do
expect it to be in the high single-digits going forward, that's number one. And your
question about what are we doing going forward, we will be canceling or have canceled
our quota share already because it is not economical for us to do that going forward.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Great, thank you so much.

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Sure.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Thanks. First, just want to note that I think that that tax rate is a lot better than people
thought it was going to be. Second on outbound reinsurance and retrocessional
protection in 2018, how should we think -- be thinking about Everest's strategy on that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Good morning, Jay. It's John. So I think we buy traditional reinsurance, we buy, have
looked at retro from time to time, we cede business to Logan, we have the cat bonds,
ILWs et cetera and we continue to look at different capital structures, the traditional and
non-traditional that we're going to do. I think probably the way I would think about it is, is
look at the net to gross ratios both for insurance and reinsurance over the last couple of
years. And those should stay reasonably consistent. We're still in the process of, as Craig
said, with the change in the internal quota share, we're still in the process of thinking of
PML management, risk management, capital management and we haven't yet decided on
everything. We have some ideas. So that may result in the tail. We do additional cessions,
but across the whole portfolio that won't be that large a percentage. So I think the net to
gross ratios that exist today are probably pretty good.

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

And part of the answer to that Jay is also that it's a little difficult to give you absolute
numbers on that because it somewhat depends on what we see coming in front door. So
if our property business is down or -- that's one strategy, if it's up, that might be an
entirely different strategy. What we are anticipating though is that our expected cat load
for go-forward into 2018 would be just under 9%, which is about point drop from where
traditionally it has been.

Okay, that's helpful. Final question is on the merger and acquisition environment and
opportunities. So in light of AIG's announced acquisition of Validus all cash for what could
be viewed as a pretty attractive multiple, does that have any influence on Everest's
thinking in terms of acquisitions going forward or consolidation within the reinsurance
market?

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

None whatsoever. In fact, not sure that we would maybe even detract a little bit more
from an acquisition scheme to the extent that that's the go forward multiple. We think that
an organic build is a lot more efficient for us, and I think we've demonstrated both on the
reinsurance and the insurance side that we've been successful in that strategy.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Excellent. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Thank you. I just want to add a little bit on Kai's question about the timing on the reserve
releases. Dom, you're I think up to almost nine years at the firm. When you came in nine
years ago, what did the reserve situation look like? And in terms of your priorities, is there
a different timeline on getting the different departments in order or are both the
reinsurance and insurance reserving techniques the same and on the same track?

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, Josh, you have a good memory as to the timeline, but when I first came in, I think,
what I said at the time is that I quote we had an adequate reserve position and I think
that's demonstrated to be accurate. I think if you look through the history at the various
accident years, we have developed favorably. So that's number one.
Some years developed more favorably than others, but all different. What did change,
and I did institute some reserving changes when I first came in just in the way we
established the current accident year number and that I think frankly through time has
proven to be perhaps a bit more conservative than it may have been prior to that. But
nevertheless, reserves have developed favorably. So -- and I think it's -- what we've been
able to harvest over the last couple of years probably is somewhat reflective of slightly
more conservative philosophy than we had in the past. But notwithstanding that, again
history will prove that our reserves have developed favorably in various -- at various
accident years.

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

And the second part of that question, Josh, was the process and the process is the same
for both reinsurance and insurance.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. And then -- I mean, usually to your peers, you bought back stock in the fourth
quarter. You obviously have a lower debt to capital ratio than everyone else does.
Depending on how you view the stock, why was it the right time? Why not buy more? The
decision in terms of how much capital you need to write new business, what's the tradeoff between debt financing and share repurchase at this point? Can you talk about, like all
the nuts and bolts behind that decision?

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Well first of all I think that we felt the stock was an enormous value at the time we bought
it in. The amount that we bought in was somewhat contained because of how close it was
to coming up with numbers as opposed to why it was hefty as opposed to something
more. We had to be mindful of the fact that we were getting closer to the year-end. And
as relative to our capital position, we were comfortable with where the third quarter
events had -- what that meant to our total financial position, so we weren't particularly
concerned about our capital position. And relative to debt to equity, what we stated in the
past is that we'd like to keep that number conservative because it's a contingency, right,
contingency reserve, if you will, to the extent that we saw an opportunity either despite
my preference for organic build, if we did see an acquisition that made some sense, that
gave us some flexibility. And/or if we saw some tremendous market opportunity, again, it
gave us flexibility. So we tend to view the debt capacity is one that gives us flexibility as
opposed to leveraging it up to the max.

Our next question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks, good morning. I'm trying to put together a couple of data points. One is the fact
that most companies and I think Everest as well has talked about the third quarter
catastrophes being in line with modeled expectations instead of having any major
surprises. And the second is that we're seeing bigger rate increases on loss affected
accounts. Is that a fair observation? And is that a rational response? Or is there -- I'm
asking, whether there is an opportunity in there?

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Is what a rational response? If it is rate increases on loss affected --

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

FINAL

Bigger rate increases on loss impacted accounts, if that was more a luck than a reflection
of lower underwriting profitability?

A - Dominic Addesso

Well, I think in part, it's -- first of all, the rate increases that have come through the market
are probably less than people were anticipating based on other market events of a similar
nature. And recognize that the market has been in somewhat of a rate decline for several
years. So what -- to the extent, was it a rational response even though the losses were as
you described as expected, I absolutely think it was a response, I think perhaps it wasn't
as rational as it needed to be. But nevertheless, from our perspective, the rate increases
kind of get us back to a point where it's a reasonable return relative to the risk we're
taking on, whereas I think if you look at the results of the industry in last three years in
many cases, many markets that we're operating at below their cost of capital. So I
absolutely think, even though it might have been an expected level of loss, if you're
writing business below your cost of capital, then it absolutely is a rational response

Q - Meyer Shields

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

No, that's helpful. I appreciate it. Is there, I guess, the opportunity -- I'm wondering, is
there an opportunity to target impact -- accounts that were impacted by 2017
catastrophes because the rate increases are bigger there than elsewhere?

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, that's what we do each and every day. And -- of course. But -- and there are
instances where we think it's the right rate and will increase share, if we think it's the
appropriate rate. And in many cases, as we saw 01/01, there were instances where we
declined or got off certain businesses because it was an inappropriate rate relative to the
risk. So yeah, these events always create opportunities, sometimes the opportunities
make sense and other times, it don't.

A - Jon Zaffino

{BIO 16652236 <GO>}

Meyer, this is Jon. I wanted to add a little more color to that. I think going back to your first
part of your question, I think there's also -- you got to look at it as modeled results and
then kind of psychology of the market and also when the rate -- when losses like this have
happened. And I'm not sure I fully agree that all -- it's certainly across the buyers and even
some of the sellers that everybody thought these losses were expected, I would highlight
the California wildfire is the largest fires of all time. Houston being impacted by Harvey
are one in a 1,000 event. I'm not sure people think in terms of one in a 1,000 type event,
so the flooding that happened there.
As you may recall Irma for a while was heading to Florida to Miami as the cat 5 and looked
like it was going to be a direct hit and the market was talking about $150 billion, $200
Page 17 of 21

billion of insured losses. And Maria hitting Puerto Rico that was the first major hurricane to
hit Puerto Rico since 1928. And all of that I think impacts what -- while it could be in a
model, I'm not sure about the wildfires and floodings, it's always a challenge for the
model, but there's certainly a lot about just the buyers and sellers and the market
dynamic and what managements think and boards think of the buyers and things like that
and people -- I think that there is some people maybe were surprised with the outcomes
of some of these and some of the losses that happened, and the accumulation and
aggregation of them. So I think there's a lot of moving parts beyond what did they model
today.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. No, that's very helpful. Very thorough. Thank you. Second question. As the crop
reinsurance book grows, is there any seasonality to how you plan to report results
because so much of the ultimate profit is recognized to the back half of the year?

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

I think we pretty much have a fixed pick loss ratio that we keep throughout the year.

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

And we do that -- it's more -- it's less seasonal now that it's on the reinsurance book than
it was when it was on the insurance book.

nature of the results. So anyway, go ahead, Brian.

Great. Helpful. The second question, I'm just curious on your workers comp business in
California, do you anticipate any kind of push back from regulators with respect to kind of
pricing and rate, given tax reform?

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi Brian, this is John. Very uncertain at the moment. We're going to obviously watch
the market carefully and continue to react based on what we see is underlying risk return
characteristics. So -- and we're following the same early commentary and we'll keep an
eye on that. But at this stage, we have not seen anything different. But we'll certainly be
watching that closely in California and other jurisdictions as information becomes better
known.

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

I think that Brian will more likely be more of a personal lines issue than it's likely to be a
commercial lines issue. And I think over time, the market will self-correct itself. I am not
sure that regulators necessarily even though sometimes can't help themselves, we'll
need -- necessarily need to get involved in that particular kind of activity.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. And then a little bit bigger picture question here. Is your pricing your business
both reinsurance and the insurance side, obviously you've got to build in some type of
kind of loss trend, inflation assumptions, which you think are kind of going forward, what
are you all kind of thinking on the loss trend side kind of over the next year or two? And
then kind of how are you pricing the business and I guess reserving for it?

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, that varies across various lines of business. So what we model in for work comp is
different than what we -- than we build in for casualty or excess liability or property, it's
more financial lines for that matter. So there isn't one part answer to that question, but
sufficed to say that we're building trend in to all -- not only our pricing, but also our
reserving activities.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay. And then the last question, I'm just curious, a lot of growth going on, any thoughts
about -- and your expenses have been going up relatively modestly, any thoughts about
whether you've got the infrastructure to handle this type of growth and could you put
more growth on the current platform?

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Is that a question about reinsurance or insurance or both?

Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

I would say on both sides.

FINAL

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, certainly I will talk to the reinsurance piece first. We have actually been adding
resources, you know we talk a lot about adding new lines of business and diversifying our
reinsurance platform. And we have been adding resources, technical resources to keep
up with that or to generate those business opportunities and properly underwrite them.
And I don't see that on the reinsurance side as a particular problem, given kind of the bulk
nature of the premium that comes in on the reinsurance side. So not an issue at all. And
frankly, from an infrastructure point of view, we have added the resources and we have
the management depth to deal with those types of accounts.
On the insurance side, as Jonathan pointed out, our expense ratio is just up slightly yearover-year and that's an area we -- where we also continue to add resources as well as
continue to invest in systems. So our -- the fact that we're able to maintain that expense
ratio, I think is a tribute to Jonathan and his team as well as the rest of the support units
within the organization that provide services to our insurance operation. So we continue to
do -- as the earned premium continues to build on the insurance operation, I think we're
able to properly manage that expense ratio and at the same time make the proper
investments where we need to.
