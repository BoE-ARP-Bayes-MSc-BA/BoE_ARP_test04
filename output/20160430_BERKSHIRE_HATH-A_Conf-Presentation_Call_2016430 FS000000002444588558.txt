Alexis Christof orous
Hello, and welcome to the first ever livestream of the Berkshire Hathaway Annual
Shareholders' Meeting on Yahoo! Finance. We are live at the CenturyLink Center in
Omaha, Nebraska where some 40,000 people waited in the pouring rain this morning to
hear Chairman and CEO, Warren Buffet, the world's most famous investor be peppered
with questions for the next seven hours for all of the world to see.
I'm Alexis Christoforous of Yahoo! Finance coming to you from the Exhibition Hall where
all the Berkshire brands come to sell their wares this weekend, including the Clayton
Home behind me that is selling for $78,900. It's a modular home and it is actually at a
discount for Berkshire shareholders .They get it for $10,000 less than they would if they
weren't shareholders.
All right. In just a moment you're going to hear from the Oracle of Omaha himself. But you
know what, we've got our own oracle here at Yahoo! Finance. It is Editor in Chief, Andy
Serwer joining in front of the Fruit of the Loom store. And Andy I know it's already been a
very busy morning here. There have been newspaper tosses and cheerleaders. What are
we going to see it's a magnitude of the man, isn't it?

Bloomberg Transcript

Andrew Serwer
That's right Alexis, and people have been streaming into this Fruit of the Loom exhibit all
morning looking to buy stuff, and as well all across this giant exhibition hall to other
Berkshire companies like See's Candy, GEICO, Dairy Queen and they're buying all of this
Berkshire bric-a-brac basically. You can see these T-shirts, underwear, Heinz Ketchup, Kraft
Mac & Cheese; there's some See's Candies and T-shirts. Even this Buffet fan. And
basically, all these people are here just to hear what Warren Buffet has to say. He is the
Oracle of Omaha, and as you suggested, the world's greatest investor. But even more
than that, he is an incredible businessman who's built Berkshire Hathaway up into one of
the most important and biggest companies in the world.
He employs over 350,000 Americans, does tens of billions of dollars of sales every year.
Has all these companies. But even more than that, Buffet has become an American icon
who influences sports, the arts, movies, politics and government as well, Presidents,
Senators, CEOs from around the world want to hear him speak and that's why everyone's
here today, Alexis.

Alexis Christof orous
Yeah. Well, a little bit that Midas touch, right, Andy. He certainly has become part of pop
culture. Well, listen, we have got you covered. Here is the schedule, all right. All these
times by the way are Eastern Daylight Time. At 10:30 AM, the meeting begins when
Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger are questioned by a panel of journalists, analysts and
the audience of shareholders. Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger are asked about

anything under the sun. Then they break for lunch, and that's when Yahoo! Finance
coverage resumes. We will be bringing you analysis and some special guests you won't
want to miss. Then at about 2:00 PM Eastern, the Q&A resumes. At about 4:30 Eastern,
there is a short recess. Yahoo! Finance has you covered with anything you may have
missed. And then at 4:45 Eastern, the formal meeting begins. Now here is the beauty of
this. You don't have to be on a desktop to watch this all. Yahoo! Finance is streaming this
all on our app as well. So take us on the go.
All right. There are diehards all over the world who know all the ins and outs of Berkshire
and Buffet. But for the uninitiated, the company touches almost every brand you can think
of, from the moment you wake up until the moment you go to bed. I want you to meet
someone called Jane Berkshire (3:50) and all the Berkshire-related products she uses
every day.
[Video Presentation] (3:56 to 5:29)
All right. Now let's hear from the man himself. Andy I know you sat down with Warren
Buffett recently and he gave you a preview of what we're going to see today, right?

Andrew Serwer

Bloomberg Transcript

That's right, Alexis. I've had the opportunity to speak with Buffet a number of times over
the years. I sat down with him recently to talk about this weekend and how it's become
this incredible extravaganza. Take a listen.
People love to hear what you and Charlie have to say. But you throw the newspapers and
we have all these kind of little mini-events that surround it. So you contributed building it
up, right?

Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. It's – there is a little bit of (6:02) in there.

Andrew Serwer
But you never – did you ever plan on it getting to be what it is today?

Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

No, I never dreamt it would get this large. I mean we have had to move the venue about
six times. Fortunately they built a new convention center here, six years or seven years
ago, or we would have had to – I don't know what we would have done. It surprised me.
We had well over 40,000 last year, and if you go back 25 years Berkshire didn't even
have 40,000 shareholders. So it – it just keeps going.

Andrew Serwer

And you're kind of maxed out, which is one reason why you decided to livestream. Can
you talk about why you've decided to livestream this at Yahoo! Finance?

FINAL

Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, there's a couple of reasons. But one reason certainly is that we sort of maxed
out and we couldn't take much of them way further names (6:44) at the meeting. The
room at the convention center, the main room holds about 18,000. There is five
wonderful rooms and last year we filled all those, and we had to go across the street to
the old motel (6:58), and so we had a couple of more big rooms over there that were
pretty full. So in effect we were starting to stream in a little bit to our own audience. So
that was one reason. But beyond that, I know, it's – we get people from all over the world.
We have maybe a 100 – 200 from Australia, hundreds from China. They come from all
over, and not everybody can afford that. It's not an easy expense to afford. So this gives
people a chance, who don't want to spend a lot of money on airplanes, and it's just
difficult to get to, from very – I think we had 55 countries that people came from last year.
So maybe we will lease your forum (7:43).

Andrew Serwer
So, it's – it's a big event. You go up on stage with Charlie Munger, your partner, do you get
nervous...

Bloomberg Transcript

Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah.

Andrew Serwer
What's it like going up there?

Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

No, no. Charlie grew up in Omaha. But he only comes here now for the annual meeting
once a year. And incidentally (7:55) we don't see each other until just right before the
meeting starts, because he is off doing something, and I'm off doing something. And
when I know the movie is coming to an end, I'm still out with the audience, watching the
movie, which starts at 8:30 Central Time and runs till 9:30 and about 9:25, I – they start
rolling the credits on the movie, and Charlie gets up. He sees me get up and we walk
backstage. And then when the movie finally is over, we walk out on the stage. But we have
– we don't talk about – we don't consult over anything. I have no idea, what he is going to
say, and I walk out there and Charlie is 92, I'm 85. He lost an eye some time ago. So I just
told him, I can see and he can hear. We got to work together. I think we have no choice.
Maybe I can't remember his name anymore, but that's a minor detail.

Andrew Serwer
Do you have a theme to the meetings or is there some sort of program at all?

Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

No, we go wherever the questions lead us. We have – we have three journalists, we have
three Wall Street specialists, and then we have the crowd. So we keep alternating among
them and last year we had over 60 questions. And we get no advance notice of it. We do
not know from the crowd who is going to be asking questions. They draw at various
stations, where we have a microphone, and anything goes. And if you have been to the
meeting I would say that, frankly now the questions come from anybody in Omaha, and a
great – a good number come from people outside the United States.

Andrew Serwer
I mean you learn something every time you talk to the man, Alexis. And what was most
striking to me from that conversation was his flexibility. I mean here's an 85 year old guy,
who famously doesn't really know much about technology, who's decided to stream this
meeting.

Alexis Christof orous
Exactly. I mean he is one of the oldest CEOs in the world. And this was his idea. He's
embracing the technology and we applaud him for that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Andrew Serwer
I mean he continues to learn every day. The man is like a sponge. He reads constantly.
He's constantly talking to people. He is very, very curious and I think that's part of what's
made him so successful.

Alexis Christof orous
For sure. Sharp as a tack. Thanks for bringing us that interview Andy.

Andrew Serwer
All right. Alexis.

Alexis Christof orous
And here is a little context for you. Yahoo! Finance's Lawrence Lewitinn did the math,
thankfully. Thank you Lawrence, and the price of one share of Berkshire stock 25 years
ago today was $8,075. Today, it is $218,530. Now that's a profit of $210,455 or 2,506%.
That means, your $8,075 investment is now worth 26 times what it was in 1991. So on an
annualized basis, it's a return of 14.1% per year, every year for 25 years. You'll be hard
pressed to find those returns anywhere else. You've in essence doubled your money on
average, every five years and three months.

Q - Alexis Christof orous
All right. With Buffet's worth at $62 billion, people will be listening to his every word,
especially this man, Bob Miles, the foremost Buffetologist. He is the author of three books
on Buffet. He also teaches an MBA course at the University of Nebraska, and we'd like to
welcome Bob in when he is here. Is Bob here? Oh, Bob Miles, come on over. Come on
over here, Bob. Get to my left. We want to chat about today's event. You're our
Buffetologist as we said. Thanks so much for being here. What year is this for you now at
the meeting?

A - Robert P. Miles

{BIO 19735683 <GO>}

This is my 20th year. I first came out when the meeting was held at a former race track
called our Ak-Sar-Ben Race Track, which is Nebraska spelled backwards.

Q - Alexis Christof orous
Okay. I wouldn't have known that. Thank you. So you've really seen this thing grow. Talk to
me about the mysticism of Warren Buffet and why this faithful crowd follows him and
hangs on his every word?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Robert P. Miles

{BIO 19735683 <GO>}

Well, I think he is just a regular guy, who speaks the truth unlike Wall Street. Warren at the
meeting, when I first attended 20 years ago, would say Wall Street will sell you anything
that you're willing to buy, and that Wall Street is the legal pickpocket for the average
investor. He educates us, he entertains us and he gives us the hard truths about finance,
the economy, and life.

Q - Alexis Christof orous
Tell me – yeah, he's sort of like everybody's grandpa or uncle in many ways, right. Talk to
me about what we might expect him to say during the meeting. We know that he is
holding on to shares of IBM at a loss right now. IBM stock is down more than 14%. It's
usually policy not to talk about individual stocks at this meeting. But you think he might –
and do you think maybe IBM was a mistake?

A - Robert P. Miles

{BIO 19735683 <GO>}

Well, he says I may have done a mistake. He said that recently. He may talk about it, but
he is likely to not talk about anything that he's purchased or they are holding or that
they've sold. But IBM maybe an exception. I think he is likely to talk to you about Precision
Castparts, which is their largest acquisition. And in fact, it's an acquisition that was brought
to him by the likely successor to Warren Buffett, on the investment side, Todd Combs.

Q - Alexis Christof orous
And that's my other question. Do you think he is going to address his succession plan
here today? I mean, he is 85. We all know he's going to live to like 200. But is he going to
talk about that succession plan today?

A - Robert P. Miles

{BIO 19735683 <GO>}

No. He is not likely to talk about that except possibly joke that he plans to work till five
years after his retirement, and then communicate with regular (13:25) with the board of
directors.

FINAL

Q - Alexis Christof orous
I do not doubt it. Bob Miles. Thanks so much for stopping by. Enjoy the rest of the
weekend.

Alexis Christof orous
All right. Well, look, the fun has just begun. We are just minutes away from Warren Buffett
taking the stage. And coming up, you're going to hear from someone who knows Buffett
better than most. And remember during the conversation we want to hear from you, the
hashtag is #brklivestream and don't forget that Yahoo! Finance app is livestreaming this
as well. You're watching Yahoo! Finance's worldwide exclusive livestream of the Berkshire
Hathaway annual meeting.
[Video Presentation] (14:07 to 15:35)
You're watching Yahoo!'s exclusive livestreaming of the Berkshire Hathaway annual
meeting, coming to you from the CenturyLink Center in Omaha, Nebraska. And we want
to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world.
I'm Alexis Christoforous, joined by Yahoo! Finance Editor in Chief, Andy Serwer and we
are just moments away from the beginning of this highly anticipated meeting. One of the
traditions this week in Omaha is the fourth annual Newspaper Toss. It was held moments
ago right here inside the CenturyLink Center. And in the past, Bill Gates and Kathy Ireland
have competed against Buffett. And Buffett has famously said he has tossed 0.5 million
papers in his lifetime. And the rules are pretty simple. Buffett says, if you can make it
closest to the door from 35 feet back, beat him and he'll buy you a Dairy Queen ice
cream. So never say Warren Buffett didn't do anything for you.

Q&A
Q - Andrew Serwer
All right. I recently sat down with one of Warren Buffett's oldest and dearest friends, the
journalist, Carol Loomis (18:23) who had written for Fortune Magazine for 60 years. She
knows everything about Warren Buffett, take a listen.

A - Alexis Christof orous

Bloomberg Transcript

While the reputation of the annual meeting itself just built over the years. And it was not
only Warren, but it was Charlie, Charlie Munger, who is such a character and an amazing
guy. And so people began to understand that this was something worth listening to.
These two guys who were nearly the age they are today when they begin to build, not
only that, but they ran into other people, who were in their business, investments, value
investing.
Dinners began to be held by some of these value investors, and I saw you the other day
quote Warren, as saying that there are some of PT Warren in him (19:19), and Warren
began to bring out the PT Warren (19:23) aspect, and so eventually we had a five
kilometer race. We have him – the newspaper throwing contest. I mean, that's an amazing
thing. The CEO, look at him, in a newspaper throwing contest. And then the floor itself of
where they sell the merchandise, and the variety of stuff that is there; books for sale,
See's Candy, Dairy Queen's, you name it, you can buy it there.

Q - Andrew Serwer
I mean it's incredibly insightful and also fun.

A - Alexis Christof orous
Right. Absolutely – people love to come here. They love it.

Q - Andrew Serwer
So Carol, I want you to pretend, like I've never heard of Warren Buffett.

A - Alexis Christof orous
Okay.

Q - Andrew Serwer
Page 8 of 152



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity

And I want you to explain to me, what makes him so special?

FINAL

A - Alexis Christof orous
So he is just extremely smart. Secondly, he spent his entire life trying to learn business,
learning over everything that he could possibly could about business. So he has his
encyclopedic knowledge of business, so when any subject comes up about business he
can comment on it immediately, and lucidly and often in a very funny way. And then thirdly,
if an opportunity comes along in business he can assess it very quickly and either to buy a
large stake in a company, like Coca-Cola, which he did four decades ago, or to buy more
and more, to buy a whole business. He is just – his judgment about what to do in those
situations is just incredible.

Q - Andrew Serwer
Carol, Warren is 85 years old.

A - Alexis Christof orous
Right.

Q - Andrew Serwer
You're around the same age?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alexis Christof orous
Yeah. Little bit – a little bit older.

Q - Andrew Serwer
Little bit older. Why do you guys keep doing this? Why does Warren keep going like this,
when he doesn't have to?

A - Alexis Christof orous
He loves work. He loves everything about it. He loves reading, and he reads immense
quantities of everything. There are no people around him that he doesn't like. He just
works with people he does like. And he just finds the whole experience wonderful. And he
has said to me that he thinks most CEOs, and certainly he would be one would pay to
have their jobs. And he certainly would. And of course it's almost true that he does pay,
because he only gets a $100,000 salary. But even so he loves his work.

Q - Andrew Serwer
Buffet has his detractors, Alexis, some people for instance say that he can be kind of
hooky. But I kind of think that's a really a redeeming quality. So many people are so serious
about business all the time and he really brings fun and joy and real passion to what he
does and I wish there was more of that in the business world.

Q - Alexis Christof orous
Welcome back to our live stream at the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholder meeting.
I've got a very special guest here. You may recognize him folks, as the legendary
entertainer, singer, song-writer, Mr. Paul Anka. Thank you so much for being here, what a
treat.

A - Paul Anka

Well, thank you. It's good to be here, I always love coming here.

Q - Alexis Christof orous
Now I have to admit, when I think Warren Buffett, I don't think Paul Anka. Tell me, give me
the connection, how did you meet Mr. Buffett?

A - Paul Anka

{BIO 1835792 <GO>}

Well, I met Mr. Buffett, a little while back. I was asked to entertain in Las Vegas at his netchat meeting, and we hit it off. And of course, I knew of him. I'd met him on a periphery at
a few events. But we got to talking and we got the song My Way, which apparently he
likes a lot. And one thing led to another, and I found that he and I began singing it
together as a duet at special events. And besides that, it's just when he touches your life,
he touches your life...

You never let go that. And I've never let go that, and we've been in touch through the
years and My Way has been a link to us and kind of performing it together and hopefully,
we'll get to do that at the White House soon.

Q - Alexis Christof orous
Oh, that sounds like a plan. We want to be there for that. He – it's a sitting song for him.
He has done it his way all these years. I know you've changed up the lyrics, right to fit with
– any other songs you might duet with him, you think?

A - Paul Anka

{BIO 1835792 <GO>}

Well, let me see. It won't be Puppy Love, it won't be Having My Baby. It might be, Yeah,
You Are My Destiny or the Times Of Your Life.

Q - Alexis Christof orous
Oh, I want my faves...

A - Paul Anka

{BIO 1835792 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah.

Q - Alexis Christof orous
He can carry a tune, I was here yesterday and he and Bill Gates were in the gold cart, just
a couple of billionaires hanging out, and he took out his ukulele and he started singing I
Have Been Working On The Railroad, he can carry a tune, right?

A - Paul Anka

{BIO 1835792 <GO>}

Oh, he definitely can carry a tune. Without doubt, he sings with a lot of passion. He knows
what he is doing and absolutely carry a tune. And one day and we've talked about it,
hopefully we're going to get Mr. Gates in there with Mr. Buffet and I'm going to recruit
Carlos Slim. It's been a goal of mine, I'm serious.

Q - Alexis Christof orous
That's great.

A - Paul Anka

{BIO 1835792 <GO>}

Everyone has been in accord. Mr. Gates just seems to not quite get to the gate.

Thank you. All right, we are just seconds away from Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger
taking that stage. It's the main event, we're going to be back immediately after the
presentation, remember, for an hour long, half time show. Joining us live will be famed
investor, Mario Gabelli; superstar, super model turned super business women Kathy
Ireland and the man, Warren Buffett called a genius, Breaking Bad creator, Vince Gilligan.
All right. You can see it all on the Yahoo! Finance and on the Yahoo! Finance app. I want to
throw it down a ways at this exhibit hall to my colleague, Editor-in-Chief, Andy Serwer here
at Yahoo! What's going on there as we countdown the moment to the main event, Andy?

Andrew Serwer
Well, you know what, I'm just thinking Alexis, looking at all these different companies here
that Berkshire Hathaway really represents the American economy or Buffett's take on it.
All these different types of businesses, and it's really amazing that the company performs
so well, it outperforms the economy, even though it represents it. Meaning he has cherry
picked the best parts of the economy and invested in it. And his shareholders have done
very well that way.

Alexis Christof orous

Bloomberg Transcript

And I think that's part of the allure for people, who don't want to have to think about it so
much. They're kind of like – Buffet's sort of like their money manager, right, because you
said, he cherry picks, watches the investments, he is in it for the long haul. He says that all
the time. And he sort of demystifies investing a bit. He makes things simple and like we
said reachable for people, and interactive for people?

Andrew Serwer
Yeah. That's right. And you've never seen happier 40,000 people in your entire life. I
mean, these people – look at them, these people are all smiling. They're all in great
moods. And who can blame them because they've invested in Berkshire Hathaway, and
it's worked like a charm.

Alexis Christof orous
Yeah. And you know his subsidiaries here are – have definitely found a way to capitalize.
And as you know, a lot of the money that is collected here, some of that goes to charities
that the subsidiaries and that Warren Buffet care about. So they're giving back to the
community. And like Brooks Running Company for instance, we interviewed the CEO
yesterday came out with a sneaker, just for Warren Buffet. It has his face on it. So you can,
I guess be in Warren Buffet shoes. They are as closest as you can get to being in Warren
Buffet shoes. So they all tried to come up with something unique to their product that has
the Warren Buffet stamp on it.
All right. Andy, we're going to check in with you in just a few minutes. But we want to tell
everybody to welcome back to Yahoo! Finance's worldwide exclusive livestream of the
Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting. We have just moments to go before the big show.
And we got like – as we said earlier 40,000 people have descended on this center for

this weekend and the weather has not been cooperating. Heavy rain came into the
Omaha area overnight, but I could tell that people were still lining up to get into this hall
and there you see a live picture of inside the arena and here's Warren Buffett.

Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Good morning. I'm Warren Buffett. This is Charlie Munger. I'm the young one. You may
notice in the movie incidentally that Charlie is always the one that gets the girl. And he has
one explanation for that. But I think mine is more accurate, that as you know every mother
in this country tells her daughter at an early age, if you're choosing between two very old
and very rich guys, pick the one that's older.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'd especially – we're webcasting this for the first time. So I'd especially like to welcome
our visitors from over the world. We're having this meeting simultaneously translated in to
Mandarin and that poses certain problems for me and Charlie because I'm not sure how
sensible all our comments will come out once translated into Mandarin. I'm not so sure
how sensible they come out initially sometimes, but we're delighted to have people
around the world joining us. Now the drill of the day is that I'll make a couple of
introductions and we'll show a couple of slides.
And then we'll go on to questions from both, our two panels and from the audience. We
will rotate them. And we'll do that until about noon, actually about a quarter to 12:00, I'll
give you a run down on a bet that was made that we report on every year. But then I'll
also in connection with that explain and it ties in with it, what I really think is probably the
most important investment lesson in the world. So we'll have that about a quarter to
12:00. And I hope that keeps you around. And then, we'll break at noon for an hour for
lunch. We'll reconvene at 1 o'clock. We'll proceed until 3:30 with questions. We'll then
adjourn for 15 minutes and at 3:45 convene a formal meeting.
I'd like to just make a couple of introductions. I hope Carrie Sova is here. Do we have a
spotlight. Carrie puts this whole meeting together. There she is, wonder woman. Carrie
joined us as a receptionist about six years ago, and I just kept throwing more and more
problems at her. And she put together the 50th anniversary book which we've actually
expanded further this year. We have a revised edition. Charlie and I autographed a 100 of
them. We endorsed first of them (34:01) among the group being sold. And Carrie while
doing that, she also had a young baby girl, her second baby late in January. But then she's
going to hit to put on this annual meeting. It's a remarkable achievement and I really want
to thank her, it's been terrific.
Actually, we have one surprise guest. I think my youngest great grandchild who will be
about seven months old is also here today, and if he happens to break out crying a lot,
and don't let it bother you. It's just his mother's explaining to him my views on inherited
wealth. And we – we also have our directors with us, and they're here in the front row. I'll
introduce them if they'll stand when introduced. Withhold your applause no matter what –
how extreme the urge to applaud them individually. And when we're finished then you can
go wild.

FINAL

First of all, Howard Buffet, Steve Burke, Sue Decker, Bill Gates, Sandy Gottesman,
Charlotte Guyman, Tom Murphy, Ron Olson, Walter Scott and Meryl Witmer and that's our
wonderful growth.
We just have two slides to show you now. The first one is a preliminary summary figures
for the first quarter. And you will notice that insurance underwriting, these are after tax
figures by category, are down somewhat. The basic underwriting at GEICO is actually
improving. But we had some important hailstorms in Texas before the end of the quarter.
We've actually had some since the end of the quarter too. So, there were more cat losses
in the first quarter than last year.
The railroad earnings are down significantly, and railroad car loadings throughout the
industry, all of the major railroads were down significantly in the first quarter and probably
will continue to be down, almost certainly will continue to be down the balance of the year.
We have two companies which we added to the manufacturing service and retailing deal
Precision Castparts and Duracell, but they were added during the quarter. So there are full
earnings shown in these figures. In the other category we have – I don't want to get too
technical here and you should read the 10-K or 10-Q when it comes out next weekend.

Bloomberg Transcript

But when we borrow money and other currencies, the only currency we've done that with
is the euro, but we have a fair amount of money that we've borrowed in euros and the
nature of accounting is that the change in value, the foreign exchange change in value
each quarter is actually shown in interest expense. So as the euro goes up, we have a lot
of extra expense shown that way. As it's not a realized factor, but it moves from quarterto-quarter. And if euro goes down, it offsets interest expense.
So technicality to some extent, because we have lots of assets in Europe and they are
expressed in euros when they go up it does not go through the income account. It goes
directly to other comprehensive income. So I just – that figure which looks little unusual,
that's the reason for it.
And we always urge you to pay no attention to the figures below operating earnings.
They will bounce around from quarter-to-quarter and we make no attempt to manage
earnings in any way, that then will be smoother. We could do that very easily, but it'd be
ridiculous we make investment decision, solely on the basis of what we think the best
investment decision is, not on the basis of our (39:26) earnings in any quarter or in any
year. And in the first quarter, we exchanged – we completed the transaction that was
began over a year ago, whereby we exchanged our Procter & Gamble stock for cash and
for Duracell and that accounts for the – largely accounts for the large capital gain in the
quarter.
So those are the figures for the first quarter and then that to illustrate what we're sort of
all about here, I put up a second slide and I started this slide in 1999. The reason being
that at the end of 1998, we affected a large merger with Gen RE and at that point, we sort
of ended a different era. After 1998 merger with Gen RE we had little over a one million
five hundred and some thousand A equivalent shares out. And our shares up to that point,

Page 15 of 152



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2016-05-01

FINAL

we've increased the outstanding shares by more than 50% over the 30 some years
preceding that point.
Since that time, as I know here, we've only increased the number of shares over the next
17 years. We've only increased the shares outstanding by 8.2%. So these figures represent
a fairly unchanged share count since that point, whereas the share count has changed
quite a bit before. And as you know, in terms of operations I have told you that our goal at
Berkshire is to increase the normalized earnings – operating earnings every year. I have
said sometimes it will only be -turn out to be only a little bit and sometimes we can get
some fairly decent jumps. But that's the goal now.
Earnings will not increase every year, because there's such a thing as a business cycle and
in the times of recession, we're going to earn less money, obviously than in times when
things are much better overall. And on top of that we're heavily in an insurance business
and earnings there can be quiet rather low because of catastrophes and this chart shows
you what's happened to the operating earnings since that time, and again pointing out
that shares outstanding have gone up very little during that period.

Bloomberg Transcript

You'll notice in 2001, when we suffered significant insurance losses due to 9/11 we actually
were in the red, in terms of operating earnings. And you'll notice the figures are very
irregular. But over time by adding new subsidiaries, by further developing the businesses
we have, by bolt-on acquisitions by re-investment of retained earnings, the earnings have
moved up in very irregular fashion quite substantially.
I put in also the capital gains we've achieved through investments and derivatives and
they totaled some $32 billion after tax, close to $50 billion pre-tax. Those were not
important in any given year, those numbers can fall all over the place. The main advantage
from my standpoint in that $32 billion is it gives us money to buy other businesses. What
we really want to focus on but we hope is that figure are under operations five years or 10
years or 20 years from now, grow substantially partly because we retain earnings from
operations, and partly because our operations improve in their own profitability, and partly
because they make bolt-on acquisitions, partly because we have gains from securities
which enabled us to buy even more businesses.
But we don't manage, as you know we don't manage to try to get any given number from
quarter-to-quarter. We never make a forecast on earnings. We don't give out earnings
guidance. We think it's silly that, we do not have budgets at the parent company level.
Most of our subsidiaries have budgets but they don't submit them or they are not our
required to submit them, to headquarters. We just focus day-after-day, year-after-year,
decade-after-decade I'm trying to add earning power, sustainable in growing earning
power debenture.
So that's a quick summary. Now we'll move on to the questions, I'll just ask of the
audience that, you limit your question to question, the notable questions have a way of
sneaking in occasionally. But, so let's keep them to a single question. We'll start off with
the journalist group on my right and we will start off with Carol Loomis (44:56).

Q&A

FINAL

Q - Alexis Christof orous
Good morning. I'll make my very short little speech about the fact that the journalist and
analysts who have given Charlie and Warren, no hint on what they're going to ask. So they
will be learning for the first time what's that going to be also. This question comes from Eli
Moises (45:18). In your 1987 Letter to Shareholder, you commented on the kind of
companies Berkshire like to buy. Those that required only small amounts of capital. You
said "both because so little capital is required to run these businesses, they can grow
while concurrently making almost all of their earnings available for deployment in new
opportunities. Today the company has changed its strategy. It now investment in
companies that need tons of capital expenditures are overregulated and earn lower
returns on equity capital. Why did this happen?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Well, it's one of the problems of prosperity. The ideal business is one that takes no
capita, but yet grows. And there are a few businesses like that and we own some. But
we're not able – we love to find one that we could buy for to $10 billion to $20 billion or
$30 billion, that was not capital intensive and we may, but it's harder and that does hurt us
in terms of compounding earnings growth. Because obviously if you have a business that
grows and gives you a lot of money every year, and doesn't take it – it isn't required in its
growth. You get a double barrel effect from the earnings growth that occurs internally
without the use of capital and then you get the capital it produces to go and buy other
businesses.
And See's Candy was a good example of that I've used that. Back when the newspaper
business was good, our Buffalo Newspaper for example was a good example of that. The
Buffalo Newspaper was making at one-time $40 million a year and had no capital
requirement. So we could take that whole $40 million in going to go buy something else
with it. But capital – increase in capital acts as an anchor on returns in many ways. And one
of the ways is that it drives us into a – just in terms of availability, it drives us into
businesses that are much more capital intensive. You just saw a slide, for example, on
Berkshire Hathaway Energy where we just announced, just in the last couple of weeks, we
announced a $3.6 billion investment coming up in wind generation, and we pledged
overall to have $30 billion in renewables.
Anything that Berkshire Hathaway Energy does, anything that BNSF does takes lots of
money. We get decent returns on capital, but we don't get the extraordinary returns on
capital that we've been able to get in, in some of the businesses we've acquired that are
not capital intensive.
As I mentioned in the annual report, we have a few businesses that actually earn a 100% a
year on true invested capital, and clearly, that's a different sort of operation then
something like Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which may earn 11% or 12% on capital, and
that's a very decent return, but it's a different sort of animal than the business that are
very low capital intensive – intensity, Charlie?

Slowly and reluctantly.

In the early days, quite a few times we bought a business that was still producing at 100%
per annum on our rebate board and didn't require much reinvestment. If we had been
able to continue doing that we would have loved to do it. But when we couldn't we went
to Plan B. And Plan B is working pretty well. In many ways, I have gotten, so I sort of prefer
it. How about you, Warren?

That's true. When something is forced on you, you might as well prefer it. Yeah. They –
well, I mean we knew that was going to happen and the question is does it trigger -- does
it lead you from what looked a sensational result to a satisfactory result and we don't –
we're quite happy with a satisfactory result. The alternative would be to go back to
working with very tiny sums of money and that really hasn't gotten a lot of serious
discussion between Charlie and me.

Okay. From the analyst group, Jonathan Brandt.

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Thanks for coming.

Q - Jonathan Lawrence Brandt

{BIO 17988091 <GO>}

My first question is about Precision Castparts. Besides your confidence in its talented
CEO, Mark Donegan, what in particular do you like about their business that gave you the
confidence to pay a historically high multiple? Are there ways Precision can be even more
successful as essentially a private company? For instance, are there long-term
investments to support client programs or acquisitions that Precision can make now that
they couldn't realistically have done as a publicly traded entity?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. We completed the acquisition of Precision Castparts at the end of January this year.
We agreed to – we made the deal last August and you covered the most important asset
in your question, Mark Donegan, who runs Precision Castparts is an extraordinary
manager. I mean we've seen very – Charlie and I've seen a lot of managers over the
years, and I would almost rank Mark as one of a kind. I mean, he is doing an extremely
Page 18 of 152



FINAL

important work in terms of making – primarily making aircraft parts. I would say that there's
certainly no disadvantages to him to be working as a – and for that company to be a
subsidiary of Berkshire and not be a public company. And I think he would say – and I think
Charlie and I would agree with him that over time, there could be some significant
advantages. For one thing, he can spend 100% of his time now on figuring out better
things to do with aircraft engines. And it was always his first love to be thinking about that,
and he did spend most of his time, but he also had to spend some time explaining
quarterly earnings to analysts and perhaps negotiating bank lines and that sort of thing. So
his time, like all of our managers can be spent exactly on what makes the most sense to
them and their business.
Mark does not have to come ever to Omaha to put on some show for me in terms of
justifying a $1 billion acquisition or planned investment. He waste – he doesn't have to
waste his time on anything that isn't productive and running a public company you do
waste your time on quite a bit of stuff that isn't productive. So I would say we've taken the
main asset of Precision Cast and made it – made him in this case even more valuable to
the company.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of acquisitions, Precision's always made a number of them, but as being part of
Berkshire, there's really no limitations on what can be done. So there again, his canvas has
been broadened, enlarged with the acquisition by Berkshire. I see no downside
whatsoever again. If he needs capital, I've got an 800 number and he wasn't paying much
of a dividend before, but he doesn't have to pay any dividend now. And Precision Cast will
do better, better under Berkshire than it would have independently, although it would
have done very, very well independently. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, in the early days we used to make wise ass remarks and Warren would say, we
buy a business, (53:50) because sooner or later and maybe it will. And we did buy some
businesses like that in the early days and they were widely available. Of course we prefer
to do that. But the world has gotten harder and we had to learn doing new and more
powerful ways of operating.
A business like Precision Castparts requires a very superior management that's going to
stay superior for a long time. And we gradually have done more and more and more of
that and it's simply amazing how well it works. And I think to something extent we've
gotten almost as good banking superior managers as we were in the old days of banking
and operating our businesses.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. We would love to find. We won't be able to find them because they're very rare
birds. But we would love to find them, other three or four of a similar type to Precision
Cashparts where they forever are going to be producing something that where quality is
enormously important, where the customers depend very heavily on them when there is
contracts that extend over many years, and where people don't simply just take the
whole bid in order to get this gadget of one sort or another. It's very important that, that
you have somebody there that has enormous skill, running the business and their

Hi. Good morning. My name is Gaspal (55:44). I'm Spanish, and I come from London. I
admire you both in many ways, but I would like to know that when looking backwards,
what would you have differently in life in your search for happiness?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, I'm 85, and I can't imagine anybody any happier than himself. By action or whatever, I
mean I'm certainly here eating exactly what I like to eat, doing in life exactly what I love to
do with people I love. So it really doesn't get any better than that. And I did decide fairly
early in life that my favorite employer was myself. And that – I think that – I manage to
avoid really aggravation of almost any sort. Really, if you or those around you that you love
have health problems or something, I mean that is a real tragedy, and there is not much
you can about it, but accept it. But Charlie and I have really been blessed. I mean here
Charlie is 92, 85 and he is doing everyday something that he finds fascinating. He – I think
he probably finds what he is doing at 92 is interesting, it's fascinating, is rewarding,
socially productive, any period you can pick in his life.
So we've been extraordinary lucky, we've been we're lucky, it's a partnership. It's more fun
doing things as a partnership. So I've no complaints. I will be very surely should be to

don't think I would have started with a textile company. Charlie.

Well looking back, I don't regret that I didn't make more money or become better known

Q - Alexis Christof orous
This question comes from Solomon Akerman (58:33), who is in Frankfurt Germany. He
wants to know why Berkshire has significantly sold down their holdings in Munich Re, which
is the world's biggest reinsurance company based in Germany, while sticking with the
reinsurance operations within Berkshire, like Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance and General
Re. Would you reduce exposure to Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance and General Re if
there were listed companies and he is hoping that this can bring out some of your insights
as to what's happening in the reinsurance business right now.

Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity

FINAL

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah, we – I said in the annual report that I thought it was very likely that the reinsurance
business would not be as good in the next 10 years as it has been in the last 10 years. I
may be wrong on that. That's just a judgment based on seeing the competitive dynamics
of the reinsurance business now versus 10 years or 20 years ago. Both Munich – we sold
our entire holdings which were substantial of Munich Re and Swiss Re. We owned about
3% of Swiss Re and we owned more than 10% of Munich Re. And last year, we sold those
two holdings. They're fine companies. They're well-managed companies like the people
that run them. I think their business, the business of the reinsurance companies generally
is less attractive for the next 10 years, than it has been for the last 10 years.
In part that's because what's happened to interest rates. A significant portion of what you
earn in the insurance comes from investment of the flows, and both of those companies,
and for that matter almost all of the reinsurance industry is somewhat more restricted in
what they can do with their flow, because they don't have this huge capital cushion that
Berkshire has, and also because they don't have as great amount of unrelated earning
power that Berkshire has.

Bloomberg Transcript

Berkshire has more leeway in what it can do, simply because it does have capital, that's
many times what its competitors have, and it also has earning power coming from a
whole variety of non – of unrelated areas, unrelated to insurance. So it was not a negative
judgment in any way on those two companies. It was not a negative judgment on their
managements, but it was at least a mildly negative judgment on the reinsurance business.
Now we have the ability of Berkshire to actually rearrange to a degree, we are certainly
affected by industry factors. But we have more flexibility in modifying business models
and we've operated that way over the years in insurance generally and in particularly in
reinsurance. So Munich, Swiss, all the major reinsurance companies except for us, it's
pretty well tied to a given type of business model. They don't really have as many options
in terms of where capital gets deployed. They have to continue down the present path.
And I think they'll do fine. But I don't think they will do as fine in the next 10 years as they
have in the last 10 years.
And I don't think if we play the same game as we were playing in the last 10 years, we
would do as well. But we do have considerably more flexibility in terms of how we conduct
all of our insurance operations. But particularly in reinsurance, we have an extra string to
our bow that the rest of the industry doesn't have.
The amount of capital that's come in to the reinsurance business, it is no fun, running a
traditional reinsurance company and having money come in, particularly if you are in
Europe and that money come in and look around you for investment choices and find out
that great many of the things that you were buying a few years ago now have negative
yields. That the whole idea of flow is it is supposed to the invested at a positive rate and a
fairly substantial positive rate and that game has been over for a while and looks like it will
be at least on a track, if not terrible for a considerable period in the future. Charlie?

FINAL

There is a lot of new capacity in reinsurance, and there is a lot of very heavy competition.
A lot of people from finance have come over into reinsurance, and all the old competitors
remain too. That's different from Precision Castparts where most of the customers will be
totally crazy to hire some other supplier, because Precision Castparts is so much more
reliable and so much better. Of course we like the place with more competitive
advantage. We're learning.
B, to put in terms of economic one-on-one and then basically in reinsurance supply has
gone up and demand has not gone up. And some of the supply is driven by investment
managers who would like to establish something offshore where they don't have to pay
taxes, and reinsurance is sort of the easiest what you might call beard, behind which to
actually engage in money management in a friendly tax jurisdiction. And you can set up a
reinsurance operation with very few people by taking large chunks of what brokers may
offer. It's not the greatest reinsurance in the world, and a couple of the operations that
have done that have proven that, that segment to be right.
But nevertheless, it is a very, very easy way to have a disguised investment operation in a
friendly tax jurisdiction. But that becomes supply in the reinsurance field, and supply has
gone up relative to demand and it looks to me like that will continue to be the case. And
couple that with the poor returns on float. And it's not as good business as it was. Now
we'll talk to an insurance man about it, Chris Gallon (1.05:19).

Q - Alexis Christof orous
Thank you. In terms of growth and profitability, GEICO really got looked by Progressive
Direct over the last year. 2015 Progressive Direct's auto business grew deposit count by
9.1%, GEICO only 5.4%, and in terms of profitability the combined ratio at Progressive was
a 95.1 and GEICO's was 98.0. Is this evidence that Progressive's investments in technology
like Snapshot, investments at GEICO has spurned is it making a time – and making a
difference in a time of difficult loss trends. Why is GEICO suddenly losing to Progressive
Direct?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, I was – that over the last – I forgot what year it was, we passed Progressive and
what year it was we passed Allstate, but GEICO's growth rate in the first quarter was not
as high as in the past couple of first quarters. But it was – it was quite satisfactory. Now the
first quarter is by far the best quarter for growth. But last year both frequency, how often
people had accidents and severity which is the cost per accident in other words, how
much those accidents cost you. Both of those went up quite suddenly and substantially
and Progressive's figures show that they were hit by that less than Allstate and GEICO
and some others.
But I don't think you'll see necessary those same trends this year. The – it's an interesting
thing last year, the first time in – I don't know how many years the number of deaths in
auto accidents per 100 million miles went up. Now if you go back to the mid-1930s, there
are almost 15 people killed per hundred million miles driven. It got down to just – just
slightly over one – from 15 to one. You had almost as many – you had roughly as many
people killed in auto accidents in mid-1930s, about 30,000, 32,000, 33,000 a year as
Page 22 of 152

FINAL

we last year or the year before, when people drove almost 15 times as many miles. Cars
have gotten far, far, far, far safer. And it's a good thing, because if we had the same rate
of deaths from auto accidents, as we had in the 1930s relative to the miles driven, we
would have over a half of million people die last year from auto accidents, and so the
figure closer to 40,000.
But last year for the first time, there was more driving, and I think there was more
distracted driving. So you really had this uptick in frequency and – and more important in
severity. FICO has adjusted its rates as I mentioned – my own prediction would be that the
underwriting margins at Fico will be better this year than last year, although you never
know when the catastrophes are coming on at mid-March and April we've got lot of cat
activity. I made a bet a long time ago on number one, on the GEICO model versus the
Progressive model and as I say that were significantly ahead of us in volume a few years
back and we passed them and we passed Allstate, and as I put in the annual report, I
hope on my 100th birthday that the GEICO people announce to me that they've passed
State Farm but I have to do my share on that too by getting to a 100. So, we'll see what
happens on that particular one. Charlie?

Greetings to all of you from the mid-west of Europe. I am Norman Rentrop (1.10:40) from
Bonn, Germany, a shareholder since 1992. My question is about the future of
salesmanship in our companies. Warren, you have always demonstrated a heart for direct
selling. When we met you in the midst of a tornado warning in the barber shop, you
immediately offered to write insurance for us.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

That's true. They were all huddled down in the barber shop. There wasn't going to be any
tornado. So I thought if they give me a dollar, I can go upstairs and if anything happens
(1.11:27) if we get $1 million or something of that sort.

Now we see with a rise of Amazon.com and others, a shift from push marketing to pull
marketing from millions of catalogs having been sent out in the past to now consumers
searching on what they are looking for. What is your take on how this shift from push to
pull marketing will affect our companies?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, the development you referred to is huge. I mean really huge. And it isn't just
Amazon. But Amazon is a huge part of it, and what they've accomplished in a fairly short
period of time and continue to accomplish is remarkable. The number of satisfied
customers they've developed and we don't make any decision involving even the
manufacturing of goods, the retailing, whatever it is without thinking on and hard about
what the world will look like in 5 years or 10 years or 20 years with that powerful trend,
really hugely powerful trend that you just described.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we're not – we don't look at that as something where we're going to try and meet
them at their own game. They are better than we are at that. And so Charlie and I are not
going to outbase those basis by a long short. But we're going to think about that. It does
not worry us obviously with the Precision Cast. It doesn't worry us in terms of the
overwhelming majority of our businesses. But it is a huge economic trend that 20 years
ago it was not on anybody's radar screen and lately it's been on everybody's radar
screen, and many of them, including us in the few areas, have not figured the way to
either participate in it or to counter it.
GEICO's a good example of a company that in an industry that had to adjust to change,
and some people made the change better than others. We were slow on the Internet.
The phone had worked so well for us, this traditional advertising, and the phone had
worked so well. But there is always a resistance to think about new possibilities. When we
saw what was happening on the Internet, we jumped in with both feet with mobile and
whatever, but there are capital – the nature of capitalism is, somebody is always trying to
figure out – if you have got some good business they're always trying to figure out how to
take it away from you and improve on it. And the effect I would say just of Amazon, but
others that are playing the same game, the effect on industry, the full effect is far from
having been seen. I mean it is a big, big force and it will – it already has disrupted plenty of
people and it will disrupt more.
I think Berkshire – I think Berkshire is quite well situated. For one thing, one big advantage
we have is we didn't ever see ourselves as starting out as one industry. I mean, we didn't
go into – we went into department stores. But we didn't think of ourselves as department
store guys or we didn't think of ourselves as steel guys or tire guys or anything else. So
we just thought of ourselves as having capital to allocate.
If you start with a given industry focus and you spend your whole time working on a way to
make a better tire or whatever it maybe, I think it's hard to have the flexibility of mind that
you have if you just think you have a large – hopefully large and growing pile of capital,
and trying to figure out what is the next best – best next move that you can make with
that capital, and I think we do have a real advantage that way. But I think – I think it's all

about -I think Amazon's got a real advantage too, and then this intense focus on having
hundreds of millions of generally very happy customers getting – very, very happy
customers getting very quick delivery of something that they – they want to get promptly
and they want to shop the way they shop, and they own a bunch of shopping malls or
something like that, I would be thinking probably hard about what they might look like 10
years or 20 years from now. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

I would say that we failed so thoroughly in retailing when we were young that we pretty
well avoided the worst troubles. I think that Berkshire has been helped by the Internet.
The help of GEICO has been enormous, and it's contributed greatly to the huge increase
in market share and our biggest retailers are so strong that they're – they'll be among the
last people to have troubles from Amazon.

Q - Alexis Christof orous
Thank you, Warren. Great to see you today. Got a lot of questions on this particular topic
and this question is a particularly pointed one. Warren, for the last several years at this
meeting, you've been asked about the negative health effects of Coca-Cola products
and you've done a masterful job of dodging the question by telling us how much coke you
drink personally. Statistically you may be the exception. According to a peer review study
by Tufts University, soda and sugary drinks may lead to a 184,000 deaths among adults
every year. The study found that sugar sweetened beverages contributed to a 133,000
deaths from diabetes, 45,000 deaths from cardiovascular disease, 6,450 deaths from
cancer.
Another shareholder wrote in about coke, noted that you declined to invest in the
cigarette business on ethical grounds, despite one saying "it was a perfect business
because it cost a penny to make sell it for a dollar, it's addictive, and there is fantastic
brand loyalty." Again removing your own beverage consumption from the equation please
explain directly why we Berkshire Hathaway shareholders should be proud to own Coke.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah, I think that people confuse the amount of calories consumed. I mean I happen to
elect to consume about 700 calories a day from Coca-Cola. So I'm about one quarter
Coca-Cola, roughly I'm done. Not sure which quarter and I'm not sure we want to pursue
that question. But I think if you decide that sugar generally is something that the human
race shouldn't have, I think the average person consumes something around 150 pounds
of dry white sugar a year 125 pounds. I mean, what's in Coca-Cola largely or where the
calories come from is sugar. I elect to get my 2,600 calories or 2,700 calories a day from
things that make me feel though when I eat them. And that's been my sole test.

It wasn't the test that my mother necessarily thought it was greater, my grandfather, but
there are over 1.9 billion 8-ounce servings of some Coca-Cola drink however, enormous
range of products. I mean if you would recall Coke, Diet Coke, Coke Zero and that sort of
thing, but they have literally thousands of products. 1.9 billion that's 693.500 million 8ounce servings a year, except there is a leap year, that's almost a 108-ounce servings per
capita for seven billion people in the world every year and that's been going on since
1886. And I would find quite spurious the fact that somebody says if you are eating 3,500
or so calories a day and you're consuming 2,700 or 2,800 and some of the 3,500 is
Coca-Cola related, any particular obesity related illnesses on the Coca-Cola you drink.
You have the choice of consuming more than you use, I mean and I make a choice to get
700 calories in this and I like fudge a lot, peanut butter. And I'm a very, very, very happy
guy and I don't know, I think and I'm serious about this, I think if you're happy every day,
it's maybe hard to measure, but I think we're going to live longer as well. So there may be
a compensating factor.

Bloomberg Transcript

I really wish, I had a twin and that twin had eaten broccoli his entire life, and we both
consume the same number of calories. I know I would have been happier and I think the
odds are fairly good I would have lived longer. I think Coca-Cola is a marvelous product. I
mean if you consume 3,500 to 4,000 calories a day and live a normal life in terms of your
metabolism, something is going to go wrong with your body at some point. But if you
keep – I think if you balance out the calories so that you don't become obese I am not
seeing evidence that convinces me that I'll make it – it will be more likely I reach 100, if I
certainly switch to water and broccoli.
Incidentally, a friend of mine, RJ Mellor (1.22:56), a remarkable man, born about a 100
miles from here west, eighth child, near Shelby, Nebraska, he said Shelby's population
was 596 and it never changed because every time some girl had a baby, a guy had to
leave the town. It was a very stable. But RJ went out to be President of Ford Motor
Company from this farm near Shelby, and he had his 100th birthday on March 4 of this
year. So I went out to see RJ for his birthday on March 4 and RJ told me that there were
10,000 men in the United States that would live to be 100 or greater and there were
45,000 women that would live 100 or greater.
So I came back and I checked that on the Internet, I went through the census figure and
sure enough that is the ratio 10,000 men over 100 roughly and 45,000 women. So if you
really want to improve your longevity prospects, I mean the guy in my position, you have a
sex change. You're 4.5 times more likely to get to be 100. That sounds like one of those
studies that people put out. It's just a matter of fact. I think I will have Charlie go first on
that one. Charlie you have any comments.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, I like the peanut butter. But I drink a lot of diet coke and, I think the people who ask
questions like that one always make one ghastly error that really inexcusable. They
measure the detriment without considering the advantage. That's really stupid. But that's
like saying we should give up air travel through airlines because 100 people die a year in
air crashes or something. That would be crazy. The benefit is worth the risk and if every

person has to have about eight or ten glasses of water every day to stay alive, then it's
pretty cheap and sensible and improves life to add a little extra flavor to your water and a
little stimulation and little calories, if you want to eat that way. There are huge benefits to
humanity and it's worth having some disadvantage.
We ought to have almost alive (1.25:27), sorry, I'm sounding like Donald Trump, but these
people shouldn't be allowed to say the defects without citing the offsetting advantage.
It's immature and stupid.

Bloomberg Transcript

Warren, with both coal-fired and natural gas plants continuing to generate around twothirds of nation's electricity and renewables accounting for less than 10%, there remains
plenty of room for growth. At this point Berkshire Energy, which has invested heavily in the
segment, is one of the nation's largest producers of both wind and solar power and yet
still it only generates around one-third of its overall capacity from renewables. As you
noted earlier, Mid-American recently committed another $3.6 billion to wind production,
which should lift the amount of electricity it generates from wind to 85% by 2020.
You also have the company overall pledging to have around $30 billion renewables longer
term. The recent renewal, both the wind and solar energy tax credits has made this kind
of investment more economically viable and should clear the path for future investments.
Eliminating coal-fired plants looks to be the main priority, but natural gas-fired plants are
also fossil fuel driven and are exposed to the vagaries of energy prices. Is the end game
here for Berkshire Energy to get a 100% of its generation capacity converted over
renewables and one of risks maybe awards associated with that effort, after all the
company operates in a highly regulated industry where rates are driven by an effort to
keep customer costs low while still providing adequate returns for the utilities.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah, I think implicit in what you say is that we do – any decision we make, including the
one that we just showed on the – during the movie to on any decision about new
generation, changes in generation has to go through a what's usually called the Public
Utility Commission. They may have different names in a few states. But the utility industry
is overwhelmingly regulated at the state level and we cannot make changes that are not
approved by the Public Utility Commission. We've had more problems for example in
bringing in renewables in our Western utility PacifiCorp because it's in effect regulated by
six states. I believe in six states and they don't necessarily agree on how the costs and
benefits should be divided if we put in a bunch of renewables and we have to follow their
instructions.
I was just being marvelous about encouraging, I mean at every level, I mean the consumer
groups, the Governor, you name it. They have seen the benefits and I was literally true
that we have one major competitor called Alliant and they have not either been able to – I
don't know the reasons, but they've not pursued renewables the way we have.

FINAL

So our rates are considerably lower than theirs. And if you look at their budget
projections, although they're substantially higher rates than we have now, they won't need
a rate increase within a year or so. And with our latest expansion, we have said that we will
not need a rate increase till 2029 at the earliest; that's 13 years off.
So there've been great benefits if you have regulation that works with you on that. But it is
a determination that is made at the state level. Now the federal government has
encouraged in a major way the development of renewables by this production tax credit
which currently amounts to about $0.023 per kilowatt hour. We would not have the
renewable generation that we have if it hadn't been for the fact that that building of those
projects is subsidized by the federal government because the benefits of reducing solar
emissions or carbon emissions are worldwide and therefore it's being the proper that
citizenry as a whole should participate in subsidizing the cost of reducing those emissions.
And that is encouraged, in fact, it's allowed; things like that have happened in Iowa as
well. But the degree to which the renewables replace primarily coal, although there is
plenty of emissions connected with natural gas to be the trace all the way through will
depend on governmental policy. And I think – so far I think it's been quite sensible in
encouraging, having the cost borne by society as a whole in terms of reduced tax
revenues and having the benefits which is less CO2 under the atmosphere. We also
broadly – they are not just limited to the people of Iowa when they built that. That's a
benefit that accrues to the world. I think you'll see continued change, it will vary by – by
jurisdiction and we would hope – we've got the capital, we've got lots of taxes, federal
taxes paid in our consolidated returns, so we're in a particularly advantageous position to
take advantage of massive investments that companies with limited tax appetites couldn't
handle. But I think you see us be a very big player, but governmental policy is going to be
the major driver.
Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yes, I think we're doing way more than our share of shifting to renewable energy, and
we're charging way lower energy prices to our utility customers than other renewable. If
the rest of the world were behaving the way we are, it would be a much better world. I will
say this about the subject though and that is – I think the people who worry about climate
change is the major trouble of earth, don't have my view. I think that we – I like all those
shifting to renewables, but I have a different reason. I want to conserve the hydrocarbons.
Because eventually I think we're going to use every drop, humanity, for chemical
feedstocks, and so, I'm in their camp, but I got a different reason.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

One thing you find – might find kind of interesting, Nebraska has not done much with wind
power and – well maybe three miles from – two miles from where we're sitting right
across the river, people are buying their electricity cheaper in (91:02) right across the river
than they are in Omaha. And yet Omaha, Nebraska is entirely a public power state, so
there is no stockholders who have to have any earnings, the bonds are issued on a taxexempt basis and yet electricity is considerably cheaper right across the river.

And the wind blowing doesn't just start at the Missouri river, I mean it comes across
Nebraska and that wind could be captured. And so far it really hasn't and the real irony is
that because our electricity is so much cheaper in Iowa, you have these massive server
farms, people like Google, it become a tech-haven for these operations that just gobble
up electricity and Iowa has gotten plant after plant after plant and job after job after job.
And increased property tax I mean gotten more property tax revenues and that's being
done – the Google's server is probably seven or eight miles from here and it's located in
Iowa, because that we have cheap wind generated electricity and it's creating jobs, it's
fascinating. But Nebraska has prided itself on public power that was originated back, I
believe in the 1930s when George Norris was a very powerful senator here and it's been
a source of pride, but lately it's been a source of cost too.
Okay. Shareholders section three.

Good morning, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger. My name is Adam Bergman; I'm with Sterling
Capital in Virginia Beach.

Bloomberg Transcript

In your 2008 shareholder letter, you said, derivatives are dangerous. They have made it
almost impossible for investors to understand and analyze our largest commercial banks
and investment banks. So, my question for you is, how do you analyze and value
companies like Bank of America Merrill Lynch and other commercial banks that Berkshire
has investments in relative to their significant derivative exposures? Thanks.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yes. Derivatives do complicate the problem very dramatically. Now they are moving away
to being collateralized which helps, but there is no question that if you ask me to describe
the derivative position of the BoA for example, I would know that they have done a
conscious job and worked hard and properly evaluating, but the great danger in
derivatives is that there is a discontinuity. If there is no discontinuity, you probably don't
have much of a problem assuming that you get mark to market and collateralize and so.
But if the system stops for a while – the system stopped after 9/11 for three days or four
days, it stopped at the time of World War I, they closed the New York Stock Exchange for
many months. They debated closing the stock exchange very seriously the day after
October 19, 1987, and it was – there were a lot of people that wanted to close it, but on
that Tuesday morning it looked like it was about to stop, but it continued.
But if you had a – if you have a major cyber nuclear, chemical, biological attack on the
country which will certainly happen at some point, if you have a major discontinuity, then
you'll have a lot f problems, a lot of problems, but you will also – when things reopen, you
will find there can be enormous gaps in things that you thought were fully protected by
collateral and that sort of netting arrangements and that type of things. So I regard very
large derivative positions are dangerous. We inherited modest size position at Gen Re
and in a benign market we lost about $400 million, just trying to unwind it with no
pressure on us whatsoever, so I do think it continues to be a danger to the system.

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yes. Charlie found one position when – he's on the audit committee of Salomon, I think it
was mismarked by $20 million, and I actually buy it, haven't since. I do know of one
incredibly mismarked position doesn't affect any of our operations. But it almost staggers
the mind to know the way that position has marked and you can only come to the
conclusion that some trader, somehow got influenced whoever did market (96:56)
probably just influenced someone or they didn't know, some of these things get so
complicated, they are very hard to evaluate.

Bloomberg Transcript

That's the kind that have the most profit in them usually, so they were quite enthusiastic
about those when we were selling them. They can be extraordinary hard to mark. And like
I say, I know one that's so much marketed that would blow your mind and the auditors, I
don't think are necessary capable of holding that behavior. In fact, it is very interesting.
There is really four big auditing firms and obviously their auditing companies were, there
is a derivative position and their auditing company aid us on one side of the transaction in
their auditing company. On the other side of the transaction in some cases, it's the same
auditor, and I will guarantee you that there are plenty of times when they march on the –
what they're attesting to are significantly different, which would be an interesting exercise
to pursue in terms of checking those numbers out.
Derivatives are still dangerous in large quantities and we have – we would not do them on
a collateralized basis, because if that was a discontinuity, I don't know exactly where we
would end up and I'm never going to get us in a position where we could be – have
money demanded of us and not be able to fulfill it with ease and with me sleeping well.
So, we won't engage and that we've got some in runoff. So far we've made money and
had the use of money for a decade or more and it's been very attractive for us, but that
does not entice me at all into doing any derivative transactions that would involve
collateral and collateral was not required.
It's still a potential, a time-bomb and the system anything where discontinuities and
basically that means closing up, stopping trading markers from functioning, anything
where discontinuities can exist, can be real poison in markets.
Kuwait, some years ago went to a very delayed system on settlement of stock purchases.
So they didn't have to settle up for six months or thereabouts sand and it caused all kinds
of problems because you've got an IOU from somebody for six months and if you got
zillions of those, a lot of trouble can ensue.
So, I agree with your general – I'm not in the least trouble by our Bank of America
investment nor are Wells Fargo, we added the Wells Fargo when – our Bank of America
position right now is a preferred stock, but we're very likely to exercise the warrants on
that. On the other hand, there are a great number of banks in the world. If you take the

wouldn't you say that Charlie?

Well, we're on the awkward position where I think we'll probably make about $20 billion of

different from the banks. We would really prefer if those derivatives have been illegal for
us to buy. We will be doing better for our country.

Q - Alexis Christof orous
This question relates to something that Warren briefly said earlier today. The question
comes from Lynn Palmer (100:39) who is just finishing her freshman year in a Houston,
Texas high school. My question, she says, concerns the float generated by Berkshire's
insurance companies. In Mr. Buffet's 2015 annual letter, he said that the large amount of
float that Berkshire processes allows the company to significantly increase its investment
income. But what happens when interest rates decline? If the U.S. were to implement
negative interest rates in same way with the Eurozone and Japan have done, how would
Berkshire be affected?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yes, well, some of our floats actually exists in Europe and where we have the problem of
negative interest rates on very high grade short term and maybe in even medium term
bonds and obviously anything that reduces the value of having money is going to affect
Berkshire because we're always going to have a lot of money. We – because we have so
much capital, and so many sources of earning power, we have the ability quite properly to
use our flow in to a certain degree and ways that most insurance companies can't think
about.
So, we can find things to do, but some actually – we've got $50 billion-odd of short-term
government securities now and we're going to get another $8.3 billion in all likelihood
early in June when our (102:30) so, we'll back over $60 billion again very soon. And so, we
have got $60 billion out, that's out at – say a 0.25% (102:40) 0.25% and minus 0.25%, it's
not that great, I mean it's almost as painful as $60 million out at a 0.25% to have it out in a
negative rate.
Float is not worth as much to insurance companies now as it was 10 years ago or 15 years
ago and that's true at Berkshire. I think it's worth considerably more to us than it is to the
typical insurance company, because I think we have a broader range of options as to what
to do with it. But there is no question about it that having a lot of money around now, this
is not just a problem for insurance companies, it's a problem for retire, it is the problem
for anybody that's stuck with fixed dollar investments and finds that their income now is a
(103:32) in Europe, perhaps a negative rate and that was not something in their calculation
at all 15 years ago.

We love the idea however of the increasing our float, I mean that money has been very
useful to us over time. It's useful to us today even under present conditions, and it's like
they will be very useful to us in the future, it's shown us a liability, but it's actually a huge
asset.

Testing. The railroad industry seems right now to be suffering from exposure to some of
the weakest parts of the economy with volume declines of varying magnitudes in coal, oil,

relatively weak of late. How much of the weakness is cyclical, how much is secular. In last

Well, I would – certainly a decline in coal, which is very important commodity, is about 20%
of revenues; that's secular. Now, there is other factors that may cause the line of decline
to jiggle around. We had a very mild winter and we went into the winter with utilities
coming unusual amounts of coal and ironically part of the reason for that was that our
service a year before than that and they've gotten role on coal. So, they compensated by
bringing in more than they needed, just to catch up and because the weather was mild,
electricity use was poor in the winter time. And so they continue at this point to have
considerably more coal on hand than they would like.
So, they are not only trying to under order what they will be using, and that has a little
effect. But the decline in coal for sure is secular and at 20% of revenues that's a significant
factor. But – and it's true that the market generally got very enthused about railroad
section year or two of those, so they sold awful lot and now that people are seeing that
(106:36) down and earnings are down in some places, the equity valuations have come
down.
We don't – we love the fact we own BNSF. We think we bought it at an attractive price.
We'd love to be able to buy a second thing exactly right at that price, which in the second
we'd even tell you little bit more probably, but we don't markup and down our wholly
owned businesses, based on stock market valuations. Obviously stock market valuations
are some factor in our thinking, but we are not marking our wholly owned businesses to

market, because we're going to hold them forever and we regard to BNSF as a very good
business to hold forever, but it will lose coal volume and they lose in other areas, but it will
gain in other areas. It's a terrific and valuable asset, and it will run a lot of money this year,
but it won't earn as much money as it earned last year.

My question is for my children watching our home today and children in the audience; how
should they look at stocks, when every day in the media, they see companies (109:13) go
IPO they are dilutive and they see a lot of – very short-term spend, the cycle is getting

friendships and this generally behaving better citizens – it's a great objective and Andy
makes it easy for them to do. So, I – on his behalf, I accept your comments.
You don't have to really worry about what's going on an IPOs or people making money,
people win lotteries every day, but there is no reason to have that effect, you shouldn't
be jealous of that, I mean, it looks great. They want to do mathematically unsound things
and one of them occasionally gets lucky and they put the 1% on television and the million
that contributed the winnings with a big slice taken out for the state, don't get on that, is
nothing to worry about it, just all you have to do is to figure out what make sense and you
don't – and you look at buying, when you buy a stock, you get yourself in the metal frame
a mind that you're buying a business and if you don't look at a quote on after five years,
that's fine, you don't get a quote on your farm every day or every week or every month,
you don't get it on your apartment house if you own one, if you own a McDonald's
franchise, you don't get a quote every day.
You want to look at your stocks as businesses and think about their performance as
business, think about what you pay for them as you would think about buying a business
and let the rest of the world go its own way, you don't want to get into a stupid game just
because it's available and I'm going to say a little bit more about that close to the break,

This question comes from a shareholder named Lisa Cantlay (113:28) in Singapore, and
this has to do with NV Energy's issue with solar energy in Nevada. Can the German help
this environmentally conscious shareholders understand why NV Energy has lobbied for
new rules in Nevada that make it prohibitive for households to use solar energy? Is there
is a good reason that we haven't yet heard about, and can the Chairman or Vice
Chairman share their views on whether there is a need to implement an environmental
social and governance policy on Berkshire investments going forward? I understand that
Berkshire Hathaway typically lets the underlying operating companies and CEOs manage
their own policies autonomously, but Berkshire's board implements better environment
and protection policies going forward.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well. The public utility and the pricing policies everything of – in Nevada as well as other
places but they're determined by a public utility commission. So there I believe three
commissioners that decide what's proper. The situation in Nevada is that in terms of
rooftop power was that of – for the last few years if you had a solar project on your roof,
you could sell back excess power you generated to the grid at a price that was far, far, far
above what we as a utility could buy it for elsewhere. So you could sell it back, we'll say at
roughly $0.10 a kilowatt hour. And about 17,000 maybe a few more now, about 17,000
people had rooftop installations.
Now they got – there were federal credits involved, but those usually got sold to other
people in terms of tax credits, so they were being subsidized by the federal government
and that encouraged solar generation as it's encouraged us to do solar generation and
wind generation as well. But the people who had these 17,000 rooftop installations were
selling back to the grid at $0.10 roughly a kilowatt hour. Energy we could purchase or
produced either by purchased elsewhere too per $0.035 or thereabouts. So 99% of our
consumers were being asked to subsidize the 1% that has solar units by paying them a
significantly – triple the market price basically of what we could otherwise buy electricity
sold to the 99%.
So, and then it's just a question whether you wish to have the 99% subsidize the 1% and
the Public Utility Commission in Nevada they had originally let this small amount of rooftop
Page 35 of 152



FINAL

Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2016-05-01

solar generation be allowed as an experiment with this roughly $0.10 rebate and they
decided that they do not believe that the 99% should be subsidizing a 1%. There is no
question that for solar to be competitive, just like wind, it needs subsidization, costs are
not yet at a level where it becomes competitive with natural gas for example and who
pays the subsidy just to be a real question if you want to encourage people to use
renewables and in general federal government has done it through tax subsidies, which
mean taxpayers generally throughout the county subsidize it and the Public Utility
Commission in Nevada decided – after seeing this experiment they decided that it was
not right for a million – well, over a million customers to be buying electricity at a price
that's subsidized, these 17,000 people, and therefore increased the prices of electricity
for the million.
And that question of who subsidizes renewables and how much is going to be a political
question for a long time to come. And I personally think that if society is the one that's
benefiting from the lack of reduction of greenhouse gases, that society should pick up the
tab. And I don't think that somebody sitting in a house in some place in Nevada, we'll call it
Las Vegas, but it could be other cities because we serve most of Nevada should be
picking up the subsidy for their neighbor and the Public Utility Commission agrees with
that.
I think we have Greg Abel who NV Energy as a subsidiary of an American – of Berkshire
Hathaway Energy, Greg, was there anything you want to add? Can we get a spotlight
down here-

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gregory Edward Abel

{BIO 1416724 <GO>}

I think it's on now. So as usual Warren, you summarized it extremely well. When we think
Nevada, it's exactly as you described. I would just add a few things, one as you touched
on earlier, we absolutely support renewables. So, we start with the fundamental concept
that we are for solar, but as you highlighted, we want to purchase renewable energy at
the market rate, not at a heavily subsidized rate that 1% of the customers will benefit from
and harm the other 99%. And it goes back to being as fundamental as this, if you take as –
as you touched on a working family in Nevada who can't afford the rooftop unit and you
ask them, do you want to subsidize your neighbor, that 1%? The answer is clearly, no.
At the same time, we're absolutely committed to Nevada utilizing renewable resources
and absolutely proud of what our team is doing. By 2019, we'll have eliminated or retired
76% of our coal units and be replacing it with solar energy, so we are on a great path
there. Thank you. And we'll just encourage our team and with the work of the
Commission, and obviously led by the state will head down a great path. Thank you.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yes, the projectionist will put up slide seven. It will give you a view of what the situation is
and this comes to all of our Berkshire Hathaway Energy operations and you can see in the
20-year period, we'll have a 57% reduction. You wouldn't want a 100% reduction
tomorrow, believe me, the lights would be off all over the country, but it's moving at a fast
pace, but you do – you want to be sure that you treat fairly the people involved in this
because somebody pays the cost of electric generation. And I do think that if you're doing
Page 36 of 152

something that's to benefit the planet, and it's important to be done, but that you have
the cost be assessed for that, not on a specific person who is I mean trouble perhaps
meeting ends meet in their job, and obviously, if you got over a million customers in that,
a lot of them are struggling, a lot of them are doing fine too. But they are not the ones in
my view to subsidize the person who could afford to put a solar unit in.

Over the past year, we've learned – perhaps I've learned that Berkshire's result is
somewhat influenced by oil markets than I previously appreciated. Revenues at the railway
company and some of Berkshire's manufacturing businesses were negatively impacted
and arguably low gas prices hurt (122:33) lost ratio, yet during this year, Berkshire invested
in Phillips 66, Kinder Morgan and even PCP has revenues associated with the oil and gas
industries. And I know Berkshire wouldn't make a bet on a commodity like oil, but is

Hi.

Q - Alexis Christof orous
I'm Ken Martin (124:37), I'm an MBA student from the Tuck School at Dartmouth. My
question is about college tuition and the problem of rising student debt balances. In the
past, prominent philanthropists have founded institutions that are now prominent
research universities in our country. Why is this not a bigger of part of today's philanthropic
debate, the founding of new colleges? Would not new supply in higher education be at
least part of the solution to this problem?

Well, I do a lot more than Warren does in this field and I am frequently disappointed, but
the monopoly has and bureaucracy have kind of branches like everywhere and the

people want to give more to it, but I'll move forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yes. You've got the option of very good state schools and we spend a lot of money on
education in this country. If you just take – you take kindergarten through 12, it's
interesting, people talk about entitlements in this country, they say, it's terrible, we have
always entitlements for associates doing everything. We have entitlements for the young.
We spend $600 billion a year educating 50 million kids in the public schools between
kindergarten and 12 grade and to seek what that is in entitlement, nobody ever seems to
bring that up, but it's a huge and I believe it obviously, what the people in their working
ages generally speaking, I think have an – in a rich society have an obligation to both the
young and the old. And based on the amount we spend, if we have problems with our
school system, it's not because we're cheap, no. There are other problems that
contribute to it in terms of the money we put out, we're right out there.
But I was the trustee of a college that saw the endowment go from $8 million to over a $1
billion, and I didn't see the tuition come down, and I didn't see the number of students go
up.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

Nothing went up, except the progressive salaries.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yes. From $8 million to $1 billion, I mean – and very, very decent people running the place.
But when you read the figures on endowment of the big schools and someone
remember that really gone up in the big numbers, the main objective of the people
running the endowment is have the endowment grow larger and that will be every does,
that is the way humans operate.
Do you have any more comments on that Charlie? You've seen a lot.

I'm afraid to get into this area.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yes, it – we've operated under all – I mean, we've operated under price controls. We've
had 52% federal taxes applied to our earnings for many years, even – I mean they were
higher at other times, but we've had regulations come along and in the end, business in
this country has done extraordinarily well for a couple of 100 years and it has adapted to
the society and the society has adapted to business. This is a remarkably attractive place
in which to conduct a business.
Imagine in a world of practically zero interest rates, American business earning terrific
returns on tangible equity. I mean those are the assets that were actually employed in the
business. The numbers are staggering and people who have had their money in savings
accounts or something that get destroyed, but owners of business, if you look at returns
on tangible equity, just check them out sometime and they have not suffered even as
people who own fixed interest – fixed income, instruments have suffered enormously. And

farm prices are down, now farmer income has fallen off a lot in the last couple of years,
but businesses managed to take care of itself and for good reason, because it
contributes to and has been the engine of a market economy that's delivered output that
is staggering by the imagination of anyone that might have existed 100 years ago.
In my lifetime, the GDP per capita in real terms of the United States has gone up six for
one. Can you imagine in a society, where in one person's life time, overall they will have
six times? The real output that they had, at the beginning, it's a – system works very well
in terms of aggregate output, in terms of distribution of that output sometimes, it can fall
very short in my view, but it will keep working, you don't have to worry about that here.
20 years from now, there will be far more uplift per capita in the United States in real
terms than there is now, and 50 years, it'll be far more though and the quality will get
better and no Presidential candidate or President is going to end that. They can shape it in
ways that are good or bad, but they can't end it.
Now, Charlie, give something pessimistic here to balance-

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

No, I want to say something optimistic, and I think that the GDP figures greatly understate
the real advantage that our system has given to our citizens. It under weighs a lot of huge
achievements because they don't translate right into money, in a certain way of the
economist can easily amble, but the real achievements are over the last centuries say, are
way higher than are indicated by the GDP figures, and the GDP figures are good. I don't
think, this issue is necessarily going to be as quite as good as the past, but it doesn't have
to be-

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

There is no one you run into at least in my experiences that says with my same talents, I
wish I'd lived 50 years ago instead born 50 years earlier, but a majority of the American
public thinks that it is a bad time to be born today compared to when they were born, but
we can show everyone they're wrong. It's the pace – the pace of innovation just think how
differently you are living compared to 20 years ago in terms of what you do with your
time. Now, lot of people may condemn or something of that sort, but you are making free
choices that were not available to you 20 years ago and you are making them in a
different direction. I'm still saying with the land line, but you people are way ahead of me.
Okay, great.

Warren, late last year, we saw Canadian Pacific make a hostile bid for Norfolk Southern, a
combination that would have linked Canada's second largest carrier with one of the two
largest railroads in the Eastern U.S. This move led to a largely negative reaction from not
only Norfolk Southern, but from Federal and State lawmakers, shippers and other railroad
operators even though a formal evaluation process hadn't even begun with U.S. Surface
Transportation Board. Canadian Pacific eventually backed down.

Looking back to 1999, when the Transportation Board blocked a proposed merger
between BNSF and Canadian National, the attitude was that any additional mergers
amongst railroads would have to be accretive to competition. What do you think they
meant by this and if one believes that the hookup of one of the two major Western
railroads with one of the two Eastern railroads would not alter the current landscape
where most shippers had just two choices amongst the large railroads operating in the
region and could actually generate efficiencies and cost savings that could be passed
along to customers, how does a combination of someone like BNSF with Norfolk Southern
and CSX not satisfy their goal?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

I think, now there is and Matt Rose, is he here? He can probably answer that, some of that
better than I can certainly; he can answer all of it better than like I can.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yes, there is Matt. Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Matthew K. Rose

{BIO 1506801 <GO>}

Yes. So, the statements is actually right; back in 1999, we had a failed merger with
Canadian National and new rules were put in place by our regulator, a little group called
the SCB. And what they said was that the public litmus test for the next merger would
have to be different. And at that point of time, we didn't really think that a large merger
was possible. And so, when Canadian Pacific announced their merger of the Norfolk
Southern, when we think about our four contingencies and those four are our customers,
the labor groups, the communities in which we serve and shareholders, which our
shareholders of course is BRK, we didn't see any interest in the final round of these
mergers occurring outside of the shareholder community.
And so, our position was simply to say, if the rest of the shipping community believes that
we ought to see this final round, that's fine, we'll participate, but we don't see it occurring
right now. We do believe that when that final round occurs, there will be great efficiencies
made for shippers and communities. But right now, we don't see the dynamics in place.
So what are those dynamics? It will be as the country continues to grow in population from
where we are today, 315 million to say 320 million, 330 million, 350 million, transportation
becomes more scares and the railroads will need to do more, and that's really when we
think the next round will occur.

Well, the public policy since 2008 and 2009 has been to very much toughen up capital
requirements in a variety of ways for banks, but it is specifically designed to make large
banks, very large banks, less profitable relative to smaller banks and you do that by
increasing capital requirements. So you can – you can change the map of banking and the
attractiveness of banking totally by capital requirements. Obviously, you said every bank
had to be 100% equity; it would be a terrible business. You can possibly earn any money
that was significant on capital. And if you let people operate with 1% capital ratios, they
can make a lot of money and they will cause the system all kinds of trouble.
So since 2009, the rules have been tilted against the larger banks by primarily for capital
requirements and that just means returns on equity can go down, but returns on equity
were awfully high prior to that. So it hasn't turned it into a bad business, it's turned into a
less attractive business than earlier. And that – some of the investment banks operate as
bank holding companies, so they may have been affected by those capital requirements.
I'm not sure getting 100% to your question. So I invite you to give me a follow-up, if you'd
like on that.

Q - Alexis Christof orous
In the marketable securities portfolio, do you feel good about the going forward
prospects of the investment bank – the investment banking companies, especially as
Wells Fargo moves into that business?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well. Wells Fargo has an investment banking aspect towards, it primarily came in through
Wachovia. And it's not in significant, but our ownership with Wells Fargo, which is very
large, our largest single marketable security, not counting crap times, which is about the
same size because in that situation we are under control position. But it's the largest noncontrolled situation that we have at Wells Fargo. And that's by intent, I like it extremely

well compared to other securities not because it has the most upside but I feel that
weighted for upside-downside that it's-

It's not the investment banking in terms of Wells Fargo, it's the general banking that-

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yes. We're not in – it isn't that big a deal and that's not what attracts us. We think Wells
Fargo is a very well run bank, but we didn't make any decision to buy a single share based
on the fact they we're going to be more in the investment banking business because of
the Wachovia acquisition. They've got a lot of sources of income, they've got a huge base
of very cheap money, but unfortunately they've got it out at very cheap rates on the other
side now, but spreads will probably work in their advantage eventually, and we think it's a
very well run bank.
Investment banking business, Charlie and I are probably a little affected by the experience
we had in running one for a short period of time. It's not been something we invested in
significantly, we obviously made a major investment in Goldman Sachs and we continue to
hold shares that came out of the warrants that we received when we made the
investment in 2008. Well, I think I can't recall us making a investment banking purchase, a
marketable security involving an investment bank for a long time; can you Charlie?

Q - Alexis Christof orous
In the conclusion of the book, 'Dear Chairman', which you recommended and this year's
annual letter a new book you recommend, the author argues that "the wise work of great
investors is inevitably reabsorbed into the industrial complex with little acknowledgement
of their accomplishments". He then argues that Berkshire Hathaway will eventually be
targeted by activists, investors, if it trades at too sharp a discount to intrinsic value. Do you
agree with this assessment and have you considered installing corporate defenses that
might prevent future generations of activists from trying to breakout Berkshire Hathaway?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yes. I used to worry more about that than I do now. Partly, size is one factor, I think the
more important factor would be that Berkshire will always be in a position to repurchase
very significant amount of stock and as long as is willing to buy that stock at some price
and it should be close to intrinsic value, there should not be a large margin in terms of
anybody that might come along and think there would be a lot of money to be made by
breaking up. There would be money lost by breaking it up, in terms of if we lose, there

would be certain advantages lost. MidAmerican Energy could not have done what it has
done in renewals without Berkshire being the parent. I mean they have been split off, it
would have been worth – the parts would have been worth less than the whole, and there
are other – I can give you significant instances that up – in other cases.
So, I don't think there will be a spread that will be enticing to anyone and beyond that, I
think the numbers that are involved would be staggering and I think we have a
shareholder base that recognizes the advantages of both the Berkshire businesses and
its culture. So I think it's very unlikely, but there have been periods in business history,
where probably all stocks sold at dramatic discounts from what you might call intrinsic
value. And it's interesting that very little activity occurred then.
In 1974 period, 1973 and 1974, there were company – really good companies, one of which
was Cap Cities for example. Tom Murphy ran it, it was something at a huge discount to
what it was worked, but people did not come along. And so to some extent when the
discounts are huge, money is harder to get. It's not a huge worry with me. Actually and in
my own case, because of the way my stock will get distributed to philanthropies after I
die, there will be a – it's very likely that my stake for some years will be by far the largest
shareholder of Berkshire in terms of votes, even with this distribution policy that it occurs.
So I – it's not something I worry about now, I used to worry about it some, but it's not a
factor now.

you talk about Berkshire's competitive advantages in its various leasing business including
containers, cranes, furniture, tank cars and rail cars? Are there other leasing business you
would be interested in entering for instance airplanes or commercial auto fleet, same
leasing companies in particular seem to sell for reasonable prices and are often available?

FINAL

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yes, well we've got a very good truck leasing business (148:21) we've got a good primarily
tank car leasing business in tank car pro car. We expanded by $1 billion when we bought
the JD fleet recently. Leasing generally isn't something – we have to bring something to
the party; that's much more than just handing people trailer and taking a check every
month. There is important service advantages brought to that, but pure leasing, leasing of
new cars which is a huge business. The map is not that attractive, so banks have an
advantage over us because their cost of funds is so low; now it's not quite as low it looks,
but I think Wells Fargo, I think the last figure was down around 10 basis points and was
somebody has maybe $1 trillion or so, and they're paying 10 basis points for it, I don't feel
very competitive at Berkshire in that situation.

Bloomberg Transcript

So pure money-type leasing is not an attractive business for us when we've got other
people with the lower cost of funds. I mean they've got the edge. And we have got railcar
leasing, involves a lot more than just a financial transaction. I mean we repair – we've got
huge activity in the repair field and those cars require servicing and the same way in our
trailer business, but you will not see us getting – aircrafts leasing doesn't interest me in
the least, we've looked at that a lot of times at various aircraft leasing companies offer to
us and that's a scary business.
And some people have done well in it by – in recent years by using short-term money to
finance, longer-term assets, which have big residual risks and that just isn't for us. Charlie?

We have lots of tough competitors and in many areas, we're a pretty tough competitor
ourselves, and the real – what we want our managers to be doing is thinking every day
about how to achieve a stronger competitive position, we call it widening the mold, but
we want to turn our better products. We want to keep our cost out to a minimum, we
want to be thinking about when our customers likely to be wanting from us a month, a
year, 10 years from now, and generally if you take care of your customer, the customer
takes care of you. But there are cases, where's there's some force coming along that
really is you may not have the answer for them and then you get out of that business. We
had that department store in Baltimore in 1966 and if we kept it, we would have gone out
of business. So recognizing reality is also important. I mean, you do not want to try and fix
something that's unfixable.

This question comes from Ram and Rajiv Tharek (153:32) from Sugar Land, Texas. He
writes my wife and I have the vast majority of our net worth invested in Berkshire and in
shares of the Sequoia Fund. Mr. Buffett, you have endorsed the Sequoia Fund on more
than a few occasions. Recently, the Sequoia Fund has been in the news because of its
large position and Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Mr. Munger has termed Valeant's business
model highly immoral.
Mr. Buffett, do you agree with Mr. Munger's assessment? Have your views about Sequoia
Fund changed? Also as you know, Sequoia is an admirer and large holder of Berkshire
stock.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, in a sense, I'm the father of Sequoia Fund. And when I was closing up my partnership
at the end of 1969, I was giving back a lot of money to partners. And these people have
trusted me and they wanted to know what they should do with their money. And we
helped out those who wanted to put in municipal bonds for a few months Bill, Scott
(154:34) and I stayed around and helped those people come up with those, but most of
them were equity-oriented type investors. And we said there were two people that we
admired enormously in the investment business, not simply because they were terrific
investors, but they were terrific people, and that would be the kind of people that you'd
make trustee of your will. So those two, one of whom is in the room, Sandy Gottesman,
our Director, and one was Sandy, and one was Bill Ruane. They were friends themselves.
So Sandy took on a number of our clients or number of our partners and they became
clients and very happy clients (155:19) some of them are still clients or their children or
grandchildren are to this day.
Others went with those – a lot of them went with both of them actually. In fact I wouldn't
be surprised but the majority who had a lot of money gave some to Sandy and gave
some to Bill. But Bill, we had a lot of people whose total funds were really not of a size
that made them economic individual clients. And so, Bill, who would not have otherwise
set up a fund, Bill said, I will set up a fund and it actually had an office in Omaha. John
Harding, he used to work for me, became the employee here and a number of our expartners, my ex-partners joined Sequoia Fund as a way to find an outstanding investment
manager, like I say both for (159:03) and for integrity and could deploy small sums with
them.
And Bill ran Sequoia until I think of roughly 2005, when he died and did a fantastic job and
even now, if you take the record from inception to now, with the troubles they've had
recently, I don't know the mutual funds in United States that has a better record. There
probably is one, maybe or two, but it's far better than the S&P and you won't find any
records that fill for 30 years or 40 years that are better than S&P. So, Bill did a great job
for people, and Bill died in 2005 and the record continued to be good until a year or so
ago. And at that time they – the management company or the manager, I should say, took
an unusually large position in Valeant and despite the objection of some people who are
on the board, not only maintained that position, but actually increased it after a fair
amount of doubt had been expressed by the board about the advisability of doing that.
The record like I say to-date still from when started is significantly better than average.

My understanding is the manager who made the decision on Valeant is no longer running
the operation and then other people (157:58) for doing so and I have every reason to
believe that they're – I know that they're very smart, decent people who are good,
probably way better than average analyst in terms of loss rate, so, I think it was very
unfortunate period when the manager got overtly entranced with the business model
which if you – I watched the Senate hearings a couple of days ago when Senator Collins
and Senator McCaskill interrogated three people from Valeant, and it was not a pretty
picture that in my view the business model of Valeant was enormously flawed, it had been
touted to us. We had several people who urged us strongly to buy Valeant, they wanted
us to meet Pearson, and all that sort of thing, but it illustrated a principal that (159:06) I
think said many, many years ago; he said if you're looking for a manager, find somebody
that's intelligent, energetic and has integrity. And he said if they don't have the last, be
sure they don't have the first two.

Bloomberg Transcript

If you've got somebody lacks integrity, you want to be dumb and lazy and if you get an
intelligent, energetic guy or women who is pursuing course of action which he put on the
front page would be – make you very unhappy. Didn't get in a lot of trouble, it may take a
while, but Charlie and I have seen and we're not remotely perfect at this, I don't mean
that, but we've seen patterns.
We get pattern recognition, that's very important in evaluating humans and businesses
and the pattern recognition isn't 100% and they know the patterns exactly repeat
themselves, but there are certain things in business and securities markets that we have
seen a over and over and that frequently come to a bad end, but frequently look
extremely good in the short run. And one which I talked about last year, I'm not referring
to Valeant in this regard is the chain-letter scheme; the disguised chain letter. You are
going to see chain letters for the rest of your life, but not that – nobody calls them chainletters, because that as a connotation that will scare you off, but a disguised kind chainletters and many of the schemes in Wall Street that are designed to fool people, have
that particular aspect to it.
And there were patterns at Valeant that I think certainly if you go and watch those Senate
hearings, I think you'll decide that there are patterns that really should have been picked
that up on and it's been very painful to the people of Sequoia. And I personally think that
the people who are running Sequoia now are able people. And I'll get into in a second the
difficulty of managing money, but first I'll give Charlie a chance to comment on this.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, I totally agree with you that Sequoia as reconstituted, it's a reputable investment
fund and the manger has reconstituted his reputable investment advisor. And I've got
quite a few friends and clients that use Ruane Cunniff, and I have advised them to stay
with the places reconstituted. I believe you've done the same thing. Haven't you?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

In a few minutes, we'll break, but I think it almost ties in with this last question. If we could
put slide three up, I promised – some years ago, I made a wager and I promised to report
before the lunch the wager was coming out, and I have been doing that regularly. But it
probably seems appropriate since it's developed this far to point out a rather obvious
lesson, which was what I hope to drive home to some degree by offering to make the
wager originally. Incidentally, when I offered to make the wager, namely, somebody can
pick out five hedge funds and I would take the unmanaged S&P index (163:18) Vanguard
Fund and I would bet that over a 10-year period that the unmanaged index would beat
these five funds that were all being managed presumably, they can pick any five funds
that were managed by people who are charging incredible sums that they will because of
their supposed expertise. And fortunately, there is an organization called or at least you
go to – if you go the Internet, if you put in longbets.org, it's a terribly interesting website.
You can have a lot of fun with it, because people take the opposite side of various
propositions that have a long tail to them and make bets as to the outcome and then they
both get their – each side gives their reasons. And you can go to that website and you can
find bets about whether what population will be doing 15 years from now or all kinds of
things, and our bet became quite famous on that. They – and a fellow I like, who I didn't
know before this, Ted Seides bet that he could pick out five hedge funds. These were
funds of funds. In other words, there was a one hedge fund at the top and then that
manager picked out who he thought were the best managers underneath and then
bought into these other funds in turn. So that the five funds of funds represent maybe
100 or 200 hedge funds underneath.
Now, bear in mind that the hedge fund, it's not making the bet, was picking out funds,
where the manager on top was getting paid perhaps a 0.5% a year plus a cut of the
profits, primarily picking out who he thought were best managers underneath, who in turn
were getting paid maybe 1.5% to 2%, plus a cut of the funds on profits. But certainly the
guy at the top was incentivized to try and pick out great funds, and at the next level those
people were presumably incentivized too. So, the result is after eight years, and several
hundred hedge fund managers being involved is that now the totally unmanaged fund by
Vanguard with very, very, very minimal cost is now 40 some points ahead of the group of
hedge funds.
Now that may sound like a terrible result for the hedge funds, but it's not a terrible result
for the hedge fund managers. These managers – A, you've got this top level manager
that's charging probably 0.5%, I don't know that for sure, and down below you've got
managers that are probably charging 1.5% to 2%. So if you have a couple of percentage
points sliced off every year that is a lot of money. We have two managers at Berkshire that
each manage $9 billion for us. They both ran hedge funds before.

If they had a two and twenty arrangement with Berkshire, which is not uncommon in the
hedge fund world, they would be getting a $180 million each merely for breathing
annually, that – I mean that – it's a compensation scheme that is unbelievable to me, and
that's one reason I made this bet. But what I'd like you to do is for a moment imagine that
in this room, we have the entire – you people own all of America, all the stocks in America
are owned by this group. You are the Berkshire 18,000 or whatever it is, that has
somehow managed to accumulate all the wealth in the country.
And let's assume we just divide it down the middle, and on this side we put half the
people, half of all the investment capital in the world and that capital is what a certain
presidential candidate might call low energy. In fact they have no energy at all. They buy
half of everything that exists in the investment world, 50% everyone on this side. And so
now half of it is owned by these no energy people. They don't look at stock prices, they
don't turn on business channels, they don't read the Wall Street journal, they don't do
anything. They just – they're a slovenly group that just sits for year after year after year
owning half of the country, half of the America's business.
Now what's their result going to be? Their result is going to be exactly average as how
American business does, because they don't have all of it. They have no expenses, no
nothing. Now, what's been happen with the other half, the other half or what we call the
hyperactives and the hyperactives, their gross result is also going to be half, right? They
can't – the whole has to be the sum of the parts sharing this group by definition can't
change from its half of the (168:53) investment results. This half is going to have the same
gross results. They're going to have the same results as the no-energy people. And
they're also going to have terrific expenses, because they're all going to be moving
around hiring hedge funds, hiring consultants, paying lots of commissions and everything
and that have as a group has to do worse than this have. The people who don't do
anything have to do better than the people that are trying to do better, and that's simple.
And I hoped through making this bet to actually create a little example of that, but that
also was open to anybody. And I would make incidentally the same offer now except
being around 10 years (169:40) more problematic as we go through life. But it seems so
elementary, but I will guarantee you that no endowment fund, no public pension fund, no
extremely rich person wants to sit in that part of the auditorium. They just can't believe
that because I have billions of dollars to invest that they can't go out and hire somebody,
who will do better than average. I hear from them all the time.
So, this group over here supposedly sophisticated people, generally richer people hire
consultants and no consultant in the world is going to tell you just buy an S&P index fund
and sit for the next 50 years. You don't get to be a consultant in that way, and you
certainly don't get an annual fee that way. So, the consultants got every motivation in the
world to tell you this year I think we should concentrate more on international stocks. This
year – this manager is particularly good on the short site, and so they come in and they
talk for hours and you pay them a large fee and they always suggests something other
than just sitting on your year end and participating in the American business without cost.
And then those consultants after they get their fees, they in turn recommend to you other
people who charge fees, which as you can see over a period of time, cumulatively eat up
Page 51 of 152

capital like crazy. So, I would suggest that – but I'm not sure, I didn't feel sure, because I
can't tell for sure about any 10 year period, but certainly saw very probable (171:26). And it
just demonstrates so dramatically. I've talked to huge pension funds, and I've taken them
through the math; and when I leave, they go out and hire a bunch of consultants and pay
them al lot of money. Just unbelievable and the consultants always change their
recommendations a little bit from year-to-year, they can't change them 100% because
(171:54) they knew what they were doing the year before. So they tweak them from yearto-year and they come in and they have lots of charts and PowerPoint presentations, and
they recommend people who in turn are going to charge them a lot of money and they
say, well, you can only get the best talent by paying 2 in 20 or something of sort.
And the flow of money from the hyperactive to what I call the helpers is dramatic, while
this group over here sits here absolutely gets the record of American industry. So I hope
you realize that, for the population as a whole, American business has done wonderfully
and the net result of hiring professional management is a huge minus. And at the book
store, we have a little book called Where Are the Customers' Yachts written by Fred
Schwed. I read it when I was about 10 years old, then updated it to – well, that didn't
update it, but new additions have been put up few times.
But the basic lessons are there. The lesson is told in that book from 1940, it's so obvious,
and yet all the commercial push is behind telling you that you're bound to think about
doing something today that's different than you did yesterday. You don't have to do that.
You just have to sit back and let American industry do its job for you.

We are targeting to a bunch of people who have solved their problem by buying
Berkshire Hathaway. That worked even better. And there have been a few of these

Yeah. And when I was given the job of naming two in 1969, I knew two. I knew a couple of
others. Charlie wasn't interested in managing more money than my friend Morris was. He
did not scale up well, although he had a fabulous record over 45 years or thereabout. But
was all I could come up with at that time. And fortunately, I did that for a couple. And the
people who went basically have one (2:54:12) that had been well served that they stayed
for the whole period.
But the people had been far, far, far more money made by people in Wall Street through
salesmanship of their release than through investment abilities. There are a few people
out there that are going to have an outstanding investment record, but there are a very
few of them. And the people you pay to identify them don't know how to identify them,
and they do know how to sell you.

Lot of stuff. And just to give you a little bit of a flavor, what it was like in the hall, the
CenturyLink arena itself, completely packed, 17,000 seats. I talked to someone who said
I've been to Oscars, I've been to the Emmy's, there's always a few seats in the back. Not
here. People quite, you can hear a pin drop almost, hanging on every word. And I thought
there are a number of interesting topics, Alexis.
One thing for instance insurance, which has been a core part of the business. And
Buffett's saying not so sanguine about it anymore, low rates, the returns aren't what they
used to be, and a lot of new players coming into the business, that was kind of
interesting.
Also reaffirming his confidence in Wells Fargo. And a broader point there, if you're a CEO
or work for a company and Buffett checks you off during this Annual Meeting, that's a
good thing. You're breathing a sigh relief and you know you get the high sign from the
Oracle of Omaha, and that's great stuff.

A - Alexis Christof orous
It certainly is. I don't if you can hear this music behind me, but it's Jay Z's New York playing,
but they actually changed the lyrics and it's let's hear it for Berkshire. So, talk about having
your finger on the pulse and being part of pop culture, that's what Warren Buffett does.
I want to bring you the first highlight, in case you missed it, Carol Loomis's (2:58:04) first
question to the panel. Take a listen.
Good morning. I'll make my very short little speech about the fact that the journalists and
the analysts who have given Charlie and Warren no hand on what they're going to ask. So
they will be learning for the first time with us, going to be awesome.

This question comes from Eli Moises (2:58:53). In your 1987 letter to shareholders, you
commented on the kind of companies Berkshire like to buy. Those that required only small
amounts of capital, you said "because so little capital is required to run these businesses,
they can grow while concurrently making almost all of their earnings available for
deployment and new opportunities." Today, the company has changed its strategy. It now
invests in companies that need tons of capital expenditures, are over-regulated and earn
lower returns on equity capital. Why did this happen?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, it's one of the problems of prosperity. The ideal business is one that takes no
capital, but yet grows. And there are a few businesses like that and we own some. But we
are not able – we'd love to find one that we could for $10 billion or $20 billion or $30 billion
that was not capital-intensive. And we may, but it's harder. And that does hurt us in terms
of compounding earnings growth, because obviously we have a business that grows and
gives you a lot of money every year and doesn't take it – it isn't required in its growth.

Bloomberg Transcript

You get a double-barrel effect from the earnings growth that occurs internally without the
use of capital and then you get the capital that produces to go and buy other businesses.
And See's Candy was a good example of that, I'd use that. Back when the newspaper
business was good, our Buffalo newspaper, for example, was a good example of that.
The Buffalo Newspaper was making at one time $40 million a year and had no capital
requirements. So we could take that whole $40 million and go into go buy something else
with it.
But increasing capital acts as an anchor on returns in many ways, and one of the ways is
that it drives us into – just in terms of availability, it drives us into businesses that are much
more capital-intensive. You just saw a slide, for example, on Berkshire Hathaway Energy,
where we just announced – just in the last couple of weeks, we announced a $3.6 billion
investment coming up in wind generation. And we've pledged overall to have $30 billion
in renewables. Anything that Berkshire Hathaway Energy does, anything that BNSF does,
takes lots of money. We get decent returns on capital, but we don't get the extraordinary
returns on capital that we've been able to get in some of the businesses where we
required – are not capital-intensive.
As I mentioned in the Annual Report, we have a few businesses that actually aren't 100%
a year on true invested capital and clearly that's a different sort of operation. And
something like Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which may earn 11% or 12% on capital, and
that's a very decent return, but it's a different sort of animal than the business of very low
capital intensity.
Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

In the early days, quite a few times, we bought a business that was soon producing 100%
per annum on rebate work (3:02:37) and didn't require much of the investment. We've
been able to continue doing that. We would have loved to do it. But when we couldn't, we
went to Plan B and Plan B is working pretty well. And in many ways, I've gotten – so I'd sort
of prefer it. How about you, Warren?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. That's true. When somebody's forced on you, might as well prefer it. But I mean, we
knew that was going to happen and the question is does it leave you from what looked as
a sensational result to a satisfactory result, and we're quite happy with the satisfactory
result. The alternative would be to go back to working with very tiny sums of money and
that really hasn't gotten a lot of serious discussion between Charlie and me.

So Andy, lots of great points made there. They talk about renewable energy and railroad,
these capital-intensive businesses they are now in. But is it really partly because Berkshire
Hathaway has just gotten so big, they need to start making investments like these?

Andrew Serwer
Yeah. That's absolutely the case. And as I had mentioned earlier, the financial services
businesses where you don't need a lot of capital, they're not so attractive right now.
Interestingly, of course, the least capital-intensive business on the planet is software, tech
companies like Microsoft, Bill Gates' company, Warren Buffett's friend, Berkshire never
invested in any software at all.

Alexis Christof orous
Yeah. This doesn't seem to be his thing.

Andrew Serwer
Not at all.

Alexis Christof orous
He always says invest in what you know. Maybe that's just not his thing. All right, Andy,
thanks a lot. We'll check back in with you in a little bit. I want to bring in Nicole Sinclair now.
And Nicole, you listened to the meeting as well to the Q&A session. What was your take
on the capital expenditure talk?

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

Well, first of all, from a big picture perspective, it's always amazing to be at that kind of
event. There was so much laughter filling the arena, a lot of energy. But really while he did
address some company-specific issues like the capital investments at BNSF railroad for
example, Wells Fargo, some other specific business issues, he really answered a lot of
broader picture questions and that was really important, from presidential candidates to
sugar, the broad economy, even drug pricing towards the end of that session. So, really
touching on a lot of topics there. As the business has shifted, he has a broader view.
I think the big takeaway – the broad takeaway is, things are tough right now, but long-term
he's very optimistic and he's really positive on the long-term future of America. And he's
really been that way all along.

Alexis Christof orous
Now, you had a special guest in the exhibition hall with you recently. We want to go back
to Andy really quickly though. Andy, you have got – we've got lots of special guests lying
around here today and, Andy, you've got a special guest with you. Who have you got for
us?

Bloomberg Transcript

Andrew Serwer
I do. I'm here with Ron Olson, who is a real Berkshire insider. He's been a Director of
Berkshire Hathaway since 1997. He is a partner at Munger, Tolles & Olson, the Los Angeles

Ronald L. Olson

Exactly.

Ronald L. Olson

Charlie was a founder of our law firm, but he doesn't practice with us now or for years

interesting takeaway?

Well, I think, there were a lot of interesting things. I thought the way in which Warren
defended Mid-America against the charges of environmentalists that we Mid-America
have frustrated the movement to solar by taking a position against the subsidizing of the
solar homeowners in Nevada, I thought it was – like everything else, Warren is such a great
teacher. And getting people to recognize that subsidizing 17,000 solar homeowners
through the utility fees charged to the other 99% of the utility customers in Nevada was
fundamentally wrong. And if you want to encourage the movement to renewables, it's a
suicidal burden and it ought to be carried by society and not by one group of customers
on behalf of a small percentage of the other. So, to me, that was – I thought the way he
handled that was interesting and, as always, done in a way that you learn something.

Andrew Serwer
Terrific. Let me ask you about Berkshire Hathaway board meetings. What are they like?
What goes on behind closed doors? Is it really a democracy or it is Warren sort of dictate
the terms?

Ronald L. Olson

{BIO 521861 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

It's not nearly as intriguing as all of you on the outside think it is. First of all, it's fun,
because anything you do with Warren Buffett is fun. Second of all, we do have important
agenda that Warren does not dominate. The single most important is always having a
successor in mind if tomorrow he goes out and gets hit by a bus.
As you heard this morning, he plans to live through at least 100 years in order to see
GEICO overtake State Farm and market share by the time he is 100 years old, which he
fully expects them to do. But that is an agenda that is our agenda. On top of that, he
reports to us on any of the major businesses that are having any challenges. We're talking
about – he wants us to understand the bad things more than he wants us to understand
the good things, and that's the focus of the meetings. And yes, he has unusual, I would
put it in terms of respect for CEO, but he's earned it, deserved it, and the shareholders
benefit from it and that directors recognize that we've done pretty well following
Warren's lead.

Andrew Serwer
All right, Ron Olsen, Berkshire Hathaway Director, Partner at Munger, Tolles & Olson.

Q&A
Q - Alexis Christof orous
If Donald Trump becomes the President of the United States, and recognizing your public
criticism of him and your public support for Hillary Clinton, what specific risks, regulatory,
policy or otherwise, do you foresee for Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio of businesses?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That won't be the main problem.

A - Alexis Christof orous
Classic, Warren Buffett. All right. Welcome back to the Berkshire Hathaway Annual
Meeting. Warren Buffett was also asked about his investment in Coca-Cola. Let's take a
look at what he had to say just a short bit ago.
Hey, Warren. Great to see you today. Got a lot of questions on this particular topic, and
this question is a particularly pointed one. Warren, for the last several years at this
meeting, you've been asked about the negative health effects of Coca-Cola products,
and you've done a masterful job dodging the question by telling us how much Coke you
drink personally.
Statistically, you may be the exception. According to a peer-reviewed study by Tufts
University, soda and sugary drinks may lead to 184,000 deaths among adults every year.
The study found that sugar, sweet, and beverages contributed to 133,000 deaths from
diabetes, 45,000 deaths from cardiovascular disease, 6,450 deaths from cancer.
Another shareholder wrote in about Coke noted that you declined to invest in the
cigarette business on ethical grounds despite one saying "it was a perfect business
because it caused $0.01 to make, sell it for $1, it's addictive and there is fantastic brand

Page 58 of 152

loyalty." Again, removing your own beverage consumption from the equation, please
explain directly why we Berkshire Hathaway shareholders should be proud to own coke?

FINAL

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. I think that people confuse the amount of calories consumed. I mean, I have no
elect to consume about 700 calories a day from Coca-Cola. So I'm about one quarter
Coca-Cola roughly and I'm done. Not sure which quarter and I'm not sure we want to
pursue the question.
But I think if you decide that sugar generally is something that the human race shouldn't
have, I think the average person consumes something around 150 pounds of dry white
sugar a year – 125 pounds. I mean, what's in Coca Cola largely are more of the calorie
come from the sugar. I elect to get my 2,600 calories or 2,700 calories a day from things
that make me feel that when I eat them. And that's been my sole test. That wasn't the
test that my mother necessarily thought was greater, my grandfather.

Bloomberg Transcript

But there are over 1.9 billion eight-ounce servings of some Coca-Cola drink – now they
have a enormous range of products. I mean, if you would recall, Coke, Diet Coke, Coke
Zero and that sort of thing. But they have literally thousands of products. 1.9 billion, that
was 693.500 billion eight-ounce servings a year, except if it's a leap year. That's almost
108-ounce servings per capita for 7 billion people in the world every year. And that's been
going on since 1886.
And I would find quite spurious the fact that somebody says if you're eating 3,500 or so
calories a day and you're consuming 2,700 calories or 2,800 calories, and some of the
3,500 calories is called recall to delay it (3:14:45) any particular obesity-related illnesses
on the Coca Cola you drink. You have the choice of consuming more than you use I mean.
And I make a choice. The 700 calories in this, I like fudge a lot, peanut brittle. And I am a
very, very, very happy guy. And I don't know – I think, and I'm serious about, as I think if you
were happy every day, maybe hard to measure, but I think you're going to live longer as
well. So, that may be a compensating factor.
I really wish I'd had a twin, and that twin had eaten broccoli his entire life, and we both
consumed the same number of calories, I know I would have been happier. And I think the
odds are certainly that I would have lived longer. I think Coca-Cola is a marvelous product.
I mean, if you consume 3,500 calories or 4,000 calories a day and live a normal life in
terms of your metabolism, something is going to go wrong with your body at some point.
But if you keep – I think if you balance out the calorie so that you don't think I'm obese, I
have not seen evidence that convinces me that I'll make it – it'll be more like reaching 100
years if I someday switched to water and broccoli.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Alexis Christof orous
All right. Nicole Sinclair joining me now. And he's certainly not making any apologies for his
addiction to junk food, right? What's your reaction to that whole Coke bit?

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

Right. I mean, he is so funny. 25% Coke Warren Buffet is and he really has a lot of fun with
it. Really he says he is happy and he lives long. He jokes around. Of course, if he had a
twin that'd eat only broccoli, he thinks he would outlive that twin. Remember, 60% of his
equity portfolio are these long-term conviction ideas, IBM, Kraft Heinz, Wells Fargo,
American Express, IBM. Other than Kraft Heinz, he's owned all of these for a very long
time, and they've done very well. So he is stuck behind Coke. He drinks a lot of it and he is
looking pretty good today. So, that was a fun answer.

Alexis Christof orous
Absolutely. He's living a great long life. I know you had a special guest recently. You sat
down with somebody from Burlington Northern Santa Fe.

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

Yes. I spoke with the CEO of BNSF. And Alexis, when Warren Buffet announced the
acquisition of BNSF in 2009, he said that it was an all-in investment in the future of
America. He talked to me a little bit more about that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Matthew K. Rose

{BIO 1506801 <GO>}

So we still have a lot of headwinds specifically as commodity super cycle is really coming
to close, strong dollars, a headwind, certainly the coal business is a headwind. The rest of
the economy on the consumer's side actually feels pretty good. So we'll rely on our old
standards, a lot of growth in domestic intermodal and ag should be pretty good for us.
So, that's a great part about us having a very balanced portfolio.

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

What is the biggest issue for coal? Is it the slowdown in China? Is it alternatives in the U.S.?
What do you focus on?

Matthew K. Rose

{BIO 1506801 <GO>}

It's really low natural gas prices.

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

Yeah.

Matthew K. Rose

{BIO 1506801 <GO>}

And we've seen low natural gas prices in my period of stewardship of this company go
from $13 to now $1.75, and that is really what is hurting coal today. What will hurt coal

tomorrow though is the Clean Power Act that is matriculating through the EPA and the
court system.

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

FINAL

And what is BNSF doing to cope with some of these changes?

Matthew K. Rose

{BIO 1506801 <GO>}

Well, certainly, we will look at our cost base. We will – we have ways to take costs out of
the business. Some of them impact employs, some of them don't. We'll look at our capital
allocation process. But at the end of the day, what we really want to do is to find new
growth opportunities to replace that lost business that we had.

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

In last year's shareholder letter, Warren Buffet talked a lot about the investment in BNSF.

Matthew K. Rose

{BIO 1506801 <GO>}

Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

How important is that for the future of the business and what can we expect in the year
ahead?

Matthew K. Rose

{BIO 1506801 <GO>}

Yeah. So, capital is really the lifeblood of any railroad – really of any network business like
this. And so it's really important. We've got a great company in terms of the level of
quality of our physical plant right now. We had the all-time safest year in our railroad from
an employee entry standpoint, 1 million train mile derailment standpoint. And that's really
important for our employees as well as our communities. And a lot of that is due to the
very, very strong infrastructure or the strong capital that we've been able to put in.

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

Do you think more needs to be done from a national standpoint investing in infrastructure
here?

Matthew K. Rose

{BIO 1506801 <GO>}

Sure. So you hear that all the time and, of course, the problem is nobody wants to pay for
it. The railroads have the great alternative of providing private capital and that's what we
do, the nearly $25 billion a year that the railroads collectively put in is about 99.5% all
private capital. And that's really great for this country. We're taking ton-miles off the
Page 61 of 152

highway. We're able to reduce the carbon footprint of our overall supply chain. What we
really need to do next is to invest more money into the highway, what we call the
interconnectors that feed into the railroad networks as well.

FINAL

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

Of course, the transportation factor is seen as the leading indicator for the economy. So
BNSF's pulse is key. They were plagued by low commodity prices in 2015. That's
something that Warren Buffett talked a little bit about today. But Berkshire is investing in
the long-term for the business. That remains very important, and BNSF, an important
investment. He said today he would buy another one if he could even at a higher price. So
he stands behind it a mid-some near-term turbulence.

Alexis Christof orous
All right. Thanks a lot for bringing us that interview, Nicole. I just want to get Andy's
reaction real quick on the floor in the exhibition hall. What are your thoughts on BNSF and
the challenges that they face? Nicole had mentioned the commodities prices.

Bloomberg Transcript

Andrew Serwer
Well, it really does touch on a lot of the problems that Buffett faces in his portfolio right
now. I mean, if you think about it, first of all, I was a little surprised when he bought the
railroad, as he calls it, several years ago. It did benefit from the economic recovery
coming out of the great recession, but now we're in a slow growth economic, number
one.
Number two, it's a very capital-intensive business that's been a subject of discussion this
morning. And then number three, the stuff that it carries, coal, oil, these are problematic.
The oil situation, of course, dangerous to carry. Coal, what happens when the coal
business, as it declines, possibly even because of regulatory issues, how will that hurt the
rail business? So this is something that Matt Rose is certainly well aware of has to deal
with and Buffett knows as well, but these are headwinds as he himself characterized
them.

Alexis Christof orous
All right. Thanks a lot, Andy. We appreciate your insights. And this weekend, Omaha has
been transformed into Midwest Hollywood. There's no doubt Warren Buffett is a celebrity
in his own right, but the likes of Paul McCartney have been here, as has the cast of

I was blown away. In 2013, when we did the movie, and I want to give a shout-out to
Michelle MacLaren, who is one of our – our greatest director on Breaking Bad. She
directed the movie that year. When I found out that Warren was interested and using
Breaking Bad as a backdrop for the movie, I was blown away. I mean this guy's an amazing

flattering.

one of these years the other shoe is going to drop and we're going to – but until then,
God bless him for having us back. We love being here.

Alexis Christof orous
You're enjoying it. What do you think makes him purely American, an American icon?

Unverified Participant

Bloomberg Transcript

He's a self-made man. And he worked hard to get what he got, and yet he's very humble
about it. The business he created – that he and Charlie created, the good that they've
done for the shareholders, it's just really – it's truly a sort of an American story. And yet
he's very humble about it and he's just – I don't know much about the stock market. And
oddly enough, I haven't really tried to glean any stock mileage for him.
But what I like – why I like spending time, the little time I get to spend with him once a year
is I love how much he loves life and how much he loves his work and loves what he does.
And to me, that's the best thing that Warren Buffett can teach folks is just how to love
what they do, find what that niche in their lives, find out what they're good out, and then
enjoy it and live life to the fullest and enjoy it while you have it. That's what I've learned
from him.

Alexis Christof orous
Yeah. That sort of life is definitely infectious, right?

Unverified Participant
Absolutely.

Alexis Christof orous
Now, I know he's also a fan of the prequel Better Call Saul. Would you put him in your
show?

Unverified Participant
In a minute. He came to visit our set last season, and he – if you watched the show, one of
our characters played by wonderful Michael McKean has this electromagnetic allergy and
he's always wearing this space blanket, the shiny Mylar blanket. So we had – Warren was
very nice to pose in this blanket that one of our characters wears. It's fun having him.

Well, you too. Thank you so much.

Alexis Christof orous
All right. Vince Gilligan, thanks a lot. And while we're discussing celebrities, Kathy Ireland

And welcome back to Yahoo! Finance's exclusive live stream of the Berkshire Hathaway
Annual Meeting. Nicole, I was a little bit jealous of one of the assignments you had when
you first arrived in Omaha. Who did you visit?

Bloomberg Transcript

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

Yeah. I had a pretty cool assignment. I visited Borsheims Jewelry. And actually this is one
of the institutions here, it's one of the most profitable divisions of Berkshire Hathaway,
and we went for a tour as they got ready for the throngs here this weekend.
On Thursday afternoon, I happened to be sporting $10 million of jewels.

Alexis Christof orous
Whoo-hoo.

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

I couldn't even say that. Including a 50-carat yellow diamond ring. But get this, Berkshire
shareholders are getting a 30% off this weekend, so that $10 million of ring would cost a
shareholder only $7 million. Take a look.
[Video Presentation] (3:28:10-3:30:09)
And for one more fun fact, Alexis, last year at the Berkshire Hathaway Meeting, there
were 27,000 guests. And so the income for (3:30:17) the patrons, the store went through
25,000 meatballs, 2,000 pounds of chicken and 9,000 squares of quiche. So, a lot of
diamonds and a lot of foods over at Borsheims over the weekend.

That's the kind of recipe I like. What did it feel like to have $10 million on your ring finger?

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

FINAL

It felt like a liability.

Alexis Christof orous
I like that. All right. All right. I think I can get used to it though.

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

Yeah.

Alexis Christof orous
All right. Thanks a lot, Nicole. And Chinese investors have a huge presence we know here
at the meeting. And Andy Serwer is with some of them. Right now, what have you got,
Andy?

And why do you think investors in China are so happy about Warren Buffett? What do they
like about him?

I guess it's because his character, integrity, his honesty, and the way he's doing
investment.

Andrew Serwer
And he is very popular in China, right?

Unverified Participant
Yeah.
Very popular. Everybody loves him and admire him.

Bloomberg Transcript

Andrew Serwer
There you have it, Alexis. And apparently, there's thousands of Chinese investors here in
Omaha, which is probably the largest group from outside the United States. Of course,
it's the largest population group outside the United States. But the interest is very high,
and that's why we're streaming this meeting in Mandarin. Of course, it's the middle of the
night right now in China, but I hope that a lot of people in your country are watching a live

One of Berkshire Hathaway's companies, the Nebraska Furniture Mart, gave a big break
to a woman who went from being one of America's top super models to one of
America's top business women. She is to my left, and I'm talking of course about Kathy
Ireland. For 23 years, she has grown her business to the point, right now, brings in $2
billion in annual sales.
Business powerhouse, Kathy Ireland, here in Omaha. So good to have you with us.

Kathy Ireland

Okay. But I know your relationship with Warren goes back further than that?

Kathy Ireland

{BIO 1642528 <GO>}

FINAL

It goes back further. Met Mr. Buffet through Irv Blumkin and the Blumkin family of the
Nebraska Furniture Mart, our very first retail partner with Kathy Ireland Home. As you said,
I'm so grateful to them to give us that start in this industry.

Alexis Christof orous
And you also, in your previous life as a super model, you graced the cover of the Sports
Illustrated swimsuit edition three times, not an easy feat. You started your apparel line at
Kmart years ago. You've now expanded to furniture, to intimate apparel. What's next for
your line?

Kathy Ireland

{BIO 1642528 <GO>}

Our line is growing. It includes everything from diamonds by kathy ireland in association
with Paul Raps of New York and their patent pending design.

Alexis Christof orous

Let's see. Let's see.

Kathy Ireland

Beautiful sparkle. No doubt. Understated but gorgeous. I'm blinded.

Kathy Ireland

{BIO 1642528 <GO>}

Thank you.

Alexis Christof orous
Okay.

Kathy Ireland

{BIO 1642528 <GO>}

kathy ireland Destinations, it's our weddings and resorts, our home furnishings collection.
We're grateful that our customers have been so loyal, and it's exciting. It's an adventure.
And Mr. Buffet, what an education this is, Mr. Munger, Mr. Buffett, what they have built with
Berkshire Hathaway, it's miraculous. It is the heart of American business handled with the
most extraordinary ethics and integrity.

And I know you were part of the newspaper toss this morning, right...

Kathy Ireland

{BIO 1642528 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes.

Alexis Christof orous
...in front of Clayton Homes. That's sort of become a tradition for you.

Kathy Ireland

{BIO 1642528 <GO>}

Well, Mr. Buffett and I both had paper out to his children, and so we've kind of got this
competition going.

Alexis Christof orous
How did you do this morning?

Kathy Ireland

{BIO 1642528 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, I'm happy to say, I beat Bill Gates.

Alexis Christof orous
Oh, wow.

Kathy Ireland

{BIO 1642528 <GO>}

I know.

Alexis Christof orous
That bragging, right?

Kathy Ireland

{BIO 1642528 <GO>}

Well, a little bit. But nobody beats Mr. Buffett.

Alexis Christof orous
No.

He is formidable. I practice, but he is extraordinary. So he beat me.

Alexis Christof orous

FINAL

Oh, okay. All right. We'll give him that. Now you say your products are designed for busy
moms. You are a busy mom yourself. What some advice you can give to women working
moms in the business world?

Kathy Ireland

{BIO 1642528 <GO>}

All moms work whether you get paid or not. Nothing is harder than raising children. My
advice is figure out your values, you priorities, put boundaries in place, because they will
be challenged. Work with good people. There's great advice that we're receiving here
today that is applicable to all of us in all situations.
Something that Mr. Buffett touched on today, he was asked by a reporter from the New
York Times, hey, is it ethical that you're working with Coca-Cola. And he said, look, I'm
probably one-quarter Coca Cola...

Alexis Christof orous
That's a great quote.

Bloomberg Transcript

Kathy Ireland

{BIO 1642528 <GO>}

We've got to enjoy life and it makes me happy when I'm enjoying good things, use
moderation, use common sense basically.
Another thing I thought that was interesting, education is a passion. And a college student
asked about free tuition and Mr. Buffett said, we often don't think about kindergarten
through 12th grade as being entitlements, but to the tune of – oh my goodness, billions of
dollars, I think it's $600 billion, throwing more money at it doesn't necessarily give us a
better product. There are improvements that desperately need to be accomplished, but
it's not necessarily through more money. And I do agree with that.

Alexis Christof orous
And you've been in business now with Mr. Buffett for quite a few years. What's the piece
of advice or sort of something that you remind yourself about that he's told you that
you've learned from him?

Kathy Ireland

{BIO 1642528 <GO>}

Well, one of the things I love about Mr. Buffett, we can all learn from him. In his books, in
his interviews, he makes it assessable to everyone so much. One thing he says is, you find
out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out. He is very – he is genuine. And in life
and in business, it's all about people. When you see Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger taking
Page 72 of 152

every question that comes their way, you see their friendship, their trust that they've built
over the years, again with the Blumkin family.

FINAL

It's – life is too short to work with people who you don't really respect. And for me, I want
to work with people I also enjoy.

Alexis Christof orous
And that certainly resonates with this crowd, 40,000 strong. Before we let you go, what's
next for you, what are you working on inside or outside of your own business?

Kathy Ireland

{BIO 1642528 <GO>}

Inside our business, in addition to some of the other categories, I have kathy ireland
intimates, handbags, merchant processing with Ireland PAYE. Just some wonderful areas
of education, children, entertainment and production. So I work with a wonderful team.
Most of us have been together 27 years, but we're just getting started.

Alexis Christof orous
So, a lot of work.

Bloomberg Transcript

Kathy Ireland

{BIO 1642528 <GO>}

And I'm inspired by this today, because this really reminds me that we've got so much
ahead.

Alexis Christof orous
I think we all are. Now that it's live stream, a lot people can get that inspiration, because
it's open to so many more.

Kathy Ireland

{BIO 1642528 <GO>}

Absolutely. I love that this is going – that people around the world are getting this

Thanks. And I'm going to toss it over to my colleague, Andy Serwer, down on the floor of
the exhibition hall. Andy?

Andrew Serwer

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Alexis. I'm here with a very special guest who just dropped by, Andrew Ross
Sorkin of The New York Times, who asked questions at the Annual Meeting. Andrew, I
have to ask you, what's it like, how do you prepare?

Andrew Ross Sorkin

{BIO 6340618 <GO>}

So we got – I think I probably got about 1,300 questions this year and I go through them
and I try to find themes, and then I try to pick out the best ones. And sometimes I actually
e-mail back and forth with different people, just try to see if we can crack a question,
make it sometimes a little better or merge two questions together.
And now increasingly and by the way, you can do this today if you're watching on Yahoo!,
send me an e-mail during this thing, because I've gotten some good questions which I
may ask this afternoon, arsorkin@nytimes.com. I'll be up there on my little computer and I
can try to answer the question if you send the goodie in.

Andrew Serwer
All right. He is working, Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times. Thanks very much.
We're going to take a break. Stay tuned. Come right back.
[Break] (3:40:33-3:40:57)
All right. Welcome back, everyone. I'm here with legendary investor Mario Gabelli. Mario,
great to see you.

Mario J. Gabelli

{BIO 1405329 <GO>}

Andy, always a privilege.

Andrew Serwer

FINAL

So, talk about this morning, what was a big takeaway for you?

Mario J. Gabelli

{BIO 1405329 <GO>}

Well, I think Warren underscored again that he's gotten to be a size with a $330 billion
market cap company, 1.5 million shares at $220,000 a share, that he has to buy more
operating earnings. And he's underscored that notion by singularly pointing out the
Precision Castparts deal, which was a $37 billion deal that closed in January.
He then talked about the cash-rich spinoff of what he did with his P&G stock to get
Duracell. So we expect a lot more. That was very fundamental. And the second thing, he
said, which is very fundamental also, is that in an election year like this year, whoever is
President, we will do well and the company will do well, because America has a model
that has been very sustainable over the last 100 years. We've had good presidents, bad
presidents, and we need certain things to go the right way, less regulation and more
efficient tax structure.

Bloomberg Transcript

Andrew Serwer
Betraying his political leanings perhaps, he suggested might be more difficult with Donald
Trump, but he didn't get into that?

Mario J. Gabelli

{BIO 1405329 <GO>}

No, he didn't talk about that with regards to the impact on Berkshire Hathaway. He may
have talked about it with regards to other elements of the market.

Andrew Serwer
Right. So, longstanding shareholder in Berkshire Hathaway?

Mario J. Gabelli

{BIO 1405329 <GO>}

Yeah, we started a mutual fund – we started hedge funds, and then we started a mutual
fund in the Gabelli asset 30 years ago and we bought Berkshire Hathaway. And the stock
was around $3,000 at that time, and we still have it at that tax basis. And we started a
closed-end fund and we own that. But unlike others that he talked about, we don't like
concentrated biz, no matter how good a company is. So we will keep it to only 3% or 4%
of a holding.

Andrew Serwer
Page 75 of 152



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2016-05-01

So let me ask you a question, Mario, the stock is what $220,000 a share at this point. Can
you buy it? Will you be a buyer?

FINAL

Mario J. Gabelli

{BIO 1405329 <GO>}

Well, we own it and right now when you have 40,000 people and you have people all
around the world focusing on Berkshire, you don't want to buy it tomorrow. But you do
want to own it and you hope that the results will settle down two weeks or three weeks
from now at $200,000, $220,000. That is fair. If you don't own it, that's a good entry
point, you should put some away. And over the next 10 years, I think you'll make about
10% a year, which is a pretty decent return.

Andrew Serwer
So, in other words, you buy when it dips maybe...

Mario J. Gabelli

{BIO 1405329 <GO>}

No, no, not because it's dipping, because – for the last 15 years that have been coming in,
for the 40 years, whenever Warren has an annual meeting, the stock has a little buoyancy.
So you want to get away from the short-term dynamics. Secondly, he reported his results
and the commentators will say some uninspiring things about the quarter. And so, one has
to be practical, but you want to own it for the next 10 years.

Bloomberg Transcript

Andrew Serwer
So what about the B shares? I know a lot of friends of mine say, well, I could never afford
$220,000. I can by a B share. Why are you shaking your head like that on the B share?

Mario J. Gabelli

{BIO 1405329 <GO>}

It doesn't matter. You walk into a pizza store, Andy, and you order a large pizza, and the
guy says, you want four slices or eight slices, what are you going to tell him? You can't eat
eight slices, so therefore give me four slices? It's the same investment business, okay?
We have to be professionals about this. $220,000 if you – you hock your wife, you hock
your house, you hock your husband, and sell your ring and buy it.

Andrew Serwer
All right. Are you concerned about some of the things that Buffett expressed some
concern about, which is investing more in high capital-intensive businesses?

Mario J. Gabelli

{BIO 1405329 <GO>}

I've been doing research for 50 years. The ideal world was Tom Murphy's Cap Cities
which had derived to the math in the consumer sector, they would do cash flow, there was

Page 76 of 152



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2016-05-01

FINAL

inflation index, and CapEx was 5% up. So you never want to buy a business that's
committed to putting capital back into the textile industry.
Like Warren said, I learned that lesson a long time ago. So there's nothing new with
regards to how he allocates capital. If you have $1 billion of EBITDA and you have to put $1
billion of CapEx to maintain it, you ain't making any money. So he is very good at cash
sensitivity private market value what we call, he calls it intrinsic, I call it intrinsic, but we call
it private market value. He understands the nature of allocation of capital and cash flow,
and he is very disciplined, and that is because he controls the company.

Andrew Serwer
So what is it about this weekend, Mario? I mean, what do you get out of it? What does
everyone get out of this, why do they come?

Mario J. Gabelli

{BIO 1405329 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, first of all, we as a firm yesterday had five companies that did a fantastic job of
presenting their stories. So we would listen to companies like Lindsay, Valmont, which are
in the water irrigation business. Union Pacific came in and addressed us in terms of an
update on that business. We had two or three, TD Ameritrade and other companies. So
we do research.
And the second thing we do is also talk to our friends who are potential clients, existing
clients and then we listen to the Berkshire Hathaway story and we challenge ourselves
with regards to the idea. So it's kind of a basic one-on-one. It's like going, and as we
described it about 50 years to 20 years ago, Capitalists' Woodstock.

Andrew Serwer
That's right. So are you concerned – I mean, everyone's concerned. You mentioned
owning the stock for 10 years. What about the classic succession issue here?

Mario J. Gabelli

{BIO 1405329 <GO>}

None.

Andrew Serwer
What do you mean by that?

Mario J. Gabelli

{BIO 1405329 <GO>}

Basically, I think the business is three large components. You've got the insurance
business with a float. Ajit has done a great job and he's built up a good team. You've got
the industrial companies that can be managed by several individuals. You've got the
portfolio that is being groomed by Ted and Todd, and so not a problem.

Andrew Serwer

FINAL

Do you have contact with the company? I mean Buffett famously doesn't really
communicate with institutional shareholders or shareholders generally, except through
ordinary communications. Does he speak out?

Mario J. Gabelli

{BIO 1405329 <GO>}

I disagree with you completely.

Andrew Serwer
Okay.

Mario J. Gabelli

{BIO 1405329 <GO>}

What do you think this meeting is about? He communicates very effectively here and
through his Annual Report. It's one of the best annual reports that you will read. Jamie
Dimon the guy at M&T Bank, you read their annual reports and you've got a good
understanding of it. You read Berkshire Hathaway, if you don't want to read it, you're not
going to understand it. So I disagree with you completely on that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Andrew Serwer
But there's no analyst meetings, there's no analysts that he has to come to, he doesn't
go to Wall Street.

Mario J. Gabelli

{BIO 1405329 <GO>}

Well, he is the great educator. Students come from all around the world to listen to him.
Secondly, if you want to understand what he does, all you have to do is go to Columbia
Business School and get Graham Dodd, Marie, and Greenwald's books and you'll
understand everything.

Andrew Serwer
All right. You plan on coming here next year?

Mario J. Gabelli

{BIO 1405329 <GO>}

We've been here for 15 years. We hosted dinner on Friday night on behalf of Columbia
Graduate School of Business. They had 500 people. We can't have any more capacity. We
will continue to do this as long as Warren is allowing us to do it.

Andrew Serwer
All right. Mario Gabelli, thanks very much for your time and great to see you.

Well, it all started out with Warren Buffett's tweet yesterday.

Alexis Christof orous
That's right.

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

His eighth tweet. He has over 1 million followers. Encouraging everyone to let him...

Alexis Christof orous

FINAL

Yeah.

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

So, that really kicked off the weekend. But of course people were really quick to jump on
comments about sugar, that's always a hot topic.

Alexis Christof orous
Yeah.

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Of course, he talks a lot about that with relation to the Coca-Cola question. Everyone
loved his quips. In the very beginning, he introduced himself and Charlie Munger, of
course, a couple of years older than me. He introduced Charlie as the younger one. He
had some advice for daughters out there. He said if you're choosing between two rich
guys, choose the one who is older. So, that got a lot of attention.

Alexis Christof orous
I like it.

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

And of course, those funny comments from Warren Buffett get a lot of attention.

Alexis Christof orous
Charlie Munger, 92 years old he is, right?

Right. So, both getting up there, but both young at heart. And of course, I mean the range
of topics, some of them more serious issues, interest rates, the economy in general,
GEICO and some of the plagues that have been hurting the insurance industry,
derivatives, Wells Fargo, a lot of these topics that he addressed, Valiant at the very end in
drug pricing, had been getting a lot of attention on Twitter. But as with many meetings, he
really touches on such a wide span of issues, and it's really his fun kind of life-oriented
comments that really get the most attention on Twitter.

Alexis Christof orous
I bet. Yeah. I was listening earlier too, and somebody asked him, a shareholder asked, if
you could take out any competitor like right now, no questions asked, just take him out,
who would it be? And Munger jumped in and said, I don't think we need to answer that...

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

Right.

Alexis Christof orous
...to which Warren Buffet said, well, he's an attorney, but I'll listen to him. There's moments
like that that are just so genuinely Warren Buffet, Charlie Munger.

Bloomberg Transcript

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

Yeah. They have so much fun up there. And I think we have a full screen of some of the
different words and phrases...

Oh, great.

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

That were thrown around. Of course, Warren Buffet there, I mean, he is the focus, he is
the life of Berkshire Hathaway, but we see a range from PAYE to investors, to rates, the
global economy, Trump of course mentioned there. He said Berkshire Hathaway would do
well with or without Trump as President, not too worried there. Insurance of course, the
shift to more capital-intensive businesses. So, a wide range.
I mean, remember, Berkshire Hathaway is such a huge conglomerate, $360 billion. When
he bought it, it was a struggling textile company. He first invested it in 1962. So he really
has done so much, built it up from frankly nothing.

And he's still such a big part of the day in and day out at the company as well. And some
may think, well, maybe he's just a figure head at 85-years-old. Not true. He's still very
much involved in all of these businesses.

FINAL

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

Absolutely. But at the same time, it's very de-centralized. When you talk to any of the
CEOs, he allows them, he trusts them to run their own businesses. He's the investor, he
sees the long-term opportunities, but he's not micro-managing. That's very important.
Benjamin Moore, whose CEO I spoke with yesterday, had said that he learned so much
but he's given such autonomy. Of course, Warren Buffet promised in that case to remain
loyal to the distributor model. He has stayed true to that. But beyond that, he really trusts
the people that he hires, he checks in with them, he offers advice, and that's really the
value that he adds.

Alexis Christof orous
Yesterday, I had a chance to speak with one of the subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway, the
CEO of Dairy Queen, John Gainor and he said the same thing. He said it's great to be
able to call him up and just he is very accessible and asking for advice. Let's take a look at
that interview.

Bloomberg Transcript

I know you had a couple of very special fans stop by earlier today, namely Mr. Warren
Buffet with his buddy Bill Gates. What were they up to?

John P. Gainor

{BIO 14024545 <GO>}

Well, Warren and Bill were taking a little tour of the exhibit hall. And Warren always loves to
come to Dairy Queen and, in fact, he always comes by and he will get a vanilla orange bar
occasionally here, or get a Dilly bar.

Alexis Christof orous
And I hear that Mr. Bill Gates paid for Mr. Buffet this morning.

John P. Gainor

{BIO 14024545 <GO>}

I understand that, because in fact our team I think they're going to take those $2 bills, take
them back to our corporate headquarters, probably put them in a frame.

Alexis Christof orous
Absolutely. They deserve that. Now, Dairy Queen has been a subsidiary of Berkshire
Hathaway since 1998. You've been CEO since 2008. So I'd imagine you've had some
chats or some interaction with Mr. Buffet. Any words of wisdom he's shared with you, or
impressions that you can share with us?

FINAL

John P. Gainor

{BIO 14024545 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean, the beauty of being owned by Berkshire is Warren really believes that each
of the managers need to be able to run their companies, and that's really how it works.
And Warren is always available. So, if you have a question or an enquiry, you can get a
hold of Warren, he makes himself readily available. Most importantly though, we've been
fortunate we had Warren and Bill Gates and Charlie Munger over in China a few years ago
and they actually opened a Dairy Queen for us. So you can imagine the press that we
received from an event like that.

Alexis Christof orous
So the footprint of Dairy Queen has really grown. You're now in the Chinese market, been
there for quite a while now. What about other international markets?

John P. Gainor

{BIO 14024545 <GO>}

Great question. Dairy Queen today is in 30 countries. U.S. and Canada are our largest
markets, but we have over 700 stores in China and this past year we opened in Poland,
we opened in Vietnam, and most recently we opened in Jordan. So you will see continued
expansion of Dairy Queen on an international basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

Alexis Christof orous
No, we know Dairy Queen is based in Minneapolis. Minneapolis is going to see its
minimum wage rise. It had one of the lowest minimum wages for quite some time. It's
going jump up to $9.50. How is that going to impact your business and the businesses of
franchisees?

John P. Gainor

{BIO 14024545 <GO>}

Well, it's an issue that we're all dealing with, but as companies not only in the fast food
industry, but in other industries. So the thing that we need to remember is many people
started Dairy Queen, teenagers, and it's their very first job. So we really believe that
people need to be paid a fair wage, but it will be a matter of how quickly that minimum
wage actually does increase.

Alexis Christof orous
We know that Mr. Buffett has actually said publicly, he's not a big fan of the minimum wage
of raising it, and he's more of a fan of the earned income tax credit.

John P. Gainor

{BIO 14024545 <GO>}

Yeah. I've heard Warren say that as well. And I think it is an issue that our franchisees are
looking at. But, in our business, it's not only labor. Food cost, occupancy cost are also –
they play a major role in a Dairy Queen store.

So, that hasn't impact summer hiring for your company?

FINAL

John P. Gainor

{BIO 14024545 <GO>}

It really hasn't. Summer hiring, we have a lot of people that love to get started at Dairy
Queen. In fact, at the meeting over the next couple of days, every year, I have people
come up to me and bring pictures and say, my very first job was at Dairy Queen.

Alexis Christof orous
That's really special. Now we know you have moved beyond soft-serve ice cream, you're
now doing actual grill food, right, you've got the grill there. How is that going?

John P. Gainor

{BIO 14024545 <GO>}

Actually, quite well. Our concept Grill & Chill is a full quick-service restaurant. We have
great sandwiches, hamburgers, chicken strip baskets. This year, we rolled our DQ Bakes!
platform. So we have specialty sandwiches, hot snack melts, hot desserts. But most
importantly, this week, we rolled the Royal Blizzard.

Alexis Christof orous

Bloomberg Transcript

What is the Royal Blizzard??

John P. Gainor

{BIO 14024545 <GO>}

Well, we took the great iconic Blizzard brand and we created a vortex in it. So, for
example, the Royal Blizzard – the Royal OREO Blizzard will have cold fudge in the middle.
The New York Cheesecake will have our great strawberry topping in the middle. So we're
taking the Blizzard to a whole new level.

Alexis Christof orous
All right. We know that Warren Buffett is in the house. We are just seconds away from him
taking the stage again with Charlie Munger for the Q&A portion to resume.
Andy, he didn't talk at all about succession in the first part of the Q&A session. You think
he might talk about it this time?

John P. Gainor

{BIO 14024545 <GO>}

Variably, he's going to be asked about it. And he usually gives a few clues to
buffetologists. They're always gleaning a few more things every year. But I think he is
going to play his cards pretty close to his vest. It's interesting to me, when you hear – just

going back to that Dairy Queen interview though, Alexis – okay, I guess we've got a hop
here, okay.

FINAL

Alexis Christof orous
Oh, yeah, he's walking over to the stage right now. These 40,000 people have
reassembled in CenturyLink Center to hear him, and he is entering the stage. Let's listen
to him.

Q&A
A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Okay. If you'll take your seats. We'll get underway. And next up is Cliff (3:57:52).

Q - Alexis Christof orous
Thank you. Berkshire has an online portal for commercial insurance business. I believe it's
CoverYourBusiness.com. Is there an opportunity in commercial lines to go direct akin to
what we've seen GEICO do in personal auto insurance?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, the answer to that is we'll find out. We have actually two online arrangements.
I'm not sure whether they're both up yet. One is called – I believe it's called BIG. I think we
got that domain name BIG. And that would be run by the Applied Underwriters, which is a
subsidiary of ours to provide workers comp. And the other is run by Ajit. And then actually,
we do some commercial auto through GEICO as well. So we will learn soon. I guess my
message about inherited, well, this is getting delivered here. Kids probably want to put
themselves up for adoption now.
So we have been a little bit, and we will be experimenting more with various insurance
lines. When you look at what has happened, just take Amazon, you have to – we want to
try a lot of things. And it amazed me how fast the inquires on personal auto migrated
from home to the Internet. And I would have thought that the younger people would do it
but the people like myself would be very slow to do it. But the adaptation by the
American public of Internet response has really been pretty incredible and shows no sign
of slowing down.
So the answer is, we'll try various things and we'll make some mistakes and my guess is
that 10 years and 20 years and 30 years from, it'll be a lot different. Station eight
(4:00:23).

Q - Alexis Christof orous
Hi. My name is Matt Claiborne (4:00:29) from Columbus, Ohio. And thank you for putting
this on for all of us. My question is, you've said before, the year will be divided into parts
for your succession, one of which is the responsibility of maintaining culture by having
Howard as Non-Executive Chairman.
Page 85 of 152



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2016-05-01

What is the plan for how Berkshire will maintain its culture, when Howard no longer fills the
role and what should shareholders watch for to make sure that the culture is being
properly maintained decades from now when I'm your age?

FINAL

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, that's the question we've obviously given a lot of thought to. And although I
hope that Howard is made Chairman just for the reason that if a mistake is made in
selecting a successor, it's easier to correct it if you have a non-Executive Chairman. But
that's a very, very – I mean, that's a 1 in a 100 or 1 maybe in 500 probability. But there's no
sense ignoring it totally. It's not a key factor.

Bloomberg Transcript

The main – by far the main factor in keeping Berkshire's culture is that you have a board
and you'll have successor board members, you have managers and you'll have successor
managers. And you have shareholders that clearly recognize the special nature of the
culture, that have embraced the culture when they sold their businesses to us. They
wanted to join that culture. It thrusts out people that really aren't in tune with it, and there
are a very few of them. And that embraces those who enjoy and appreciate it. And I think,
to some extent, we don't have a lot of competition on it. So it becomes very identifiable.
And it works – so I think the chances of us going off the rails in terms of culture are really
very, very, very slight regardless of whether there's a non-Executive Chairman or not. But
that's just a small added prediction. So, it's – I think that the main problem that Berkshire
will have will be size. And I've always thought that when I was managing, whenever I
started managing money, size is the enemy of performance to a significant to degree. But
I do think that the culture of Berkshire adds significantly to the value of the individual
components viewed individually. And I don't see any evidence that there'd be any board
member, any managers or anything that could in any way really move away from what we
have now for many, many decades.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

There's just so much power in place.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Another thing that's interesting is how little twirl what we get in it too. So the number of
managers that have been needed, and we've had to replace them last 10 years, were
very few they without a retirement age. And I tend to bring that up with every meaning of
reinforce the idea. But without a retirement age and with people working because they
love their jobs and they like the money as well, but their primary motive is that they really
like accomplishing what they do in their jobs. And that means that we get long tenure out
of our managers. So the turnover is just low. The directors are not here for the money.
And so we have great tenure among the directors and I would argue that's a huge plus.
It's going to go on a very long time.

Bloomberg Transcript

Andrew? (4:05:04)

Q - Alexis Christof orous
Thank you, Warren. The following question comes from Aritz Galdos (4:05:10) and several
other shareholders asked similar questions that are part of this as well. It's a bit of a multipart question. About two dozen men and women worked with you, Warren, at our
corporate office. I see from last year the quality of the picture has been improved in the
Annual Report, so congratulations on that.
However, looking at it, there is something that comes to anyone's attention and is the lack
of diversity among the staff. A 2015 analysis by Calvin Investments found that Coca-Cola
was one of the best companies for workplace diversity, while Berkshire Hathaway was one
of the worst. You've explicitly stated that you do not consider diversity when hiring for
leadership roles and board members. Does that need to change? Are we missing any
investment opportunities as a result? And do you consider diversity, however defined,
with company leadership and staff when analyzing the value of the company that you may
want to purchase?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, it's a multiple part question. The answer to the last one is no. What was the one
before it?

You've explicitly stated you do not consider diversity when hiring for leadership roles in
board members. Does that need to change and are we missing any investment
opportunities as a result?

FINAL

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. We will select board members, and we lay it out and we've done so for years. And I
think we've been much more explicit than most companies. We are looking for people
who are business-savvy, shareholder-oriented and have a special interest in Berkshire,
and we found people like that.
And as a result, I think we've got the best board that we could have. They're clearly not in
it for the money. I get called by consulting firms who've been told to get candidates for
directors for other companies. And by the questions they ask, it's clear they've got
something other than the three questions we ask in terms of directors in mind.
They really want somebody whose name will reflect credit on the institution, which means
a big name. And one organization recently, the one that did the blood samples with small
pricks, that they got some very big names on their board. And Theranos, I think is that the
way you pronounce it, Charlie? Theranos.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. And I mean, the names are great, but we're not interested in people that want to
be on the board because they want to make $200,000 or $300,000 a year for 10% of
their time. And we're not interested in the ones for whom it's a prestige item and who
want to go and check boxes or that sort of thing.
So I think we've got – we will continue to apply that test, business-savvy, shareholderoriented, and with a strong personal interest in Berkshire. And every share of Berkshire
that our shareholders own, they bought just like everybody else in this room. They haven't
got them an option or – I've been on the board but they've given me stock. I get it for
breathing basically, half a dozen places that are – maybe three or four that I was on the
board of.
We want our shareholders to walk in the shoes and our directors to walk in the shoes of
the shareholders. We want them to care a lot about the business and we want to be
smart enough, so that they know enough about business that they know what they should
get involved in and what they shouldn't get involved in.
The people in the office, I'm hoping that when we take the Christmas picture again this
year, they're exactly the same 25,000 that were last year, even though we might have
added 30,000 employees elsewhere, and maybe $10 billion of sales or something like
that. It's a remarkable group of people and they – and we just take those meeting virtually
Page 88 of 152

FINAL

every one of the 25,000, our CFO, my assistant, whoever, they've been doing job-afterjob connected with making this meeting a success and a pleasant outing for our
shareholders in a way. It's a cooperative effort.
The idea that you will have some department called annual meeting department and
you'd have a person in charge of it and he would have an assistant then they would go to
various conferences about holding annual meetings, and then they hire consultants that
come in and help them on the need, we just don't operate that way. It's a place where
everybody helps each other.
Part of what makes my – well, my job is extraordinarily easy, but the people around me
really make it easy. And part of the reason it's easy is because we don't have any
committees. Maybe we have some committee I don't know about. But I've never been
invited to any committees, I'll put it that way, at Berkshire. And we may have a PowerPoint
someplace, I haven't seen it and I would not use it anyway, we just don't do – we don't
have make-work activities. And we might go to a baseball game together or something
like that. But seeing the other guy of operation and I like ours better, I'll put it that way.

While Berkshire has authorized a share purchase program, originally ended up buying
back shares at prices no higher than 10% premium to the firm's most recent book value
per share. Figure that was subsequently or increased repurchased shares at prices not
higher than 20% premium to book value. There has been relatively little share repurchase
activity during the last four-and-a-half years. Even as the shares dipped down below the
1.2 times book value threshold during both January and February of this year, if you base it

FINAL

on a buyback price calculated on Berkshire's book value per share at the end of 2015,
number that had not yet been published when the stock did dip that low.
Given your belief that Berkshire's intrinsic value continues to exceed its book value, with
the difference continuing to widen over time, are we at a point where it makes sense to
consider buying back stock at a higher breakpoint than Berkshire currently has in place?
And would you ever consider stepping in and buying back shares if they did dip down
below 1.2 times book value per share, even if that prior year's figure had not yet been
released?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. You mentioned that it's all below 1.2 times, but I don't think that's correct. I keep a
pretty close eye on that, and it's come fairly close to 1.2 times, but I can almost guarantee
that it has not hit 1.2 times, or we would have done it. And I'd be happy to send you
figures on any day that you might feel that it did hit the 1.2 times. Clearly, in my view,
Charlie's as well as the board's, the stock was significantly more than 1.2 times, but it
should be significantly more or we wouldn't have it at that level.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the other hand, we did move it up from 1.1 times to 1.2 times because we had acquired
more businesses over time that were the differential between our current value and the
intrinsic value, really had widened from when we said the 1.1 times. I have mixed emotions
on the whole thing in that, from strictly a financial standpoint and from the standpoint of
the continuing shareholders, I'd love the idea of buying at 1.2 times, which means I
probably would love the idea of buying a little higher than 1.2 times.
On the other hand, I don't take – and it's the surest way of making money per share there
is. I mean if you can buy dollar bills for anything less than the dollar, there's no more
certain way of making money. On the other hand, I don't particularly like, enjoy the actual
act of buying out people who are my partners at a price that is well below what I think the
stock is where.
So we will buy stocks almost certainly. We don't make it a 100% pledge, because there'd
be a lot of ramifications to that. But the odds are extremely high that we would buy a lot
of stock at 1.2 times or less, but we would do it in a manner where we were not throbbing
the stock at any given level. And if that happens, it will be very good for the stockholders
to continue. It is kind of an interesting situation though, because if it's true that we will, and
are eager even from a financial standpoint to buy it at that price, it's really like having the
savings account, where if you take your money out as a dividend or as an interest
statement on the savings account, you get $1. But if you leave it and you're almost
guaranteed that we'll pay you $1.20. I mean, why would anybody want to take money out
of the savings account if they can cash it in what they left at a 120%.
So, let's say, it acts as a backstop for ensuring that a no-dividend policy results in greater
returns than it would be a – we paid out $1 and people got $1, if they leave the $1 in,
they're going to get at least $1.20, it might be at least. It's not a total guarantee, but it's a
pretty strong probability. So would we increase that number? Perhaps, if we run out of
ideas, and I don't mean day-by-day, but if it really becomes apparent that we can't use

capital effectively within the company in the quantities which is being generated, then at
some point the threshold might be moved up a little because it could still be attractive to
buy.
And you don't want to keep accumulating so much money that burns a hole in your pocket
and said actually that a full wallet's little like a full bladder, that you may get an urge very
quickly to pee it away, and we don't want that to happen. But so far that hasn't happen,
and we will look at – in every instance where we have $100 billion or $120 billion or
something like that around, we might have to increase the price. Any time you can buy a
stock in for less than its worth, it's advantageous to the continuing shareholders. But it
should be via demonstrable margin. Intrinsic value can't be that finely calculated that you
can figure it out to four decimal places or anything of the sort. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

While you have noticed it elsewhere in the Corporate America, these buyback plans to
get a life of their own and it's gotten quite common to buy back stock at very high prices
that really don't do the shareholders any good at all. I don't know why people are exactly
are doing, but I think it gets to be fashionable.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

It's fashionable. And they got sold on it by advisors.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

And that's true too.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Can you imagine, somebody going out and saying, we're going to buy a business
and we don't care about the prices. We're going to spend $5 billion this year buying a
business. We don't care about what the prices. But that's what company is doing. They
don't attach some kind of a metric to what they're doing on their buyback. Just say, we're
going to buyback $5 billion of stock. Maybe they don't want to publicize the metric, but
certainly again they should say, we're going to go buy back $5 billion of stock, if it's
advantages to buyback. But they don't – they say, we're going to buy the XYZ company.
They say we'll buy it at this price, but we won't buy at a 120% of that price. But I have very
rarely seen – Jamie Dimon is very explicit about saying, he's going to buy back the stock
when he's buying it below, what he considers intrinsic value to me. But I have seen
hundreds of buyback notices and I've sat on boards of directors, one after another where
they've got a buybacks and basically – they said they're doing it to prevent dilution or
something like that. It's nothing to do with preventing dilution. Dilution by itself is a
negative and buying back your stock at too higher prices is another negative. So, it has to
be related to valuation. And as I say, you will not find a lot of press leases about buybacks
that say a word about valuation.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. It's our largest store in volume, but we had a problem there that we had in Kansas
City and we probably have every time we open the store and that we generate so much
initial volume that we had a delivery problem, like I say it was worse in Kansas City. That
was the first one we opened. So, we really had to take our foot off the gas pedal because
the last thing in the world we want do to be quite honest is make first impressions with
delivery problem – accompanied by deliver problems. So, it's our largest store in volume.
The deliveries have gotten far better. They actually are meeting our company standards
that we have in Omaha, but that wasn't the case for some months. And it's hard to go
open a – we opened up the largest home furnishing store in the United States and we did
it in an area where we naturally thought we trained the drivers as well as we could and
everything, but delivery was 100 plus units out there in the new operation, taking in
corporate and people getting lost and routing being bad and all kinds of thing. There was
plenty of work to be done and it's been done.
So, I expect that store, which already is the largest store we have, but I think it will be $1
billion annual store before very long. We're getting ready to step on the gas. It's a terrific,
terrific area. We have 20 plus auto dealerships there. They're located in the Dallas-Fort
Worth area. We probably have three or four of them in the area where our Furniture Mart
is. They can't build fast enough down there. Toyota is moving there. It already is a great

store, but it's going to be something even far beyond that. We've opened up about – I
think about four food places so far. We've got four or five more in the works. And they're
doing terrific volumes. I'm starting to sound like Donald Trump there, tremendous, terrific
and fantastic. I've never seen anything like it. But just wait till next year, I'll come back. I'll
really be in shape. It's doing well. We couldn't have picked a better area. We have over
400 acres that we're very fortunate in grappling a whole bunch of land and we're bringing
prices and variety like nobody has seen and now we've just got to delivery like nobody
has ever seen.

This question comes from (04:23:41) of New York. Mr. Buffett, you have expressed
concern about cyber, biological, nuclear and chemical attacks, but preventing catastrophe
is not getting enough attention.
For example, a bill passed the House unanimously to harden the electric grid against the
high-altitude nuclear explosion, not too many bills passed unanimously these days, but
then the bill got modeled up in the Senate. Have you considered funding? Wouldn't it be a
good idea for you to consider funding? Are lobbying and educational campaign to
promote the public good in this area and counteract industry lobbyists who are often
more interested in short-term profits?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, in my view, there's no problem remotely like the problem of what I call CNBC;
cyber, nuclear, chemical and biological attacks, that either by rogue organizations, even
possibly individuals, rogue states, I mean, to think about – you can think about a lot of
things and it will happen. I think we've been both lucky and, frankly, the people have done
a very good job in government because government is the real protection on this, and
not having anything since 1945. We came very, very close during the Cuban Missile Crisis
and I don't know what the odds were, but I do think that if there had been – I can think of
many people whether they've been in places either Kennedy or Khrushchev, we would've
had a very different results, and it's the ultimate problem.
As I put in the annual report, it's the only real threat to Berkshire's economic – external
threat to Berkshire's economic wellbeing over time. And then I just hope when it'll happen
– I hope when that happens that it's minimized, but the desire of psychotics and
megalomaniacs and religious fanatics and whatever, they do harm on others is a lot more
when you 7 billion people on earth than when you had 3 billion or so, which is the case
when I was born, but less than 3 billion. And unfortunately, there are means of doing it. If
you were a psychotic back far enough, you threw a stone at the guy in the next cave and it
would sort of limit relationship with damaged to psychosis, but the – and that went along,
sort of bows and arrows and spears and cannons and various things. And in 1945, we
unleashed something like the world had never seen and that is a pop gun compared to
what can be done now. So there are plenty of people that would like cause us huge
damage and I came to that view when I was in my 20s and in terms of my philanthropic

will take away some of the excuse for countries to develop their own highly enriched
Uranium. So, that – but it's overwhelmingly a governmental problem you're dealing. And it
should be, and I think it actually has been the top priority for president after president,
something that they can go out and talk about every day, and they don't want to scare the
hell out of everybody and they also don't want to skip people's answers of what they're
doing. But being in insurance business, you don't have to be even in the insurance

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, I've tried telling people. Nobody disagrees with you on it. They just – it seems sort of
hopeless to you. I mean they don't know what to do beyond what they're doing. They've
done a lot of things. I mean, it's not all gets publicized, but – and I think Kennedy or
Khrushchev, I mean, Khrushchev shouldn't have been sending it over into Cuba, but at
least he had enough sense when the new Kennedy in that business to turn the ships
around. But it's – you can't count on there being Kennedy's or Khrushchev's all the time in
charge of things. And the mistakes that are made – I see the mistakes that are made in
business, sort of human behavior, where people act so contrary to their own long range
and self interest that humans are – they've got of frailties. You can argue that if Hitler

how that decision making is made is just totally beyond comprehension and that person
did not end up doing a lot of damage, but the capability for damage is absolutely
incredible. I don't know how Berkshire does anything about – I don't know how to do it,
someone probably would. if I knew how to do reduce the probabilities of the CNBC type

the exact name of it, but their idea – there was a bunch of nuclear scientist, it was long
ago, but their idea was to affect elections in small states that they're being, but
government was the main instrument and you would have imagined the impact. And just
one after another people took it up and got discouraged. I don't think it's because we've
had the wrong leaders, I think our leaders have been good on this.
And I think that any candidate – well, I do not worry about the fact that either Clinton or
Trump would regard that as the paramount problem of their presidency. But I just don't
know, the offence can be ahead of the defense. And that's you can win the game 99.99%

The Lubrizol lubricant additives business is one of your sixth largest non-insurance units,
but there has been relevantly little disclosure about its performance since it was acquired
nearly five years ago. Can you please update us on how the core business has done and
how the competitive landscape and end markets have evolved since it was acquired? I
know the core business is not a growth business, but has the increase in miles driven
helped their top line at all? Could you also talk about the performance of one or two of
their more important bolt-on acquisitions, whether it'd be Chemtool, the pipeline flow
improver company, Warwick, Wethersfield that were Lipotec?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. The additive business, there's four companies in it basically and it's no growth but
very good business and we're the leader. So it has performed almost exactly as you
would anticipate since purchase. And other specialty companies have, some of which
have might have rolled possibly, but they're small. So, Lubrizol overall on an operational
basis has been very much as we anticipated or you would have anticipated if you've
looked at the prospectus at the time we bought it. They made one large acquisition,
which was a big mistake, and that was in the oil field, especially chemical area, and was
made just about the time that – or even a little after that oil took a nosedive. So we've had
some decent acquisitions there, but the biggest acquisition should not have been made.
It is – we still got the fundamental earning power of the additives business and everything.
And that has not disappointed us in anyway. It's a very well-worn operation that way, but
it's not a growth operation. Charlie?

Hello. Hello, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger. Thank you so much for your insights, teaching and
being great remodels. My name is (04:35:41) based in New York City. A question for both
of you is related to psychological biases. Through Berkshire Hathaway's operations,
you've got a very good read on macroeconomic factors, yet Berkshire does not make
investment decisions based upon macroeconomic factors. How do you do control the
effects of information such as knowing macroeconomic factors or the anchoring effect of
knowing stock prices because after a while it's hard not to (04:36:13) before? And how
does that influence your rational decision making whether you should ignore it or whether
you should try to use it in a positive way?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Charlie and I certainly, we read a lot. So we – Enbridge is an economic matters and political
matters for that matter. And so we know a lot or we're familiar a lot I should say with
almost all the macroeconomic factors. That does not mean we know where they're going
to lead, we don't know where zero interest rate's going to lead, but we do know what's
going on if we don't know what is likely to...

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. He summed it up. In terms of the businesses we buy and when we buy stocks, we
look at it as buying businesses. So they're very similar decisions. We try to know all or
manageably can know of the microeconomic factors. I like looking at the details of a
business whether we buy it or not. I mean I just find it interesting to study the species and
that's the way you do study. So, I don't think there's any lack of interest in those factors or
denying the importance of them. So, am I getting at this question or not, Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

There hardly could be anything more important than the microeconomic. So that is
business, business and microeconomic are sort of the same term.

Q - Alexis Christof orous

A - Charles Thomas Munger

Microeconomic is what we do and macroeconomics is what we put up with.

Q - Alexis Christof orous
The anchoring effect, I mean, how do you deal with that as well?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

Well, we're not anchored, but we're ignoring.

Oh, I see.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

But we – Charlie and I are the kind that literally find it interesting in every business. We like
to look at micro factors. If we buy – when we buy a See's Candy in 1972 that may have
been 140 shops or something, we'll look at the numbers on each one of them and we'll

watch them over time and we'll see how furniture shops behave in its second year. We
really like understanding businesses. It's just – it's interesting to us. And some of the
information is very useful and some of it may look like it's not helpful, but who knows
when some little facts stored in the back here in mind pops up and really does make a
difference.
So, we're fortunate and that we're doing what we love doing it. I mean, we love doing this
like I'd be like watching baseball games and which I like to do too. But they just a very act,
every pitch is interesting and every moment and whether the guys – a double seals
interesting or whatever it maybe. And so, that's what our activity is we devote it doing and
we talk about that sort of thing.

This question comes from Matt Bandy (04:40:36), in Dallas, Texas. He is asking about
Seritage Growth Properties. He says in December 2015, you filed a personal 13G,
evidencing a roughly 8% ownership position in the real estate investment trust Seritage
Growth Properties, which to my knowledge is not parallel as a Berkshire investment.
Alternatively, in September 2015, Warren filed a personal 13G evidencing ownership in
Phillips 66, which is parallel as a Berkshire investment. My question is how do you decide
when making a personal investment for your own account versus an investment for
Berkshire? I understand market cap and ownership sizing are the likely factors, but does it
still not behoove them invest for the shareholders benefit in the company like Seritage
that might have significant upside, and where are you putting your personal money to
work?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Right. I do not own a share or never have owned the share of Phillips 66, so I'm sure
where that person – what he's referring to. And maybe that there's some way when the
form is filled out that because I'm CEO of Berkshire that, on some lines it imputes
ownership to me or something, but the answer is I never owned the share of Phillips. And
Seritage is real estate investment trust that had a total market value of under $2 billion
when I bought it. And my situation is that, I have about 1% of my net worth outside of
Berkshire and 99% in it and I can't be doing things that Berkshire does. So, Seritage with a
$2 billion market cap is not really something that is of Berkshire size, plus we've never
owned the real estate investment trust to my knowledge or my memory in Berkshire at all.
I mean, it's just not a – so I could buy that and not have any worry about a conflict with
Berkshire. As a practical matter, my best ideas are – I hope they're my best ideas, are off
limits for me because they go to Berkshire if they're sizeable enough that'll have a
significance to Berkshire. We will not be making investments from us that's something
very odd.
We will not be making investments in companies with a total market cap of a couple of
billion, well, with our present size. But – so, every now and then, I see something that's
sub size for Berkshire that I'll allow put my – that numbers on my net worth and the rest of
this stuff is off limits. Basically, unless Berkshire's all done buying something or is – I mean, I
own some wells that I borrowed long, long time ago and Berkshire was not interested in. I
mean we bought enough or something at the time or maybe we didn't have money for
investment, but I try to stay away from anything that could conflict with Berkshire. And if
I've been buying Phillips, when Berkshire was buying Phillips or prior or subsequently, there
could be a case where it'd be okay when we might have hit some limit, but the answer is I
didn't buy any and have never owned any. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, part of being in the position like that, you really don't want conflict of interest, even
the appearance of. And it's been 50 years or 60 years when that we embarrassed
Berkshire by some of (04:44:22). Both of us have preferably nothing of significance in the
total picture outside of Berkshire. And I've got some CostCo stock, I'm director of
CostCo. Berkshire has got some CostCo stock.

There are two or three little overlaps like that, but basically Berkshire's shareholders have
more to worry about the some conflict, but Warren and I are going to give it. We're not
going to do it.

FINAL

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

It may sound a little crazy and it's only because I got afforded to say this, but I would much
rather make money for Berkshire than for myself. I mean, it does not make any difference
to me anyway. I've got all the money I could possibly need and way more. And I'm
balanced my personality, everything is more wound up in how Berkshire does than I am
myself because I'm going to give it all away. So I know my end result is zero and I don't
want Berkshire's end result to be zero. So I'm on Berkshire side. Cliff ?

Q - Clifford Gallant

{BIO 1854853 <GO>}

One of the great financial characteristics of Berkshire today is its awesome cash flow.
While its simple earnings, less CapEx formula yields and annual free cash flow calculation I
figured of around $10 billion to $12 million, in reality it seems to be much higher, closer to
$20 billion. And I think maybe part due to changes in the deferred tax assets year-to-year.
What is the outlook for free cash flow and can investors continue to expect similar
dynamics going forward?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

There's a lot of deferred tax that's attributable to unrealized appreciation and securities.
And don't have the figure, but let's just assume that's $60 billion of unrealized
appreciation and securities, well, then there would be $21 billion of deferred tax. That isn't
really cash that's available. It's just an absence of cash that's going to be paid out until we
sell the securities. Some arises through bonus depreciation, the rail road will have
depreciation for tax purposes, that's a fair amount higher than for work purposes.
But overall, I think primarily the cash flow of Berkshire as a practical matter relating to our
net income plus our increase in float, assuming we have an increase. And over the years,
float has added $80 billion plus to make available for investment beyond what our
earnings have allowed for. And that's the huge element. We're going to spend more than
our depreciation in our businesses, primarily being number one because of the – we'll
have the railroad in Berkshire Hathaway Energy, our two entities that'll spend quite a bit
more than depreciation and a likelihood for a long, long, long, long time. And the other
business is, unless we get into inflationary conditions, it won't be a huge swing one way or
the other.
So, our earnings, the $17 billion – not counting capital gains, but our earnings, which were,
whatever they were, around $17 billion, plus our change in float is the net new available
cash, but, of course, we can always sell securities and create additional cash. We can
borrow money and create additional cash. But it's not a very complicated economic
equation at Berkshire. People didn't – for a long time, they didn't appreciate the value of a
float. We kept explaining it to them and I think they probably do now.

The big thing, the goal, what Charlie and I think about, we want to add every year
something to the normalized earning power per share of the company and we think we
can do it because we should be able to do it. We have retained earnings to work with

and we haven't accomplished much, and other years something big happens. And we
don't know ahead of time which year is going to be which. Charlie?

Well, there are very few companies that have ever been similarly advantaged in the whole

Hey, Warren and Charlie, thank you so much for your generosity and sharing your life's

for that. And Berkshire managers, thank you for building important companies and
stewarding our financial features. Thank you, guys. This is Bruce Wayne from Micro Jig

importance of getting the best reputation you can and behaving well. This year, I'd like to
ask and preface with Bill Gates Road (04:50:32). Warren's gift is being able to think ahead
of the crowd. It requires more than taking his aphorisms to the heart to accomplish that,
although Warren is full of aphorisms well worth taking to heart and he also added that I've
never met anyone who thought in business in such a clear way.
Warren, what elusive, yet obvious to you, truth has allowed you to think ahead of the
crowd and build a clear mental framework to produce a historically significant institution
powerhouse brand? And Charlie, same to you what obvious truth presents itself so clearly
to you, but many would currently disagree with you upon?

I think I got the question. And I owe a great deal to Ben Graham in terms of learning about
investing and I learned – I owe a great deal to Charlie in terms of learning a lot about
business. And then, I've also been around – I mean I've spent a lifetime looking at
businesses and why some work and why some don't work.
As Yogi Berra said, you can see a lot just by observing. And that's pretty much what
Charlie and I've been doing for a long time. And you do – I mentioned pattern recognition
earlier and I would say it's important to recognize what you can't do. So, we may have
tried the department store business and a few things, but we've generally tried to only
swing the things in the strike zone and our particular strike zone. And it really hasn't been
much more complicated than that. You do not need – you don't need the IQ in the
investment business that you need in certain activities in life. But you do have to have
emotional control. I mean, we see very smart people do very stupid things and it's
fascinating how humans do that. Just take the people that get very rich and then leverage
themselves up in some way that they lose everything, I mean they're risking something
that's important to them for something that isn't important to them, where you can say
you could figure that one out in first grade but people do it time after time. And then, you
see that constantly self-destructive behavior one sort or another. I think we've probably –
and it doesn't take a genius to do it, but I think we've sort of avoided the self-destructive
behavior. Charlie?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, there's just a few simple tricks that work well. And particularly we've got a
temperament that has a combination of patience and opportunism in it. And I think that's
largely inherent, but I always suppose it can be learned to some extent. I think there's
another factor that accounts for the fact that Berkshire has done so well as it has, is that
we're really trying to behave well. And I had a great grandfather, but when he died the
preacher gave a talk and he said, none envied this man's success so fairly one and wisely
used. That's a very simple idea, but it's exactly what Berkshire is trying to do. There are a
lot of people who make a lot of money and everybody hates them and they don't admire
the way they earn the money. And I'm not particularly admiral of making money running
gambling casinos and we don't own any, and we've turned down businesses including a
big tobacco business. So, I don't think Berkshire would work as well if we were just terribly
shrewd, but didn't have a little bit of what the preacher said about my grandfather am
(04:54:49). We wanted to have people think of us as having won fairly and used wisely. It
works.

on Saturday and it was a hard 10 hours. At the end of the 10 hours, I came in and he made
me give him two pennies, which was my contribution to the social security and he gave
me two $1 dollar bills and a long lecture about the evils of democrats and the welfare
state and the lack of self-reliance, and he went on and on and on, so I had the right –

Warren and Charlie, you're famous for making a deal over a day or two with nothing more
than a handshake. Your pride yourselves on the small overhead of doing the diligence
mostly yourself, other successful acquisitive companies use teams of internal people,
outside bankers, consultants and lawyers to do due diligence, often over many months to
assess deals. Speed maybe a competitive advantage. You've done some amazing deals,
but does your diligence process also put us at greater risk. And if you're ever gone, how
would you recommend Berkshire change, how we approach deal making?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. I get that question fairly often, sometime often from layers. In fact, our own – we
talked to Munger Tolles, our law firm, and that was one of the questions I got why we
didn't do more due diligence, which we would have pay them by the hour for. It's
interesting. We've made plenty of mistakes in acquisitions, plenty, and we've made
mistakes in not making acquisition. But the mistakes are always about making an improper
assessment of the economic conditions in the future of the industry or the company.
They're not a bad lease, they're not a specific labor contract, they're not a questionable
patent, they're not the things that are on the checklist for every acquisition by every major
corporation in America, but those are not the things that count. What counts is whether
you're wrong about whether you've really got a fix on the basic economics and how the
industry is likely to develop or whether Amazon's likely to kill them in a few years or that
sort of thing. And we have not found due diligence list that gets to act what we think are
the real risk when we buy a business. Unlike I say, we've made – we certainly made at
least a half a dozen mistakes and probably a lot of more these getting the mistakes of
omission, but none of those would have been cured by a lot more due diligence. They
might have been cured by us being a little smarter. It isn't – it just isn't the things that are
on the checklist that really count assessing whether a manager who I'm going to hand the
$1 billion to for his business and he is going to hand me a stock certificate, assessing
whether he's going to behave differently in the future in running that business than it has
in the past when he owned it. That's incredibly important, but there's no checklist in the
world that's going to answer that.

So if we thought there were items of due diligence, indecently there are a few that get
cover for me. They want to make sure that they don't have twice as many shares out as
you're buying. But if we thought there were things that we were missing that were of
importance in assessing the future economic prospects of the business, we would by all
means drilled down our nose, but the question if – when we bought See's, the company
had 150 releases. When we buy Precision Castparts, they have a 70 plants, there's going
to be pollution problems at some place. And those aren't – that is not what determines
whether a $32 billion acquisition is going to be look good five years from now or 10 years
from now, and we try to focus on those things. And I do think it probably facilitates things
with at least certain people that are method of operation does cut down. You're going to
dis-squabbles on small things. I've seen deals fall apart because people start arguing
about some unimportant points and their egos get involved and they draw lines in the
sand and all of that. I think we gain a lot. When we make a deal, it usually gets done.

Well, you just have to think about business quality, usually counts on something more than
whether you crossed the TENs on all leases (05:02:29) or something. And the human
quality of the management we're going to stay are very important. And how are you
going to check that, it's by due diligence. And I think I don't know anybody who's had a
generally better record than Berkshire in judging business quality and the human quality of
the people. We're going to lead the business after it's required and I don't know whether
it'll improve at all by using some different method. So, I think the answer is that for us at
least, we're doing it the way we should.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Negotiations that drag out have a tendency. They're more likely to blow up for some
reason. I mean people, they can get abstinent about very small points and it's silly to be
abstinent, but people gets silly sometime. So, I like to keep things moving, I like to show a
certain amount of trust in the other person because usually trust comes back to you, but
the truth is there's some bad apples out there and spot a NIM (05:03:38) is not going to
come from looking at documents. It's – you've really have to size up whether that person
who's getting a lot of cash from you is going – how they're going to behave in the future
because we're counting on them. And that assessment is – this is important as anything
involved. We know all the figures and everything going in and we know what will pay. And
so we don't want things to get gummed up in negotiations. And I'm perfectly willing to
lose small points here and then if I have the deal on the right terms, I don't believe in
making a – and Tom Murphy taught me this. I mean, you just don't try and win every point.
It's a terrible mistake. You make a decent deal and if you find something have been
deliberate in some way. That's okay. If you think it's bad phase and it gives you an
indication of the character of the person you're dealing with, then you got another
problem and you're lucky you find it that out early. Charlie, anymore?

Warren, the announcement earlier this month that Ajit Jain will be taking over
responsibility for all of Berkshire's reinsurance efforts once Tad Montross retires from
General Re has raised some questions about not only the change in leadership structure,
but succession planning. Given the state of the reinsurance market, it makes sense to
have Ajit overseeing both businesses, especially if the pricing environment is expected to
be difficult for another 10 years, and there are duplicative efforts that can be streamlined.
Given this move and the change in responsibilities we've seen in several Berkshire
subsidiaries the last few years, I was just wondering if you could give us some color on
how succession planning is handled at a subsidiary level and any insight you can give us
into what led you to finally decide to have Ajit oversee both of Berkshire's reinsurance
arms and whether or not it will change the amount of work he'll be doing on the specialty
side of the business would be greatly appreciated.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, Tad Montross after 39 years have done an absolutely sensational job for Berkshire.
Originally, Gen Re was a problem child for a while, as you know, and some brought on by
itself and some external. But the – and Tad is – I mean he's sensational, and I tried several
times maybe successfully in terms of month, but not in terms of years to get him to stay
at longer. And you say it makes sense to have the reinsurance operation under Ajit. Ajit's
ability to handle more and more in insurance, he oversees a company called Guard, which
most of you have never heard of, and we bought it a few years ago. And it's doing
terrifically. It's based in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. But It's doing a great job, with small
business policies, primarily workers' comp around the country and it's flourished. It's being
put under Ajit. He started the specialty operation a couple of years ago and under Peter
that is going gangbusters.
And I have found – and this is interesting, but it's true. I have found with really able people,
they can handle so much. Well, just take Carrie solve with it, put this meeting together. If
you have some preconceived notion that an annual meeting that's going to have 40 000
people and therefore our needs to spend millions of dollars with all kinds of
organizational planning and meetings and meeting and meeting ever, but really able
people – my assistant, Debbie Bosanek, she can do anything. There's just no limit what
talented people can accomplish.
And if I had something else in insurance tomorrow that needed doing, I would probably
call Ajit on that too. So, it has no – in terms of my succession that is something we'll have a
board meeting on Monday, but we'll talk about it as we always do at every meeting and
our thoughts are as one on that. And everybody knows why it makes the most sense. But
five-years from now something different could make sense. That's one reason for not
announcing any names. I mean, who knows what happens in terms of the time when it
happens, or what happens with the person involved and maybe their situation changes.
There are no tea leaves to read in the fact that Ajit is supervising Gen Re from this point
forward. Charlie?

Questions continue to come in about the financing and working relationship that Berkshire
formed with 3G a couple of years ago and this is one of those questions. While 3G has
been very successful in cutting costs and increasing margins at Kraft Heinz, the company
has seen volumes and revenues decline. As a long-term investor, how do you judge when
a management is cutting muscle as well as fat? Can a business increase revenues, while
cutting costs? And I forgot to say, this came from Rick Smith (05:13:07) at New York City.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, the answer is yes that sometimes you can cut costs that are a mistake to cut and
sometimes you can keep costs that are a mistake to keep. Tom Murphy had the best
approach. I mean, he never hired a person he didn't need, and therefore they never had
layoffs. And you might say that at headquarters at Berkshire, we followed a similar
approach. We just don't take on anybody. Now, I think it is totally crazy when companies
are in – if you're in a cyclical business, you may have to cut a workforce because there

aren't as many carloads of freight moving or something like that, so you cut back on crane
crews and all that. But the idea that you give up your staff or whatever it maybe an
economist or something like that because business has slowed down, if you don't need
them now then you didn't need them in the first place.
People that are there just because somebody started a department and they hired more
people and so on, I would argue that since we've forgotten to insult this group so far, I
would suggest that happens in Investor Relations departments perhaps, or something of
sort. You get a department going and they are always going to want to expand.

Bloomberg Transcript

The ideal method is not to do it in the first place, but there are all kinds of American
companies that are loaded with people that aren't really doing anything or are doing the
wrong thing, and if you cut that out, it should not really have any significant effect on
volume. On the other hand, if you cut out the wrong things, it can have a big effect. I mean
it can be done in a dumb or a smart way. My impression with everything I've seen, and I've
seen a fair amount so far, is that 3G, in terms of the cost cuts that they've made, have
been extremely intelligent about it and have not done things that will cut volume.
It is true that in the package goods industry, volume trends for everybody, whether there
are fat or lean in their operation, volume trends are not good. And the test will be over
time, three years or five years, are the operations which have had their costs cut, do they
do poor in terms of volume than the ones that in my judgment look very fat. So far I see
no evidence of that whatsoever. I do think at Kraft Heinz, for example, we've got certain
lines that will decline in volume. I think we've got certain lines that will increase, but I think
overall the packaged goods industry is not going to go any place, in terms of physical
volume, and it may decline just a bit.
I've never seen anybody run anything more sensibly than 3G has and in terms of taking
over operations where costs were unnecessarily high and getting those costs under
control in a hurry. And the volume question, we'll look at as we go along. But believe me, I
look at those figures every month, and I look at everybody else's figures every month.
And I try to – I'm always looking for any signs of underperformance because of any
decisions made and I've seen none. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yeah. And sometimes when you reduce volume, it's very intelligent because you're losing
money on the volume you're discarding. It's quite common for a business not only to have
more employees than it needs, but it sometimes has two or three customers that could
be better off without. So it's hard to judge from outside whether things are good or bad
just because volume is going up or down a little. Generally speaking, I think the leanly
staffed companies do better at everything than the ones that are overstaffed. I think
overstaffing is like getting to weigh 400 pounds when you're a normal person. It's not a
plus.

Berkshire paid $4.1 billion for Van Tuyl's auto retailing business and consolidated its
earnings for nearly 10 months last year. Given prevailing acquisition multiples in the
industry and margins and the record level of retail auto sales, it seems that the acquisition
should have contributed more to Berkshire's bottom line in 2015 than it seem to, although
it's hard to tell for sure since its results were lumped in with those of the German
motorcycle apparel acquisition, which was only owned for a part of the year also.
I understand that the tax deductable intangibles reduced the effect of purchase price of
Van Tuyl, but I still wonder whether there were any one-time charges or whether profits
from insurance and finance operations could have been reported somewhere other than
in the retail segment.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Jonathan Lawrence Brandt

{BIO 17988091 <GO>}

I imagine Berkshire's earning a better return on the acquisition than it's so far apparent,
but I wonder if you could explain the difference between the likely economics of the deal
and what I infer from the annual report figures.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, you're right about it. It is better than it looks. For one thing, we got $1 billion of
securities, roughly, with the 4.1(n) and those securities we're basically carrying at a quarter
of a percent, but that $1 billion is available to us and that came with the deal. There are
some very significant acquisition accounting charges that will continue for a couple of
years and that I'm happy to have taken that way. The economics of Van Tuyl, I would say,

Page 110 of 152

have worked out almost exactly. If you had me a year ago layout a projection, I don't do it,
but if I had, it would look very much like things have turned out. And Jeff Rachor, who runs
that operation, is really fits the Berkshire mould. I mean we've got a first class CEO there.
But take $1 billion off the purchase prices for openers and then there are some
amortization charges of items that are allowable that make you correctly see a fairly low
figure against what it appears the acquisition price was. So far, it's exactly on schedule and
the schedule was perfectly satisfactory.
Okay. Station two.
We haven't – incidentally, we haven't had much luck so far in acquiring other auto
dealerships based on the same metrics that we bought Van Tuyl and I think to a small
degree that's because people think we've paid more for Van Tuyl than we did. They're
not seeing certain factors. And so if they think we paid X, and therefore they're entitled to
X, and we didn't pay X, so we haven't made – we've bought very little so far. I hope that
changes in the future, but we're not going to change our metrics in terms of how we
value auto dealerships.
Okay. Station two?

Q - Alexis Christof orous
Good afternoon, Mr. Buffet and Mr. Munger. I'm John Gorrie (05:22:19) from Iowa, City
Iowa. With interest rates go from zero to negative in a country, how does that change the
way that you value company or stock? Do you choose a high valuation because the
discount rate is low, or on the other hand, do you choose a low valuation because the
cash flow is likely to be poor?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, going from – which we haven't done in this country yet, but going from zero to minus
a half is really no different than going from 4% to 3.5%. I mean, it has a different feel to it
obviously, if you have to pay a half a point to somebody. If you have your yield or your
base rate reduced by half a point, it's of some significance, but it isn't dramatic. What's
dramatic is interest rates being where they are, generally. I mean whether it's zero plus a
quarter or minus a quarter, or plus a half or minus a half, we're dealing with a situation
that's essentially very close to zero interest rates and we have been for a long time, and
longer than I would have anticipated. The nature of it is that you'll pay more for a business
when interest rates are zero than if they were like 15% when Volker was around and you
can take that up and down the line.
I mean we don't get too exact about it because it isn't that exact to science, but very
cheap money makes me pay a little more for businesses than when money was at what
we previously thought was normal rates, and very tight money would cause me to pay
somewhat less. I mean we had a rule for 2,600 years that Aesop lived around 600BC, but
he didn't happen to know what was BC, but he can't know everything. And it was that a
bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, but a bird in the hand now is worth about ninetenths of a bird in the bush in Europe. It depends on how far out of the bush it is, but it

keeps getting a little less as you go along. These are very unusual times that way. And if
you ask me whether I paid a little more for Precision Castparts because interest rates
were around zero than if they had been six percent, the answer is yes. I try not to pay too
much more, but it has an effect. And if interest rates continue at this rate for a long time, if
people ever really start thinking something close to this is normal, that will have an
enormous effect on asset values. It already has had some effect. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yeah, but I don't think anybody really knows much about negative interest rates. We've
never had them before and we never had periods of stasis, except for the Great
Depression. We didn't have things like happened in Japan, a great modern nation playing
all unmonetary tricks, Keynesian tricks, stimulus tricks, and mired in stasis for 25 years. And
none of the great economists who studied this stuff and taught it to our children
understands it either, so we just do the best we can.

You long expressed the importance of taking your long-term view when investing. Over
the decades, your substantial returns in American Express seem to support your point.
And you've talked in the past about the ability of American Express to reinvent itself over
time, but today it seems to be a company that doesn't have alternative businesses and its
brand doesn't seem to have the same cache as it once did. Shouldn't a prudent investor,
shouldn't Berkshire periodically reassess its reasons for owning an investment?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, we reassess our reasons for owning all investments on almost a continuous basis,
and both Charlie and I do that, and we're usually in a general range of agreement, but
sometimes we are a fair distance apart, perhaps. There's no question that payments are
an area of intense interest to a lot of very smart people who've got a lot of resources and
...

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

And rapid change.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah, and rapid change and it will change. And I personally feel okay about American
Express and I'm happy to own it. I think – but their position has been under attack for a
decade, more intensively later – lately and it will continue to be under attack. I mean it's
too big a business and it's too interesting a business and it could be too attractive a
business for people to ignore it, and it plays to the talents of some very smart people. I
mean it's a natural that great many organizations that are really quite able think about it
and it's big.

... as to whether there's been something that have really changes the game in a big way.
And that's not only true for American Express. That's true for other things we own,
including things we own 100% of that. And we'll be wrong sometimes. We'll be right
sometimes, we'll be wrong sometimes, but we'll be right sometimes too. And – but it's
not that we're not cognizant of threats, but assessing the probabilities of those threats
being a minor problem or a major problem or a life threatening problem is a tough game,
but that's what makes our job interesting.

Andrew?

A - Andrew Serwer
Warren and Charlie, well, the first part's for Charlie, second part's for Warren. Charlie, you
clearly understand the power of incentives. How do apply this at Berkshire when designing
compensation formula, without naming names or dollars amounts, please illustrate for us
with examples of a couple of examples of how Berkshire's operating managers get paid
for performance in different industries? The second part is for Warren, which is you once
said you'd write about how we should compensate the next Berkshire's CEO, can you
describe exactly how we should do it now?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Warren worry about the next CEO, but the – when it comes asses – our incentives systems
are different and what they're trying to adapt to is the reality of each situation. And the
basic rule on incentives is you get what you reward for. So, if you have a dumb incentive
system, you'd get dumb outcomes. And one of our really interesting incentive systems is
at GEICO and I'll let Warren explain it to you because we don't have a normal profits type
incentive for the people at GEICO. Warren, tell them because it's really interesting.

FINAL

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, at GEICO we have two variables and they apply to well over 20 000 people, I
think you have to be there a year. Beyond that point, everybody's been there a year or
more, and I could be wrong on the exact period, is subject and knows, understands that
these two variables will determine bonus compensation. As you go up the ladder, it has a
multiplier effect. It's still the same two variables, but it gets to be larger and larger in
terms of bonus compensation as a percentage of your base, but it's always significant. It's
always significant. And those two variables are very simple.
I care about growing the business and I care about growing it with profitable business. So
we have a grid which consists of growth and policies in force on one axis. Not gross in
dollars because that's reflected by average premiums, which are outside their control, but
growth in policies in force. And then on the other grid, we have the profitability of
seasoned business. It costs a lot of money to put business on the books. I mean, we
spend a lot of money on advertising and all of that. So, the first year any business we put
on the books is going to reduce profits significantly. And I don't want people to be
worried about the profit that might be impaired by growing the business fast. So
profitable seasoned business, growth of policies in force. Very simple. We've used it since
1995. We've put a tiny little tweak or two in for new businesses or something, it's
overwhelmingly a simple system. Everybody understands it. In February or so, it's a big
day when the two variables are announced and people figure out how they come out on
it. And it totally aligns the goals of the organization in terms of compensation with the
goals of the owner. And that's a simple one.

Bloomberg Transcript

The interesting thing about -

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

It's simple, but other people might reward something like just profits. And so, the people
don't take on new business that they should take it on because it hurts profit. So you've
got to think these things through and, of course, Warren's good at that, and so is Tony
Nicely.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. And just thinking about it, I mean, somebody comes and says, well, you'll rewarded
profits. I don't want to reward profits. That alone would be the dumbest thing you could
do to them. You just quit advertising and start shrinking the business a little. And like I say,
people there know that the very top person is getting paid based on those same two
variables, so they don't think that the guys at the top have got a cushy deal compared to
them and all of that. It's just a very logical system. The interesting thing is, and I'll get to
your second question in a minute, but the interesting thing is that if we brought in a
compensation consultant, they would start coming up with plans that would be designed
for all of Berkshire and get us all pulling together -

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

And maybe an undertaking power. God knows where they get the plan.

FINAL

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. The idea of having sort of a coordinated arrangement for incentive compensation
across 70 or 80 businesses or whatever is just totally nuts. And yet, I would almost
guarantee you that if we brought in somebody, they would be thinking in terms of some
master plans or sub-plans and all this kind of thing, and explain it with all kinds of
objectives. We try to figure out what makes sense in each business we're in. There are
some businesses where the top person is enormously important. There are some
businesses where the business itself dominates the result. We try to design plans that
makes sense.

Bloomberg Transcript

In certain cases, I asked one fellow that came to work for us, or that was selling me his
business, the day I met him he came to the office and he had a business that he wanted
to sell, but he also wanted to keep running it. And I made a deal with him on it and then I
said, tell me what the compensation plan should be. And he said, believes that I thought
you told me that. I said, no, I don't want a guy working for me that has a plan that he thinks
doesn't make sense or that he's unhappy with it or it's chewing at him or he's complaining
to his wife about it, or whatever it may be. You tell me what makes sense. And he told me
what made sense and it made sense and we've been using it ever since. Never changed
a word. We have so many different kinds of businesses. Some of them are very tough
businesses. Some of them are very easy businesses. Some of them are capital-intensive
and some of them don't take capital.
I mean, you can just go up and down the line and to think that you'll have a simple formula
that can be sort of stamped out for the whole place and then with some overall stuff for
corporate results on top of it, but you'd be wasting a lot of money and you'd be
misdirecting incentives. So we think it through one at a time and it seems to work out
pretty well. In terms of the person that succeeds me, it's true, I have sent a memo – in
fact, I've sent two memos to the board with some thoughts on that. Maybe I'll send a third
one, but I don't think it would be wise to disclose exactly what's in those letters. But it's
the same principle as I've just gotten through describing.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

And he wanted more bad examples. A lot of the bad examples of incentives come from
banking and investment banking. And if you reward somebody with some share of the
profits and the profits are being reported using accounting practices that cause profits to
exist on paper that aren't really happening in terms of underlying economics, then people
are doing the wrong thing and it's endangering the bank and hurting the country and
everything else. And that was a major part of the cause of the Great Financial Crisis is that
the banks were reporting a lot of the income they weren't making and the investment
banks were, too.
The accounting allowed for a long time a lender to use as his bad debt provision his
previous historical loss rate. So an idiot could make a lot of money by just making way,
gain of your (05:41:05) loans on a high interest and accruing a lot of interest and saying,
I'm not going to lose any more money on these because I didn't lose money on different
loans in the past. That was insane for the accountants to allow that and literally insane. It's

Page 118 of 152

not too strong a word. And yet, nobody is ashamed of it. I've never heard of an
accountant that's ashamed of it.

FINAL

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

And the another thing that's possible is when you get the very greedy chief executive,
and who wants an enormous pay-off for himself and to justify it designs a pyramid so that
a whole bunch of other people down the line get overpaid or get paid in relation to
something they have no control over, just so it doesn't look like he's all by himself, in
terms of that fantastic pay-off he's arranged for himself. There's a lot of misbehavior. You
saw it in pricing of stock options. I think people that – I literally would hear conversations in
a boardroom where they hoped they were issuing the options at a terribly low price. Well,
if you get people interested in having options issued at a terribly low price, they may even
occasionally do something that might cause that. And it's certainly – what could be
dumber than a company looking for a way to issue shares at the lowest price? But
compensation isn't as complicated as the world would like to make it, but that's – if you
were a consultant, you'd want to make people think it's very complicated and that only
you can solve this terrible problem for them.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

We want it simple and right and we don't wanted to reward what we don't want. Those of
you with children, just imagine how your household would work if you constantly rewarded
every child for bad behavior. The house would be ungovernable in short order.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Okay, Gregg.

Q - Greggory Warren

{BIO 15185326 <GO>}

During the past several years, Burlington Northern had spend more than just about every
bearable (05:43:13) on capital expenditures. While the company reduced its CapEx
budget from $5.7 billion during 2015 to $4.3 billion this year, it still represents around 20%
of annual revenue, which we believe is at least the bare minimum for most railroads to
continue to invest indefinitely.
Other than maintenance CapEx, which is likely to account for around 60% of that total,
what do you believe are the most likely additional investment opportunities for BNSF
realizing that the secular decline in coal, which has accelerated of late, and the
complicated nature of crude oil shipments where BNSF has already invested heavily the
past few years, are likely to push it more towards other parts of the business.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

As I mentioned in the annual report, in the case of all railroads, merely spending a
depreciation expense will not keep them in the same place. So, depreciation is an
inadequate measure of the actual steady-state capital expenditure needs of a railroad,
even in these fairly noninflationary ways. And that's an important consideration in buying
the business. We knew that going in and it's been reinforced since. We spent a lot of
Page 119 of 152

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

money in 2015, because we had a lot of problems to correct and that was when we spent
the $5.7 billion. I would say that the true maintenance CapEx, if you're looking at $4.3
billion, is higher than 60% of that number when you really evaluate, keeping the railroad in
competitive shape to do just the same volume as it would be doing the year before. So,
there is an additional expense at BNSF that is not reflected in the figures.
There we also have a lot of intangible expenses at some other businesses that aren't real
expenses. I mean, overall, I think that Berkshire's figures actually are on the conservative
side in relation to real economic earnings, but that's not true at any railroad. We've also
had something called positive train control, which amounts to a lot of money for the
industry. I think, we may be a little further along the most of them and thank (5:45:43) for
that, but that's $200 million or $300 million a year and maybe whether it'd be close to $2
billion or something like that on an aggregate. So, it is a very capital-intensive business.
We run – at the BNSF, we run far more grossed in revenue ton-miles than any other
railroad in North America and that has obviously – some is a factor on capital expenditures.
But I would say that it's very likely that we will spend more than depreciation –
unfortunately, quite a bit more than depreciation to stay in the same place for a long, long
time as well other railroads.
And that is a – that's a negative then in the picture. We will always be looking for ways to
use capital expenditure money to develop additional business and we get that
opportunity regularly, it's just a question of the size of it. And we did a lot of that in the
Bakken and we reckon – we got benefits from it. We're not getting benefits as much as
we thought we would at this point when the price of oil has fallen off. But that was a very
sensible capital expenditure and I hope we'll get the opportunity to do more. What's
happening in coal with the decline? I mean that doesn't really have anything to do with our
overall capital expenditure budget, except we won't be spending a whole lot of money to
expand in that arena. Does that answer your question okay?

Q - Greggory Warren

{BIO 15185326 <GO>}

Well, I was just thinking maybe with intermodal as well, if that's the longer-term
opportunity to invest more heavily there.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

We're always open to it. But we would want – you have to see a fair amount of revenue
coming from – we had a proposition very recently, which we're working on for many, many
years, in terms of making the port on which (5:47:57) considerably more efficient and we
spent a lot of money on that and spent a lot of time. And we would spend a lot more
money – a whole lot more money if it's been approved. And recently, the court came out
with a decision that was negative on it and whether that kills the chance to do that or we
look someplace else, we'll have to look at the situation.

Q - Alexis Christof orous
Good afternoon, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger. My name is Marcus Douglas (5:49:07). I'm an
investment advisor from Houston, Texas. Where I'm from there are a lot of people losing
their jobs, mostly due to the sharp decline of crude oil prices. My question pertains to the
overall state of the union more so than my dear city. Keeping in mind that crude oil is
primarily brought and sold in American dollars, do either of you believe the major
fluctuations in the supply of crude oil influence the future monetary policy decisions? Sorry.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, that's yours, Charlie.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, my answer would be not much.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. It's an important industry, obviously, and the decline in the price of oil has had a lot
of effects; very good for the consumer, millions and – well, hundreds and millions of
consumers. And very bad for certain of the businesses, like the one we bought in Lubrizol,
and some others to a degree. Net, it should be good for the United States overall that oil
prices – for oil, we're a net oil importer. I mean, just like it's good for United States to have
Page 121 of 152



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2016-05-01

FINAL

low prices for bananas, we're banana importer, and that anything we net buy is a plus
when prices fall. But then oil is big enough and extends into so many areas that it also
hurts play (5:50:48), when the price of oil falls and it particularly hurts capital values. So,
the value – the consumer gets the benefit, he or she calls goes to the public station every
two weeks or three weeks or something like that and it comes in relatively small
increments.
The capital value contraction, which is huge if you project out lower-price oil for a while,
hits immediately. I mean in oilfield that was worth X, maybe worth half-X or third of X or no
X, overnight. And so, there are certain big factors in terms of our chemical operations,
people just stop ordering. So, you have this big impact on capital values immediately and
you have the benefits move in over time. But net, the United States is better off and Saudi
Arabia is worse off when prices of oil are lower. Oil is a big part of the economy. But our
economy has continued to make progress overall during the oil price decline. But
obviously, different regions suffer disproportionally, just was like they boomed is (5:52:13),
they got a real boom in – during a period when it at $100 and when fracking came in big
time (5:52:22). Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

No, I think that that will do for this subject.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Carol (5:52:28)?

Q - Alexis Christof orous
Thank you.
Yeah. The question is from Larry Leibowitz (5:52:35) of Boston. The year-end balance
sheet for manufacturing service and retailing operation shows total current assets of
$28.6 billion, of which cash and equivalents are $6.8 billion. Meanwhile total current
liabilities are $12.7 billion, implying net working capital of $15.9 billion. It has become
increasingly common for companies like Apple and Dell to finance their business via their
suppliers, in some cases, with negative working capital. Why is it necessary for these
Berkshire businesses to have so much working capital, particularly so much cash? More
generally, how do you think about efficiently managing the working capital of a business
segment so large sprawling and decentralize to this one?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, we have excess cash everyplace at Berkshire. So, we don't – at present, it
really doesn't make any difference whether we have it at certain subsidiaries or other
subsidiary. So, we do not – we have access cash. As I pointed out in the past, we'll never
go below $20 billion of cash and we'll actually stay comfortably above it. But allowing for
the preferred, it's going to (5:53:51) will be again over $60 billion of consolidated cash.
We don't really worry much about what pocket it's in. It's not making anything anyway at
these levels. Now, if rates move higher, we've actually got the mechanics in process to do

Page 122 of 152



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2016-05-01

FINAL

sweep accounts and that sort of thing, which – so, I would pay no attention to the
particular cash that's being held in that category there.
The cash in Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the cash in the railroad, we have independent
levels that we don't guarantee their debt and they run with ample cash and we would not
look at sweeping that down to a minimum. But if you're talking about 40 or 50 of our
miscellaneous subsidiaries, we will go to a sweep account when rates get where it really
makes any difference to do it. But right now, when you're getting zero, it really makes not
(5:54:59) much difference where you get zero. So, I think the fellow has overanalyzed it a
little bit, but I understand why he did it.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

One of his ideas is why don't we imitate some of these other people and pay our
suppliers a lot more slowly, so we have more working capital.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, that's a big thing in business now and last year – Walmart, for example, went to
almost all of their suppliers, as I understand, and certainly the companies that we supply
and they basically had a list of half a dozen things that they wanted present suppliers to
agree with you, and one of those things was more extended terms. And each of our
companies made their own decisions, but my guess is they got more extended terms
from most of their suppliers, maybe a very high percentage of their suppliers and they've
gone from – I don't remember the exact request whether they went from 30 days to 60
days or whatever it was, but the they got a meaningful extension. So, you will – in a couple
of years or a year, takes time to implement, you'll see higher payables relative to sales at
Walmart than you saw a year or two years ago.
And they are under a lot of pressure, competing with Amazon and others. And that's one
of the ways they expressed it. And I've seen it done other places and it's conceivable that
one of our subsidiaries might deem it wise to do it, but I don't think they will. I mean I think
that the pressure for cash at Berkshire is not that high and I think that the pressure for the
desire for great relations with suppliers is – would probably overcome in most of our
managers' minds in a desire to start extending terms.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yeah. I think it's hard to do that verbally (5:57:09), when you're rich and your supplier isn't
and think that your suppliers don't love you. And so, I think there's something to be said
for, leaning over backward to have a win-win relationship with both suppliers and
customers always.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

It's never been pushed at Berkshire. You can argue we've got a pretty good thing going in
floor anyway. So...

Okay. Jonny?

Q - Jonathan Lawrence Brandt

{BIO 17988091 <GO>}

Most American corporations separate out supposedly one-time restructuring costs
whereas Berkshire doesn't. Berkshire's reported operating earnings are, therefore, in my
opinion, of higher quality. Have you ever calculated how much higher operating earnings,
on average, would be if Berkshire separated out plant closing costs, product line, exits,
severance pay and similar items? Is it a material number or does Berkshire not incur much
in the way of these types of costs typically because most of your acquisitions are
standalone?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Let me take that one. That's a question like asking why don't you kill your mother to get
the insurance money. We don't do it. We're not interested in manipulating those numbers
simply. We haven't had a restructuring charge ever and I don't think we're about to start.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. I would say this too, Jonny, that we don't do that. The numbers would not be huge.
There could be a year, I suppose, when they might be, for some reason. But they are
more conservatively stated than most companies and I think they're of higher quality. But
I'd point it out also that I think that our depreciation expense at the railroad, which is
standard and which all the other railroad use, is inadequate as a measure of true
operating earnings. But that's...

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

And you're talking about we like to advertise our defects.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Not all of them. There is no question that we – I think we will have more amortization of
certain intangibles, which reduce earnings and reported earnings, but which in reality are
not expenses. We'll have more of that than some companies. And I pointed that out, I
never want to report one of these things where I have the whole adjusted earnings set on
say (5:59:48) this is what you're supposed to pay attention to, because everyone of
those I've seen virtually results in some inflation of figures and things are good enough at
Berkshire. We don't need to inflate the figures. Okay. Station five.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

You've got my sympathy.

FINAL

Q - Alexis Christof orous
Yeah. Yeah. The volume is about $600 million, $650 million. We're 4.1% ahead this year.
Obviously, my question is about fixed income. If I look at in your annual report, it's about
the volume of $25 billion and if I had, let's say, the CDS, you were selling the CDS and it's
about a volume of $7 billion or $8 billion. So, my concrete question is, the premium on your
CDS is about 31 basis points at the end of the year. So, mark-to-market, it's probably at
the high teens or at 20%s. So, would you consider to unwind this position? Are you
allowed to do it? In the annual report, you say no. But probably you can make exactly the
contrary trade on it that means your buying protects you. Is that a philosophy which you
stand behind? Could you do that from any (6:01:18) point of view, when the premium
extremely low, which is at the case that the spreads are, as I see it, between 15 basis
points and 20 basis points? Can you...

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

That sounds right.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

There was a time for you

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

I think he was referring to, we have one position left over from six years or seven years
ago or thereabout that involves us selling protection on zero coupon municipal bonds with
a nominal value – maturity value, which is – since they're zero coupons, is far off and not
present value at all. I think $7.7 billion or something like that. And we're just sitting with that
position, because we like the position. And gentleman mentions that our CDS is – that's
an insurance premium against our debt that people buy. A, there's a fair amount of activity
in it from time to time. And I think that's partially caused by the fact that we neither
collateralize that municipal contract that he refers to, but we don't collateralize, with minor
exceptions, the equity puts that are still out there. So, the counterparties have to buy – I
believe this is the case. I think the counterparties have to buy protection on Berkshire's
credit through CDSs. Now, the people like that buy it from, their credit probably isn't as
good as Berkshire. So, I mean I think they're – but it's probably an internal rule at some of
these firms that are on the other side of the contract.
And so – but that really doesn't make any difference to us. Back in 2008 and 2009, our
CDS prices went up to a crazy level. And I even commented here at the annual meeting
that I would love to be selling to myself, which if ever I was (6:03:22) allowed to. But what
goes on in the CDS market really isn't of any particular interest to us. And it's too bad for
the other guys, they didn't get collateral from us and we wouldn't have given it them. And
so, they have to buy these things that, like I say, from our standpoint, they're wasting their
money. But they probably have internal rules that make them. I think I've addressed your
question. But Charlie, do you think I've addressed his question?

Well, truth of the matter is that we don't pay much attention to trying to get an extra 2
basis points by being gamy on our short-term things in that credit default position is a
weird historical accident and we don't pay a much attention to it either. It will go away in
due course.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

Yeah. All of our contracts are just going to expire. We're not – now, we do a few
operational contracts in our Energy company. I mentioned a couple of places where they –
for their own reasons and sometimes because the utility commissions want them to, they
do certain things, but it's peanuts. And the positions that I instituted six years or seven
years ago are basically all (6:04:35) in a runoff position and the first big runoffs will be in

Q - Becky Quick

{BIO 16400962 <GO>}

This question comes from Tom Hensley (6:05:09), a long time shareholder from Houston,
Texas, who says, over the years, you've been effusive in your praise of Ajit Jain and his
contributions to Berkshire. In the 2009 Chairman's letter, you wrote, if Charlie, Ajit and I
are ever sinking in a boat and you could only say one of us, swim to Ajit. My question is,
what if we don't get to Ajit in time, please comment on the impact on National Indemnity
in Berkshire and whether or not there's another Ajit in the house?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

Q - Becky Quick

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

Yeah.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. It would be very significant and that would be true of some other managers at
some other subsidiaries. But it's quite dramatic with Ajit's operation, because literally
there were a few years when we had like 25 or so – or 30 people where that operation –
it was an unusual period at the end, but where it's earning potential under Ajit was
fantastic, that probably won't happen to that degree again. Wish it would, but he's done a
tremendous amount for Berkshire. But I can start with Tony, he's done a lot – there have
been a lot of managers that have created billions and billions of dollars of value for
Berkshire, I mean. And maybe you can get into the tens of billions, it's having a fantastic
manager that has a large business – potential business available to them and who makes
the most of it. It's huge over time and you don't see it necessarily in a week or a month or
anything of the sort. But when you're building capital value, I mean think of the value of
(6:07:16) was on, I mean it wouldn't have happened without him, and you're looking at
huge values. And I could name other situations. The value of Tom Murphy and Dan Burke
was that average (6:07:30) between zero and what they ended up with. I mean they built
that thing from a bankrupt UHF station in Albany. It wasn't that they were – they didn't
invent television or anything of the sort. They just managed it so well. So, really
outstanding mangers. They're invaluable and we want to align – and Charlie and I can't do
it ourselves, but we want to align ourselves with them and then have them feel about
Berkshire the way we feel about it. And if we do that, we have an enormous asset and we
do have in Ajit and a number of the other managers. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yes. And Ajit has a longer shelf life than we do. He'd be particularly missed.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, let's not give up here, Charlie. I reject such defeatism. Cliff ?

Q - Clifford Gallant

{BIO 1854853 <GO>}

Thank you. Low to negative interest rates is something that's been discussed a few times
today and you've mentioned there's implications for a return on flow. I was wondering
how should shareholders value the 25% of the flow that's been created by retrocessional
reinsurance, where the business is booked at an underwriting loss and at times it has
adversely developed?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Cliff brings up some of our business in the insurance business. We take where
(6:09:00) these are the probability of some underwriting loss in order to get to use the

money for a very long period of time and it would look, under today's interest rates, like
we can't do much with that. There's two answers to that. We don't think it will – with a
duration of the kind of contracts we have, we don't expect these rates, but we could be
wrong. But the second one also is that we do think that occasionally we will get chances,
even in periods of low interest rates, to do things that are – will produce quite a bit very
reasonable returns. And so, we are not measuring it against Double-A corporates or
anything of the sort. We're measuring it in the potential utility to us with our really pretty
unusual flexibility in respect to the deployment of funds and this long period when we'll
have an opportunity perhaps still come up with one or two things that – where we can
deploy money at a rate that may be quite a bit higher than other people, assume now
that money can be deployed. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yeah. We're willing to pay a little money now to have just a certainty of having a lot of
money available in case something really attractive comes up in a bit difficult time.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

Q - Mindy Jensen
Hi, Charlie and Warren. My name is Mindy Jensen and I'm from Longmont, Colorado. I
work for the largest real estate investing social network online called BiggerPockets.com.
We're seeing investors starting to get concerned that the real estate market is a bit
frothy, similar to the run-up of the 2005, 2006 and 2007 that led to the crash in 2008.
Warren, in 2012, you told Becky Quick that if you had a way to easily them, you'd buy
100,000 houses and rent them out. How do you feel about the real estate market today?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

It's not as attractive as it was in 2012. We're not particularly better at particularly real
estate markets than we are at stock markets or interest rate markets. But there's certainly
– and it's driven, to some extent, by these low interest rates, but there is certainly
Page 128 of 152

properties that are being sold at very, very low cap rates that strike me as having more
potential for loss than gain. But again, if you can borrow money for very, very little and you
think you're getting into some very safe asset, 100 basis points or 150 basis points higher,
there is a great temptation to do it. I think it's a mistake to do that, but I could be wrong.
I don't see a nationwide bubble in residential real estate now at all. I think in a place like
Omaha or in most of the country, you are not paying bubble prices for residential real
estate. But it's quite different than it was in 2012. And I don't think that next time around
the problem is going to be a real estate bubble. I think that it certainly was the cause in a
very large part of what happened in 2008 and 2009. But I don't think it would be the
replica of that. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Warren, Todd and Ted now have been at Berkshire for several years. What have been
their biggest hits and failures, specifically? And what have they learned from Charlie and
Warren and what are the biggest differences between you and them?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, I'll answer the last part, the easiest. I'm trying to think of very big deals that we can
do something in investments or in business, preferably, just in operating businesses. I
mean they still are – their primary job is working on – each has a $9 billion portfolio and
one of them has, I don't know, perhaps, seven or eight positions and the other one has
maybe 13 or 14. But they have a very similar approach to investing. They both have been
enormously helpful in doing several things, including important things, for which they don't
get paid a dime and which they're just as happy working on as working on the things as
they're when they're working on things they do pay off for them financially. They've got –
they're perfect cultural fits for Berkshire. They're smart at what they do and they're a big
addition to Berkshire. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Again I've nothing to add.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Did I cover the whole thing, Andrew, or was there one part I missed there? Did I...?

Q - Andrew Ross Sorkin

{BIO 6340618 <GO>}

Biggest hits and failures, I think I specifically wanted to know in terms of investments and
trying to understand the way you think, perhaps – I think the question was more focused –
Page 129 of 152



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc

I think my implication was the way they think and the way you think. Are there differences?

FINAL

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah, they're – I would I'd say they have a bigger universe to work with, because they can
look at ideas in which they can put $500 million and I'm trying to think of ways to put nut
(6:15:27) sums in the billions. And they probably – well, they certainly have a more
extensive knowledge of certain industries and activities in business that have developed
in the last 10 years or 15 years. They'd be smarter on that than I am. But their approach to
investing, I mean they're looking for businesses that they understand and that are going
to – and through the stocks of those businesses that they can buy at a sensible price that
they think will be earning significantly more money five years or 10 years from now. So, it's
very similar to what I'm thinking about, except I probably add another zero to it.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

And we don't want to talk about specific hits and failures.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

days that show what Berkshire does in marketable securities. But we don't identify – I may
identify whether it's mine or theirs. But we don't get into indentifying what they do
individually.

Q - Greggory Warren

{BIO 15185326 <GO>}

Looking at Berkshire's finance and financial products segment, there was a fairly
significant increase in the amount of cash carried on the group's books last year. After
holding steady between $2 billion and $2.5 billion during 2012 through 2014, the amount of
cash held at the segments spiked up to $5.4 billion at the end of the third quarter of last
year and $7.1 billion at the end of 2015. This incidentally coincided with your acquisition of
GE's railcar leasing unit as well as the acquisition of several railcar repair and maintenance
facilities. Sales and profitability were fairly solid last year, but don't really seem to account
for the magnitude of the change in cash. And investments, debt and other liabilities do
not look to have changed significantly enough to count for the difference, perhaps
accounting for about $1 billion of the increase. Just wondering where the additional $3.5
billion in cash came from and whether or not, the elevated level of cash at the end of last
year is excess to the business or a new required level of cash for the operations?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, I can't tell you where it came from. You think I would, $3.5 billion. But I can tell you
why we were funneling money into the parent company and in the finance company. That
money was basically dedicated to making the $22 billion portion of the Precision Castparts
purchased that was accounted for cash we borrowed. We actually borrowed $12 billion,
but $10 billion was what was – of the borrowing was there. And we pushed money from
various sources, depending on who owned what and sort of thing, we pushed money into
those two entities and eventually into the parent company to take care of the $22 billion
that was coming due turned out to be at the end of January, when the Precision Castparts
closed. There is really no significance to it other than that. Okay, station seven.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Alexis Christof orous
And there you have it, Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO, Warren Buffett; along with
Vice Chairman, Charlie Munger, ending the question-and-answer period of the Berkshire
Hathaway Annual Meeting. In just a moment, the formal shareholder session begins.
Welcome back to Yahoo Finance exclusive live stream of the Berkshire Hathaway Annual
Meeting coming to you live from the CenturyLink Center in Omaha, Nebraska. I'm Alexis
Christoforous joined once again by Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief, Andy Serwer. And what
a day, what an incredible couple of days here in Omaha, Andy, what was the highlight of
this meeting today for you?

Andrew Serwer
Well, I don't think there were any red-hot zingers Alexis and it's sort of the totality of all of
it. I mean, there were a lot of topics that he got to that Buffett and Munger addressed.
And I think that the way I'll look at it is, they had to sort of speak to a lot of things that
people had serious questions about; everything from global warming to sugar, to interest
rates, succession. And they're able to sort of handle all those really kind of tough
questions, quite frankly. And weave in their wisdom and levity. And basically, they're sort of
charming their shareholders. But that's a little understating it, because I think that they
were giving substitutive answers, very sophisticated answers. But I think it was kind of low
risk, low return meeting overall.

FINAL

That's a good way to describe it. Yeah. And towards the end there, we heard that
somebody asked about IBM and he stuck with his policy of not really talking about
individual investments, individual subsidiaries of Berkshire. So, I guess we couldn't have
expected much more out of that.

Andrew Serwer
Yeah. I think that's right. And with IBM, in particular, I mean, they said, both Munger and
Buffett said, the jury is out. They've got this big bet. And we don't know whether it's going
to work modestly or very well.

Alexis Christof orous
Right.

Andrew Serwer
I mean, that's optimistic. Similar things about American Express and other big investment
that it's very attractive, it's a very attractive business. Even if it was less attractive, it would
still be a good business to invest in.

It is and they're always ready, though, to say, hey, look, we may fail. We failed before, we
may fail again. The question of succession came up. We knew it would have to at some
point. And again, sort of not a lot of clarity there. And he brings up a valid point. He said,
listen, if we put a name out there now and this person wouldn't need to take over for the
next few years, their situation could change. So, why put a name out there if everything is
still so fluid?

Andrew Serwer
That's right. And with succession, though, Alexis, he did talk up Ajit Jain, who is his righthand man at the insurance business. And interestingly, Ajit Jain is a lot like Buffett in that
he is super smart, whip-smart, but also perceived to be a really decent guy and someone
people really like to work with and work for. And I know Buffett really like to work with Jain,

and you know how important that is. Buffett always say, he only likes to work with people
that he likes to work with.

Alexis Christof orous

FINAL

That's probably a pretty good policy in life, right?

Andrew Serwer
Yeah.

Alexis Christof orous
People talked about how they do their due diligence and sometimes they've come under
a little criticism, both Munger and Buffett about, do they do enough due diligence. And I
really liked his answer, because he said, at the end of day, it's about this human being I'm
going to be giving a lot of money to, and there has to be a level of trust there and how
do you do due diligence on a person, I mean there are some of the obvious ways. But you
have to have a little bit of faith, maybe a history with that person and a relationship there
that you believe in?

Bloomberg Transcript

Andrew Serwer
I mean, he'll do two things, Alexis, to your point. He'll have a conversion with this person
to get a feel for them and then he'll take a look at this paper, their numbers and he can
just sort of tell very, very quickly, better than most mere mortals.

Alexis Christof orous
Right.

Andrew Serwer
Both of those things, both of those things; your character...

Alexis Christof orous
Right.

Andrew Serwer
...and your balance sheet and your income statement, and just make a very quick decision.

FINAL

Alexis Christof orous
All right. Let's bring in the Nicole Sinclair now, who is down on the exhibition floor. And
Nicole, so much of this session was devoted to buybacks. Let me get your initial reaction
to the question-and-answer session.

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

Well, Warren Buffett has been outspoken in saying when his stock reaches 1.2 times book
value, he will buy back stock. And he was asked if there's some flexibility in that, would he
buy back at higher levels. And he answered that he probably wouldn't, but he value the
idea of if you have cash on hand, use it; if you think your stock is undervalued, put that
cash to work, buy back shares. He doesn't see anything wrong with that. Of course,
buybacks have been a controversial topic throughout this recovery, many investors and
analysts saying that buybacks have artificially inflated earnings – earnings per share. Buffett
really defending the role of buybacks from evaluation perspective, but really sticking to his
1.2 times metric, when he's going to buy back stock. At these levels, though, Berkshire, in
his mind, very cheap by historical standards.

Bloomberg Transcript

Alexis Christof orous
Also talked a little bit about capital-intensive investments and it's not something that
Berkshire Hathaway traditionally has done. But with Precision Castparts and with Burlington
Northern Santa Fe, he's now – and the renewable energy space, he's now entered all
those kinds of acquisitions, what did he have to say about that?

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

Yeah. He got a lot of questions about BNSF, about Precision Castparts, particularly
because BNSF has had to have a lot of investment to boost its business. He thinks, of
course, this is shift away from the core insurance business, which is still a very important
part of Berkshire. He highlighted the value of businesses that don't require a lot of
investment, but also said, you know what, there is only so much upside you can have
there. We have these other opportunities. He remains very positive long term for the
future for BNSF, for Precision Castparts. He is very bullish on aerospace cycle, of course.
And remember, keep in mind, Berkshire, 10 and one-quarter of their business, if you
include that Kraft Heinz stake (6:28:43), would be listed as Fortune 500 companies if they
were independent. So, he is really talking about huge portions of our economy that he's
really bullish on. He is bullish on the future of America. He is bullish on the future of
industry and the industrial sector and that really came through into the accession
(6:28:59).

FINAL

All right. We should just let folks know you're in front of a house, it's actually indoors,
you're not in suburbia. You're in front what's called the Clayton Model Home, it's one of
the subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway and that's why there's a price on it as well,
because shareholders get a discount on that house. So, if they buy this weekend, it's
$10,000 off the regular price. It's one of the benefits, I guess, of being a shareholder and
attending the meeting. All right. I want to take a look now, both Andy and Nicole, at one of
the questions that was asked during the question-and-answer session. Take a listen.

Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Because if it's true that we will and are eager even, from a financial standpoint, to buy it at
that price, it's really like having a savings account, where if you take your money out as a
dividend or as an interest payment on the savings account, you get $1. But if you leave it,
then you're almost guaranteed that we'll pay you $1.20. I mean, why would anybody want
to take money out of the savings account if they can cash it in what they left at 120%.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, it acts as a backstop for ensuring that a no-dividend policy results in greater returns
than it would be if we paid out $1 and people got $1. If they leave $1 in, they're going to
get at least $1.20, it might be at least – it's not a total guarantee, but it's a pretty strong
probability. So, would we increase that number? Perhaps, if we run out of ideas, and I
don't mean day-by-day, but if it really becomes apparent that we can't use capital
effectively within the company, in the quantities with which it's being generated, then at
some point the threshold might be moved up a little, because it could still be attractive to
buy. And you don't want to keep accumulating so much money that burns a hole in your
pocket. And it's been said actually that a full wallet's a little like a full bladder that you may
urge very quickly to pee it away and we don't want that to happen.

Alexis Christof orous
Speaking...

Andrew Serwer
All righty.

Alexis Christof orous
...the everyman speak. That's why we love Warren Buffett.

Andrew Serwer
Right.

Alexis Christof orous
Because he's able to give us analogies like that and again speaking to the issue of
buybacks and that he's ready to buyback if he feel he needs to.

FINAL

Andrew Serwer
Yeah. And he is also talking about cash and a propensity to spend it, Alexis. And these are
some sort of all chestnuts for Buffett. He loves cash. He loves businesses that throw off
cash. He's always buying them, always looking to acquire more. He gets a ton of cash in
these businesses. But he is very disciplined about not just spending it. On the other hand,
when he see something, he will just pounce. I mean, he will make an investment right
away with all that cash, but he doesn't let it burn a hole in his pocket.

Alexis Christof orous
And he also said that when he and Munger begin negotiations with a company, more
times than not it ends with them buying that company, or the deal happens.

Andrew Serwer
Right.

Alexis Christof orous

Bloomberg Transcript

More than often the deal happens as opposed to falling apart. Nicole, I don't know if you
were able to hear what we were just talking about and that sound bite from the session.
But just wanted to get your quick thoughts on his analogy there about a full wallet is like a
full bladder, you want to...

Andrew Serwer
What?

Alexis Christof orous
...pee that right away...

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

Yeah, I am in...

Alexis Christof orous
I'm quoting Mr. Buffett.

Nicole Sinclair

{BIO 20166308 <GO>}

...total agreement. He takes very complex issues, financial issues and makes them very
understandable for everyday investors, for everyday people. And that's one of the
reasons he's so beloved. And his stocks are real companies, of real products that you can
eat, feel, touch, live in, like this house behind me. So, his analogy there just really on point.

Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity

And really to add on to that, that 1.2 times bottom there for the stock really providing a
floor from a valuation perspective is something that many investors have pointed to as
one of the attractive elements for the stock. I spoke with Whitney Tilson before this
meeting. He is a very well-known investor, very bullish on Berkshire. And he really believes
that's one of the reasons that Berkshire is such a buy here. The upside versus the
downside is really attractive and he's really interested in it right here. And if you take a
look here at some of the topics really being talked about on Twitter, on social media, we
were monitoring all your tweets real time, succession was a lot of interest we see here,
the future, everyone's wondering what's next for Berkshire. And really from a valuation
perspective, again, many analysts, many investors saying that the stock already
discounting Buffett's age, already factoring in the bench that he's really developed over
the years, the way that he is really have the culture permeate throughout all of the
different businesses. And so, that's really important as we think about the stock going
forward.

Alexis Christof orous
All right, Andy, you wanted to add something?

Andrew Serwer

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. I mean, it's interesting, Nicole, that you said that, because there's a lot of reasons
why the stock could be higher. I mean, first of all, you have to get over the fact that it's
$220,000 a share.

Alexis Christof orous
Right. Class A shares. Yeah.

Andrew Serwer
That's not a valuation, that's just the actual price, of course. But it could be a lot higher, for
a couple of reasons. What if Buffett was 45 years old? I mean, imagine. That's number
one. Now, they were complaining Buffett and Munger, or actually was a question,
responding to a question about the fact that the company is not really Triple-A, which is
kind of surprising.

Alexis Christof orous
That's right, right.

Andrew Serwer
And that's because it's kind of complicated. It's a category of one, right. There is no other
company like Berkshire Hathaway. It's a holding company with insurance operations that
has big investments. What? I mean, that's like nothing. So, in other words...

Page 138 of 152



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2016-05-01

Alexis Christof orous
You categorize it, yeah.

FINAL

Andrew Serwer
...if it was less complicated, if the CEO was younger, if it had a Triple-A rating, would it be
$500,000 a share? Who knows? If Buffett lives for a long time, it probably will get to be
$500,000 a share. I mean, it could. I don't really know. When we make predictions like
that, they invariably don't come true. But...

Alexis Christof orous
You just said it.

Andrew Serwer
Well, well, it's funny, because I remember. I'm old enough to remember when it was
$8,000 and $3,000 a share.

Alexis Christof orous

Bloomberg Transcript

You should have gotten in.

Andrew Serwer
I know. And it seemed outrageous. And you're like, my goodness, this thing could never
go higher. Thousands of dollars, a stock trading for thousands of dollars, this is
impossible, it could never go higher. And now, it's a six-figure stock.

Alexis Christof orous
I know.

Andrew Serwer
Right.

Alexis Christof orous
It is hard to believe. But with Warren Buffett at the helm, maybe not so hard to believe.

Andrew Serwer
Yeah, I guess that's it.

about it, it's just very consistent in what it's produced for the shareholder.

Nicole Sinclair

It was a very animated stadium, a lot of laughter, a lot fun. Were you here early in the
morning? And what was the environment like among all the shareholders? Did you meet
new people?

We always meet new people and what to me is interesting to meet people from other
countries and their involvement and how strongly they believe in Berkshire Hathaway and
their performance and what they've passed and what they feel it's going to do in the

The next item of business is a motion put forth by the Nebraska Peace Foundation. Motion
is set forth in the proxy statement and will the projectionist please put up number nine.
Here we are. The motion requests that our insurance business issue a report describing a
response to the risk posed by climate change, including specific initiatives and goals
relating to each risk issue identified. Directors have recommended that the shareholders
vote against the proposal.
I will now recognize and I think he'll be up – (6:43:42) I will now recognize Dr. James
Hansen to present the motion, but I believe maybe the gentleman from the Nebraska
Peace Foundation may be introducing and then he may introduce Dr. Hansen.

Bloomberg Transcript

To allow all interested shareholders to present their views, I ask the initial speaker to limit
his remarks to five minutes and then those – the microphone in Zone 1 is available for
those wishing to speak for or against the motion subsequently. Zone 1 is the only
microphone station in operation.
For the benefit of those present, I ask that each speaker for or against the motion limit
themselves, with the exception of the initial speaker, to two minutes and confine your
remarks solely to the motion. And the motion should be left up on the – I see, is (6:44:34)
that up there or not?

Unverified Participant
Yeah.

Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Okay. The motion should be left up there. In a sense incidentally I – it ask us to present a
report about the risk to the insurance division by climate change and I did address this
subject in the annual report, that would be a report and it was a report that was concurred
by Ajit Jain, who is number-one expert on insurance risk. So, that does represent the view
of our insurance division and myself as the Chief Risk Officer, but the subject now is open
and we welcome the initial speaker's comment. And if you're just going to introduce Dr.
Hansen, I can see who's up there. Then I presume he will have the five minutes and then
subsequent speakers will have two minutes. So, go to it. You're on.

Thank you. My name is Mark Vasina. I'm the Treasurer of the Nebraska Peace Foundation,
the owner of one-eighth share of Berkshire Hathaway. We are the sponsor of the
shareholder resolution, which Mr. Buffett has described. In so doing, making the
recommendation to develop a risk analysis and report on it, we're following the lead of
the Bank of England, which last September published a comprehensive report on climate
change risks facing the insurance industry and recommended that its regulated
companies conduct reviews of the risks and make this available. The Bank of England
regulates the UK insurance industry, which is the third largest global insurance market.
I'll turn the rest of my time over to world renowned climate scientist, Dr. James Hansen.

James Hansen

{BIO 2273951 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you for this opportunity. I want to make a suggestion that I hope you will ponder.
Some aspects of climate have become clear. Humans are changing the atmosphere and
we can measure how this is changing earth's energy balance. More energy is coming in
than going out. So, the ocean is warming, ice sheets are melting and sea level is
beginning to rise. We are now close to a point of handing young people a situation that
will be out of control with ice sheet disintegration and multi-meter sea level rise during the
lifetime of today's young people, which would mean loss of coastal cities and economic
devastation.
Sea-level rise would be irreversible on any timescale of interest to humanity. The other
irreversible effect of rapid climate change would be extinction of a substantial fraction of
the species on earth. The bottom-line is that we cannot burn all fossil fuels and the
economic Law of Gravity is that as long as fossil fuels appear to be the cheapest energy,
we will keep burning them.
So, my request, given the respect and the trust the public has in you, is that you reflect
upon the possibility of a public statement in favor of a revenue-neutral gradually-rising
carbon fee. A carbon fee is needed to make the price of fossil fuels honest, to include the
cost to humanity of their air pollution, water pollution and climate change. A rising carbon
fee is needed to spur effective investments by the private sector in clean energies and
the energy efficiency.
Most important, it will steadily phase down fossil fuel use. So, I'm not asking you to
endorse the carbon fee on the spot, but I hope that you will reflect upon it and perhaps
provide a clear statement in your next report. It could be your greatest legacy. It could
affect everything, even the course of our future climate. Thanks.

Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Thank you, Dr. Hansen. I might say that we – although we may differ on some specifics,
and I don't know – I'm no expert on this subject, whatsoever. I don't think you and I have
any difference in the fact that it's important that climate change, since it's something
where there is a point of no return, if we are on the course that you think is certain and I
think is probable, that it's a terrible important subject, but the emotion that was put forth

Page 145 of 152



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc

FINAL

was relating to the insurance aspects of it. And we have discussed – believe me, we have
thought and discussed insurance aspects. And I've, in fact, given a report in the – which
was asked for by this, within the annual report.
So, it is really not – the issue before the shareholders is not how I feel about whether the
climate change is real or whether a carbon tax is appropriate, it's whether it poses a risk
to our insurance business. And I recognize the Bank of England read that report. But we
respectfully disagree with them in terms of – not in terms of the importance of climate
change, but in terms of the risk to our insurance business. We don't – we are not forced –
we don't write policies for a long period of time. We're not forced to write a policy on
anything. So, we are – our judgment has made as propositions are presented to us,
usually as to whether, for one year, we are willing to accept the given risk for a given price.
And that, obviously, climate is enormously (6:51:02) important in our activities, hurricanes
being the most important, probably, although we also get involved in earthquakes, but
that is what the proposal is about. And we've given a response to that and it does not
mean that we differ on the importance of climate change to the human race.
So, with that, I'd be delighted to hear from the various seconders.

Bloomberg Transcript

James Jones

{BIO 20692064 <GO>}

Hello. My name is Jim Jones. I'm the Executive Director of the Katie School of Insurance at
Illinois State University. I would like to express my concerns, based on three hidden risks
associated with the climate change. The first relates to stranded assets of insurers
investing in fossil fuels. The second is a more insidious risk related to climate change. This
risk is associated with the long-term liabilities associated with a property, life and health
lines of business. And I realize that a number of intelligent people and experts don't see a
long-term liability. But they're missing one important part is that primary insurers are not
able to withdraw or re-price books of – entire books of business.
Following hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, new hurricane models were developed in
Florida and they attempted to get the recommended rate approvals for that. They were
not allowed to. And so, many insurers began to withdraw from that market. 10 years later
that, about 40% of the underperforming business is still on the books of those insurers.
And this could play out in the several other states that are exposed to climate risk.
For a reinsurer, the value of reinsurance with their customers is a long-term business. The
reason why this is so important is because, according to my count, 156 of your reinsurance
customers have filed climate change disclosures. And these customers are looking for
long-term interest being protected by their reinsurer. And if not, there is potential for a
relationship to fault (6:53:46) risk that could occur, if they perceive your reinsurance as just
being one-year contracts that can be re-priced or withdrawn, and you enter into that
world of the expanding market competition of alternative reinsurance, which just last year
was $72 billion; and earlier this quarter, we set a record of $2.2 billion in cat bonds.

Thank you. I would point out that we have not been asked ever, to my knowledge, to write
long-term contracts. Our primary insurers know that we look at one year at a time. And we
will not write business that we think has a major negative probability, and they don't
expect us to. It's way less a relational business than in the past. It's much more a
transactional business. But we will not write – if we lose the customer, because they want
us to do something stupid, we lose the customer. And there is not a – in our business, I'm
not speaking for other reinsurers, but in our business, and I believe with most other
reinsurers, they are not going to do something that they think is terribly disadvantageous
to them. Just to maintain a relationship, that's not really a relationship and via subsidy
(6:55:26).
So, that does not strike me, frankly, as a factor at all of negative consequence at
Berkshire. But we – in terms of what happened after Katrina, rates went up and actually
the hurricane experience in Florida has been better than any period since before 1850
that we have any records on. That's been a surprise to us incidentally. But we have not
written business of – catastrophe business in Florida during that period, because we didn't
think the rates were adequate. They were adequate, we just were wrong about it.

Bloomberg Transcript

So the – and incidentally, that is not – the fact that we walked away from cat business in
Florida that we thought was mispriced does not hurt us in the business. It's really a – it's a
much more of a transactional business in the – there may have been a time when
relationships were very big in reinsurance. But with so many entrants in it, it is very much a
transactional business and no one expects you to do something that's very stupid. And if
what they do that, it's the wrong kind of a relationship. I'm glad to hear the next speaker.

Jane Kleeb
Hello, Mr. Buffett. My name is Jane Kleeb. I run a group called BOLD Nebraska, which was
part of an unlikely alliance who beat Keystone XL to protect the (6:57:07) state as well as
property rights. And I met you several years ago at Senator Nelson's home, and I had
pulled you aside and asked how could we get healthcare reform passed. And you told me
two things; you said the polling numbers matter and that we have to keep on applying
public pressure. And we feel the same way about climate change and climate action. The
most recent Yale study said that even 47% of conservatives believe in the climate change
and want to start seeing corporate and government action.
And your response to this resolution struck me, because one of the sentences said that if
you live in a low-lying area, you should probably move. Well, we work with native brothers
and sisters, who live in coastal communities and one of those tribes is now the first United
States climate refugees. They didn't have the option to move, they were forced to move.
And so, we're turning to you and we're turning to ourselves to continue to apply public
pressure and hope that both you and Charlie stands with us. And maybe it's not this year
and maybe it's not the year after, but we would really look forward to you doing full
climate risk analysis as well as divesting from all the fossil fuels that you own. And lastly, it
takes both small and mighty as well as big and powerful to solve this problem of climate
change. So, you blocking small solar in Nevada is the wrong road to go down. Thank you.

Okay. I think you'll have a reasonable time to move. But I will say if you're making a 50year investment in low-lying property, it's probably a mistake. I actually said you may – as a
homeowner in a low-lying area, you may wish to consider moving. And I would say that if
you expect to be there for 10 years or so, I don't think I would consider moving. But if I
thought I was making a 100-year investment, I don't know I would make it. I think, I guess
to the question, we have a shareholder proposal that says what are the risks to the
insurance division from climate change? We're not denying climate change is incredibly
important subject. We're not denying its existence, but it will not hurt our insurance
business and it's immaterial compared to other things that couldn't affect our insurance
business. And that is the issue before the meeting. But I'd be glad to hear from the next
speaker.

Good afternoon, Mr. Buffett. My name is K Karn (6:59:50). I've been a shareholder for
more than a decade, basically my investing life. Today, someone said that you think ahead
of the crowd. With regards to this resolution, you're saying that the Berkshire insurance
business will just raise rates the next time the policy is renewed and that makes sense.
But you agree that climate change poses a major problem for our planet. I would say that
climate change posses a major problem for the stability of our global financial markets if
the political action continues at its current pace with regards to this issue. I personally
agree with Dr. Hansen that a carbon fee is the solution to address this issue. I'm
wondering if you can tell us what you think the solution to address this issue is and
whether you think the Berkshire businesses more broadly than just insurance will be
impacted by this issue in the next decade or two.

Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. I would – I don't know if it would affect in the next decade or two, but I won't argue
with you at all that it's likely not certain that unless various techniques are designed for
reducing a wealth (7:01:13) for sequestration, different things of that sort, that plenty of
people will be working on, or unless the emissions – greenhouse gas emissions are
reduced significantly that it's a terribly important problem for civilization. And they've been
other – I mean, there's certainly going to be some very smart people working on ways to
change the balance in some way, either through less being released in the atmosphere or
by various techniques that might diminish the impact. But no one here will deny that it's
important. I don't think it will impact in the serious way, the climate – or insurance, for that
matter, in the next decade or two.
But as I pointed out in the report, if you're dealing with something where there's a point
of – you pass a point of no return, the time to do something isn't to really (7:02:21) get 10
minutes away from the point of no return, so that there are policies, which we've
subscribed to very strongly in terms of renewables and that sort of thing. But I think
there's also possibilities within the scientific communities that there will be solutions that
are beyond my limited knowledge of physics that can conjure up myself. But there are a
whole lot of people out there that are a lot smarter. And I think that a basic problem on
the reduction on the – if those things don't come to pass is the fact that it's a planetary
Page 148 of 152

problem and it requires corporation by very important countries. And I think President
Obama has done a good – made a good start in working with leaders of other countries.
But it can't be solved by the United States alone, as you know better than I. But be glad to
hear from the next speaker.

Hello. My name is Nancy Meyer (7:03:24), and I've been a shareholder for 15 years with my
husband. We have great faith in Berkshire Hathaway, that's why we invested. So, I'm just
here to say that as a shareholder, I'd like to ask my fellow shareholders to consider the
economic cause of climate change and urge Berkshire Hathaway to adopt this resolution
to show leadership in the insurance industry. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Thank you. I appreciate the fact you being our shareholder, but I do think – for reasons I've
laid out, I don't really think that the – I think the resolution is, in the sense, inapplicable to
our insurance business. I mean, insurance – global climate is not a risk to our insurance
business. It may be a risk to the planet over time, but that's a different thing. I mean, you
can – we can adopt all kinds of resolutions about saying that obviously nuclear proliferation
is a threat to the planet and you can say well then it's a threat to the Berkshire. But in
terms of being Berkshire specific, you can read the resolution. And like I say, our answer,
with Ajit Jain, probably the smartest person I know in insurance, and I have 99% of my net
worth in Berkshire that's all destined to go to philanthropic institutions and I'm not eager
to see that disappear. And I do regard myself as the Chief Risk Officer of Berkshire. And I
worry about things that can hurt Berkshire and I do not see it in our insurance division in
relation to climate change. But thank you.

Richard Miller

{BIO 1984613 <GO>}

Good afternoon, Mr. Buffett. I am Richard Miller in the Creighton Theology Department
here in Omaha, and I study and teach climate change and its social effects. I just wanted
to make you aware that Berkshire is operating within a larger economy and that the mostimportant climate analysis, economic analysis from Nicholas Stern indicates that on our
current path, by the end of this century, 30% loss in global GDP is possible. The other
issue is when we talk about doing something about climate change, doing something
means to avoid major sea-level rise, we need to reduce emissions globally, starting today,
7% per year. The only time we've ever reduced emissions over a 10-year period in a
growing economy was in the 1990s in England and we reduced them 1% per year. So,
we're talking about a completely different thing than President Obama's gradual move
and we need to do something. No, we need to massive transformation immediately. And
with your large global holdings, you are a world significant figure on this, not just about
this particular shareholder resolution.
Thank you for your time.

Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, yes. We're in Omaha, which is considerably above sea level and we have no big
economic interest in this subject in our insurance companies. We don't write much of that
catastrophic insurance we used to write many years ago. So, we're asked as a corporation
to take a public stance on very complicated issues. We've got crime in the cities, we've
got a hundred – we've got a thousand complicated issues that are very material to our
civilization. And if we spend our time on the meeting taking public stance on all of them, I
think it'd be quite counterproductive. And I don't like the fact that the people who
constantly present this issue never discuss any solution, except reducing consumption of
fossil fuels. So, there are geo-engineering possibilities that nobody is going to talk about
and I think that's asinine. So, put me down is not welcoming.

We don't want to have a political rally. The motion is now ready to be acted upon. There
are any shareholders voting in person, they should now mark their ballots on the motion
and deliver their ballot to one of the meeting officials in the aisles. Ms. Amick, when you're
ready, you may give your report.

My report is ready. The ballot of the proxy holders in response to proxies that were
