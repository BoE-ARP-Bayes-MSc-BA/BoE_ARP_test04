{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter
conference call. We posted strong results for both the second quarter and first six months
of 2017. Net income per share was up 48% to $1.48 from $1.00 in the second quarter of
2016, and for the first six months of 2017, our net income per share rose 41% to $2.67 per
share from $1.89 per share in the same period of 2016.
We ended the quarter with book value per share of $62.65, inclusive of dividends paid,
this is up 9.8% since June 30, 2016 and 5.8% since the beginning of this year. And as of
June 30, 2017, the annualized return on shareholders' equity was 9%, and since 2013 has
averaged just under 10%.

Bloomberg Transcript

These improving results demonstrate continued strong profitable growth, improvement in
our global platforms with the exception of some product lines underwritten in London,
which I'll address in more detail shortly. Higher net investment income generated by our
alternative portfolio, including a gain on the sale of another equity investment.
Overall, gross premiums written were up 22.6% in the second quarter and 19% in the sixmonth period of 2017. This strong growth partially reflects the acquisition of Ariel Re, but
our top line is also benefiting from the investments we've made in technology.
These digital initiatives which we've been talking about for the past few years are now in
vogue. For us, it's a differentiator and that they make it easier to do business with us by
simplifying the workflow, business process and better employing technology to drive
growth, even in a more competitive pricing environment.
Let me go through our underwriting operation. And just as a reminder, our international
business is defined as where we underwrite with not necessarily where the risk resides.
First in our U.S. operations, I am happy to repeat this quarter that Kevin Rehnberg and his
team are doing an outstanding job. Our U.S. operations reported a 13.4% increase in
gross written premium to $365 million. Net premiums were up 17% in the second quarter
of 2017 compared to a year ago and net premiums earned rose 10.8%.
While three of our four reported business lines within this unit grew versus a year ago, the
strongest growth was in our liabilities segment. We intentionally reduced our property
exposure. The second quarter of 2017 loss ratio excluding catastrophic losses and reserve
Page 2 of 13



Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td
Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2017-08-08

development improved to 57.4% from 57.7% reported in the same period a year ago, and
as a reminder, for the last several years, our loss ratio in the U.S. has been below 60%.

FINAL

While we did see an increase in the expense ratio this quarter, this was mainly attributable
to one-time IT expense charges as we continue to outsource some of our infrastructure
and the hiring of new people that we think will produce profitable business for us, and we
would expect these numbers to normalize by the end of the year.
We're reporting these strong results in our U.S. operations and what many have
characterized as an increasingly competitive market environment. So, one might ask, how
are we able to profitably grow in this type of market environment?
For us, the key differentiator is our specialty approach. We provide products that offer
innovative solutions for hard-to-place risks. In distribution, we have intimate relationships
with key brokers and continue to remove unprofitable relationships.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our diversified portfolio reduces our reliance on any one product or geographic region
and allows us to reallocate resources to the lines of business with better margins. And our
size is an advantage that allows us to be nimble and develop new technology to better
serve our clients and distribution.
Lastly, but a key part of the execution is bringing on experienced underwriters with
demonstrated track records of building profitable businesses. We've made several key
hires in both the U.S. and in our international operations, and will continue to capitalize on
the consolidation in the industry that has resulted in very talented, experienced
underwriters looking for a new home. Many have come to Argo.
These are the competitive strengths that we're leveraging to grow profitably in a market
where the pricing is essentially flat. When you look at the markets we operate in, size and
scale are not as critical as another market. For example, Colony, our E&S platform has
been in this market for more than 25 years, and the average size of the premiums written
in this business for us are about $6,000. In fact, over 90% of our business in this market
has an average premium of $25,000 or less.
These are numbers that we've talked about on previous calls, but I just thought I would
mention them again. In these markets, the speed that you can bind, deliver and service a
policy is the key to success, and again we've been investing in our digital solutions for
several years.
As a few examples, a number of years ago we made investments in technology to
enhance our systems and improve the speed at which we can bind and quote business.
I've mentioned previously that we've gone from taking four to 10 days to underwrite or
quote a policy to less than 24 hours to do so now, and I think we will continue to improve
upon that as this year progresses.

Page 3 of 13

Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2017-08-08

In the markets we're in, submissions remain high and the fastest one to quote the
business often wins. Our results in the U.S. demonstrate we're well on our way to winning
and gaining market share.

FINAL

We're also benefiting from new product launches, a few examples of recent product
innovation are our cyber, architect and engineer products in other professional lines.
Trident, our public entity business continues to perform strongly. Other areas like
Rockwood, our specialty workers' comp business, has benefited from an economic
turnaround, and they like many of our businesses have also streamlined processes to
operate more efficiently. Our surety and program businesses are also both growing
profitably.
Going forward, we'll continue to innovate, uniquely manage relationships and use
technology to make enhancements to the way we do business that should allow us to
profitably grow in areas where we otherwise would be struggling in a competitive market.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving on to talk about our international operations that include London, Bermuda, Latin
America and other emerging markets. These are being run by José Hernandez, who
joined Argo in October of 2016, and since the end of the first quarter of 2017, José has
strengthened his management team through two exceptional hires, we're very pleased
to welcome to the Argo team.
Jorge Luis Cazar has joined us in June to run our Latin American operations. Prior to joining
Argo, Jorge was running Global A&H for Chubb. And last week we announced that Matt
Harris is joining Argo to run our European and Asian operations. Matt has extensive global
experience and most recently, was running AIG's Southeast Asian Operations.
Another important appointment also announced last week was the new Managing
Director of our managing agency, Dominic Kirby, a 25-year industry veteran who joined us
with the Ariel Re acquisition earlier this year.
From a financial standpoint, we still have a few changes to make to bring the international
results up to our high expectations. In the second quarter of 2017, gross written premium
was up 35%, primarily driven by reinsurance business and by business in Bermuda and
Brazil. The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and prior-year reserve development is
56.3% compared to 48.1% in the second quarter of 2016 and for the six-month period, the
loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and prior year development was 55.5% compared
to 51.4%.
The difference in both calendar and accident year results is being driven primarily by
results in our D&F property book, which I'll talk about momentarily. Other than that, all of
our other platforms are growing well and growing profitably.
I've been very vocal about the issues in the London market, even questioning the
business model and sustainability in the past. In doing so, I'd emphasize that the London
Page 4 of 13



Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td
Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2017-08-08

market is becoming increasingly more expensive as both commission expense and
compliance expense continue to rise.

FINAL

This is despite increasing pressure on the cost of acquiring business, and it's an issue that
I think is being felt industrywide now, and I'm happy to point out that fortunately for us, as
other parts of our platform continue growing, they're becoming a more important part of
the group.
While it's not getting any easier at Lloyd's as margin pressure continues, particularly in
property, we continue to sculpt the book to optimize our underwriting margins at the
syndicate with an emphasis on our better-performing products.
Going forward, our International Operations should also benefit from the combination of
the increasing geographic presence, new management leadership, new products and
strong distribution relationships to help build upon our existing franchises, globally.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, turning to investments, Argo second quarter return was 1.6% versus 1.8% in the
second quarter of 2016. Year-to-date, we're slightly ahead of last year at 3.1% versus 3%.
You may remember that, the second quarter of 2016 was a strong quarter for our
portfolio as the credit markets recovered from the energy crisis.
For the quarter, our core bond portfolio was up 1.1%, and our risk portfolio was up 2.5%.
Our core bond portfolio benefited from a slightly flatter yield curve, spread compression
and a weakening U.S. dollar. Our risk portfolio benefited from the strong quarter in
equities and credit.
Year-to-date, the core bond portfolio was up 1.9%, and our risk portfolio was up 6.3%. Our
reported net investment income was $43.6 million for the second quarter of 2017, $8
million higher than a year-ago and $13.2 million higher than the first quarter of 2017.
Alternatives, which were positively impacted by the sale of the business during the
quarter were $20.6 million, and made up most of the increase both year-over-year and
sequentially.
As a reminder, we expect the alternative contribution to be lumpy by quarter, but as can
be seen in the table provided in our press release that we issued yesterday, the
economic gains over the past few years have been very positive.
Moving on to capital management, during the second quarter of 2017, we repurchased
$2.8 million or 46,500 shares of stock. As we've talked about in the past, we will capitalize
on opportunities when our stock price corrects to a level that does not in our view reflect
the value of the franchise we're building.
We recently had this opportunity in our stock, and since June 30th, 2017, we repurchased
an additional 56 – a little over 56,000 shares for approximately $3.4 million. That brings
our total repatriation through share repurchases and dividends to nearly $520 million since
Page 5 of 13

Date: 2017-08-08

FINAL

we began our share repurchase program, and our shareholders' equity has grown from
approximately $1.5 billion to approximately $1.9 billion during the same period, which
equates to a 10% combined annual growth rate and book value per share.
So, to summarize, yes, market conditions are competitive, but this is the market that
we're in. So, you can sit back and reduce volume and wait for the elusive hard market
where you can do what we're doing, and approach the market by developing better tools
through digitization, pricing and risk selection to improve returns as we've demonstrated.
The combination of our capital allocation and our underwriting results, and the total return
investment strategy of our portfolio is generating real value for our shareholders.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Axel Schmidt, our Chief Underwriting Officer, Axel?

Axel Schmidt

{BIO 19499069 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. As Mark mentioned, our gross written premiums
were up 22.6% in second quarter, and 19% in the six month period of 2017. In fact, we've
grown gross written premiums in all four of our major lines of business in both the second
quarter and for the first six months of the year compared to the corresponding 2016
period.
The proportion of Specialty business across the group in the first six months of 2017 has
increased to 22.6% of the overall portfolio from 16% in 2016. This is driven by the
acquisition of Ariel Re and growth in our U.S. program (16:29) business.
Our consistent growth across the whole portfolio has been short, but (16:34) the portfolio
remains diverse with the spread of products across all four major lines of business. This
diversification allows us to take a proactive approach to managing our portfolio across the
cycle result in over reliance on individual products or geographies.
We continuously monitor the performance of our products, product portfolios and
distribution partners. As identified in favorable trends, we would seek to address these
issues either by increasing rate, adjusting our risk appetite or by other underwriting
actions.
As I said before, and will continue to reiterate, it is vital that we maintain our underwriting
discipline and underwrite for profit and not for top line. The fact that we've demonstrated
growth across the portfolio does not mean we're only writing for top line, where business
does not meet our internal underwriting standards for whatever reason; we will keep on
declining this business.
Furthermore, we are regularly reviewing and are necessarily (17:38) optimizing our
portfolio mix. Mark mentioned the challenges in the Lloyd's market; that's an area we've
taken corrective actions in our property portfolio as Mark mentioned, and are ready to
take additional actions if required.

FINAL

However, we're not aiming to shrink to greatness. On the contrary, we've always followed
attractive opportunities to select specific lines of business and products; where we see
opportunities, we will go on making investments in underwriting teams and underwriting
systems.
We continue to utilize technology to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our
underwriting process, as well as utilizing this as a differentiator in the marketplace. This is
not a new initiative for Argo.
In fact, we recently celebrated the five-year anniversary for our first policy on our digital
platform Protect in Brazil (18:32) and that time, we've utilized the platform to serve
customers in more than 3,000 cities by over 2,000 brokers across Brazil.
During the second quarter, at Argo Pool, our global specialty lines (18:48) business, we've
strengthened our underwriting teams further by bringing in experienced underwriters,
particularly in the U.S. These talented underwriters are, along with our existing teams,
driving the development of new business opportunities, and are supporting our global
professional lines across all of Argo's six underwriting entities in professional lines.

Bloomberg Transcript

Additionally, our Continental European professional lines team are further establishing
themselves in our selected key markets.
As I mentioned last quarter, cyber is an area where we see significant market
opportunities. Our dedicated cyber underwriting teams across the U.S., Bermuda and UK
are constantly collaborating to leverage our expertise globally, and to ensure that we
deploy our capacity, effectively.
In the U.S. our Specialty Programs (19:41) business continues to grow from strength to
strength. Our gross written premium increased by 14.2% from Q2 2016 driven by our
Brownstone Excellent Programs (19:52). We continue to see opportunities in this area, and
have added further programs in the quarter.
Overall, there's pockets (20:00) of challenging areas across the portfolios, which we
continue to manage. I'm optimistic about the flow of popular new opportunities, we
continue to see – and the underlying talent that we have on reorganization to execute on
those opportunities.
With that, I hand over to, Jay to add some more commentary on our financial results. Jay?

Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Thanks, Axel, and good morning, everyone. I'll add a few details on the financials, and
then open it up to questions.
Of note, related to the growth, both Mark and Axel discussed, excluding business
underwritten by Ariel Re, which was acquired in February; year-over-year growth was 6.7%
Page 7 of 13



Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td
Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2017-08-08

for the quarter, and 8% for the six months. Again, this was driven by increases in most of
our U.S. core operations.

FINAL

In addition, the ratio of net to gross premiums decreased modestly, reflecting an increase
in certain front-end businesses, and the purchase of additional reinsurance protection.
Turning to the loss ratio, yet another outstanding quarter and six-month results from our
U.S. operations, somewhat less so in the International Operations as Mark mentioned. In
the second quarter 2017, we reported $1.1 million of favorable development compared to
$12.7 million in the second quarter of 2016.
For the first half of 2017, unfavorable development of $5.7 compared to $15.9 million of
favorable development in the same period of 2016. This quarter's result reflects
continued positive development in our U.S. operations, offset by adverse development in
our London operation related to property, liability and specialty lines in roughly equal
amounts.

Bloomberg Transcript

It's worth noting that the first quarter of this year included approximately $10 million of
development related to the Ogden rate change in the UK, analyzing claims – reported
claims for Hurricane Matthew. The breakout by U.S. and International is detail in the press
release. Catastrophe losses in the quarter were a modest $4.5 million compared to $22.7
million in the second quarter of 2017. Losses in this year's quarter are primarily from
smaller U.S. storms.
Turning to the expense ratio in the second quarter, the expense ratio was 38.8%
compared to 38.6% in 2016. For the six months ended June 2017, the expense ratio was
39.6% compared to 38.5% in the 2016 period.
However, approximately 1% of the six-month result relates to non-recurring items that
impacted the ratio, primarily in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding these non-recurring
items for the six-month period, the expense ratio was essentially flat.
Interest expense was up in the quarter, reflecting the $125 million term loan issued as part
of the Ariel acquisition, the inclusion of the outstanding Ariel junior subordinated
debentures, and to a lesser extent, to the increase in LIBOR, off which the rate on some
of our outstanding debt is based.
For the second quarter of 2017, the effective tax rate for the group was 9.4% versus our
base assumption of 20%. The lower than expected rate was mainly due to over half of
our earnings being attributable to our Bermuda operations.
We ended the quarter with a pre-tax, unrealized, embedded gain of $150 million
compared $134 million at March 31st and $116 million at year-end 2016. Majority of gains
are part of our equity holdings, our fixed income holdings remain very short in duration
and carrying value currently approximates market value.

Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take questions.

Q&A

FINAL

Operator
We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Greg
Peters of Raymond James. Please go ahead.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Good morning, and thanks for the call. I had three topics I was hoping you could respond
on. First, on the underlying loss ratio, I know, Mark you were talking a little bit about in your
prepared remarks, but looks to be about 200 bps higher in the quarter, and on a year-todate basis.
Just curious if that's sort of a new level run rate that we should be thinking about going
forward. And then, the other two questions, one's around the capital generation, you're
generating earnings and maybe you could comment on the M&A pipeline, because if
there's no M&A, I guess, you'd be more aggressive with a return of excess capital.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then finally on the new hires, Mark, some of the guys that you mentioned are coming
from companies with larger balance sheets. So I'm just wondering if there's any sort of
adjustment that they have to position themselves for success at Argo?

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Okay. Let's start with the loss ratio. I don't think, the run rate is higher. I made the point in
my remarks that actually the loss ratio excluding development and cats in the U.S. has
actually improved slightly; it's 57.4% now, which I think is a pretty good number.
Our loss ratio for our International business is a bit higher right now because of some of
the – we had to reset the loss pick for our DNS book, but as we continue growing the
other parts of International, I think, we'll see that come back down.
So I don't expect our loss ratio to be running two points higher going forward. I expect it
to be about where it is or as we continue changing mix of business, I still, think it's
possible that it comes down particularly outside of the U.S.
So, I think, everything is positive. All the business that we're putting on the books today,
we think has the same margins as what we've been reporting for the last few years in
terms of loss ratio. So, I'm feeling pretty good about that.
Jay wrote down the questions.

Capital generation and M&A.

FINAL

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Yeah, so, let's talk about capital management. I think, one of the things that we've done
really well over the last couple of decades is how we manage our capital. For the last year,
we've slowed down a little bit, the amount of capital that we've repatriated as we digest
Ariel.
You'll recall that at the end of – you'll recall that in February, at our year-end earnings call,
we increased our dividend by $0.05 a share, which was about 23% increase. With our
share price where it is, and now that we've finished digesting or I should say, integrating
Ariel Re, we've decided that for now, buying back stock is a good idea.
And as we get later in the year depending upon what happens during hurricane season, I
think, we will look at further capital repatriation. As far as M&A, there's always things to
look at, but we are always competing with a lot of motivated buyers, and sometimes that
works out for them, and sometimes that doesn't. So I think, we'll continue to manage our
capital prudently as we've done for the last couple of decades.

Bloomberg Transcript

And as for people, we have hired over the last four or five years, a few people from
larger organizations and they all seem to be fitting in just fine. I will note yesterday that,
Jose Hernandez did remind me that he still knows how to use Excel, even though he's
come from a large company. So (28:26) company and get things done yourself, and I think
the guys are fitting in just fine.

Q - Greg Peters

Great answers. Thanks for the follow-up.

Operator, next question please?

Operator
The next question comes from Jeff Schmitt of William Blair.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Hi, good morning, everyone. Looking at the expense ratio in the International side, it's
actually down in the first half of the year, despite pressures in the London market. Can you
maybe discuss what's driving that or what you're doing to bring that down?

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Yeah, a lot of it is mix of business, and the addition of bringing on the Ariel Re business to
the Argo platform.

FINAL

Okay. And then on the alternative investment side, how much of the returns are coming
from – I know there's an internally managed portion of that book. Is much coming from
that or is this just sort of more broader across the book. I know you invested in kind of a
wide array of securities there?

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Yeah, no, the returns for the quarter were across the whole portfolio.

Hi. Good morning.

Good morning.

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Good morning.

Q - Christopher Campbell

{BIO 20262752 <GO>}

Quick question on international if I may. So, the core loss ratio and reserve development
are both kind of worse year-over-year, and it looks like you're responding by lowering
your retentions on what appears to be this underpriced business.
So, I'm just curious, where is this underpriced business going now that you're – while
you're seeding it? Is it migrating more on a rated balance sheets or collateralized
sidecars?
Yeah, I am not sure that we're seating more of the business that we think is underpriced.
We're just letting it go. If our retentions are going up it's just – it's because of how we're
managing the total portfolio, not anyone class of business.
Okay. Yeah. I just saw the retentions were about 58% versus 69% year-over-year.

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

FINAL

To a lesser extent, that reflects an increase in trade capital. So that means – what does
that mean? It means we speak for a little bit less of the syndicate for 2017 versus 2016,
but those are what I'd call very much aligned business partners of ours.
So, they have the same level of interest in making sure that we underwrite profitable
business.

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Right, and included in that is the increased session ratio of the Ariel Re business on to
Syndicate 2019 (31:41) straight capital.

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

That's right.

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

That's the largest driver of change in session ratio year-over-year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Christopher Campbell

{BIO 20262752 <GO>}

Okay. So, you do see the difference in the seeding commissions. So, when we're looking
at that 280 bps year-over-year expense ratio improvement, how much of that is just a mix
shift, bringing on Ariel Re versus actual cost synergies that you're kind of squeezing out of
the platform now that it's on – now that it's integrated upon?

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Well, it's a combination of both change in mix of business and getting to scale.
Remember, part of the benefit of bringing Ariel on to our platform, was being able to
reduce some of the combined overhead, and we're starting to see some benefit of that
now, and as I mentioned in the last call, I felt we would really start to see that in the
second half of the year.

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

Okay. That makes sense. And just one final one if I can? Mark, you had mentioned the
expense structure challenges at Lloyds and I know that Lloyds is doing some redundancy

Presumably, we'll benefit from that, and I guess it remains to be seen what the quantum
is.
