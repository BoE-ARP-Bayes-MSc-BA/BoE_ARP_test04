MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Allianz Conference Call on the Financial Results
for the Third Quarter 2015. For your information, this conference is being recorded.
At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to your host today, Mr. Oliver Schmidt,
Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

Thank you. Yeah. Good afternoon from my side as well and welcome to our conference
call about the results of the third quarter 2015. There's nothing speciﬁc to be added from
my side today.
So, without further ado, I hand directly over to Dieter.

FINAL

Yeah. Thank you very much, Oliver. And good afternoon to everybody on the call. Let me
just dive directly into the presentation.
And I'll start with the business highlights. We continued to focus on new product
developments in retail property, in the Life & Health space also, mainly retail, and then in
Asset Management. And I think, in all categories, we are seeing very good progress,
which is then also visible into our proﬁt margin and new business developments in the
segments. I will come to this later.
In the investment space, we had a successful quarter with some really headline-making
large investments in Germany, UK, but also in Ireland, helping to diversify our investment
portfolio.
So, now let's start with the numbers.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, page 5 on the group of all results, a €2.5 billion operating proﬁt, might have seemed
by some of you as a small disappointment. Actually the underlying operational results are
unchanged on a high quality level and also very good. But ﬁnancial markets had some
particular volatility in Q3. So, FX results, volatility in equity markets also inﬂuenced the
P&C and Life & Health segment results. So, that created some negatives, and I will explore
on the details of this when I come to the speciﬁc segments.
Total revenues down, mainly coming from the Life segment, because P&C and also Asset
Management is in revenues up in the third quarter. And the reduction in Life & Health is
very welcome by us because it's an evidence of our expansion strategy that we are clearly
reducing the volume in traditional single premium business and replacing it with new
products. But, so far, the lower volume and new business value and new business margin,
when we come to this page, is clearly demonstrating that the strategy is working.
Net income is more down than the operating proﬁt. Added to the reduction in operating
proﬁt is a higher tax rate and some more impairments also coming from Q3 number, the
ﬁnancial market movements, that explains the diﬀerence. But already, to be mentioned
here, I'll come back to this also at the end of the presentation. We stick to our operating
outlook for 2015. We are well prepared for a very good year-end, as predicted.
Now the capital page. Shareholders' equity actually slightly up in total. Unrealized gains
did not move a lot. We had oﬀsetting eﬀects between European government bonds and
corporate bonds. So, one has widening spreads, the other has a reduction in spreads, and
also base interest rates.
And in the equity markets, actually the unrealized gains stayed quite stable. The stocks
which were impacted by the market actually directly go through the 20% hurdle and we
have impaired them in the quarter. That should not surprise you. That is quite a lot of
stocks in the energy and commodity sector, which mainly created immediate
impairments.

FINAL

So Solvency II capitalization at 200%, and we are now really converging to the number,
and IMAP approval I would expect in the next couple of weeks.
The 12 percentage point down is split into three categories. Number one is market
movements, these are just 5 points. And if you want to test it against our published
scratch numbers from last quarter, use 20 basis points on the interest rates and 7
percentage points on stock market movement, and that gives you both sensitivities
combined 5 points movement.
The next 5 point is coming from adjusting to EIOPA rule on how to calculate U.S.
equivalent. And we moved from the 100% CAL to 150% CAL, and that is the
recommended formula by EIOPA. And the last 2 percentage points are ﬁnal adjustments
coming from the German regulator on our IMAP, mainly aﬀecting our German solvency
ratio. And then the 2 percentage points eﬀect on a group level.
And then, there were some smaller changes coming from the IMAP approval process,
which are adding up to 0%, because there are pluses and minuses. So, overall, a very
comfortable level, ready for the ﬁnal goal on Solvency II and still the same dividend level
as promised last year being accrued.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, moving to the P&C numbers.
Internal growth, nominal 2.4%. If you correct for acquisitions and FX, only 0.6%. Actually
we still have a pretty good growth in our core markets. However, in Germany, same
strategy as we do in Life, we reduced traditional products with guarantees. And please be
reminded that we have a fairly large book in Germany in the retail accident business,
which is the savings product with guarantee, which is sold as a single premium product
and therefore the same strategy as in Life has been applied here.
When I ignore this product line and I go to what you would also see as European fee
business, Germany has actually a growth rate above 3% or even close to 4% in the
quarter.
The other reductions are coming from Brazil, further cleaning up of the portfolio, but I
would say aggravated by the macro picture in Brazil which clearly darkened. Then the runoﬀ of our Russian retail, we are now with our Russian retail business year-to-date 95%
down compared to the year before. And then Fireman's Fund has also continued to
reduce volumes. So, there are the negatives in the overall growth.
And then we are very more careful underwriting in our global line business, credit
insurance as well as the large corporate business and specialty business. So the growth is
really coming more from the retail and mid-corp businesses. I would really positively
highlight our Allianz growth by partners, that is the Global Health and other response
(8:58) business, as well as Australia and Spain, who has a real run in its business
development because you will see that I highlight Spain also on the following pages
further.

FINAL

So, moving to the results in P&C. Combined ratio at the ﬁrst glance could be ﬂat with
94.1%, so a tick-up in total, but underlying some moving ﬁgures. So, ﬁrst of all, last year
was free of cat events. This year we had 120 basis points. Last year we had a run-oﬀ result
of 2.6%, where we had a big negative coming from Fireman's Fund, about 1.8 percentage
points this year. We don't have a negative from Fireman's Fund. So, the positive run-oﬀ
across the segment is roughly the same, the 4.4%.
Expense ratio tick-up, there is a one-oﬀ eﬀect, as we have reallocated in our expense
(10:10) business some numbers between loss ratio, so service provided versus expense
ratio. That is neutral for both numbers, but it is a shift between the two lines. And then we
see also a further mix change with the trends to higher commission and acquisition cost.
So, therefore, the expense ratio is up.
The underlying loss ratio is suﬀering a little bit from large losses more, but not signiﬁcant.
I think that is some 40 basis points, 50 base points. And then, we see also, clearly, a
deterioration of the numbers coming from Argentina. And we have booked in Argentina
actually additional $50 million split between prior year and current year.

Bloomberg Transcript

That is a catch-up on the deterioration of the inﬂation rate in Brazil. And we have to turn
this business. This might be – that is in Argentina easier than in Brazil. We are already on a
track to increase at the moment our prices by 2.5% to 5% per month, because Argentina
motor runs on 30-day policies and not 6 months or 12 months policies.
So the operating proﬁt in P&C is down compared to last year by €70 million. And it is all
coming from the investment results, underwriting a very small reduction that is the slight
uptick in the combined ratio. And I'll come to the investment results in a moment.
Let's look, ﬁrst, at the operating proﬁt development country-by-country. And the
combined ratio, when you look at the individual combined ratio, I think the strong
combined ratio is really supported by a broad basis of successful large entities, our
Continental European home and core markets, Germany, Italy and France. That is AGCS,
which continues to have a very good result.
The 98.6%, which you ﬁnd here on the page, you have to split into the old AGCS business
and the Fireman's Fund commercial business addition. AGCS standalone is below 91%
and Fireman's Fund is 117%, So, still above 100%. We have actually in this quarter still
booked some cleaning up. We have not increased reserves, but we have cleaned up
some other commitments from full participations receivables or other smaller balance
sheet items. And then we had a ﬁnal settlement with the disposal of the businesses with
ACE. So, all-in-all, that cost us about €45 million in operating proﬁt for the quarter, so that
was a smaller clean up.
The Latin American number, the big negative is coming from Argentina, as I explained
already, and Brazil is also still negative as the environment really delayed I would say the
recovery quite some time. The other numbers are still all very strong. And again, I would
point out to Spain, which is not only growing but with a 85% combined ratio also doing a
great job on creating margin.

FINAL

The other businesses are pretty much in the area what you would have expected, where I
should add here that we see in Germany, France and also Belgium actually quite some
smaller weather-related claim events in the third quarter, nothing which has been called a
cat, something which is just costing some money.
And for example, in Germany, our normal quarterly budget would have been 6.3% for
weather and we consume 6.7%. So, that is – and for France, the diﬀerence is big, and also
Belgium has some eﬀects of this that aﬀects us this part of the continent.
If we move to the investment numbers of P&C, so page 15. The running yield income is
pretty stable. So, all decline in yield has been compensated by higher asset volume and
we run pretty ﬂat on investment income. However, foreign currency investments held in
the hard currency balance sheets created some €70 million loss in the quarter, because
foreign currency goes trading directly with exchange of the currency. And that is all of the
reduction in our P&C number here.

Bloomberg Transcript

And I just mentioned FX. In the total group balance sheet, the FX trading result of the
quarter was on a gross basis €600 million loss. In P&C, the share growth straight (16:01)
for the shareholder. In Life, it's of course depending on what balance sheet it is split with
the policy holder.
So, that is the volatility of Q3. In October, actually a third, so around €200 million of the
€600 million returned to the positive. So, even if you don't know what will it be on
December 31, it is at least a good start into the year-end quarter. And with the other
information, I think on the reinvestment rate duration, there is nothing to talk about in
particular, it's all business as usual.
Let's move to the Life business. Yes, 10% reduction in volume, a lot of single premium
reduction. Actually, when we would use what we are not doing but maybe here for
comparison with our peers, the APE terminology. Our APE is actually 9% up in new
business year-over-year, because we are writing a bigger fear in recurrent premium. And
single premium is down. We are in recurrent premium slightly up.
So, that is the ﬁrst visible change in the mix. And when we then go to the diﬀerent
markets, you can see in detail that the traditional business, so the traditional guarantees in
Italy, in France and in Germany is down and we have placed it with unit-linked business in
Germany with the product with the new lean guarantee type, which is consuming less
capital.
And we will actually on our Capital Markets Day explore this section much more to show
you also the eﬀect on capital consumption and what does it mean long-term. The only
volume number where you could say, well, that is not great, is actually the new business
volume in the U.S., which is currency adjusted 30% down.
So our market share in ﬁxed index annuity moved from 30 percentage points we had last
year to 20 percentage points in 2015. 20 percentage points is still at the upper end of our
long-term market share in the ﬁxed index annuity space and we have probably a bit

FINAL

underestimated how fast the competition will copy our (19:01) product. And not only
copying it, actually putting it with more aggressive terms into the market. The new
business value we have generated out of the business this quarter is really very good. And
I would come to the new business value in a moment. Let me ﬁrst spend a minute on the
operating proﬁt development.
You see an increase in the investment margin that is sometimes a bit diﬃcult to
understand the eﬀects that we have in the policy holder, shareholder split in Germany to
do the catch-up for the whole nine months, depending on how the realized gains and
losses and overall investment income develops for the full nine months.
And the low participation for the shareholder in Q1 is now turning into a higher
participation in Q3. And overall, we are still on track for the full-year result. I think the
German results are much easier to understand as we have the 12 months together
because that is then the legally binding allocation of the proﬁts to shareholder and policy
holder. So, therefore, during the year, it is always a bit of volatile proxy for really targeting
the policy holder credits.

Bloomberg Transcript

That grows the investment margin here in numbers up. However, we have two big
individual negatives in this P&L for the quarter that is on one hand another write-down of
Korea of €148 million. This time it is both Life product with traditional guarantees above
6% of the guarantee levels of this block. And in the last quarter, we had old block of
Health business, which also has high guarantees, which was being evaluated and being
written down.
For the next quarter, as we have now covered both blocks of business which could create
trouble, we are not seeing any further write-downs. Actually last year, we had this Life
block write-down in Q4, and now it is in Q3. So it is a bit also advancing, when you want
to compare it to 2014 what we had a quarter later last year.
So the other negative one-oﬀ in the overall numbers is actually out of the dynamic
hedging process of our old VA business. We had a €100 million base risk negative. The
base risk in the old VA block is very simple, coming from the fact that customers' money is
in actively managed equity funds and the hedging goes to index funds.
And when active managed equity fund moves diﬀerently than the index, you create a
base risk. And that base risk was actually very benign, and in the last two years, in most
quarters slightly positive. This quarter, it created a €100 million hit, which is buried here in
this operating proﬁt development.
So now coming to the new business margin. We put the new business margin in the
heading because 3.0% is the second best new business margin the group ever reported.
Only before the ﬁnancial crisis, there was one quarter or two quarters with a better
number. So 3.0% is a tremendous success in this environment and it is a tremendous
success for our business mix change strategy.

FINAL

So how do I get from the last quarter's maybe disappointing number to this quarter's 3%
number? First of all, we are using for the evaluation of the new business margin always the
interest rate curve at the beginning of the quarter. So we talk here the Q2 was evaluated
at April 1. And when you would evaluate the second quarter at July 1 interest rates, then
we would have seen 2.6% new business margin at last quarter. So here you have 3.0%, so
it's 40 basis points to mix change. And we are expecting that in the next year to continue
our trend to move the new business mix.
Also, I told you already sometime ago that we are adjusting in the U.S., the fee schedules
as expense charges to price for higher new business margin. That is now becoming
visible in the Q3 numbers with 3.8 percentage points new business margin. And again,
Spain has not only a very good growth in new business, but also this 4.8 equates average
interest rate and is producing a nice new business value.
As we have a look at the overall investment margins, the investment margin overall is 22
basis points. Our midpoint new business margin is 17 basis points a quarter. That is our
expected value for each quarter. So therefore 22 basis points is at the upper end. So, from
a structural point of view, the investment portfolio and the numbers are very strong.

Bloomberg Transcript

But you can also see that the net harvesting number was negative which has equity
impairment and the FX losses, but mainly coming from Germany compensated by the
policy holders. Therefore, you see in the mechanics an oﬀsetting eﬀect under the proﬁt
sharing and the net margin for the shareholder is pretty stable.
That does not mean that the policy holder are not getting anything in Germany. Actually,
for the whole nine months, the proﬁt sharing percentage for the policy holder is slightly
higher than the year before. And duration we are managing to a fairly high level. So we
continue to run our duration gap below half a year, which is I think a good and stable
evidence of our risk policy.
Now coming to the assets under management. I believe that this is the second positive
story I can talk about today. PIMCO's outﬂows €16 billion. That is certainly substantially
less than the previous quarter. So we are very well on track in the reduction of the
outﬂows and that is further evidenced by the October numbers.
In October, we have for both asset manager achieved positive net inﬂows. So PIMCO has
in October, since April 2013, the ﬁrst positive inﬂow month. And Allianz Global Investors
had in October another good month. Here the quarter number for Allianz Global
Investors is €1.3 billion. Now the last four quarters I think aggregated some €18 billion of
net inﬂows.
The assets under management were aﬀected by markets, equity markets down and also
corporate bond market, the credit spread widening down, so 2.8% market value loss. Also
this is looking completely diﬀerent in October. So, therefore, we had certainly for asset
management a very good start into the last quarter of the year and we are looking
forward to the year-end results.

The revenue development for asset management are now on 27. It's 1.1% up where the
underlying fees and commissions 11%, down on currency adjusted that is still driven by the
outﬂows we have experienced over the last four quarters obviously. The plus is coming
from the performance fees which we ﬁrst booked in September. And I told you in the
beginning of the year that you will see in the PIMCO operating proﬁts a big anti-load as
development that we are expecting in the last month of the year, starting in September, a
series of one-oﬀ performance fees where we have booked the ﬁrst number here in
September as just being mentioned.
The revenue margins are pretty ﬂat in development, actually PIMCO with €39.7 billion in
2015, and this margin excludes obviously the performance fees, we are a pickup against
second quarter and a further pickup against the ﬁrst quarter, so all very stable
developments. In Allianz Global Investors, there is some more complex stories because
we included and changed beginning of the year some advisory mandates, which we
included in our assets under management calculation. That is the main driver for the shift
of the fee margin. When I do it on a like-for-like basis, the margin development is very
unexciting, ﬂat.

Bloomberg Transcript

So now what does this mean for the operating proﬁt of the asset management space.
Clearly, when you start with last year's third quarter, the volume eﬀects are what they are.
The performance fee is the positive impact and then we also have made in a like-on-like
basis improvement in our cost to income ratios.
When I start with Allianz Global Investors, here showing a 74.5%, but we have booked in
the third quarter €34 million restructuring charge to really improve the cost to income
ratio in the upcoming years more, and that is the ﬁrst half of the restructuring charge we
will probably see in 2016, more of it. When I take out the restructuring charge, AGI was
already at 68.5% cost to income ratio which is, since we started the setup in the current
form, the best cost to income ratio so far and clearly below the 70%.
PIMCO, including performance fees, below the 60% level. But let's do a fair comparison
to the second quarter and ignore the performance fees for a moment, then we can
actually see a 2 percentage point improvement against the second quarter for no
additional one-oﬀ burdens, but also improvement in the underlying expenses, in
particular back-oﬃce administration also oﬀshore services.
So, overall, the €600 million operating proﬁt for the asset management business looks
not only very good, I think, but the underlying explanation makes really hope and
appetite for the future in asset management.
Corporate segment with the uneventful ﬂat, nothing really especially to report on it. And
then I would go to the last page of my presentation, the translation from operating proﬁt
to net income. Clearly, additional write-downs driven by Q3 markets. That was €100
million more than last year.
And when we ignore the slightly complex tax treatment last year where we did win with
our Life business a big court case for old tax claims, when we leave this aside, our tax rate
Page 8 of 26

FINAL

worsened by 6 percentage points compared to last year. We had last year some tax-free
realized gains. This year we have more tax-free realized losses. And also we have actually
a planned restructuring in Italy where we are merging and collapsing some scaﬀolding
structures, which cost us some money. Therefore, the tax rate in Q3 is higher than what we
would like to see as the long time version.
And now I'm coming to the summary. Nine months revenues still up. Clearly, the Life
volumes trending down, but I think to the beneﬁt of shareholder and also policyholder
because they are now getting the better product with the lower guarantees and higher
returns.
Operating proﬁt ﬂat against last year. So, therefore, a very promising starting point for the
last quarter of the year, where we have to expect at least some of the things we can
control, less one-oﬀs when the ﬁnancial market goes yo-yo around Christmas that I cannot
inﬂuence.
And shareholders' net income is 4% up compared to last year, with a positive outlook for
the year-end operating proﬁt. So, that number should be then also relative to last year
improved further. And we are in a very strong capital position and balance sheet position,
a 200% Solvency II ratio and we are seeing the IMAP approval shortly happening and we
are very well prepared for it.

Bloomberg Transcript

And with this one, I will stop here and look forward to your questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now take our ﬁrst question from Farooq Hanif from Citigroup. Please
go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thank you very much. Firstly, I've got two questions really, but ﬁrstly on Life. In
terms of your outlook for earnings growth, there's two contradictory things going on here.
Firstly, obviously your new business sales are down a lot, but new business margins are
sort of – sorry, new business proﬁt is kind of ﬂat.
But, on the other hand, the IRR has gone through the roof. It's really strong annual
payback period on that business seems to have fallen to four years based on your current
assumptions. So what I wanted to ask is, are we kind of going into a new paradigm of
halting growth for the sake of Solvency II and low interest rates and margin management?
Or do you actually think, if you add these three things together, your positive earnings
can actually grow?
That's a long question. So, I got question one. And the second question, in LatAm, you
talk about the sort of delay in the turnaround progress. Does this feel a bit like Russia?
Page 9 of 26

Obviously, for diﬀerent reasons, diﬀerent drivers. So, I mean, is this not high in the agenda
for exiting? Thanks.

FINAL

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Okay. So, thank you very much. I think the better IRR is coming very much because the
products are consuming less good capital and that is clearly a driver and improvement for
it. So, for the customer, the products are actually more attractive, but also for the
shareholder. I think we have adjusted really very well this year to the Solvency II world a
big time.

Bloomberg Transcript

You could argue that we maybe started later than some others, but I think we are now
running a more complex strategy not only to moving to unit linked and risk products, our
strategy is uniquely in risk products, yes, but a big focus on the capitalized or capitaleﬃcient product for this other alternative guarantee concept, which we are running now,
whether it is the ﬁx index annuity in the U.S., then copies of this product in the German
markets plus some new and innovative developments for the German market speciﬁcally.
And that allows us actually to show the bigger IRR. That this product needs to be training
with all the sales forces and also with independent ﬁnancial brokers that therefore the
volume is going down when you say, I don't want to give you the traditional product, I
would say that is a transition phase.
I don't think it has anything to do with the product that is now acceptance and training.
And when more – actually in Continental Europe, it would be good for us then more
market participants would copy our product strategy, because then it is becoming much
easier as a market standard. And then we can, I think, with the size of our organization and
the advantages we have in having dealt with this product earlier, I think also call our
market shares further.
LatAm, I would not compare it with Russia at all. Russia was a structural problem of the
market, which disadvantaged foreign players against local players. I cannot say the same
in Brazil. I think in Brazil is an open market and everybody who is doing the right things
can be successful. And we are still believing that we can do the right thing.
But the economic outlook in the country has changed quite a bit. And therefore the
transition, in particular in hotels (40:34) but also in motor retail, it's a bit harder.
Customers are really very keen to get the best price oﬀer and the negotiations are
tougher when an economy is not doing well. And that is the main reason for the Brazilian
delay, but we stick to our plans. So, don't mind this answer. Sorry.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

So, yeah. And sorry for the long questions as well. But just quickly, so are we within sight
of proﬁtability within a year, two years?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

I think it takes a year longer than we have hoped. But I think we are turning. And still for
me Brazil, but also now Argentina is clearly important upside potential for next year.

We will now take our next question from Michael Huttner from JPMorgan. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Fantastic. I'm going to lobby for you, obviously this is not a real question, but I was just a
bit surprised that you're cutting costs at AGI when they're doing so well and I just
wondered why that is? It's a bit of a lobbying question, I apologize for that.
And then as a completely oﬀ the world question, and I may have misunderstand these
things, since you're writing new business in Life, capital light and you're stopping the
capital intensive, presumably the Life's embedded value account is slowing up, is
releasing lots of free surplus. What are you doing with that money? Thank you.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. So AGI, the cutting cost exercise, these are mainly on back-oﬃce and administrative
functions. We are actually globalizing functions. We could have globalized already
sometime ago, but it's the ﬁnance function and other back-oﬃce function. So it will not
stop the great distribution and products development as well as product successes. So
we do it really in a very measured basis to the beneﬁt of both sides.
The new business in Life, yes, that is the long-term idea that the new business mix is
creating a higher Solvency ratio for each of the balance sheet. That will be one of the
levers we are using to improve the IFRS ROE of our Life OEs. And exactly on this point we
will explore further on the Capital Market Day on November 24.

Hi. Afternoon. I've got three questions, please. Firstly, on capital. Given these are sort of
nominal (43:50) numbers, and you've included a couple of IMAP adjustments, are these
basically your sensitive numbers, obviously, without the formal approval, ﬁrst question.
Second question, on performance fees, can you comment on a little bit how much your
freed up performance fees, and I was expecting more of this to come through 4Q and
3Qs. I want to know how much we've got less for 4Q. Can you give some guidance,
please?
And then just, ﬁnally, just a follow-up on the Life product changes. Obviously here this is a
good news for ROE. I just wonder whether you need to do more in terms of expense
management at some point on the back, but given I think should not replacing the
nominal proﬁt you'd be generating on traditional products for this new style guarantee
Life products? Thank you.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The performance fees, certainly there is substantially more to come, but I would not guide
to a speciﬁc ﬁgure because the booking and accounting of this performance fees is
spread over September till January, potentially February. So how much will exactly hit
three months, I think, that is too diﬃcult for me to estimate it precisely. And you would
only shoot me afterwards and I'm giving the wrong number and I want a peaceful
Christmas this year.
So, on Life, well, in a number of policies, we are not reducing. So, therefore, the admin
task as such will stay the same. The new products are not less complicated. So, that is not
a natural source of savings. And actually when you want to improve the IFRS result and
CRE, the risk management actions what you can take are bigger drivers than admin costs.
Before you'll see the impact of admin costs in the Life ROE for our Continental European
businesses, I think you'll have to send every second employee home that you'll see
something and that I wouldn't see possible to run the business like this. So, therefore, it is
a driver, but in magnitude pretty small.

We will now take our next question from Nick Holmes from Société Générale. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Oh, hi, there. Thank you very much. Couple of questions. The ﬁrst is actually again on
Solvency II. Dieter, I just wonder how you justify the 150% CAL coverage when, as you
know, peers are on 250% and 300%? And then diﬀerent probably just wanted to look at
Italy, and the combined ratio is exceptionally good. And just wondered if you could
explain a bit more how sustainable you think that is? Thank you very much.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Well, I think the justiﬁcation is pretty simple on the U.S. equivalent. That is the oﬃcial
rule communicated by EIOPA and the German people are obviously very simple, they just
follow rules. And but also for the CAL it is a more complex concept because, depending
on your business mix in the U.S., 100% CAL is translated in European language quite
diﬀerent depending on what business you are writing.
And when you look at our net asset value levels in our U.S. Life business, which are
substantially higher also when you divide it, for example, by the asset of the balance
sheet, you see that our capitalization and our U.S. subsidiary is substantially higher than
some of the peers you have mentioned. And that it won't be another explanation why
150% is sometimes a better number and a bigger number than 250%.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Dieter, that's very interesting. Can I just follow up on that? I mean, do think other
regulators who are requiring 250% and 300% are interpreting EIOPA's 150% guidance in
the same light that you described, i.e., they are looking at the quality of the CAL ratio?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

I think that is clearly among the European regulators an understanding that regulation for
VA and the U.S. has not moved a lot since the ﬁnancial crisis, and the European regulators
still they are watching this development. And that is always when you have any discussion
on the international capital standard between U.S. and Europe, that is the main discussion
point. And therefore, the CAL is would say is VA-adjusted in its interpretation by the
European regulators. We all have developed a good understanding of this and the
regulators in Europe are smarter than many people believe here.

But, just one ﬁnal question. I mean, is that interpretation entirely judgmental or is there
any additional guidance that you're giving over how to measure the relative risks of the
VA book and stuﬀ like that? Well, is it entirely out of the judgment of the Dutch regulator,
and the French, and the British?

FINAL

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

I think, what you – the latter you said is true.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

I'm not going to – maybe they have an internal discussion about this and discussed it in
the EIOPA board meeting together, but I am not participating in this month. So, then
you'll have to ask the regulator on this one.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

That's very helpful. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yeah. And the Italian combined ratio, sure it is a really good combined ratio, and we have
a strong advantage over the markets since many years and quarters. So the distance to
the market has not moved a lot. And we should also – actually we included the Unipol
business in this and still the combined ratio stayed at a very excellent level.
And I would expect that we still see pressure from the motor business. But we have, for
example, when I compare it with a year ago, we have a 10 percentage point improvement
in our commercial business. And so, to reduce Italy to motor-only is maybe not fair to our
Italian colleagues.
Plus, what I mentioned on the ﬁrst page, our retail non-motor product, which we are
selling now with large number of pieces, is also contributing to a stable good combined
ratio and that eﬀects we are managing. And I would see, yes, clearly pressure from motor
in the next year, but also positive in the other categories. So, overall, still a very strong
outlook for our Italian business.

Q - Nick Holmes

We will now take our next question from Andy Broadﬁeld from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.

Q - Andy D. Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

Oh, hi. Good afternoon. A few questions for me. So, the ﬁrst, just on reserves, can you just
give us a bit of a feel for where the release is coming from? Whether there's been any
changes over the last few periods, as to whether they're rising from, whether they're fairly
poorly set?
And also just you've clearly focused on the Latin American business, basically Argentina
on the cleanup and you have also did with Russia. How should we think about the
temptation from our side is to say, well, where we dealt with next year, and then we can
improve your numbers by that amount. You're clearly an organization that always has
things going right and wrong all the time. Do you view these as exceptional restricted
jobs or they just kind of run-of-the-mill? Do you see them more as like run-of-the-mill for
an organization like yours?
And then just, ﬁnally, on the Life, just returning to the life product mix shift and the hope
that – or the expectation to shift the products. Is it right to assume that the proﬁts you
generate on a €100 of unit linked product will be in absolute terms less than €100 of
traditional product? And therefore, when we think about absolute proﬁtability of the new
Page 15 of 26



Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2015-11-06

products, it should be lower than on the traditional products? So, if you can just give us a
feel for that absolute level of proﬁts generated by those unit of premium?

FINAL

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Okay. So let's start with the reserve releases. It's really oddly distributed to many OEs.
Clearly, Italy is always part of it. Our large corporate business is always part of it. Oil level
(55:16) is always showing a strong positive run-oﬀ, but also Spain. So, actually, all the one
who show really this and excellent combined ratios always have a process of very prudent
reserving and recycling then as run-oﬀ.
So, therefore, we show in these countries also a worse accident year loss ratio maybe than
some others, but that comes then big later. And you cannot have every quarter a strong
positive run-oﬀ result, and then not having it at the end.

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, actually, LatAm, sure. I cannot promise to you for 100% that there will be no new
LatAm next year in another place of the world. I would not see it for the moment, but you
can also say, I didn't see Argentina a year ago, otherwise we would have prevented it. I'm
still positive that we get LatAm moving the Fireman's Fund story. Yes, the cleaning
brought actually still some more items to the surface, which need to be cleaned, but the
progress at Fireman's Fund is very strong and the integration is really very well working.
So, the Life mix change, I am inclined to say no to your question because the new
business margin is nothing else than the present value of the future proﬁts. So the
operating proﬁt coming out of it, forget the taxes, stands the correction of the duration of
support that over how many years it will emerge. So if €100 of premium has the same new
business margin, then it will also generate the same operating proﬁt.
Now, it gets to the more advanced calculation. You have a little bit less proﬁt emergence
on unit-linked because you have less capital charges on it, therefore also a smaller risk
margin embedded, and the risk margin also comes up as operating proﬁt. However, the
unit-linked business is quite often attached to PIMCO or AGI fund. So we have also a
proﬁt emergence in our asset managers.
So, therefore, in total, taking everything into account, I would say it's equal; plus, minus
around it.

FINAL

Good afternoon. Thank you. Just, Dieter, on the Solvency sensitivities, which seem to have
changed reasonably signiﬁcantly in 3Q, particularly on the credit spreads and also on the
interest rate. One discussion I was having with the Investor Relations team was it's linked
to the policy holder participations and indirectly linked to the level of interest rates, and
that is intuitive.
But is this sort of a bit worrying that suddenly we have such a big impact in the
sensitivities as well, so it's sort of a moving scale for us and the movement is quite high?
And just any thoughts on that would be really appreciated.
Then two more clariﬁcation questions maybe. In Korea, the understanding I had was that,
if interest rate worsen, it could again worsen. But you seem to suggest that the two
portfolios which needed these charges are sort of ﬁxed. Just could you conﬁrm that,
please? And lastly...

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Right.

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. No, go ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Sorry. Last question is very quick one as well. The P&C in Germany, the investment
contract type of business, now we can also see a material change in the investment
income line, where the investment contract line shows up part of the net harvesting and
quite a signiﬁcant change from previous quarters in history. Is it a one-oﬀ-ish impact?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

In which balance sheet, sorry?

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

In the P&C investment income line, we see a – the role of an investment line for reserves
and investment contracts. And that has signiﬁcantly changed in this quarter, used to be
minus €100 million, minus €50 million and now it's minus €8 million, and probably is
linked to this AV, the change...

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yeah. Yeah. That is related to the Life book.

But is it sustainable?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yeah.

FINAL

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

So is it a sustainable eﬀect or is it just a slot and then...

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

No, no, that is a bit also again the compensation for the write-downs in the portfolio. That
is pretty much like the German Life business, because this portfolio is actually, in the
mechanic, a smaller copy of the German Life book but within the P&C company.
I think it's confusing for many people what a Life product has to do in a P&C balance
sheet. But that is the way how it started many decades ago. But in this yield environment,
the product will probably not have such a brilliant future. And so – but it is also more
driven by the ﬁnancial market losses in the quarter.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

So it could normalize. Okay. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yeah, yeah. I would normalize it. So Korea write-down because this is a form you like,
mechanical calculation. So, therefore, you can actually say with pretty high certainty.
Today with today's interest rate in Korea, there will be no further write-down to this year.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

And is this a beginning of period point or end of period point that you measure this
formula in Korea?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

This is a 16-quarter rolling average.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

16-quarter.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

So, even if the number in the last quarter moves a little bit further, the 16-quarter rolling is

FINAL

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

And the Solvency sensitivity, I think you spotted the right driver that is the lower policy
holder participation, but that is not driven by the market movement of 20 basis points.
Yes, to some extent, but we had a large share of our internal model driven by the
feedback from the regulator in the summer and that has increased then ﬁnally also this
volatility number. So, that is also a consequence of the conversions process to the ﬁnal
Solvency II number.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay. All right. Thank you, Dieter.

A - Dieter Wemmer

We will now take our next question from Michael Haid from MainFirst Bank. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Two questions. First, on the payout ratio. I am a big fan of your
payout ratio, 50%, on stated net proﬁt and on the dividend continuity. And to my
understanding, the 50% goes for the stated net proﬁt. What do you do in a year when if
the net proﬁt goes what you think is above the normal level? Do you adjust for one-oﬀs or
is it just the stated net proﬁt, and you try to manage down earnings in other ways?
Second question, German Life business, you mentioned that the ﬁrst quarter and second
quarter you had assumed lower policy holder participations. In the third quarter, it goes
up. Is it that usually in the fourth quarter we see a burden in the IFRS operating proﬁt from
German Life or should we expect just no seasonal impact here?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Okay. So, ﬁrst of all, the payout ratio is our stated policy that 50% of the net income is
paid out as dividend, and we clearly said we want to stick to this dividend policy for a
number of years and it was not meant as a one-oﬀ. And the result is what the result is. And
it will be 50%, and I tried to guide in my speech that the 4% in net income cost we have at
the moment for the nine months that this could further improve by year-end when you

Page 19 of 26



Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2015-11-06

also assume that the operating proﬁt ends up higher than at year-end. That was what I
tried to say, but maybe I was not successful in what I am saying.

FINAL

The German Life policy holder participation is actually pretty stable. We had in 2014 for
the whole year 83.1%. At the moment, year-to-date, it is 82.3%. So, that are small
movements which are mainly coming also from accounting diﬀerences between local staﬀ
and IFRS, which are always inﬂuencing also this number overall.
In the last quarter, there are sometimes eﬀects in the German Life operating proﬁt coming
from the true-up calculation on the debt amortization, depending on the year the trueups. I cannot tell you what would be the outcome of the true-ups this year.

ahead. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Frank Kopﬁnger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everybody. I have two questions. My ﬁrst question is on the 117%
combined ratio at Fireman's Fund. Can you comment a little bit there on this
development? Do you expect more restructuring charges there or should we expect even
there is a strengthening going forward here?
And then my second question is overall on taken goodwill impairments. As your Munich
neighbor yesterday indicated that, especially in its German Primary Life business, the
interest rate could be at risk triggered by the low yield environment. Do you see the same
risk here not only at your German entities, but maybe broadly speaking as we just had it
with the degrade of Northern Korea?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yeah. That was the question I answered before that I do not see the Korean issue in any
other bell on Street. Certainly, that is a normal regular amortization of deferred acquisition
costs, because in the end deferred acquisition costs would have an end to their lifetime,
as underlying policy is matured. So, that should be gone. That is the normal process. So,
therefore, there is an ongoing amortization of it, but this one-oﬀ triggered by loss
recognition event, I think that is limited to Korea.
And goodwill impairments, in particular in Germany, I wouldn't foresee in the strengths of
our balance sheets and also with the money and proﬁt we are producing. Our German
Life business too, as a reminder, has a 15% ROE. When a 15% ROE couldn't support a
goodwill, that would be a really sad economic situation.

FINAL

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

For the third quarter, we've tested all our goodwills as nobody is in trouble. Fireman's
Fund, sorry, I almost forgot about it. I think we still have too much expenses and
infrastructure on it and we had some cleaning of the numbers so far. So the 117% is
certainly not the underlying run rate of the business.
We had still not a good loss ratio there and also the expense ratio is still too high. But in
the expense ratio, we moved already to 32% now in the third quarter. And so, one who
remembers the story from last year that we started in the commercial business with some
40% expense ratio, I think we have done a tremendous step forward this year. The loss
ratio is mainly aﬀected also by some cleanups or writing oﬀ on premium receivables and
things like that. So it is not that we increased loss reserves in Q3 end. I would also not
expect loss reserve increases in Q4.

We will now take our next question from Paul De'Ath from RBC. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

Q - Paul C. De'Ath
Hi. Good afternoon. A couple of questions for me. Firstly, just looking at the Life new
business and ongoing shift away from traditional products. Clearly, you've had great
success in Germany with your kind of reduced but still some elements of guarantee
products and the successes (1:11:24), et cetera, and the ﬁxed income annuities in the U.S.
I'm just wondering, in the likes of France and Italy where unit-linked seems to be coming
to the full, is there any scope to put some of your I guess lower guarantee products into
those markets as well or are you happy to just continue down the European (1:11:52) unitlinked route in those markets?
And then, the second question was just on PIMCO and the cost income ratio, which
obviously showing signs of improvement. I think I remember, during the issues that
PIMCO has been having, you've been kind of increasing the level of marketing spend, et
cetera. And now that PIMCO seems to be turning a corner kind of further down the line,
should we expect the expenses to start reducing again just as you're now bigger? Thanks.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you for the question, Paul. I think, in France and Italy, France is now running in
its new business mix in the retail space at 50% unit-linked, 50% still the traditional. We are
Page 21 of 26



Company Name: Allianz SE

Date: 2015-11-06

FINAL

certainly thinking of whether it'll be in the next years what we call the hyper product. So
ﬁxed index annuity style could be helpful.
In Italy, we are now I think closer to 80% unit-linked, but also there the ﬁxed-index annuity
product is in the design phase, how we ﬁnd a version which really is suited to the Italian
market. We believe from the U.S. experience, and in particular with Italian expense
structure, which should really create a very good product, and we will certainly see how
fast we can bring it to the market.
PIMCO is already showing good quarter, 2 percentage point improvement in the cost
income ratio, and that is certainly not coming from a recovery of the revenue line. So the 2
percentage point is really a reduction of the one-oﬀ expenses, but also a reduction of the
expenses related to the volume.
I think, all-in-all, we could probably see that in the back-oﬃce processes about 40% of the
cost variable. We still have the increased marketing costs and some other one-oﬀs and
the retention packages as a one-oﬀ still in the numbers. So, going forward, we are
certainly – we were already I think optimistic in summer about PIMCO's development, but
our optimism is growing with the development at PIMCO.

We will now take our next question from William Elderkin from Goldman Sachs. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - William H. Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Three questions. Just back on the dividends. I
don't think I've understood the policy correctly. In a scenario where your capital is
absolutely ﬁne but net income for whatever reason is down a bit year-on-year, would the
sort of ambition to keep the dividend ﬂat win or would you sort of allow the payout ratio
to rise above 50% if need be or is the 50%, say, a ﬁxed number if you will?
Secondly, just on the very strong Italian combined ratio, I mean just how much of that
combined ratio do you think is coming from the core Allianz business and how much
being impacted by the portfolio transfer from Unipol? And ﬁnally, do you have any sort of
exposure to the liability risks faced by certain German car makers?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Okay. So, that's an interesting new question. Yes, I did not mention the second rule of our
dividend policy because I thought, when I mention it, you will all conclude on the phone
that I am predicting a falling net income. So, therefore, I stayed away from this. But you
are right. In case the net income would be a bit smaller than the year before, we stick to

Page 22 of 26



Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2015-11-06

FINAL

the previous year dividend, which translates then into a payout ratio above 50%. That is
the a stated dividend policy. But I thought that could be misinterpreted when I use it.
In the Italian combined ratio included for the Unipol business, let's say, roughly €200
million in the quarter at a combined ratio of, let's say, €94 million. That was what you
wanted to know. And then, certainly we have a share of the D&O programs of most
German car makers. So, but the limit we have for our share on each policy is clearly
deﬁned. It will not create a big number when any European or U.S corporate would come
with a claim under their D&O program, and that is I think well-maintained.
Well, I think our risk management in the large corporate business, you can also see, how
we actually handled the Tianjin harbor claim. Our predicted loss on this is some €60
million. And actually we took very much the learnings on storage claims from the Bangkok
ﬂood event three years ago where we had this surprise concentration from many
European and international corporates.
And we are now really much more careful on storage concentration and don't want all this
to be hit by unknown clash. And that is a part of our overall risk strategies.

Hello. Hi, there. Two very quick questions. Dieter, I think you mentioned that the PIMCO

strategies? I'm assuming you're still seeing outﬂows in the traditional books. So this is
presumably in the income fund. Or is there any – is it broadly spread? Just any more color
as to the nature of the ﬂows you're seeing. Is the expectation – I think your original
expectation was you hoped PIMCO would be break-even ﬂows in Q4. I guess you're now
suggesting it could be positive in net ﬂows for Q4.
And my second question, just a quick one, on the expense ratio, P&C expense ratio, you
talk about special eﬀects, business mix changes, and obviously the commission ratios
edged up slightly. Is the Q3 expense ratio, is that at ongoing level or the commission ratio
continued to rise a bit? I'm not sure what the noise factors are to think about on the
trajectory there. Thanks.

Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. Well, I don't want to guide to a ﬁnal number for the inﬂow at
PIMCO for the quarter. I have absolutely just reported about the October number. And

FINAL

when we analyze the development in Q3, we can actually say that we have seen already
with the customers in Asia, with the customers in Europe and Middle-East and Latin
America, each had positive net inﬂows for the quarter. So the U.S. was actually from a
region the area where we still have seen the outﬂows in Q3. So, that is then the area to
turn around.
In particular, the income fund you mentioned are really doing well. For the ﬁrst 10 months,
we had close to $12 billion of inﬂows in this fund only. And our global wealth management
had a very good month in October. So I think that are the main areas and the general
information I would give to you, without now really going into the full autonomy of the
October numbers.
Your other question was on the expense ratio. I would say there was some special eﬀect in
Q3 on the admin expense ratio, which will normalize in Q4. The acquisition expense ratio,
that development is probably not rewarding as our fastest growing areas are the areas
with higher commission rates.

So it should stay around this level then?

Well, in admin, maybe 20 basis points, 30 basis points down.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. And then – okay. But I guess the commission ratio could still edge up a bit further,
sounds like?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. All right. Thank you.

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

Okay. We have time for one last question, if there's any?

Fantastic. So there was a – a few hours ago, there's a big mine ﬂood disaster thing in
Brazil. And so is there an exposure to that? And alike to that, can you say a little bit more
about the trend in large losses, if it's just a term? One of your competitors clearly has
issues with that and just a bit of a resource would be lovely? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Michael, I won't go whole day in communication. So, therefore, I don't know what had
happened in Brazil and in the mining industry there. So, therefore, I can prefer not to
comment on this. I believe I mentioned that our accident year loss ratio had 50 basis
points increase in Q3 from large losses and that's attributed across many. So I would still
consider it as a small uptick, nothing really special.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay. So, no special accidents and no...

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

No cleaning up of portfolios.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Lovely. Okay. Great. That's all. Thank you so much.
