{BIO 1463509 <GO>}

Good afternoon, and let me add my, welcome to today's call. We're off to a good start
this year, as we delivered strong results in the first quarter. Our strategy of focusing on
profitable underwriting and relationships, portfolio investment, and disciplined capital
allocation is clearly delivering value to shareholders.

Bloomberg Transcript

We continue to build a unique company with the breadth of products and differentiated
businesses across many of the key markets in the world. And we are not done, we
continue to build competitive scale in each of our key operations.
Our focus on building and investing in our business, including in digital technology has
generated strong growth and improving operating efficiencies and challenging market
conditions in recent years. We certainly haven't been waiting around for the markets to
turn, rather we've been building a business that could thrive in various market cycles. A
business that strongly considers the future 5 to 10 years down the road not 5 to 10
months down the road. This will be our path forward as well.
We'll not lose sight of how this business will perform over the Long Haul, despite any
pressure to make short-term guided decisions and changes. A hardening market for
premium rates is terrific for us, as it is for all industry players but unlike others -- like some
others in the industry, it's not the defining component of our growth, providing great
service and innovative products to our clients is what defines us.
Our financial results reflect the success of this strategy and should generate a return on
equity of 700 basis points above the risk-free rate or approximately 10% in this interest
rate environment.
From a margin standpoint, we expect to improve our underwriting margin for a combined
ratio by 100 basis points annually over the next two years allowing for more normal loss
expectations keeping in mind the exogenous events of last year, and the year before.
And a combination of our continued investments in technology and growth, and growing
the business should provide us with the scale, we need to improve underwriting margins.

FINAL

Over the past few months, we've spent time with many of our investors and the feedback
from almost all was the same. Keep executing on your strategy that is building long-term
value for shareholders. We heard many of you that we should be focusing on ROE on
GAAP basis and we agree as it better signifies the value creation of the business by more
accurately reflecting changes in the investment portfolio in the first quarter, our annualized
return on average shareholders' equity on a GAAP basis was 20% versus 5.5% in 2018.
Furthermore, annualized adjusted operating return on average shareholders' equity was
9.1% in the first quarter of 2019, versus 8.1% in the first quarter of last year, and 6.3% for
the whole year of 2018. We're clearly a seeing a lot of progress and overall profitability.
As I previously mentioned, our opportunity to increase margins will continue to come from
driving efficiency in our operations, leveraging technology to make our business more
efficient, and deriving more value from each dollar we spend. During the first quarter, we
improved our combined ratio or margin by 100 basis points versus last year to 94.8% this
year from 95.8% the year ago.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our US operations are well established and well known in the area of excess into Excess
and Surplus Lines. We've been growing and scaling our international footprint, which
allows us to achieve desirable geographic diversification and now we have the benefit of
applying, some of the key best practices from the US in this growing platform as well.
Over the years we've demonstrated through our loss ratios, that we're very good at
selecting risk. Now we're on to improving our efficiency, while maintaining our in and risk
selection. We've known this is the natural next step in our long-term strategy which is
focused on maximizing our core functions of risk selection and investment portfolio
management, and amplifying those results with wise capital allocation.
Ultimately, all this leads to profitable growth, solid return on capital and superior growth in
our book value per share. To demonstrate our progress in the 2019, first quarter book
value per share increased 8% to $55.23 and compared to $51.43 at December 31, 2018,
inclusive of cash dividend.
As we've always said, we view the growth in book value per share over time, as the key
metric to demonstrate value creation, I should say its book value per share plus dividends
paid. As we go through the current financial highlights, you'll see the progress we're
making. We reported net income of $91.2 million or $2.63 per diluted share, up
approximately four times from the prior period a year ago.
Overall, gross written premium grew 7.1% to $761 million from $711 million in the first
quarter last year. We continued selectively targeting premiums with the best loss ratios,
leveraging our investments in -- and leveraging our investments in digital technology. In
2019, as planned we retained less premium, primarily, due to an increase in ongoing
strategic use of third-party capital.
When we talk about the operations in more detail, you will see that retentions in the
international business are lower than in the US as we cede more risk to our third-party

capital providers. Jay, will take you through additional details in just a little bit.

FINAL

Overall the contribution from underwriting income increased, by 26.6% this year to $21.9
million from $17.3 million a year ago. In the quarter margins improved as well, driven by
better loss in expense ratios versus a year ago. The loss ratio excluding catastrophe
losses and prior year development, improved to 56.6% from 57.2% in the year ago
period.
Net investment income decreased 5.8% to $33.9 million, compared to $36.0 million in the
2018 first quarter, due to a lower contribution from our alternative investments. This
portion of our portfolio is reported on a one to three month lag and reflects the volatile
markets in the latter months of 2018.
We have cautioned that results from these investments would be lumpy as they've been
in the past couple of -- as they have been in the last couple of quarters. The earnings
contribution from alternative investments in the 2019, first quarter was $1.9 million
compared to $8.7 million in the prior year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net investment income on the core portfolio increased 17.2% to $32 million compared to
$27.3 million in the 2018, first quarter. And the increase was primarily due to, an increase in
the invested asset-base in higher investment yields and Mark Rose, our Chief Investment
Officer, will go through all of this in a bit more detail in just a minute.
Now let's talk about our US operations. We continue to leverage technology in our US
Business creating significant efficiencies, driving down costs and enhancing customer
service. Each consecutive quarter, as we look at the targeted growth and the
improvement in margins, the benefits of our digital investments become increasingly
more evident.
In the US Operations gross written premium in the 2019 first quarter was $411 million,
which was up $38 million or about 10% compared to the first quarter of 2018. This growth
was achieved in property up 41%, professional up 28.5% and specialty up 17%.
Liability was down modestly from the prior year. We continue to execute on our strategy
to target select business lines and at the same time manage our risks and exposures. As I
mentioned earlier, when discussing overall premium growth the retention of net written
premium to gross written premium was 60.5% in the first quarter, as part of our ongoing
strategic use of third-party capital including reinsurance, most notably from our property
business.
Margins in our US Business continue to improve with the 90.9% combined ratio in the 2019
first quarter, compared to 93.9 a year ago. The underlying combined ratio excludes
Catastrophic losses in prior year reserve, sorry -- the underlying combined ratio when
excluding catastrophic losses and prior-year reserve development improved to 90.9%
from 92.7% in the first quarter of this year versus last year.

FINAL

Moving on to our international operations. So far, we've focused on digital investments on
growing the US business. Going forward, the strategy is to take what we've learned in the
US and apply it to our international business as well. We're executing on that strategy in
several ways.
We're implementing similar protocols in the international operations that drove growth in
margin improvement in the US Turning to this quarter's results. Gross written premiums in
the 2019, first quarter were up 3.7% to $350 million compared to the first quarter of last
year.
Growth was achieved in property, liability and specialty lines as a result of an increase in
new business and favorable rate changes. Growth is partially offset by the decision to
non-renew select cyber accounts in our liability line, which was also true in our US business.
The underwriting income for the 20 -- for 24, the first quarter of 2019 was $9.2 million
compared to $15.8 million for the first quarter of 2018. The lower contribution from
underwriting, primarily reflects the strategic use of reinsurance and third-party capital to
manage risk exposure, modestly higher there were slight -- there was modestly higher
catastrophic losses in this year's first quarter and a $3.6 million decline in favorable prioryear reserve the development.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving on to discuss our digital business transformation. Our adoption of technology
solutions has been a strong driver of our success and remains a key strategic priority.
Leveraging digital tools and process optimization has not only increased efficiency and
scale, but has also improved our risk selection.
I want to share with you a recent statistic, I read in a Forbes article. The amount of data we
produce every day is truly mind-blowing -- mind-boggling. There are $2.5 quintillion bytes
of data created each day at our current pace, but that pace has only accelerated with the
growth of the internet of things.
Over the last two years a long night alone, sorry, in the last two years alone 90% of the
data in the world was generated. I'm not even sure how many quintillion bytes that is but
it's a lot.
We're taking advantage of this in our Argo insights platform, where weekly we're
consuming multiple terabytes of data and running it through that's not as much as
quintillions of bytes and we're running it through machine learning algorithms, which both
highlights the unique risk factors to the underwriters as well as helps to price complex
risks.
Not only will this have an impact on the loss ratio through better risk selection and
consistency of underwriting but reduces the amount of time spent analyzing each risk so
that we can get to more business. Early on we're seeing significant improvement in
underwriting efficiency.

FINAL

What we've learned with our new technology this proves the old -- disproves the old
saying that there is no bad risk just bad price, which is wrong in our view. There actually
bad risks that we've chosen to exclude and this risk management is why we are seeing
better loss ratios in the business, where we are able to apply these algorithms.
As previously discussed, our quick quoting applications continue to scale without us
needing to add headcount. In the first quarter, our pilot project for self-serve producer
quoted premiums increased 36% over the fourth quarter of 2018.
It's early but this is a positive sign as our producers continue to get over 80% of their
automated quotes in a matter of minutes with over 90% of them continuing to use this
digital self-service method versus returning to paper, in paper submissions that they email
to us.
This combined with our continued efforts to automate underwriting for our high-volume,
small risk businesses resulted in 21% of our total US gross premium for casualty, flowing
through one of our digital systems in the first quarter. We only expect this percentage to
grow as we add lines to our digital platform.

Bloomberg Transcript

All the examples, I've just discussed are driving the improvement, you're seeing in our
reported results. An added benefit is being able -- is being viewed as the preferred
specialty carrier providing automation and innovative products for our distribution
partners.
Changing topics, let's talk about capital management. In February, your Board authorized
an increase in the quarterly dividend by 15% to $0.31 per share. Over the past 3 and 5
years our quarterly dividend has increased at a compounded rate of more than 20%. Our
capital management strategy has not changed. Our top priority remains deploying capital
to the businesses capable of delivering attractive returns in a reasonable time period.
We also have a strong track record of returning excess capital to shareholders. Between
stock buybacks and dividends paid, we returned over $650 million of capital to
shareholders between 2010 and the end of the first quarter of 2019 and over the same
time frame we grow our equity base from $1.5 billion to $1.9 billion or a combined increase
in capital generated of over $1.1 billion. Additionally, the market value of Argo has grown
from just under $1.2 billion in 2010 to over $2.5 billion, today.
So, to summarize Argo's performance in the 2019 first quarter. Our business has shown
significant strength and agility in a competitive market and is strongly positioned. As a
result of growing in target areas, where we see the most profit potential. Our loss ratio
continues to improve. And our expense ratio continues to improve as we remain focused,
on scaling our business and managing cost.
Looking forward, while we expect investment performance and capital management, can
to contribute -- to continue to contribute to growth in book value. We're focused squarely
on our business results. Driven by underwriting income to achieve a 10% return on equity.

And I say this every quarter, but we have the right team in place, with the right skill sets
and experience to continue driving value for all of our shareholders. And we look forward
to updating you on our continued progress going forward.

FINAL

I'm now going to turn the call over to Mark Rose to talk about our investment portfolio in
more detail.

Mark H Rose

{BIO 1557365 <GO>}

Thanks Mark. And good afternoon. I will take you through Argo's investment performance
for the quarter.
The first quarter total return was 3.1% or up a $148 million, compared to a decline of
negative 0.4% in the first quarter of 2018. You may remember the first quarter of 2018,
when the capital markets sold-off, after a very strong 14-month rally.

Bloomberg Transcript

This year Q1, was a mirror opposite, with the capital markets rallying, a big rally, after
experiencing a major sell-off, we all remember in the fourth quarter of 2018. The sell-off
was driven by the Fed's rate hikes and strong outlook, which consequently softened after
the December sell-off.
In 2019, first quarter, our portfolio participated in a market-wide rally in all asset classes.
During this time, the S&P was up 13.6%, the US Aggregate investment grade bond index
returned 3%, the leverage loan index was up 4% and the high-yield bond market was
rallied 7.4%.
Correspondingly, for Argo, our core bond portfolio, which is approximately a half the
duration of the US aggregate index was up 2.2%. Argo's equity portfolio was up 16% and
its non-investment grade credit portfolio, which includes a mix of both bonds and bank
loans was up 6.5% for the first quarter of '19.
We continue to maintain a stable mix of asset classes with 65% in core bonds, 8% in
equities, 7% in non-investment grade debt, 7% in alternatives and 12% in short-term and
cash. Our reported net investment income was $33.9 million for 2019, first quarter,
comparing favorably as you heard, to last quarter's $29.4 million but below 2018, where
we had $36 million.
Driving net investment income growth both sequentially and year-to-year was growth in
the portfolio and higher yields, which was offset on a year-to-year basis in comparison
with the alternative investment portfolio.
Alternative income for the first quarter was $1.9 million. As we commented on last
quarter's call, we hold approximately $135 million in private equity structured funds, which
report on a quarterly lag, so the first quarter 2019, results are actually the numbers from
fourth quarter 2018.

Page 7 of 21

Furthermore, we hold a smaller portfolio of long-only and hedge funds. These funds are
counted on a monthly lag, so the Q1 numbers, include the toughest month of December
in the fourth quarter of 2018.

FINAL

With that, I will turn the call over to Jay.

Jay S Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Thanks, Mark. And good afternoon, everyone. I'll make a few comments and then we'll
open it up for questions.
The financial results for the 2019, first quarter continued the positive underlying trends in
our business. And the strong start to the year positions the company well to meet our
financial goals. The Quarter's financial results make evident the benefits from our
investments and talented people and better tools and business processes, especially in
our US operations, which continue to generate strong results and measured growth.

Bloomberg Transcript

At the same time the work that's been put into the international offer rush -- operations is
evident in the segment's return to a solid underwriting margin. The company is well
positioned to generate long-term profitability and growth leading to enhanced
shareholder value.
The 2019 first quarter financials also demonstrate that we are on track to meet our stated
financial goals too. Number one, improve our combined ratio by 100 basis points, annually.
In fact, the 94.8% combined ratio in the 2019 first quarter was 100 basis points better than
the prior year. Two, continue to reduce the expense ratio through operating efficiencies
and scale.
Our expense ratio is down 40 basis points on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Further
excluding the effects of reinstatement premiums and certain one-time costs. Our
expense ratio was 37.8% and 80 basis point improvement. Finally, on a year-over-year
basis, our non-acquisition costs were flats to 2018. So, our expense management efforts
combined with the 7.1% growth in gross written premium, continues to drive progress
towards margin enhancement. And finally three, generate an average return on average
shareholder's equity of 700 basis point above the risk free rate.
Our quarterly operating income $41.1 million or $1.18 per share generated an annualized
9.1% return on average equity. Let me go through a few other -- few items further
explanation in the quarter's numbers.
As Mark mentioned, over all the business grew on a gross written premium basis by 7.1%,
which of course is a function of both the increase to business volumes and a better than
anticipated rating environment. One particular item which deserves a bit more explanation
with regard to premiums is the quarter's retention levels.

FINAL

As noted during the year last year and on the fourth quarter call earlier this year, we strive
in the originator of the best-performing risk and will retain exposures that fit within our risk
and volatility appetites. Through the use of third-party capital including certain strategic
reinsurance programs, we are essentially originating a portion of risk on behalf of third
parties and we increased this mechanism in the second half of 2018 and headed into
2019.
This is most pronounced in the quarter by way of the change in relationship of gross of
net to gross written premium. In the quarter for the group the retention was just under
48% versus a retention ratio of 52%, in the prior year's first quarter. That said the first
quarter was impacted by the treatment of certain outwards reinsurance treaties and as
such, we expect the retention for the year to be just under 60% or slightly less than last
year.
Touching on the US Operations, gross written premium grows by 10.2% to 410 million
compared to the 2018 first quarter. Mark referenced the growth by product, it's worth
noting that the growth and property is somewhat exaggerated by the introduction of our
funding program without which GWP in that line grew by 6.8%. This quarter, there is
noticeable difference in retain and that retain from the notable difference in net retained
premiums compared to a year ago.

Bloomberg Transcript

The gross to net written premium retention ratio and the 2019 first quarter which 60.5%,
consistent with the fourth quarter of 2018, but compared to 66.8% in Q1, 2018 primarily
due to the increased use of reinsurance program, and the aforementioned new fronted
program property.
Turning the margins in the US Were pleased with the loss ratio which improved 3 points to
56.5% in the 2019 first quarter from 59.5%. The calendar year loss ratio excluding
catastrophe losses improved 1.8 points to the 56.5% from 58.3%, primarily reflecting
higher premium rates and business mix shift.
In addition, in the first in the 2018 first quarter there were several non-CAT, weatherrelated loss events that were not repeated in the 2019 first quarter. Underwriting income
was 55% to 24.8 million from 16 million in the 2018 first quarter. A 4.4% increase in net
earned premiums 180 basis point improvement in the current estimated loss ratio and
continued positive prior year development for the quarter $4 million, reflect the effects of
scale, efficiency, underwriting discipline and digital initiatives.
Moving to international operations. Gross written premium of $350 million rose 3.7% from
the 2018 first quarter. This growth is primarily attributed to property and liability lines in the
Bermuda and European insurance operations. Benefiting from new business opportunities
and higher premium rates, Bermuda insurance lines represent -- lines represent
approximately 58% of the quarterly increase in growth. The growth in the European
insurance lines relates to the acquisition of Ariscom the 2018 first quarter.
Net retained premiums as a percentage of gross written as percentage of gross written
for the 2019 first quarter were 32%, down from 35% in the 2018, first quarter. This again is
Page 9 of 21

FINAL

part of the increased use of third-party capital primarily, in the reinsurance property lines,
as a result in property lines both net written and earned premium are down.
The loss ratio for the 2019 first quarter was 56.2% compared to 52% for the 2018 first
quarter. The increase in the loss ratio reflects modest unfavorable prior year reserve
development this year, compared to favorable development in 2018. Coupled with a
small capital loss reported, in the segment against the cash-free quarter, last year. When
adjusting for these two items, the underlying trend demonstrates the stability of the
results in the quarter with the current accident year ex-CAT loss ratio up 80 basis points
year-on-year, more a function of business mix and a few discrete attritional losses than to
underlying changes in the core loss ratios.
The loss ratio in the 2019 first quarter, was also impacted by an increase in ceded
reinsurance premiums paid, as a result of higher ceded loss recoveries on prior
catastrophe events. A couple of more items to note.

Bloomberg Transcript

As we discussed in prior quarters, we've evaluated the impact of US and other
jurisdictional tax changes to our expectation of consolidated effective tax rate. After
further analysis and a clearer understanding of the implication of such changes, we've
lowered the assumptions used in the calculation of operating earnings to a 15% tax rate
down from our prior assumption of 20%.
We believe, the new assumption is appropriately conservative as demonstrated by the
current quarter's effective tax rate of just under 10%. This quarter's provision also included
some adjustments to prior year taxes to prior tax years, which when taken into account
would produce an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Following up on Mark Rose's
comments on investments, our core portfolio continues to perform quite well with the
contribution to net investment income, growing 17.2% in the 2019 first quarter, due to
higher invested asset base and improved investment yields.
The 2019 first quarter, benefited from improved financial markets with volatility was
significantly less than the 2018 fourth quarter, as a result the change in value of equity
securities resulted in an unrealized gain of $54.2 million through the income statement. A
positive swing compared to the unrealized loss in the 2018 fourth quarter.
While, the change unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities in 2018 of $75 million
reported through AOCI Swung to a gain of $61.6 million at March 31, 2019, quite a reversal
in such a short period of time. All of which along with the strong contribution from
underwriting results contributed to the quarter's growth in book value per share, which as
Mark mentioned, was 7.4%, 8% with inclusion of dividends.
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. And we're now ready to take questions.

(Question And Answer)

FINAL

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). At this time,
we will pause momentarily to assemble our roaster. And our first question comes from
Jeff Schmitt, of William Blair. Please go ahead.

Q - Jeff Schmidt

{BIO 15098244 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Question on the expense ratio and I think you had
mentioned in your opening remarks, Mark that you think, it would come down about a 100
basis points per year for the next couple of years.
And just looking in at the US it were flat year-over-year, there was some investments in
the business in that still. How much of that overall improvement is going to come from
scaling versus those internal investments coming down or are you at sort of a run rate
ongoing expense for that?

A - Mark E Watson

{BIO 1463509 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well we're always going to be spending money on technology particularly with the rate of
change, but I think I said this last quarter, I think we're kind of over the hump on big
expenditures, I think, now it's more iteratively as we see opportunities. But as I was
mentioning in my remarks today.
I think that little a lot of the things that we have going on that I've highlighted today and in
previous quarters, were hitting 5% of the business maybe 20% or 30% of the business
maximum, so far in the US. So there's still a lot of opportunity to roll a lot of other lines of
business onto some of the technology platforms or digital platforms that we've created.
So, I think a lot of the scale that Jay alluded to is in part writing more business in general
but I think it's also rolling more business onto the digital platforms that we've created. So I
do see the opportunity for an improvement in expense ratio in the US.
As well as an international and as I think Jay and I both said today. We're really just getting
going with some of the things, we think, we can do with our technology in our international
business, particularly in London. And the good news is that we -- through a lot of trial and
error in the US and in Brazil over the last five years or so.
We don't have to go through all that trial and error again to deploy some of our know how
that we figured out, and I would also add I think, I didn't say this today but I think I've said
this last quarter the cost of technology continues to come down. And we find ourselves in
a really good spot in that we can now afford technology that was otherwise unavailable
before and we're not locked into these while we all have legacy systems, we're not
locked into these legacy systems that cost $100 -- $100 million plus to build and maintain.
So we're trying to get to the cloud as fast as we can and that's not free but it sure is
scalable.

Okay. Do you have a sense on how much of the US Business, you could put on that
platform, and likewise international as you as you shift there?

FINAL

A - Mark E Watson

{BIO 1463509 <GO>}

Yeah, well the goal -- so the goal is 100%, right. I mean I get that that's somewhat
aspirational. But the goal is 100%. Do I think that 70% or 80% in the short run is
achievable? The answer is yes. Do I think that's true in international? that may take a little
longer just because of the Lloyd's construct but I think will certainly get 30% to 50% of
that on and it'll come on I think at a faster rate than the US., but again we're just getting
going.

Q - Jeff Schmidt

A - Jay S Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, I mean it's a couple things, one and I maybe I'll just go back to one of your earlier
questions and that was about the expense ratio. We're seeing growth in some businesses
like surety that are going to drive up, that are going to keep the expense ratio elevated,
as it contributes to that business. Likewise, we're seeing -- we're writing more surety
business that drives look -- that drives the loss ratio down. The other thing that was really
driving the result in this quarter relative to last year, was some underlying property losses
that hit in the first quarter of last year. They were weather-related losses, that weren't -wouldn't have been characterized as CAT, you may recall it was kind of bad-winter.

A - Mark E Watson

{BIO 1463509 <GO>}

And yeah, I think the way I characterize it a year ago, was we have a certain amount of
property or CAT activity that's not hurricanes and earthquakes. Yeah and we think these
things in are going to happen at a certain level and then every year it always seems to be
more. And the other thing we always talk about are our losses that we think will happen
about every -- from an actuarial perspective about every 18 months and we had more -we had an abundance of those in the first quarter a year ago.

Q - Jeff Schmidt

Our next question comes from Bijan Moazami, of Compass Point. Please go ahead.

Q - Bijan Moazami

{BIO 2087745 <GO>}

Hi, good evening, everyone. You had a phenomenal growth rate in professional in lines. If
you could talk about what's driving that, is it pricing? market share gain, what are the kind

Page 12 of 21



Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td
Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2019-04-29

of products that drives that. Also, if you could walk me through why you're buying a lot
more reinsurance for this particular line?

FINAL

A - Mark E Watson

{BIO 1463509 <GO>}

The professional business is growing for a number of reasons. First, we've hired a number
of talented people that had originated a fair amount of risk and I think Bijan, I think, we've
been talk -- I think, we've been talking about -- I know, we talked about this last quarter a
little bit, but I think we've been talking about it for the last three or four quarters. So, I
would expect that rate of growth to moderate this year on a written basis, as those
underwriters kind of fill up their portfolio. And of course, there's a lag between written
and earned, so, I suspect that, our earned premium this year will continue to be more
than we would normally expect, just as written was a year ago. As for why we buy re-in -we would buy a lot of reinsurance on this book, whenever we're growing something
quickly, I like to buy a little more reinsurance than we might otherwise, just to make sure
that we didn't get something wrong and add in more volatility than we expected and of
course we always think that buying reinsurance is a good hedge against volatility in
general and depending on it, whether we assuming we get the math right, sometimes it's
a less expensive way to capitalize the business on our own balance sheet.

Q - Bijan Moazami

{BIO 2087745 <GO>}

Are you getting a lot of rates, too?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark E Watson

{BIO 1463509 <GO>}

Yes, I think that, as you've heard on other calls this quarter and the previous quarter,
pricing is finally starting to move up across the Board in professional liability

Q - Bijan Moazami

{BIO 2087745 <GO>}

On the property lines obviously, you're not retaining much of that business anymore. So is
it fair to assume that your catastrophe exposures or catastrophe losses, is going to
dramatically decrease, going forward and more importantly, is that business becoming
really a fee business, at this kind of retention?

A - Mark E Watson

{BIO 1463509 <GO>}

Yes, and that's the point I was trying to make at the end of the fourth quarter and also the
end of the third quarter. If you look at our CAT results for the second half of last year on a
net basis versus the year before, I think dramatically different is probably the right word to
use, Particularly given that the number of CAT events or exogenous events last year was
pretty similar in both number of events and the total financial impact at an industry level,
at a gross level for us but you can see that the net the difference in net was quite
considerable.
Fortunately, it's about where we predicted it, would be a year ago, I think we could have
done without paying all the losses, but it was nice to see that they came in about where
we thought they would when we were predicting at the end of 2017? what would happen
if a number of but similar set of events happened in 2018. As far as fee business, yes I
Page 13 of 21



Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td
Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2019-04-29

think that is a good way to put it. That's what Jay and I are both referring to when we say
that we're originating risk on behalf of others.

FINAL

So we're underwriting on their behalf and we're getting a fee for it. With all of the CAT
activity this past year meaning 2018, it's kind of hard to see that flow through the P&L. But
I think we'll get you will have a chance to see more of that in 2019.

Q - Bijan Moazami

{BIO 2087745 <GO>}

If that capacity here to stay?

A - Mark E Watson

{BIO 1463509 <GO>}

Yes, remember most of questions, I remember most of that capacity is in the form of
capital supporting both of our syndicates and so far our capital provider seem pretty
pleased with us. What I was saying about the fee income is a lot of it, is based upon
profitability. And so given the amount of activity in '16 and '17, we haven't had a chance to
earn the fee income that we think we would on a normalized basis.

Q - Bijan Moazami

{BIO 2087745 <GO>}

Thank you.

Our next question comes from Matthew Carletti of JMP Please go ahead.

Q - Matthew Carletti

{BIO 5249827 <GO>}

Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a few questions just want to follow up Mark and Jay on
some of the pricing comments, you made. You referenced a few times stronger pricing in
certain areas and you just mentioned professional lines outside of think CAT which is one
of the more obvious ones are there, other areas you'd point to in your business that
you're seeing some significant pricing movement?

A - Mark H Rose

{BIO 1557365 <GO>}

Well, let's start with CAT, it's the easiest, so both reinsurance and property are finally
moving up particularly the D&F property and London that was CAT exposed. That's midteens on up and remember, we were talking about getting rate increase, although it was
more modest a year ago. We also talked about reducing the size of the portfolio, if we
couldn't get the rate increase that we wanted. For here's what I would say for our other
lines of business. On average, we're seeing single-digit rate increases, not double-digit
rate increases. But keep in mind that our portfolio mix is not the same as everyone else
and when you look at our loss ratios that are running in the 50s across the board by the
way that's US And international. We don't necessarily need that much rate increase will
take it, but that's why I was making the point in my opening remarks that I think what really
moves the needle for us the most is just continuing our portfolio optimization that we've
been working on for the last several years and continuing to use the digital platform and
creating algorithms to help us select risk and also continuing to drive scale on our
Page 14 of 21

platform. So that we're less dependent upon rate increases having said that, if the market
price goes up we're going to be beneficiary of that just as much as our competitors will
be.

FINAL

Q - Matthew Carletti

{BIO 5249827 <GO>}

Right. Okay. Next question just relates you mentioned in your prepared comments about
the more flattish year-over-year result and liability being the result of some non-renewed
cyber exposures. We're just wondering, if you give us a little color there that was that just
price, was it aggregation? was it you weren't comfortable with terms? what led to you
nonrenewing a chunk of business in both segments there?

A - Mark E Watson

{BIO 1463509 <GO>}

Yeah, so, that was mainly a recognition on our part. So this is just our point of view, that
the market price for the very large cyber accounts is mispriced, Particularly, the top end of
programs that are now hundreds of millions dollars and we thought it was better to just sit
on the sidelines and wait for the market to not only re-price some of the cyber programs
that are out there, but also restructure them as well.

Q - Matthew Carletti

{BIO 5249827 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Great and last question, just looking at the strong growth and property, which we've
talked about a bit, just wondering, is there -- should there be any, based on your
expectations for the year is there anything that should make that more front-end
weighted versus spread across a year would you expect, a strong-ish level of growth out
of property across all the different renewal periods.

A - Mark E Watson

{BIO 1463509 <GO>}

Well, no. I think, the market in general for CAT-exposed property is front-end weighted for
the first seven months of the year. So, you should -- you'll see more activity and more
change next quarter and then modestly in the third quarter, but I think, you'll see the most
amount of change this quarter, particularly, for non-US business and a little bit more
change for the US business in the second quarter.

Q - Matthew Carletti

Great. Thank you, very much for the answers and best of luck.

Q - Christopher Campbell

FINAL

Hey, I guess my first question is kind of the adverse development in international. I guess,
just where is that coming from and is any of that like jebi-related?

A - Jay S Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

All right the answer to the second question is no. It was $800,00. So, it was really small
amounts in various places that just ended up when you counted it all up. It was on that
side of the ledger on the international front.

A - Mark H Rose

{BIO 1557365 <GO>}

Yeah, the two to go back to jebi, we did on a gross basis we did feed but we did see
some development in jebi but our retro program picked it up.

Q - Christopher Campbell

{BIO 20262752 <GO>}

Got it. But I know, you guys are -- you obviously buy a ton of reinsurance, but I mean, like
how are you guys approaching that going into mid-year, where we're hearing like rumors,
like potentially rate increases. How would that influence your reinsurance buying strategy?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark E Watson

{BIO 1463509 <GO>}

That's a really good question. So, when we think about reinsurance, there's a number of
different factors that go into it. One is managing volatility. Another is a substitute form of
capital, and the third is, just looking at the price of reinsurance relative to whether we
want to, -- what if-- we're always looking to safely can generate a better return on capital,
if we kept the risk net on our books versus laying it off. So, I mean, depending Chris, on
how much reinsurance pricing goes up, we may want to decide to keep more net.
Particularly, if we're getting price increase as an insurer and so my guess is that there will
be a lot of movement in our reinsurance programs this year. I suspect that we'll add more
to some and let others go depending upon price, but so far for our reinsurance programs
that we're buying, price has been pretty flat since the 1st of January.

Q - Christopher Campbell

{BIO 20262752 <GO>}

Okay. Got it. And then on the Lloyd side, I know you guys, reinsure in it, I mean there's two
ways you can do it there, but like what are you seeing in terms of your pricing over there?

A - Mark E Watson

{BIO 1463509 <GO>}

Yeah, so remember that most of the reinsurance program, there isn't really reinsurance
per se, It's third-party capital supporting our syndicates and in fact the majority of the
capital supporting our syndicates is third-party capital. So that's kind of the largest form of
laying off volatility that we have, as far as the reinsurance programs that we've got that
have come up for renewal so far again they're renewing relatively flat.

Q - Christopher Campbell

{BIO 20262752 <GO>}

Okay. Great and then just one, last one, the international expense ratio was kind of
roughly flat and I know that was one area that you were targeting for improvement. I
guess just when should we start to see that your action is starting to take hold there?

FINAL

A - Mark H Rose

{BIO 1557365 <GO>}

Well I'm going to give the same answer, I always do which is it's going to be lumpy, but if
we look over a period of time and that's a year or more, I think we'll we should start to
see some improvement but some of it is also mix of business. And one of the things that
I've talked about on the last two or three quarters is this reality that sometimes acquiring
business is very expensive. And so I've really been pushing my colleagues in London in
particular to look at, and how much cover holder business we've got where the acquisition
cost is literally 30 points to 40 points and reducing that a bit this year, well more than a bit
this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, in the short run that may have a corresponding increase in non-acquisition cost as
we allocate fixed costs over less premium but my guess is it's kind of a push when you
lighten up one and then allocate the rest. So I think it's going to be lumpy over the next
few quarters but as we're always saying what matters most is the loss ratio. And I just
want to make sure that we really get our product mix right in our international business. So
as we reallocate our portfolio, I think we'll see acquisition costs come down or have the
acquisition cost ratio come down and we'd like to try and hold the non-acquisition
expense ratio flat at the same time.

Q - Christopher Campbell

{BIO 20262752 <GO>}

Got it. And does the acquisition cost ratio does any of that like the improvement that
you're planning. Does any of that include like increased ceding commissions, just by
ceding more business You get more of your expenses reimbursed?

A - Mark H Rose

{BIO 1557365 <GO>}

That's a good, excuse me, that's a good question, but in this instance that really doesn't
come into the frame.

Date: 2019-04-29

Good afternoon. I guess, I'd like to start by going back to your operating target of 700
basis points over the risk-free rate, current ROE objective. And in your comments Mark,
you added a caveat, which was allowing for normal loss expectation. So, I thought maybe
for a second you could go back and revisit that and clarify what you mean by that?

FINAL

A - Mark H Rose

{BIO 1557365 <GO>}

Yeah my point was if we have a year like last year or the year before. It's hard to imagine
that we would have had an and ROE 10 points. Now, you would expect in the less volatile
year to make it up and that's kind of what we've seen in the first quarter of this year. We
had last quarter, we had the capital markets impacting ROE in a negative way and this
quarter they were impacting ROE in a positive way.
Last year particularly and the third quarter in the last two quarters of 2017, we had more a
more than average level of CAT activity. So I was just trying to point out that there will be
some volatility depending upon what's going on in the world around us.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Mark this is a follow-up on that is there I mean when we think about our projections
curious what -- how you're thinking about, CAT impact on the consolidated loss ratio, in
any given year?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark E Watson

{BIO 1463509 <GO>}

Yeah, so I think, given how we have repositioned the portfolio on a net basis. I think, three
to five points depending upon how much activity there is in a year, is a reasonable starting
point.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Okay, I'm about to repeat or try to repeat a comment that Jay, made. So, if I make
mistake with it I apologize and you can correct me. But I believe Jay, in your comments
you said that, the net premium written to gross premium ratio is running around 48% and
then you went on further to say that or suggested that, it should be running around 60%
for the full-year. Assuming, I'm repeating it correctly, is there any specific cadence on how
that ratio might evolve over the remaining three quarters?

A - Jay S Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Cadence, if you go back and look at last year as a proxy, the numbers would have been
52- 63-63-61. That would have been the quarter-over-quarter -- that would have been a
quarterly progression last year. What I suggested was I think, when the dust settles this
year, it'll be slightly below 60. So I think, starting out with that lower number this year, you
can kind of benchmark it of what you can see in the numbers from last year?

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Okay that actually is helpful. Thank you.

-- Greg, I don't see that much difference throughout the rest of this year and going
forward it might be a point or 2, but that's.

FINAL

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Okay. And the final question will be around, the ongoing discussion you have with
shareholders around investments in technology, data analytics and algorithms. It feels like,
algorithms, data analytics have all replaced the rhetoric management uses on all
conference calls. And it's just that, you were hearing from everyone, use those buzzwords
and when I think of data analytics and algorithms, I think of data scientists sitting in a room
crunching through numbers and there's a lot of other companies that have a lot more
scale and size to invest in that type of initiatives. So I'm curious about your initiatives and
the balance you strike between doing it in-house and then using outside vendors and just
adding some more color around what you've been doing there is always helpful, thank
you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark E Watson

{BIO 1463509 <GO>}

Well I just want to say that we've been using those buzzwords for a while. It's interesting,
when you asked the question about the difference between doing it in-house and using
third-party vendors. When we started doing this in-house a couple of years ago, we did so
because there were very few third-party vendors and now they're popping up
everywhere. And actually at a meeting that we had a couple of months ago, on
technology, we were talking, we're always talking about how we want to allocate our
resources on building technology and what we're quickly realizing is there's so much more
available today that third-parties have already created that we don't have to build a lot of
our digital things that we were doing two years ago and so our shift is focusing more and
more now towards trying to find best-in-class technology that we can apply for ourselves
instead of trying to create it for ourselves. And also, while I didn't talk about it this quarter,
I think you all have heard me, in the past talked about how our workforce is really changed
a lot, while our headcount hasn't really changed too much. We have many more data
science well we didn't have any data scientists a few years ago, we have many more
actuaries today. We have Software Engineers today we have a lot more people that are
very focused on data and figuring things out from an automated perspective, which is why
we've made the point that we've been able to grow so much without having to add
headcount in general, but add underwriter headcount in particular.
And so, particularly for our small account business, it's much more about and I'm saying
this figuratively not entirely literally. It's much more about a portfolio approach, than just
risk by risk, but for our large account business it's still very relationship driven and very
much risk by risk. So it's really opposite ends of the spectrum.
So, we'll try and come up with some new buzzwords next quarter but I do think that we've
kind of we the industry has kind of hit a tipping point in recognizing that there's
technology available and we'd better be using.

Right, I know you value your distribution partners and but we're also hearing in the
distribution side, investment in technology and it seems like there's risk for
disintermediation and I know you're not going to throw your distribution partners under
the bus on a conference call. But can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in that
side of the business because distribution isn't a very expensive proposition for any
insurance company?

A - Mark H Rose

{BIO 1557365 <GO>}

Well that's right and so one of the things that I've said on previous earnings calls, I didn't
think they would necessarily be disintermediation in any one part of the value chain, but I
thought there would be disintermediation in the sense that those that have figured out
how to use technology effectively, will be able to reduce the cost it takes to deliver the
health the product to the end user the policy holder and I thought that those that were
not investing in technology, would get left behind over time and I think that you're slowly
starting to see that a little bit now but if you think about my remarks from earlier today, in
and distribution.

Bloomberg Transcript

The point one of the points I was trying to make is we've made it really easy for our
distribution partners to engage us and that makes it less expensive for them to deliver
the policy to the business owner. So, I think you'll see us all get connected, I think that we
underwriters are good at evaluating and selecting risk.
And I think that brokers are really good at helping business owners understand what risk
they need to insure and the best way to go about it and most importantly of all and this is
particularly true for larger accounts, providing choice and in a whole account solution to
the business owner. One of the things that I know we're so good at slicing ourselves into
little specialties that it makes it impossible for sorry, it makes it very difficult for us to
provide a one-stop shopping opportunity for a business owner and so the broker plays a
very valuable role in that they kind of bring all the different products in the market
together and deliver them more seamlessly than we underwriters are capable of doing
right now. And again I'm talking about larger accounts that are more specialized. For small
bot policies we'll see how that market evolves.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks for the color. I guess the final comment, I'll make is in you guys can respond
is that with the lower tax rate going forward it seems like you've lowered your combined
ratio targets and that's in essence in an effort to hit your 700 basis points of the risk-free
rate return hurdle. So I think -- Go ahead.

A - Mark E Watson

{BIO 1463509 <GO>}

I'm going to answer for Jay I think the reality. I don't think that's, I don't mean that may be
an outcome but that the reality is we keep looking at what we're paying in taxes every
quarter and this has been going on for a few years now and the reality is that our effective
taxes rate looked a lot more what like what Jay just described and I think our auditors are
really leaning on us to think hard about what our effective tax rate should be.
