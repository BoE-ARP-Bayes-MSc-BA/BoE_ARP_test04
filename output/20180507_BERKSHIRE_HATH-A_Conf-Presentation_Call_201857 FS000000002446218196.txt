MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION

FINAL

Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Hello and welcome to Yahoo Finance's coverage of Berkshire Hathaway's Annual Meeting
Live from the CenturyLink Center in Omaha, Nebraska. I'm Andy Serwer here with my cohost, Jen Rogers. We're also joined by Myles Udland who will be heading into the meeting
shortly.

Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

We are just about 30 minutes away from Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger taking the
stage. Investors and Buffett fans were lined up early here, and we mean early.

Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Wow.

Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

This is what it looked like, though, just around 6:00 this morning. That's about an hour
before the doors even opened. And then, here's the moment. The doors opened and
those people make the mad dash to get the best seats.

Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

The running of the shareholders, Jen. Around 7:00 AM, Warren Buffet and a gaggle of
press took in the sights here in the Convention Center full of booths from Berkshire
associated businesses like Dairy Queen, Brooks Running, and Coca-Cola.

Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

So, Berkshire released its earnings last night, and Myles has been digging into the results.
Buffett himself tipped his hat a little bit about some of the big news, revealing that he's
taken a larger stake in Apple. What else did we learn?

Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

Yeah. We also have a very interesting quarter, so a little bit of a quirk here. The net loss
attributable to Berkshire shareholders, $1.1 billion, but the operating profit, which strips out
the loss, which is really attributable to that securities portfolio. Wells Fargo is down a lot.
Coke shares were down almost 6%. It was $5.3 billion. So Buffett himself was bracing for
this rule. He had told shareholders in previous quarters, this is going to make our earnings
essentially incomprehensible on a year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter basis.
He said that these adjustments, which are now required to report each quarter, are
generally meaningless. This is the language that he used in the 10-Q with respect to how
Page 2 of 164



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2018-05-05

you figure out Berkshire's overall value. So, I think we'll talk about that a little bit in the
meeting just to sort of let shareholders know exactly what's going on. Here's why we're
reporting a loss. And also going forward, I think the quarterly report might be even less
sort of incisive for Berkshire shareholders.

FINAL

Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Berkshire Hathaway is big, but not as big as the U.S. government and the tax code.

Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

Yeah. No joke. It looked incomprehensible to everybody but you.

Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

Everybody but him, I suppose.

Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Right. That's true.

Bloomberg Transcript

Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

We also have Yahoo Finance's Julia La Roche. She's on the floor here in the Convention
Center. Julia already got to walk around the floor today with Warren. What did you guys
talk about?

Julia La Roche
That's right, Jen. I did get a question into the Oracle of Omaha as he made his way
around to the different booths. And the question is, when are you going to make that
move, make that acquisition with that $100 billion cash pile that you have? What has to
happen? And he said that he's waiting for that phone call. So I asked him, what do you
want to hear on that phone call? And he said he just wants to hear about a good business.
Now I also asked him about the moat. What is the moat for Berkshire Hathaway? And he
says it's the culture. It's the management style. And as you know, he has a very hands-off
management style. So if you're looking to be acquired, give Warren Buffett a call, that's
what he wants.

Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

People always talking about what companies will Berkshire buy? Amazon, giant private
companies, Coke Brothers, it's all out there.

Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

Page 3 of 164



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc

There are a lot of names and there will definitely be a lot of questions about that given all
the cash that he is sitting with right now.

Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

FINAL

Absolutely.

Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

All right. So, moving on right now, we've got investors making their way in to the arena.
Capacity right now for that crowd inside, expected to be 17,500. As we said, the line
started before dawn here in Omaha and we were there. Correction. We sent Myles. Myles
Udland was there, meeting those very first investors in line. Take a look.

Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

All right. We are here with the first people in line. Sort of there's a few bullpens, but these
guys are here. Mike and Mike, they're from Long Island. They were here at about 3 o'clock
this morning. Guys, good to talk to you.

Unverified Participant

Bloomberg Transcript

I appreciate it. Thank you.

Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

All right. So Mike (00:03:46) you are 20 years old. This is your fifth meeting. Tell me a little
bit about why you got here first? Why you come to these meetings and what you hope to
get out of them?

Unverified Participant
Really, it's just all about the investment knowledge of Buffett. I mean, it's worth its weight
in gold every minute you could listen to it, and it's almost – he's a shining idol on a hill in
terms of capitalism and what this country represents. And I think it's just a great event
overall.

Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

And (00:04:12) how long have you been a shareholder?

Unverified Participant
I've been a shareholder since 2009. Fortunately enough I've bought it in January 2009
and haven't looked back ever since.

All right. Great. And have you guys usually gotten here first? This is the first time you've
come in super early?

FINAL

Unverified Participant
We normally come here around the same time every year and normally get a spot right
up front.

Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

So, what time you were here today?

Unverified Participant
We're here at 3:00 AM.

Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

And what have you been doing over the last three hours? It's about 6:11 AM right now.

Bloomberg Transcript

Unverified Participant
Walking around, keeping loose, (00:04:38), reading the letter a little bit. It's been a lot of
fun, meeting a lot of great people.

Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

All right. And Mike (00:04:45), there is one kind of thing that you hope to, maybe in part
to other fathers out there, other sons that are thinking about coming or haven't come,
what would you say to them?

Unverified Participant
I would say it's a great experience. You definitely should do it. It's basically Woodstock for
capitalists, and it's great collegiality of the meeting, unique great people online and so on
and just the investment wisdom. It's memories that will last the lifetime.

Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

All right. Great. Thanks, guys so much. And enjoy the meeting today.

Unverified Participant
We'll do.

Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

I love that young Mike (00:05:12) keeping loose. You know what they say about this
meeting. It's a marathon. It's not a sprint. So, you really got to be flexible.

FINAL

Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

The whole weekend.

Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

The whole weekend. Warren Buffett has said that he thinks attendance here at the
Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting could break the record – could break the record of
42,000 that was set a few years back. What's the trend with attendance been?

Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Well, three years ago when they set that record that was the 50th Anniversary, Jen, of
Berkshire Hathaway. So, you'd expect a lot of people to come. Attendance was up the
following year 2016. That was the first year. We live-streamed.

Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Was it at fault?

Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

And some people did blame us. I said maybe people are staying home and watching us,
but actually attendance has built 2016, 2017, and now to 2018. And Warren Buffett himself
said that he thinks that our live stream has actually increased attendance because of the
attention that we're bringing to it.

Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

I have to say of all the years that I have been here, the line seemed incredibly long this
morning and multiple entrances had lines that were wrapping around.
(00:06:11)

Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

No. So the front of the arena is on 10th Street. That's a North South Street. And I was
hearing that, for the first time ever, that line actually went all the way to the South and
then turned East around the corner. So, that would be the longest line to kind of get in
that main entrance. And then, also walking around the convention hall yesterday, I mean, it
was absolutely mobbed. The number of stands were just – there were lines to get into
the exhibit.

Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Right. Like you were saying...

FINAL

(00:06:31)

Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

Fruit of the Loom is my favorite. Fruit of the Loom, the line that had to be 100 people long.
And it went back two full booths, it went past the shoes, went all the way to the NetJets
which itself had a long line because people want to go in, look at the private jets. See's
Candy as we know, always a mob scene. Brooks Running is always one of the most
crowded booths. And it took 20 minutes to do one lap of the floor yesterday.

Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

And just to be clear, this was the line to get into Fruit of the Loom. Not even to buy
anything. It was like a hot club. People are like lining up.

Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, I got to say, I've got some great deal in there. That's all I'll say.

Bloomberg Transcript

Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

So, it's interesting too. So, how does the math work? There's 40,000 people here, but
only 17,500 can fit into the arena. The overflow is over here, shopping still in the
convention center. Then there are other rooms here and across the street, The Hilton,
where people can view this, here watching in Yahoo Finance. And so, there's another
20,000 people spread about.

Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

So, where do all these people come from? I mean, I have met people from all over the
world. We wanted to find out a way that we could see this information in one place. Julia
La Roche now has moved to just below our stage with more and where everyone comes
from. Julia?

Julia La Roche
That's right. Some people describe this as the Woodstock of capitalism. Others describe
it as a pilgrimage, a journey that you make once in a lifetime, sometimes many times in a
lifetime. And so, we have folks coming from all over the world and we want you to come
tell us where you're coming from, but we have a lot of folks coming in from Europe.
I see Rome. I see Spain. We have France, Germany, Norway. And we have, again, a ton of
people across the United States coming into Omaha. We have South America. We have
Page 7 of 164



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2018-05-05

Venezuela here, Colombia and then in the Caribbean. I also see Bermuda on our map.
And as you know we have a lot of folks coming in from China. We had a big China event
hosted by Yahoo Finance. So this is a global event here in Omaha, Nebraska.

Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

FINAL

All right. Thank you so much, Julia. I've met a bunch of people from China, of course.

Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Yeah.

Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

The door that I walked in through, the very first people were from China and got here at
midnight. What about you guys? Where's the furthest you've had somebody from or most
interesting?

Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Well, that's kind of the other side of the globe. I mean...

Bloomberg Transcript

Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

Yeah. I don't think I'm going to get further than China, and I've also met a number of
people from there.

Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

There's a thousands of people from China. I mean, it's not just 20 or 30 people.

Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

Yeah.

Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

It's thousands of people from China. I mean, there are people from India. There are
people from Southeast Asia. There are people from South America. That can be a long
trip as well, of course. So, it really is a global phenomenon.

Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

Yeah. And then a couple of guys at the hotel this morning, they were in from Ireland when
we were walking around in line. We saw a lot of people actually from the U.S. everywhere,
Florida, Seattle, Philadelphia, New Jersey, some of us this from Chicago. So, exotic points,
Long Island. We had Mike and Mike (00:09:04) from Long Island...

Mike and Mike (00:09:05)

(00:09:06) Long Island. That's the way it should be.

Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Exactly. That's so funny.

Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

Is it that how would always is?

Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

It feels like that way, right?

Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

You'd go so far and then you find somebody from just around the corner.

Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

There it is.

Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

So, you guys, we have so much more coming. We are just about 20 minutes away from
our exclusive live stream of the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting. We're all waiting for
Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger to take the stage. Andy, though, already got a chance
to sit down with Warren Buffett.

Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

I did. And it's a great interview. I'd like to think lot of ground we covered.

Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

We think it's a great interview.

Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

FINAL

It's kind of a tradition that you guys get to sit down now.

Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Yeah. And there's just a wide range of conversation. I mean, Warren Buffett is the kind of
person that you literally can talk to him about anything under the sun, and he has just an
insightful take on it. And I think that's the main reason for the draw here is that people just
– and they ask him questions about your kids, and life, and jobs, and working, and
investing of course.

Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

So you had about 30 minutes with him that you guys sat down and talked? You covered
really a wide range of topics with him, everything from the Trump tax cuts, to China, and
even the Me Too movement, we're going to take a listen.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q&A
Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

You've praised the President's Tax Cut, calling it a win that the American economy's back,
I guess.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

No. I have said that it is a win, a tax bill that was targeted in a big way to help corporation.
So, it helps Berkshire's million shareholders. This is what I would have done if I was going
to have a tax cut, but – so as an individual, I do not agree with the philosophy that led to it.
But as a steward at Berkshire Hathaway, I have to tell you that it does our shareholders' a
lot of good.

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

I see. Because I was going to ask you, I mean there must be a cost to this. There's...

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

There's always a cost.

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Right. I mean, and it sort of suggest that savings from the government then, all that
money was maybe misspent by the government. I mean, is there a cost that downside to
Page 10 of 164



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2018-05-05

the tax cut?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

FINAL

Well, there's always – I mean...

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

A trade off.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

If you take taxes to zero forever, then cut – you wouldn't be issuing a lot of bonds. But
there's – you can't ever do just one thing in economics. You probably can't in physics
either. There's a butterfly effect. But in economics, you always have to say, and then what,
and if you give a large break to one group, it's not free. If I were going to cut the
revenues of the United States, I would have helped different group of people. But as I say,
it is very helpful to Berkshire. It's not that we were non-competitive before, but our
shareholders are better off.

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Don Harding (00:11:47), one of our readers – viewers asked, so have you increased
salaries and benefits for Berkshire employees like some other companies have done in
the wake of the announcement about tax cut?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Some of our portfolio companies have done that. But we're not paying dividends,
we're not repurchasing shares, we're investing, and we'll use the money for investment.

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

I wonder, Warren, what you think of President Trump's tweets particularly about the stock
market. And one of our readers asked, Yuanyi Chin (00:12:16), from San Mateo, how
Warren Buffet would rate President Trump?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

I'm not going to rate the president. But I would say that communication is enormously
important for a president. Going back to Roosevelt in the 1930s, every family in the
country will sort of hover around the radio. I mean, if you had the big networks, you were
talking to everybody. And now it's much more diffused, and obviously President Trump
feels that he does not like it filtered through the traditional (00:12:49), so he's going to do
it directly.
I believe communication is enormously important for a CEO, and I like to talk to our
shareholders directly. If I were frustrated with my ability to talk to Mike (00:13:01), the
people I'm responsible for, I would try to figure out how to do it directly. Obviously, I think
the president feels that way.

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

So, can we talk a little bit about healthcare initiative? Have you told a story about how that
came about? Did Jamie (00:13:14) call you up on a conference call with Jeff (00:13:16)?
How did it happen?

FINAL

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

I think probably I can't answer with 100% precision, but my impression is that it came
about because there's a quite young works for us, Todd Combs also on JPMorgan's
board. And Todd and I have talked a lot about healthcare, and I think Todd developed
some ideas about how something like this might work. And I think he's the one that
actually talked to Jamie.

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

And is this really just for these three companies or is it going to be a model for the rest of
the health care system? What's the point?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

I hope if we can figure out a way to have better care at lower cost and stem the constant
rise as a percentage of GDP, I hope every company in the United States steals the idea of
Robert.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

And just I also want to touch on cryptocurrencies, I know that you've had some negative
feelings about them. But now Wall Street institutions seem to be dipping their toes in, and
I wonder, A, if you've changed your mind at all and, B, one of the biggest mysteries in
America, what did you tell Katy Perry about cryptocurrencies?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, (00:14:26).

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

I guess so. It's said that you guys talked about cryptocurrencies, but none of us know what
you guys said, it's just between you two.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. We did. We did.

FINAL

But I will answer your question about it. But there's two kinds of items that people buy and
think they're investing. One really is investing and the other isn't. If you buy something, a
farm, an apartment house, or invest in a business and look to the asset itself to determine
whether you've done something, what the farm produces, what the business earns and
so on, you don't really care when the stock market is open. You can do that on a private
basis, in fact, you do it on a private basis if you buy a farm or apartment house generally.
And it's a perfectly satisfactory investment.
You look at the investment itself to deliver the return view. Now, if you buy something like
Bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don't really – you don't have anything to produce
anything, and you're just hoping the next guy pays more. And the next – and you only feel
you'll find the next guy to pay more, if he thinks he's going to find somebody that's going
to pay more.
Now, if you ban trading in farms, you could still buy farms and have a perfectly decent
investment. If you ban trading in apartment houses or even in equities, if you ban trading
in Berkshire Hathaway for the next five years, our investors would do fine over time.

Bloomberg Transcript

But if you ban trading in (00:15:48) or if you ban trading in some bitcoin, which nobody
knows exactly what it is, people would say, well, why in the world would I buy it? And you
aren't investing when you do that. You're speculating. There's nothing wrong with if you
want to gamble. Somebody else will come along and pay you more money tomorrow.
That's one kind of game. That is not investing.

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Interesting. I want to ask you some questions for the Chinese audience. First of all, can
you say ni hao to them?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Ni hao.

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

All right. How much do you think the Chinese economy and markets will ultimately
become like the United States? How much convergence do you think there will be?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

I really don't know the answer to that. What I do know is they have found the secret sauce
for themselves just like we found the secret sauce a couple of centuries ago. And so, they
have had an economy in the last 60 years or thereabout. They have unleashed the
potential of their citizen rate and where for really centuries they did not progress that
much economically for overwhelming portion of the population. What they've done in the
last 50 or 60 years is a total economic miracle. I never would have thought it could have
happened. But the truth is they're smarter as we are, they work as hard as we are and
they can have a growth in the economy from a lower base that will exceed ours

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Shifting gears. Warren, I want to ask you about women in the workplace and the #MeToo
movement. What role can men play to advance women in their careers in business and in
the economy?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, I had and have two sisters. They're absolutely as smart as I am and better
personalities and you'd like them better. They were born around my time in 1930 and they
were told to marry early and marry well. That was the unseen message. I mean nobody
ever said it that way, but yeah.
So, I have seen half of the United States' talent, basically, put off to the side. And it's one
of the things makes me optimistic about America because when I look at what we
accomplished using half our talent for a couple of centuries, and now, I think of doubling
the talent that effectively employed or at least has a chance to be, it makes me very
optimistic about this country. And good managers are scarce. Talent is always rare, and
you better use every bit of it that you find. And certainly, the way I've felt personally all my
life.

you what do you want to be remembered for?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

As a teacher. Yeah. That would be very flattering if I would feel that that was on my
tombstone because I benefited from terrifically from teachers. Not all teachers who were
employed as teacher, but teachings of all kinds, but the people spending their time to
pass along what they have learned...

Yeah. Well, I don't do anything at investing, but – that's complicated. I've just been at it a
long time. I mean, just look at them. I just put that $114, and the S&P had $400,000.

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Well, I think there's a little more to it than that. Scott (00:19:27) from Papillion, Nebraska
says how do you tell the difference between reasonable and unreasonable fear? So when
there is a stocks down, maybe it should be down or stocks down maybe it shouldn't be
down?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, you just keep looking at the facts. I mean, you're looking at a business that's the
important thing. You don't look at a stock chart. I looked at stock charts for years. I used to
have a lot of fun doing that. I was kind of groping around for all of philosophy. You look at
the business. I mean how you decide – if you own a half interest with some buddy of yours
in a McDonald's store, how do you decide whether it's a successful investment? Well, if
the stone is two feet out, and there's no business today, do you say, well, I made a
terrible deal. No. You look at how it's performing as a business over time, how it's doing
versus the competition.

A - Myles Udland

Yeah. Exactly and that's because he has this wisdom that people really seem to gravitate
towards. And I'll tell you there is a lot more to that interview. We're going to put the whole
thing up after this weekend. You can watch that. But one of the most popular parts
because we did a piece on it was how you could have made essentially $400,000 in the
stock market. And he tells a story of investing $114 in the market in 1942 when he was an
11-year-old kid. And if you just left it there and let it compound not even put any more
money in, it would be worth $400,000, was that 76 years later. Now, you may not want to
wait that long but say you just wait 50 years and also say you're putting money in every

A - Unverified Participant
Well, I mean, of course, he mentioned Bitcoin, and I'm sure he will get questions on that
today. Probably not from the analysts or the journalists, but likely from shareholders may
know he takes a majority of those questions especially in the afternoon from
shareholders. And I thought it was very interesting especially in light of this morning's
results from Berkshire Hathaway where it seemed disappointing because of this
accounting change. But the point is the operating profits are good. There's a real
underlying business if you're buying Berkshire Hathaway. What you think of the business is
your own decision.
But with Bitcoin, I mean, he made the point pretty simply. You're hoping someone else
pays more, and Dan Roberts had broken out that post earlier. A lot of people had read
that. I'm sure that a lot of people didn't like his response to that, but it's been a pretty
common refrain. I mean, he hasn't said a lot of positive things about Bitcoin in the past,
but I thought that was a very measured and simple way to lay it out that you think this
thing is worth this price and hoping that someone will buy it at a higher price, but there's
no underlying business or cash flow impacting the value of Bitcoin.

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

He's a very optimistic guy, but on Bitcoin not so much. Even this morning telling CNBC it's

A - Julia La Roche

Bloomberg Transcript

That's right, Jen. I'm here at Duracell. You might have seen this exhibit. It's one of the
bigger exhibits. I'm now with Duracell's, Shane Grady. Shane, thank you so much for joining
us and tell us what this exhibit is.

A - Shane Grady
Definitely. Yeah. This is the Duracell PowerForward program which is actually a disaster
response program where we come in within 24 hours as our goal of any major disaster
that causes a large power outage. We come and help people from a power standpoint.

A - Julia La Roche
All right. Can you show us more of the truck back here?

A - Shane Grady
Yeah. Definitely in this truck – and all of our trucks carries 3,000 pounds of batteries or
more. Here we have AA, AAA, Cs, Ds, 9 volts, we also carry hearing aid batteries. These
batteries, of course, are for flashlights and radios, but it really goes well beyond that into
home health aides like daily dialysis machines, ventilators, kids' toys and anything that you
can keep everyone sane and calm and try to give them a normal life.

A - Julia La Roche
And since 2011, you've made 48 deployments. Tell us about some of the recent
deployments that you made last year. We saw a lot of hurricanes last year. What did you
experience?

FINAL

We definitely did. We spent two weeks in our Hurricane Harvey with two of our trucks. Four
then immediately went over to Hurricane Irma into Florida with four trucks, and then Irma –
I'm sorry – and then Maria over in Puerto Rico was 40 days, which is quite a long
deployment for us. And those people are going through so much.

A - Julia La Roche
Yeah. Can you talk to us a bit more about the work that you all have done in Puerto Rico?
We kept on hearing about the loss of power there. What did you experience during your
time in Puerto Rico?

A - Shane Grady
Those people are going through so much. The entire island, think that 3.4 million people
without power for so long. They were so grateful of our attendance and our efforts in
coming in to help out. It was huge. So, we flew over two trucks, ended up giving out 100
tons of batteries.

A - Julia La Roche
And why did you all recognize that there was a need to do this?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Shane Grady
Well, during a disaster there are so many people who give water, so many people donate
food and a lot of people give clothing. But during that whole span, the power was still out.
And it seemed like Duracell will step up, we were already making short-term reliable
power and let's just come in and help out with the product we're already making.

A - Julia La Roche
Well, great work. Jen, back to you all.

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

Oh, okay.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

All right. So it's interesting, the Duracell thing because...

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

...in China, Jen, you discovered that his likeness – Warren Buffett's likeness is on Duracell
battery packages and it's used to sell them, of course.

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean, he is a huge celebrity in China. We've seen him on Coke cans, before but I
had no idea that he was actually used to sell batteries as well. And they don't even need
his name.

FINAL

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Right. It's just his image.

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

You can just show a picture.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

And Charlie Munger too, apparently, he's on buses all over probably advertising BYD
there. The electric car company they've invested in and another guest told us that
Buffett's likeness, it's not just Beijing and Shanghai, you can go to the far reaches of
Western China and you'll see his picture. So, in a way, his celebrity is even greater in China
than it is here in the United States because his likeness is not used here in the United
States which, I think, is an interesting point.

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

And it's pretty big here as well.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

Maybe even bigger there. One person we're keeping very busy today is Julia La Roche,
running around with another guest from the floor. Julia?

Q - Julia La Roche
All right. BYG is the world's largest manufacturer of electric vehicles and it's also Warren
Buffett's biggest China investment. We're joined by Stella Li, the President of the BYD
Motors. Stella, thank you so much for joining us.

I think it's amazing. They love BYD. They love BYD management and they then also gave
us a very strong support, always tell us we need to look in for long-term success. Don't
look for the short-term. So, each time our business is up, down, but they always stand out
and say, we support you. Continue doing whatever you are doing. Yeah. Don't look for the
short-term play. So, I think, it's a really big honor to gather them as an investor and
especially as the greatest supporter to us.

Q - Julia La Roche
Now, you've been heading up the expansion efforts in North America. How is that going
and where are you seeing opportunities?

A - Stella Li

{BIO 17010473 <GO>}

Yeah. I think that we're doing very well. We, first in 2013, we bought a facility. Then in 2014,
we started with 30 employee. And then now, after four years, we have more than 900
people. And then we just two months ago signed an agreement with the SMART Union,
become really well connected with the local community.

Bloomberg Transcript

So that's only the first baby step for our expansion here. So, I think we will continue really
pushing forward, changing the bus industry to set up target really help the industry to be
100% zero emission in next 5 to 10 years. And then the same time we introduced our
electric trucks here including refuse trucks and also (00:27:53) to use at port and also
electric forklift.
So we continue to broaden the whole range of the fleet to U.S. to really pushing the
industry and to really try to working harder for our mission of changing the world to give
the whole community a better, cleaner environment.

Q - Julia La Roche
Well, we know BYD is very well known in China and you do have the buses as you
mentioned that's what you're best known for and you've been expanding in California.
Where else in the U.S. can we find some of the BYD electric vehicle buses?

A - Stella Li

{BIO 17010473 <GO>}

Yeah. I want to remind you already continuous three years BYD is the world's largest
consumer EV car company in the world. Just the difference our majority is in China. And so
far, the market is – the biggest market is in China. So, we still want to focus on Chinese
market to increase the sales volume. And then maybe working some target to someday
to achieve 1 million electric cars. And then our expansion is like a very selectively in some
country not go to every other country. We didn't have a plan to come to U.S. yet.

Q - Julia La Roche
And how about the passenger car? I'm curious about the opportunity in the U.S. because
again you are known for the buses. Are you going to be bringing electric vehicle
passenger cars especially when we start seeing Ford getting rid of some of those cars in
their fleet and focusing more on SUVs and trucks? Is this an opportunity for you all?

A - Stella Li

{BIO 17010473 <GO>}

Yes. Maybe someday. And also this time like in April just two weeks ago like there's the
Beijing Auto Show. BYD first time unveiling our concept car for EV. It's to attract a lot of
attention. I think it's very best, very sexy stylish design. So this was the contribution came
from like a chief designer, like a Wolfgang Egger results. So he continued brought to like a
global talent, designer, joined BYD, and we will continue to introduce very attractive like a
EV from the design and to the market. Plus BYD first time introduced what we call the DLink, this kind of technology.
So you're sitting in the car, then our – like a instrument center, is more like it is a big, large
phone, iPhone, you can even rotate in this path to like a play, any old app you have. So our
cars become more intelligent now. So we're talking about a lot of Internet company invest
for a passenger car, with a stylish design, with all the high tech. But BYD is also leading the
curve as an auto manufacturer. We'll make it very sexy, stylish design, plus, make our cars
more intelligent, and will feature old, like a smart function you have in the phone into the
car. So that's also attract a lot of attention.

Q - Julia La Roche
Right. Stella Li, President of BYD Motors. Thank you so much. And back to you, guys.

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

...getting close, just about 5 minutes until the meeting really gets underway. And for those
of you unfamiliar with how things work here at the meeting, right now, investors are in the
arena and they are being treated to a short film that the company puts together every
year that is full of celebrity cameos and a lot of funny moments.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Yeah. We can't show you the whole thing, but we do have just a little bit to give you some
flavor. And this is really the first time any part of annual meeting video has been allowed
to be seen outside the arena. And the reason why is because a lot of celebrities and
Hollywood movie stars are in this and they don't want to – they're doing it just for a private
screening, essentially. They don't want to get out on the Internet.
So, let me explain what's going on here. Warren Buffett really wanted everyone here
watching the stream to see this. It's Charlie Munger attempting to open up a box of See's
peanut brittle and he's getting more and more anxious and frustrated because, Lord
knows, he want to get to that peanut brittle. And what's going to happen – and the reason
why it's important for you to see this is because what's going to happen is when Charlie

and Warren walk out onto the stage or the arena, Warren's going to give him some
peanut brittle and probably the whole arena will erupt in applause. So, it's sort of an inside
joke and we're setting it up for you so you understand what the inside joke is here, if you
follow that.

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

Yeah. You all get to be part of this with us. It is hard to open these.

A - Andy Serwer

You need a knife to open a box of See's peanut brittle, full stop. And Lord knows I've
opened up a lot of those boxes.

expecting a little reveal of. There is a lot of eating at this event, if you don't know.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

FINAL

They eat that peanut brittle on stage the whole time.

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

They eat the peanut brittle, they're drinking soda, it's not the healthiest diet ever. So,
after – when they come out, they get questions. And the first question is a big deal, right?

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Yes. It's always asked by Carol Loomis, who is a very senior journalist from Fortune
magazine. I worked with her for decades, an old friend of Warren Buffett. She edits the
shareholder letter and she gets the honor of asking the first question. And the interesting
thing is Carol takes it upon herself to ask the most salient, difficult, hard, tough question.
She really works it and thinks about it. So, I want to ask you guys – Myles, what do you think
Carol Loomis – and she won't tell us what it is – what do you think Carol Loomis' first
question is going to be?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

So, I think what she'll do is, I think she will dredge up an old quote from Warren Buffett
about Apple, why he didn't like the company, why he would never buy it. I think she'll
recite it to him, and then ask, well, Warren, what happened? You now own over 200
million shares of the company. You own 5% of the world's largest company. It's the
biggest stockholding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. And she'll say, what the hell?

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Are you a hypocrite?

A - Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

Right?

FINAL

It's definitely top of mind. I don't know. I feel like she's going to be a little bit less like what
happened yesterday. I feel like GE, which a lot of people were talking about in the line as
well. So many people think that GE has been just beaten down, like look at the stock price,
and Warren could be the savior to come in here for it. I think that could be an interesting
way to go.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

All right. My pick is Wells Fargo, and how much longer can you own this dead horse or this
company that's just been besieged by regulators, shareholders, and he stood by the
company and withstood a lot of criticism already. And I think that that is going to be Carol
Loomis' first question.

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

Good one

A - Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

And you know what? If you go back, I think the most formative moment in Berkshire's
history, certainly in Warren Buffett's public history, was his episode with Solomon Brothers
back in the early 1990s. And I think what happened to Wells Fargo is more direct to
consumers. People understand why that was bad much more than what happened to
(00:35:03).

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

Much more consumer facing.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

And it's so interesting when you say that, Myles, because he said I'm never doing that
again, right? And here you kind of are. I mean, in a way, it's inevitable. If you take big
steps, stocks like that, that you're going to at some point have a problem.

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

We have less than a minute to go. The movie is ending up there. Andy, this is a reflection
of America in some point here.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

It really is. I mean if you look around at all these companies it is an amazing cross section
industrial, consumer, things that you wear, things that you eat, transportation. It is a slice of
America. It's a cross section that reflects our economy, but it's Warren Buffett's take on
the best of America.
Now you may not agree with it. You may say Coca-Cola that's sugar water but it's a treat.
It's iconic. It sells really well. And so he doesn't buy companies that don't perform well.
Well, he tries not to in any event. And so it's really interesting to consider this whole
convention center here. Warren Buffett's take on the best of America

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

I mean, I see bankers walking next to farmers, walking next to ranchers, walking next to

mentioned that, Jen, that people are bringing their children, not typically young children
but teenagers, who maybe are sort of interested in Apple and investing and they kind of
see that and have heard about this event and it's kind of fun.

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

And that goes to Warren Buffett not as an investor but as a teacher. And the whole
wisdom of what we love to get from the letters and frankly with the Q&A here today really

And Warren Buffett has said that if he can be remembered for anything it would be as a

mostly answering questions and hearing what's on their minds. That's a very important
part of what's going on.

Right now, we are looking at pictures from inside the arena but that was just a dark shot
there. We have the Berkshire Hathaway name up. That means that we are getting very
close to Charlie Munger, Edward Buffett.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

He's like a rocket launcher.
(00:37:39)
Well, they take their time. I mean, Charlie Munger, you're not going to hurry, Charlie, out
there. Charlie will go out there and take his sweet time and he's going to be ready when
he's ready. And, of course, they've got to get the peanut brittle and the cherry cokes out
there.

A - Jennif er Rogers

Well, we know how long that takes to open. There they are. We're going to turn it over to
the annual meeting, Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger.

See you back soon.

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

FINAL

Good morning. I'm Warren. He's Charlie. Charlie does most things better than I do, but
that one was a little tough. Charlie, maybe you can chew on it on a while.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

At the formal meeting that will begin at 3:45, we will elect 14 directors. Charlie and I are
two of them, and I would like to introduce the other 12. I'll do it in alphabetical order.

Bloomberg Transcript

If they will stand as I announce their name. Withhold your applause. May be hard to do, but
give it your best. And when we get all through, then you can let loose, but – we'll do this
alphabetically. Beginning with Greg Abel, if you'll stand and stay standing, Howard Buffett,
Steve Burke, Sue Decker, Bill Gates, Sandy Gottesman, Charlotte Guyman, Ajit Jain, Tom
Murphy, Ron Olson, Walter Scott, and Meryl Witmer.
Let's see. This morning, we posted both our earnings and our 10-Q. And if we can put up
slide one, you can take a look at what was reported. And as I warned you in the annual
report, a new accounting rule was introduced at the beginning of this year. And it provides
that our equity securities, whether we sell them or not, are mark-to-market every day.
So, we can have a gain or loss of a couple billion dollars in our equity securities portfolio,
and that day, according to the accounting principles now in effect, which are a change, will
be recorded as making a couple billion dollars that day or losing a couple billion. And I told
you that would produce some very unusual effects from quarter-to-quarter. And it further
explains why I like to release our earnings early Saturday morning and as well as the 10-Q
to give people a chance to read through the explanation. Because if you just were handed
this with a TV monitor, you know, at 3:30 in the afternoon or whatever it might be, you
would report the net earnings figure, understandably very quickly. And it really is not
representative of what's going on in the business at all.
So, I'll – if you look at the figure of operating earnings, which is what we look at, we
actually earned a record amount for any quarter we've ever had. And that includes, no
realized gains or losses on securities, or on the few remaining derivatives we have. You
might leave that slide up there just a little longer. Maybe it's up.
The insurance underwriting, GEICO had a quite a good-sized turnaround in profitability
and a good gain, although not as big a gain as last year, which was a record in terms of
policies in force, and really, throughout most of our businesses. And the details are in the
10-Q, which is up on our website now. And as you can see, the railroad was up
significantly, and most of our businesses tended to be up. Now we were aided in that, in a
Page 26 of 164



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2018-05-05

material way, by the reduction in the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Our
businesses were up significantly on a pre-tax basis, but the gain was further enhanced by
the change in the income tax rate.

FINAL

So that pretty well sums up the first quarter. We'll probably get some – may well get some
questions on it when we get into the question-and-answer section.
The questions we'll be getting, we've got the press over here, and we have the analysts
on my left, and of course, we have our partners out in front of me. And we will rotate
among you. And the questions we get, as we go through the next six hours or so, will
understandably relate to a lot of current events.
We may get asked, and we don't know the questions, but we may get asked, you know,
about Fed policy, or whether we're seeing any inflation, or whether business is speeding
up or down, or the threats we may face competitively in our businesses as we go along.
And anything goes on the questions, except we won't tell you what we're buying or
selling. But it really can be a question sometimes of confusing the forest with the trees.

Bloomberg Transcript

And I would like to just spend just a couple of minutes giving you a little perspective on
how you might think about investments, as opposed to the tendency to focus on what's
happening today, or even this minute, as you go through. And to help me in doing that, I'd
like to go back through a little personal history and we will start, I have here up here in
New York Times of March 12th, 1942. I'm a little behind on my reading. And if you go back
to that time, it was about, what? Just about three months, since we got involved in a war
which we were losing at that point.
The newspaper headlines were filled with bad news from the Pacific. And I've taken just a
couple of the headlines from the days preceding March 11th, which I'll explain was kind of a
momentous day for me. And so you can see these headlines. We've got slide two up
there, I believe. And we were in trouble, big trouble, in the Pacific. It was only going to be
a couple months later that the Philippines fell, but we were getting bad news. We might
go to slide three for March 9th. Hope you can read the headlines, anyway. The price of
the paper's three cents, incidentally.
And let's see, we've got March 10th up there, as slide, I want to get – whether it's
advanced technology of slides, I want to make sure I'm showing you the same thing that
I'm seeing in front of me. So anyway, on March 10th, when again, the news was bad, full
clearing path to Australia. And it was like it, the stock market had been reflecting this. And
I'd been watching a stock called Cities Service preferred stock, which had sold at $84 the
previous year. It had sold at $55 the year early in January, two months earlier and now it
was down to $40 on March 10th. So that night, despite these headlines, I said to my dad, I
said, I think I'd like to pull the trigger, and I'd like you to buy me three shares of Cities
Service preferred the next day.
And that was all I had. I mean, that was my capital accumulated over the previous five
years or thereabouts. And so my dad, the next morning, bought three shares. Well, let's
take a look at what happened the next day. Let's go to the next slide, please. And it was
Page 27 of 164



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2018-05-05

not a good day. The stock market, the Dow Jones Industrials, broke 100 on the downside.
Now they were down 2.28% as you see, but that was the equivalent of about a 500-point
drop now. So I'm in school wondering what is going on, of course.

FINAL

Incidentally, you'll see on the left side of the chart, the New York Times put the Dow
Jones Industrial Average below all the averages they calculated. They had their own
averages, which have since disappeared, but the Dow Jones has continued.
So the next day, we can go to the next slide and you will see what happened. The stock
that was at $39, my dad bought my stock right away in the morning as I'd asked him to,
my three shares. And so I paid the high for the day.

Bloomberg Transcript

That $38.25 was my tick, which was the high for the day. And by the end of the day, it was
down to $37, which was really kind of characteristic of my timing in stocks that was going
to appear in future years. But it was on the – what was then called the New York Curb
Exchange then became the American Stock Exchange. But things, even though the war
until the Battle of Midway looked very bad, and if you'll turn to the next slide, please, you'll
see that the stock did rather well. You can see where I bought at $38.25 and then the
stock went on actually to eventually be called by the City Service Company for over $200
a share. But this is not a happy story, because if you go to the next page, you will see that
I – well, as they always say, it seemed like a good idea at the time. So, I made $5 on it. It
was, again, typical of the behavior. But when you watch you go to $127, it looked pretty
good to get that profit.
Well, what's the point of all this? Well, we can leave behind the City Service story and I
would like you to again imagine yourself back on March 11th of 1942. And as I say things
were looking bad in the European theater as well as what was going on in the Pacific, but
everybody in this country knew America was going to win the war. I mean it was we've
gotten blindsided but we were going to win the war. And we knew that the American
system had been working well since 1776.
So, if you'll turn to the next slide, I'd like you to imagine that at that time you had invested
$10,000. And you put that money in an index fund, we didn't have index funds then, but
you in effect bought the S&P 500. Now, I would like you to think a while and do not change
the slide here for a minute. I'd like you to think about how much that $10,000 would now
be worth. If you just had one basic premise, just like in buying a farm, you buy it all
throughout your lifetime and you look to the output of the farm to determine whether
you've made a wise investment. You look to the output of the apartment house to decide
whether you made a wise investment if you buy an small apartment house the whole of
your life. And let's say instead you decided to put the $10,000 in and hold a piece of
American business and never look at another stock quote, never listen to another person
give you advice or anything of that sort. I want you to think how much money you might
have now.
And now that you've got a number in your head, let's go to the next slide and we'll get
the answer. You'd have $51 million and you wouldn't have had to do anything. You wouldn't
have to understand the accounting; you wouldn't have to look at your quotations every

Page 28 of 164

FINAL

day like I did that first day, I'd already lost $3.75 by the time I came home from school. All
you had to do was figure that America was going to do well over time that we would
overcome the current difficulties. And that if America did well, American business would
do well. You didn't have to pick out winning stocks. You didn't have to pick out a winning
time or anything of the sort. You basically just have to make one investment decision in
your life and that wasn't the only time to do it. I mean I could go back and pick other times
that would work out even greater gains.
But as you listen to the questions and answers we give today, just remember that the
overriding question is, how is American business going to do over your investing lifetime. I
would like to make one other comment because it's a little bit interesting. Let's say you've
taken that $10,000 and you'd listen to the prophets of doom and gloom around you and
you'll get that constantly throughout your life. And instead you use the $10,000 to buy
gold. Now, for your $10,000 you would have been able to buy about 300 ounces of gold.
And while the businesses were reinvesting in more plants and new inventions came along,
you would get down every year and you look in your safe deposit box and you'd have
your 300 ounces of gold. And you could look at it and you could fondle it and you could – I
mean whatever you wanted to do with it, but it didn't produce anything. It was never
going to produce anything.
And what would you have today. You would have 300 ounces of gold just like you had in
March of 1942. And it would be worth approximately $400,000. So if you decided to go
with a nonproductive asset, gold instead of a productive asset, which actually was earning
more money and reinvesting and paying dividends and maybe purchasing stock whatever
it might be, you would now have over 100 times the value of what you would have had
with a nonproductive asset. In other words for every dollar you have made in American
business, you'd have less than $0.01 by a gain by buying in the store value which people
tell you to run to every time you get scared by the headlines or something. So it's just
remarkable to me that we have operated in this country with the greatest tailwind at our
back. That you can imagine it's an Investor Day. I mean you can't really fail at it unless you
buy the wrong stock or just get excited at the wrong time. But if you're on the crosssection of America and you put at your money and consistently over the years, there's no
comparison against owning something that's going to produce nothing.
And frankly there's no comparison with trying to jump in and out of stocks and pay
investment advisor. If you'd followed my advice incidentally or this retrospective advice,
which is always so easy to give, if you follow that of course, there's one problem buddy,
your friendly stockbroker would have starved to death. I mean you could have gone to the
funeral to atone for their fate. But the truth is you would have been better off doing this
than a very, very, very high percentage of investment professionals have done or people
have done that are active that it's very hard to move around successfully and be really
what can be done with a very relaxed philosophy, and you do not have to be – you do not
have to know as much about accounting or stock market terminology or whatever else it
may be or what the Fed is going to do next time and whether it's going to raise rates 3
times or 4 times or 2 times. And none of that counts at all really in a lifetime of investing.
What counts is having a philosophy that you have that you stick with. Do you understand
what you're in and then you forget about doing things that you don't know how to do.

So, with all those happy words, we will move on and start the questioning and we'll start
with Carol.

FINAL

Q - Carol Loomis

{BIO 7137249 <GO>}

Good morning. In choosing a first question to ask each year, I look for a question that is
definitely Berkshire-related and is timely. And this question seemed to fill the bill. The
question came from William Anderson (58:13) of Salem, Oregon. And he said, Mr. Buffett,
you have previously said that there are two parts to your job, overseeing the managers
and capital allocation. Mr. Abel and Mr. Jain now oversee the managers, which leaves you
with capital allocation. However, you share capital allocation with Ted Weschler and Todd
Combs. Question, does all that mean you are semi-retired? Or if not, please explain?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I've been semi-retired for decades. The answer is that I was probably – well, it's hard to
break down the percentage of the time that I was involved in but now – the jobs that are
now done by Ajit and Greg, and in the case of investing, the sub part of the job that is
done by Ted and Todd. Ted and Todd each manage $12 billion or $13 billion. So in total,
that's 25 billion. And we have in equities $170-some billion, probably now, and $20 billion in
longer-term bonds, and another $100 billion in cash and short-term. So they're managing
$20 billion, $25 billion and doing a very good job. And I still have the responsibility,
basically, for the other $300 billion. So I think Charlie will tell you, in fact, I'd like him to
comment, nothing's really changed that much. Clearly, we've got two people in, Ajit and
Greg that are smarter, more energetic, just bring more to the job every day. But they
don't bring too much, because the culture is that our managers are running their business.
But there's a lot – there's a good bit to oversee. So they do a superb job.
And Ted and Todd not only do a great job with the $12 billion or $13 billion each, they
started with a couple billion each, not that it's all been the growth of the $2 billion. But
they also have done a number of things for Berkshire that they do it cheerfully, but more
important, very skillfully. So there's just – there's one thing after another that I will have
them looking into or working on. And sometimes I steal their ideas and – but I think,
actually, semi-retired is probably – catches me at my most active point. I think if – your
questioner's got a good point. Okay, Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, I've watched Warren for a long time, and he sits around reading most of the time
and thinking. And every once in a while he talks on the phone or talks to somebody. I can't
see any great difference. A lot of people – part of the Berkshire secret is that when
there's nothing to do, Warren is very good at doing nothing.

Hi Warren. Hi Charlie. Given the growth in airplane build rates, it seems surprising that
Precision Castparts isn't doing better on the top or bottom line. I understand the issue
with a bumpy transition from old to new programs, but I've also heard from industry
sources that Precision's market position is not as strong as it used to be amid intensifying
competition and some technological disruption. What does Precision need to do to
solidify and strengthen its preeminent position with its aerospace customers so that it can
deliver the growth you expected when Berkshire acquired it?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah...

Q - Jonathan Lawrence Brandt

{BIO 17988091 <GO>}

More generally, two years after the acquisition, what is your outlook for that business?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Give me the last part again. The outlook.

Q - Jonathan Lawrence Brandt

{BIO 17988091 <GO>}

More generally, two years after the acquisition, what is your updated outlook for that
business longer term?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Longer term, I think – and in the reasonably shorter term – it's a very good business. I
mean, you were – you mentioned aircraft, but we get into other industries. But certainly
aircraft's the most important. You have manufacturers that are very dependent on both
the quality of the parts and the promptness of delivery. You do not want to have an
aircraft worth $75 million or $100 million or maybe $200 million and be waiting for a part or
something of the sort. So it's – reliability is, both in terms of quality and delivery times and
all of that sort of thing, is enormously important. And we get contracts that extend out
many years. And sometimes we – I mean, we will get them well before the plane even
starts in production. So there's very long lead times and we have found in the last year –
found it earlier, but I know of some specific cases in the last year where other suppliers
have failed in their deliveries and then the manufacturers come to us and say, we would
like you to help us out. And we say, well, we'd be glad to help you out, but we'd like about
a five-year contract, if we're going to do it because we're just not going to make up for
these other guys' shortfalls periodically. But that sort of thing has a very long lead time.
The business is a very good business. One thing you will see their earnings charged with
is about $400 million – little over $400 million a year of intangible – nondeductible in that
case, amortization of goodwill, which is not an economic cost in my view. We have a
significant amount of that through Berkshire, but by far, the largest amount is related to
the Precision acquisition. So whatever you see, you can add about $400 million that in my
view is not an economic expense, but the accountants would argue otherwise. But it's our
money, so we'll take my view. Mark Donegan, who runs that operation, is incredible, and
he has been not only – he's a fabulous manager. I wouldn't have bought it without him in
Page 31 of 164



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2018-05-05

charge. He also has been very helpful to us in other areas, and he loves to do it. So you
can't beat him, both as a manager in his own operation, but with his devotion to really
doing everything that will help Berkshire. It's a very good acquisition with very long tails to
the products that are being developed. Charlie?

FINAL

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, yeah, I think we'd buy another one just like it tomorrow if we had the chance.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah, that's the answer. Man of few words, but he gets the point. Okay, now we will go to
the shareholder in Station 1. I believe that's probably up here to my right.

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Quick question. We know both you and China delegations – U.S. and China delegations
are in China for intense discussion, also called a Trade War. Let's go one step beyond the
Trade War. Do you think there's a win-win situation for both countries or the world is just
too small for both to win and we have to revisit your 1942 chart again? Thank you.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Thank you. I'd like to just mention one thing. In August, I'm going to be 88, and that will be
the eighth month of the year, and it's a year that ends with an eight. And as you and I both
know, eight is a very lucky number in China. So if you find anything over there for me, this
is the time we should be acquiring something all those eights.

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Will do. Will do.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

The United States and China are going to be the two superpowers of the world,
economically and in other ways, for a long, long, long time. We have a lot of common
interests, and like any two big economic entities, there are times when there'll be
tensions. But it is a win-win situation when the world trades, basically. And China and the
U.S. are the two big factors in that, but there's plenty of other citizens of the world that
are involved in how this comes out. And there is no question – and the nice thing about in
this country I think is that both Democrats and Republicans basically, on balance, believe in
Page 32 of 164

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

the benefits of free trade. And we will have disagreements with each other. We'll have
disagreements with other countries on trade. But it's just too big and too obvious that the
benefits are huge, and the world's dependent on it in a major way for its progress, that
two intelligent countries will do something extremely foolish.
We both may do things that are mildly foolish from time to time, and there is some give
and take, obviously, involved. But U.S. exports in 1970 and U.S. imports in 1970 were both
about 5% of GDP. I mean, we were, selling 5% of our GDP and buying a 5% of our GDP,
basically. Now people think we don't export a lot of things. Our exports are 11-and-afraction-percent of GDP. They've more than doubled as a share of this rising GDP. But the
imports are about 14.5%, so there's a gap of 3% or thereabouts. And I would not like that
gap to get too wide. But when you think about it, it's really not the worst thing in the world
to have somebody send you a lot of goods that you want and hand them little pieces of
paper. I mean, because the balancing item is, if you have a surplus or deficit in your trade,
you're going to have a surplus in investment. And so the world is getting more claim
checks on the United States, and to some extent they buy our government securities,
they can buy businesses. And over time, you don't want the gap to get to be too wide
because the amount of claim checks you are giving out to the rest of the world could get
a little unpleasant under some circumstances.
But we've done remarkably well with trade. China's done remarkably well with trade. The
countries of the world have done remarkably well with trade. So it is a win-win situation.
And the only problem gets to be when one side or the other may want to win a little bit
too much, and then you have a certain amount of tension. But we will not sacrifice – the
world, I mean – we will not sacrifice world prosperity based on differences that arise in
trade. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yeah, well I think that both countries have been advancing. And of course China is
advancing faster economically, because it started from a lower base and they've had a
little more virtue than practically anybody else in the world in having a high savings rate.
And of course, a country that was mired in poverty for a long, long time, and that
assimilates the advanced technology of the world, and has a big savings rate, is going to
advance faster than some very mature company like Britain or the United States. And
that's what's happened. But I think we're getting along fine, and I'm very optimistic that
both nations will be smart enough to realize that the last thing they should do is have any
ill will for the other.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Okay, Becky Quick.

Q - Becky Quick

{BIO 16400962 <GO>}

This question comes from Kirk Thompson. He says, Warren, in this year's annual letter to
shareholders, you referenced both cheap debt and a willingness by other companies to
leverage themselves as competitive examples as to why it's hard to get more acquisition
deals done. It seems like the trust and prestige of doing a deal with Warren Buffett and

FINAL

Charlie Munger allow Berkshire to get a hometown discount and beat out other firms that
might pay a little more to a prospective seller. Have you given thought to having other
Berkshire managers have more public exposure, so future generations of successful
business owners continue to bring deal opportunities to Berkshire like they have in prior
decades?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah, that sort of reminds me of – who was it? Tony O'Reilly remarked one time about the
responsibility of a CEO that the very first job of the CEO was to search through his
organization and find that person who had the initiative and the brains, the determination,
all of the qualities to be his logical successor, and then fire the guy. There's no question. I
think the reputation of Berkshire as being a very good home for companies, particularly
private companies, but a good home for companies, I don't think that reputation is
dependent on me or Charlie. It may take a little – there'll be a little testing period for
whoever takes over, in that respect. But basically we've got the money to do the deals.
We'll have the money to do the deals subsequently. People can see how our subsidiaries
operate in the future. And the truth is that, I think some of the other executives are
getting better known. But there will be a – I'll tell you this. If things get bad enough, you
don't have to worry, they'll be calling us no matter what. So I do not worry about the socalled deal flow, which is a term I hate. But I don't think there's – I think that's dependent
on Berkshire and not dependent on me.
And, as I've mentioned, my phone isn't ringing off the hook with good deals, so
apparently this big winning personality or something is not delivering for you. So it may be
the next person will be even more – get even more calls. Berkshire, the reputation
belongs to Berkshire now. And we are, for somebody that cares about a business that

You're getting your wish. And it is weird that about 99% of the public companies that
change hands, in terms of control, change hands in a sort of auction presided over by an
investment banker. And the people that buy are usually just leverage it to the gills, and
when it starts doing a little better, they re-leverage it. And that money is coming out of
the charitable endowments and pension plans who are making these highly-leveraged

Bloomberg Transcript

There was one fellow who came to me many years ago. And he had a wonderful business
and he had been worried because he had seen a friend of his dying. And the problems
that arose later when the managers, to some extent, tried to take advantage of the
widow. And it became a disaster. So he said he thought about it a lot the previous year.
And he decided he didn't want to sell the business to a competitor, who would be a
logical buyer, because they would fire all of his people. And the CFO that would remain
and all up and down the line they'd all be the acquirer's people. He didn't want to do that
to his people. And then he thought – and he didn't want to sell it to a private equity firm,
because he thought they'd leverage it up. He never liked to leverage that much, and then
they'd just resell it later on to somebody, so it would be totally out of control of what he
wanted to do. And he wanted to keep running it himself. So he said, Warren, he said, it
isn't that you're such a great guy, he says, it's you're the only one left. So Berkshire will
continue to be the only one left in many cases. Gary Ransom?

Q - Gary Kent Ransom

{BIO 3446828 <GO>}

Good morning. Warren, in your annual letter, you wrote about a potential for a $400 billion
natural catastrophe event, something out in the tail of the loss distribution. I can think of
another risk that could have a similar order of magnitude, and that would be cyber risk. I'm
sure all your managers have taken steps against that potential, but out in the tail of the
cyber risk distribution, it could hit a lot of industries, a lot of your companies. So how do
you think about and prepare for the big one in cyber?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, I include, incidentally, in my – that part I wrote in the Annual Report where I said
that roughly – nobody knows the answer on this. I mean, I could stick down 2%, and
somebody else much smarter in insurance would stick down a different figure. But I think
it's about a 2% risk of what I call a $400 billion super cap of all time. But cyber is in that
equation. I mean, that's not just earthquakes and that sort of thing. And frankly, I don't
think we or anybody else, really knows what they're doing when writing cyber. I mean, we
– it is just very, very, very early in the game. And we don't know what the interpretations of
the policies, necessarily, will be. We don't know the degree to which they'll be what –
there'll be correlated incidents, which we don't really think are correlated now or haven't
had the imagination to come up with. We know that every year when I go and hear these
people from the CIA or wherever it may be, they tell me that the offense is ahead of the
defense, and will continue that way. And I can dream of a lot of cyber incidents, which I'm
Page 35 of 164

FINAL

not going to spell out here, because people that have twisted minds may be – they've
probably got more – way more – ideas than I've got, but I don't believe in feeding them
any.
But it's a business where we don't – we have a pretty good idea of the probabilities of a
quake in California, or the probabilities of a three or a four hurricane hitting Florida, or
whatever it may be. We don't know what we're doing in cyber, and we try to keep – we
don't want to be a pioneer on this. We do some business in that arena in Berkshire
Hathaway Specialty. But if you're doing something for competitive reasons, which I'm okay
with, but when I'm doing something where I – that people tell me is a competitive
necessity, we are going to try not to have – we don't want to be number one or number
two or a number three in exposures on it. And I don't – and I am sure we are not in cyber.
But I think anybody that tells you now that they think they know in some actuarial way,
either what general experience is likely to be in the future, or what the worst case would
be I think is (01:22:46) themselves. And that's one of the reasons that I say that a $400
billion event has a – I think has roughly a 2% probability per year of happening.

Bloomberg Transcript

Cyber is uncharted territory and it's going to get worse, not better. And then the question
is whether, if we have a whole bunch of $25 billion commercial limits out there, whether
there's some aggregation that we didn't foresee or that the courts interpret those
policies differently, then they are generally going to give the benefit of the doubt to the
insured. So you're right in pointing that out as a very material risk, which didn't exist 10 or
15 years ago and will be much more intense as the years go along. And all I can tell you,
Gary, is that, that's part of my $400 billion and my 2%. But if you've got a different guess,
it's just likely that yours is right than mine on that. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yeah, well, something that's very much like cyber risk is, you've got computers
programmed to do your security trading and your computer goes a little wild from some
error. And that's already happened at least once where somebody just was fine one
morning and by the afternoon they were broke because some computer went crazy. We
don't have any computers we allot – we allow to go big automatically trading securities. I
think, generally, Berkshire is less likely than most other places to be careless in some
really stupid way.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

I do think if there's a mega cap from cyber, and let's say it hits $400 billion, I do not think
we'll have more than a 3%...

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

No, no, we'll get our share.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

But it will destroy – like what will destroy a lot of companies – we will actually, if we had a
$12 billion loss, I would think, except for the new accounting rule, but I believe from what I
call operating earnings, we would probably still have a reasonable profit that year.

Wally Obermeyer, Obermeyer Wood Investment Counsel, Aspen, Colorado. Warren and

That's too tough. Why don't we go on to a new question?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

I'm afraid I have nothing to add. I don't mean to be unfair to somebody asking a question,
but it is unfortunately an entirely different game. And the electorate – the motivations are
different, the terms, the reward system is different. I mean, everything is different. And if
we knew how to solve that, we can't add anything to what you had in your view. I'm sorry
on that. Okay, Andrew?

Q - Andrew Ross Sorkin

{BIO 6340618 <GO>}

Hi Warren. This question comes from Paul Spieker (01:27:18) of Chicago, Illinois. I believe
he may be here today. He writes, one of your more famous and perhaps most insightful
quotes goes as follows: Should you find yourself in a chronically leaking boat, energy
devoted to changing vessels is likely to be more productive than energy devoted to
patching leaks. In light of the unauthorized accounting scandal at Wells Fargo, of its
admission that it charged customers for duplicate auto insurance, of its admissions that it
wrongly fined mortgage holders in relations to missing deadlines caused by delays that
were its own fault, of its admission that it charged some customers improper fees to lock
in mortgage interest rates, of the sanction placed upon it by the Federal Reserve
prohibiting it from growing its balance sheet, and of the more than recent $1 billion
penalty leveled by federal regulators for the aforementioned misbehavior. If Wells Fargo
Company is a chronically leaking boat, at what magnitude of leakage would Berkshire
consider changing vessels?

FINAL

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah, well, Wells Fargo is a company that proved the efficacy of incentives, and it's just
that they had the wrong incentives. And that was bad. But then they committed a much
greater error, and I don't know exactly how or who did it or when, but ignoring the fact
that they had a faulty incentive system, which was incenting people to do things that were
kind of crazy, like opening nonexistent accounts, et cetera. And that is a cardinal sin at
Berkshire, we know people are doing something wrong, right as we sit here, at Berkshire.
You can't have 377,000 employees and expect that everyone is behaving like Ben Franklin
or something out there. I don't know whether there are 10 things being done wrong as we
speak, or 20, or 50. The important thing is we don't want to incent any of that if we can
avoid it, and if we find that – when we find it's going on, we have to do something about
it. And that is absolutely the key to it.

Bloomberg Transcript

And Wells Fargo didn't do it, but Salomon didn't do it. And the truth is we've made a
couple of our greatest investments where people have made similar errors. We bought
our American Express stock. That was the best investment I ever made in my partnership
years. We bought our American Express stock in 1964 because somebody was incented
to do the wrong thing in something called the American Express Field Warehousing
Company. We bought – a very substantial amount of GEICO we bought, but became a
half of GEICO for $40 million because somebody was incented to meet Wall Street
estimates of earnings and growth. And they didn't focus on having the proper reserves.
And that caused a lot of pain at American Express in 1964. It caused a lot of pain at GEICO
in 1976. It caused a layoff of a significant portion of the workforce, all kinds of things. But
they cleaned it up. They cleaned it up, and look where American Express has moved since
that time. Look at where GEICO has moved since that time.
So the fact that you are going to have problems at some very large institutions is not
unique. In fact, almost every bank has – all the big banks have had troubles of one sort or
another. And I see no reason why Wells Fargo as a company, from both an investment
standpoint and a moral standpoint going forward, is in any way inferior to the other big
banks with which it competes of it, they made a big mistake. It cost – I mean, we still got – I
mean we have a large, unrealized gain in it, but that doesn't have anything to do with our
decision-making. But I like it as an investment. I like Tim Sloan as a manager, and he is
correcting mistakes made by other people. I tried to correct mistakes at Salomon, and I
had terrific help from Deryck Maughan as well as a number of the people at Munger,
Tolles. And I mean that is going to happen. You try to minimize it.
Charlie says that, an ounce of prevention isn't worth a pound of cure, it's worth about a
ton of cure. And we ought to jump on everything. He's pushed me all my life to make sure
that I attack unpleasant problems that surface. And that's sometimes not easy to do when
everything else is going fine. And at Wells, they clearly – and I don't know exactly what –
but they did what people at every organization have sometimes done, but it got
accentuated to an extreme point. But I see no reason to think that Wells Fargo, going
forward, is other than a very, very large, well-run bank that had an episode in its history it
wished it didn't have. But GEICO came out stronger, American Express came out stronger.
But the question is what you do when you find the problems, Charlie?

the best in the future, it might be Wells Fargo, of all of them.

This New York Times that I have here from March 12th, 1942, if you go toward the back of
it, in the classified section, you have one big section that says, help wanted male, and
another one that says, help wanted female. Was the New York Times doing the right thing
in those days? I think the New York Times is a terrific paper. But people make mistakes.
And the idea of classifying between – taking ads and saying, well, we'll take them and
divide them up between men and women, what jobs we think are appropriate or that the
advertiser thinks is appropriate. We do a lot of dumb things in this world. And GEICO, as I
say, in the early 1970s, they just ignored – and you can do it in the setting of proper
reserves, which mean they charged the wrong price to new customers because they
thought their losses were less than they were.
And I'm sure some of that may have been a desire to please Wall Street or just because
they didn't want to face how things were going, but it came out incredibly stronger. And
now it's got 13% of the households in the United States insured. And it came out with an
attention to reserves and that sort of thing but that was heightened by the difficulties that
they'd found themselves in where they almost went bankrupt.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

It was a lot more stupid than Wells Fargo. It was really stupid what they did way back,
right?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. They had the world by the tail, and then they quit looking at the reserve
development. And American Express was just picking up a few dollars by having the Field
Warehousing Company in 1963. And they were worried whether it was going to sink the
company. And when some guy named Tino De Angelis in, I think it was Bayonne, New
Jersey – in fact, I went to the Annual Meeting in 1964 of American Express after the
scandal developed, and somebody asked if the auditor would step forward. And the
auditor from one of the big firms, which I won't mention, came up to the microphone, and
somebody said, how much did we pay you last year? The auditor gave his answer, and
then the questioner said, well, how much extra would you have charged us to go over to

Bayonne, which was 10 miles away, and check whether there's any oil in the tanks? So,
here was something a tiny little operation, some guy was calling him from a bar in
Bayonne and telling him this phony stuff was going on, and they didn't want to hear it.
They shut their ears to it. And then what emerged was one great company after this kind
of, what they thought was a near-death experience.
So we're going to make mistakes. I will guarantee you that we will get some unpleasant
news at Berkshire. I don't know what it'll be – the most important thing is we do something
about it. And there have been times when I procrastinated, and Charlie has been the one
that jabs me into action. And so he's performed a lot of services you don't know about.
Okay. Gregg, Gregg Warren.

Q - Greggory Warren

{BIO 15185326 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning, Warren. I have a little bit of a follow-up on Becky's question. At the 2014
Annual Meeting, as well as this morning, you noted that the power of Berkshire brand and
its reputation, as well as the strength of Berkshire's balance sheet, would allow the
company's next managers to replicate many of the advantages that have come with your
being the face of the organization, one of which has been an ability to extract high rents
from firms in exchange for a capital infusion and the Buffett seal of approval during times
of financial distress.
I buy the argument about the strength of the balance sheet and believe that deals will
continue to be done with sellers still lining up to become part of the Berkshire family,
especially if the company's next managers are allowed to keep a ton of cash on hand. But
I'm not entirely convinced that they'll be able to garner the same 8%, 9%, 10% coupons,
as well as other add-ons, that you've been able to extract from firms like Goldman Sachs
and Bank of America in times of distress. I'd expect those rents to be at least a few
percentage points lower once you're no longer running the show. That is, until those
managers build up a reputation to warrant higher returns. Am I right to think about it that
way?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

I'm not sure. When we, in – you mentioned Goldman Sachs, and we also did with General
Electric, in September or early October of 2008. We probably could have actually
extracted better terms. I think it might have been counterproductive in the end, but I was –
we would have done better, incidentally, financially, if we'd really waited till the panic
developed further, because I didn't know how far it would develop, but we could have
made a lot better purchases three or four or five months later than we did at that time.
And we also did not want to do something that looked to be so high as to and make the
transaction disadvantageous to Goldman or to GE. They were going to take the terms we
offered, but we actually didn't push it to the limit, because there really wasn't anybody
else around. And we're working on something right now that probably won't happen. It's
not huge. But actually, in this case, both Todd and Ted have brought deals to me. One of
them brought something to me. And he was thinking – and the same terms that I got and

Page 40 of 164

FINAL

was thinking about. And he's the one that returned the call that he had received about a
transaction. And I do not think the party on the other side is going to care about the fact
that they had him on the phone rather than in the end of the line. There may – there could
be just a little bit of certain times in history. But we will continue to have our standards of
what we think money is worth at any given time. And Ted and Todd think this is well above
that, as I do. And there will be times very occasionally when our phone will ring a lot. And I
don't think they'll hang up because I don't answer. They need the money. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, the times he's referring to, a lot of them were like worse than 50 years. So, that's a
really rare kind of an occurrence. And we didn't make all that many deals. So, I think he's
right. It will be harder for us to make some more deals in the future.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. The problem is the sums involved now more than the problem of deciding what the
proper term should be. And sometimes, we can get what we think is appropriate.
Sometimes we – most of the time today, we can't. But you may see a transaction or two
that not in terms of buying business, but in terms of securities that strike you as perfectly
decent wage to invest Berkshire's money and they may well come through Todd or Ted,
instead of directly to me. I like to think I'll be missed a little bit, but I – you won't notice it.
Okay. Station three.

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

I'm John Lichter (01:42:33) from Boulder, Colorado. Mr. Buffett, are you still involved in
pricing decisions at See's Candies and The Buffalo News? And what other Berkshire
subsidiaries do you take more than a hands-off approach?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. You're correct that at one time, I – and for some quite a while, both Charlie and I
took part in the pricing decisions at See's Candy (sic) [See's Candies] (01:43:12). And
certainly, for some years, [indiscernible] (01:43:19) the question, the survival of The Buffalo
News was really in question. I definitely took part in those decisions. In both cases, we had
good managers, but we still wanted to – we thought those decisions were important. But
it's been a long, long time, very long time since we've participated in anything like that.
And I can't tell you what the per pound price is for See's Candy (sic) [See's Candies]
(01:43:56), which is because people, and you're invited to join this group, send me free
candy from time-to-time, and I can't – really, I can't tell you the prices at The Buffalo News.
I mean, all I know is it's very, very, very hard to move up prices on advertising generally. So,
now, we – the only thing, as Ajit and I talk frequently, and if there's some very big risk, and
somebody wants a $5 billion cover on a chemical plant, some way, excess loss of over $3
billion [indiscernible] (01:44:38) we have a certain amount of fund with him deciding on
the price in his head, and I decide in my head and then we compare notes.
That's the kind of risk that you really can't look up in a book and see actuarially what is
fairly the parameters are fairly likely to be. I enjoy thinking through the pricing of that, and I
Page 41 of 164

particularly enjoy comparing it with Ajit. So, these are just the oddball situations. But we do
that sort of thing, and we've done it for three decades. And it's part of the – it's part of

The CEO of one of our most successful subsidiaries, I may have talked to him as I saw him
here to say hello. I probably talked to him three times in the last 10 years. And he does
remarkably well. He might have done even better, if I hadn't talked to him those three
times.
And on the other hand, Ajit, I talk very, very frequently. And he's got the kind of business –
hey, I know more about the insurance business, I know about the (01:46:45) business. And
it's interesting and we are evaluating things that you don't look up in a book. I mean that
actuarial talent is not what's important in the things that Ajit talks to me about. It's
probably important throughout our insurance operation, but in these particular cases,
we're making judgments and his judgment is better than mine, but I just like to hear about
them. They are interesting propositions. Okay. Carol?

Q - Carol Loomis

{BIO 7137249 <GO>}

This question comes from a Berkshire shareholder named Jack Ciesielski. He's a wellknown accounting expert, who for many years has written the Accounting Observer. Mr.
Buffett, in this year's shareholders' letter, you have harsh words for the new accounting
rule that requires companies to use market value accounting for their investment holdings.
For analytical purposes, you said, Berkshire's bottom line will be useless. I'd like to argue
with you about that.
Shouldn't a company's earnings report say everything that happened to and within a
company during an accounting period? Shouldn't the income statement be like an
objectively written newspaper informing shareholders of what happened under the
management for that period, showing what management did to increase shareholder
value and how outside forces may have affected the firm? If securities increased in value,
surely the company and the shareholders are better off. And surely they're worse off, if
Page 42 of 164



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2018-05-05

securities decreased in value. Those changes are most certainly real. In my opinion,
ignoring changes in the way that some companies ignore restructuring costs is censoring
the shareholders' newspaper. So, my question is how would you answer what I say?

FINAL

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, my answer to the question asked – what my answer would be to what he said. I
would ask Jack if we've got $170 billion of partly-owned companies, which we intend to
own for decades, and which we expect to become worth more money over time, and
where we reflect the market value in our balance sheet, does it make sense to every
quarter mark goes up and down through the income account, when at the same time, we
own businesses that have become worth far more money in most cases, and become –
since we bought – you name the company – take GEICO, an extreme case. We bought
half the company for $50 million roughly. Do we want to be marking that up every quarter
to the value, and having it run through the income account? That becomes an appraisal
process. There's nothing wrong with doing that in terms of the valuation. But in terms of
value, and you can call it gain and net asset value, or loss and net asset value. That's what
a closed-end investment fund or an open investment fund would do.

Bloomberg Transcript

But to run that through an income account, if I looked at our 60 or 70 businesses or
whatever number there might be, and every quarter we mark those to market, we would
have, obviously, a great many in certain cases where, over time, we'd have them at 10
times what we paid. But how quarter-by-quarter we should mark those up and run it
through the income account where 99% of investors probably look at net income as being
meaningful in terms of what has been produced from operations, during the year, I think
would be – well, I can say, it would be enormously deceptive.
I mean, in the first quarter of this year, you saw the figures earlier, where we had the best
op, what I would call operating earnings, in our history. And our securities were down $6
billion or whatever it was. To keep running that through the income account every day, you
would say that we might have made on Friday, we probably made $2.5 billion as well. If
you have investors and commentators and analysts and everybody else working off those
net income numbers and trying to project earnings for quarters and earnings for future
years to the penny, I think you're doing a great disservice by running those through the
income account.
I think it's fine to have marketable securities on the balance sheet. The information
available as to their market value, but we have businesses there. If we were – we never
would do it – but if we were to sell half, we'll say, of the BNSF railroad, we would receive
more than we carry – we could turn it into a marketable security, and it would look like we
made a ton of money overnight. Or if we were to appraise it every three months and
write it up and down, A, it could lead to all kinds of manipulation; but, B, it would just lead
to the average to any investor being totally confused.
I don't want to receive that in that manner and, therefore, I don't want to send it out in
that manner. Charlie?

Well, to me, it's obvious that the change in valuation should be noted and that is and
always has been goes right into the net worth figures. So, the questioner doesn't

McLane's core operating margins have dropped about 50% from where they've generally
been since acquisition. Could you elaborate on the competitive pressures in the grocery
and convenience store distribution business that have caused the deterioration in profits?
And do you expect the margin structure of that business to eventually get back to where
it was or is this the new normal?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, I don't know the answer to the second part about the future, but there's no question
that the margins have been squeezed. They were very, very narrow. As you know, they
were about $0.01 on the $1 pre-tax and they have been squeezed from that. Payment
terms get squeezed. And in some cases, we have fairly long-term contracts on that. So,
we go on for five years at one. And then, it's a very, very tight margin business. And the
situation is even worse than you portray because within McLane, we have a liquor
distribution business in a few states. And that business has actually increased its earnings
moderately and we've added to that business.
So, within McLane's figures, there's about $70 million or so pre-tax from the liquor part
that have nothing to do with the massive part you're talking about in terms of food
distribution. So, it's even – the decline is even greater in what you're referring to than
you've noticed in. That's just become very much more competitive. Then, we have to
decide. If you look at our competitors, they're not making much money either. And that's
capitalism. I think there comes a point where the customer says, I'll only pay X and you
have to walk away. And there's a great temptation when you're employing, particularly
employing thousands of people and you build distribution facilities and all of that sort of
they can take care of them to meet, what you'd like to term, as irrational competition. But
that that is capitalism and you're right.
We took – the earnings went up quite a bit from the time we bought it. And we're still
earning more than that. And we've earned a lot of money over time. But as I say, a fair
amount of that is actually coming from liquor distribution activities in about four states that
we purchased very well run. And we will do our best to get the margins up. But I would not
– I could not tell you or give you a really – your guess is almost as good as mine or better
than mine maybe as to what margins will be in that distribution business five years.

Good morning, Charlie and Warren. I know it seems a little bit out of order, but I'm a huge
fan of yours, Charlie, mostly for your 25 Cognitive Biases. From Seattle, Washington, I run
a one-person digital marketing firm that specializes in Facebook ads and e-mail marketing.
I use these a lot. Your breakdown of Coca-Cola was really, really solid. And I use that as a
reference, when looking to how to understand the mechanics of my clients' products and
how to promote them. So, I'm fairly certain that your Cognitive Biases work for Internetrelated companies.
Now that, you're partnering with Amazon on health care, I'm curious, have you started to
understand how to apply these biases to Internet-related companies? Or is there another
set of tools you used to decide if you understand the business? Because you guys talk a
lot about not investing in businesses that you don't understand.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, health care is – we don't plan to start health care companies or necessarily, insurers
or anything. We simply have three organizations with leaders that I admire and trust. And
we – mutually goes around all three, and we hope to do something which Charlie correctly
would probably say is almost impossible to change in some way a system which is – who's
taking 5% of GDP in 1960, and now taking close to 18%. And we have a hugely
noncompetitive medical cost in American business relating to any country in the world.
The countries that – there were some countries that were around our 5%, when we were
at 5%, but we managed to get to 18% without them going beyond 11% or so. Literally, in
1960, we were spending $170 per capita on medical costs in the United States, and now
we're spending over $10,000. And every dollar only has 100 cents. So, there is a cost
problem. It is a tapeworm in terms of American business and its competitiveness.
We don't – we have fewer doctors per capita, we have fewer hospital beds per capita,
fewer nurses per capita than some of the other countries that are well below us, and
you've got a system that is delivering $3.3 trillion. That's almost as much as the federal
government raises. It's delivering $3.3 trillion or some number like that to millions and

FINAL

millions and millions of people who are involved in the system, and every dollar has a
constituency just like politics.
And whether we can find the Chief Executive which we're working on now, and which I
would expect we would be able to announce before too long, but that's a key part of it,
and whether that person will have the imagination and support of people that will enable
us to make any kinds of significant improvements in the system, which everybody agrees
that sort of out of control on costs, but they all think it's the other guy's fault, generally.
We'll find out. It won't be easy, but it is not a – the motivations are not primarily profitmaking. They're – we want to deliver – we want our employees to get better medical
service at a lower cost. We're not going to – we certainly not going to come up with
something where we think the service that they receive is inferior to what they're getting
now. But we do think that there may be ways to make a real significant changes that could
have an effect, then we know that the businesses will unbelievable.
And if we fail, we've at least tried. But the idea is not that I will be able to contribute
anything at some breakthrough moment by reading a few medical journals or something,
changing something that is embedded with the medical system, but the idea is maybe
the three organizations which employ over a million people and which, after we
announced, we had a flood of calls from people who want to join in, but there isn't
anything to join into now, but they will, if we have come up with any ideas that are useful.
Whether we can bring the resources, bring the person and the CEO is terribly important.
And then, bring the person, support that person and somehow figure out a better way for
people to continue to receive better medical care in the United States, without that, 18%
going to 20% or 22% in the lifetime of our children or something of sort. There are only
100 cents in the dollar. And we will see what happens.
But if you were Ajit, actuarially figuring, it would not – you would not bet on us, but I think
there is some chance we will do something. There is a chance that nobody can quantify
that we could do something significant. And we are positioned better than most people
to try. And we've certainly got the right partners. So, we will give it a shot, and see what
happens. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

There is some precedent for success in this public service activity. If you go back many
decades. John D. Rockefeller I, using his own money, made an enormous improvement in
American medical care, perfectly enormous, like there's never been any similar
improvement done by any one man since that (02:03:52). So, Warren having imitated
Rockefeller in one way, he's just trying another and maybe it'll work.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Rockefeller, incidentally, lived a very long time. So, I actually am trying to imitate him in
three ways. We'll see what happens, but we are – we're making a lot of progress. And I
think we'll probably have a CEO within a couple of months but if we don't have one, we're
not going to pick somebody just because we want to beat any deadline or anything like
that. We've got these wonderful partners. We don't have a partnership agreement among
us. Somebody started drawing up one in the legal department and the CEO just put a

stop to it. They do have places that have a lot of resources. And while we all have our
share of bureaucracy, we can cut through it if we've got something that we really think
makes sense.

FINAL

And we will get the support. We get a lot of resistance too, but we will get the support of
a lot of American business, if we come up with something that makes sense. But if it was

This question comes from David Rolfe, who is with Wedgewood Partners and has been –
the company has been shareholders in Berkshire since 1989. The stock is currently the
largest holding in their stocks, 18 stocks. He asks this question. Over the past two years,
you have listed the individual fund to fund's performance from Protégé Partners. When will
you start showing the annual performance on $25 billion that Ted and Todd manage? Can
you state if either Ted or Todd is beating the S&P 500 Index over the last five years?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Both, A, we'll probably never report their individual performance. But you can be
sure that I have an enormous interest in, as does Charlie, in how much we think they
contribute to Berkshire, and they have – they've been terrific. They know we have the
intellect and the record. But they are exceptional human beings and they – Todd has done
a tremendous amount of work, for example, on the medical project. And Ted has – I've
given him several things and he's done them better than I can do them.
So, the record since inception and I'm measuring it – Ted came later than Todd, a year or
so later. But the record since inception is almost identical. Both for the two managers,
from their different (02:06:49) and matching the S&P. And they've received some
incentive compensation, which they only get if they beat the S&P. And as I said, they're just
slightly ahead. That really hasn't – it's been better than I've done. So naturally, I can't
criticize it. They were two very, very, very good choices.

My question is on GEICO. Last year, you promised growth and delivered. But along the
way, the combined ratio was moving up and it was the first time it was over 100% in about
15 years, granted some of that was catastrophes. But even excluding catastrophes, there
was something going on in the loss trends that caused you to slow down that growth, at
least (02:08:37) to the latter part of the year. And I wondered if you could tell us what was
going on? And I did look this morning too, so it looked like the first quarter settled down a
little bit, but I still like to know about the fourth quarter?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah, sure. The only thing I differ with the question, when you say it caused us to
slowdown. We didn't want to slow down the growth. I mean, you're looking at a guy here
that has never wanted to slow down the growth at GEICO. The growth did slow down, but
it wasn't because we wanted to. Our prices that led to the underwriting loss, the action
would have been slightly in the blank without the catastrophes. But we haven't have paid
our light bills, we might have been in the black too. I mean, there's except for stuff
doesn't mean much in insurance, as far as I'm concerned.
If you look at the first quarter, our margins were around 7%, which is actually a little more
than we aim for. And that we see the unaudited – I mean the preliminary figures for April
and they're similar. So, the underwriting gain is or margins are perfectly satisfactory now.
And we'd love to get all the growth we can and we will gain market share this year, and
we gain market share.
When Tony took over the place, it was in 1993. It was two and a very small fraction percent
and that'll be 13% of the households in the country now. We will keep gaining share. We

will keep writing profitably most of the time. And every now and then, our rates will be in
that slightly modestly inaccurate – inadequate, I should say, and/or will have maybe some
big losses on hurricanes or something that sort or we'll have a Sandy in New York.
Look, GEICO was a jewel, and it's really – we got some other, we feel, awfully close to
similarly about, but it's an incredible company. That has a culture of all of its own. It's
saving its customers probably $4 billion or $5 billion a year against we'd say with other –
against what they would otherwise be paying based on the average in auto insurance.
And it will be profitable on underwriting a very high percentage as the year. It contributed
another $2 billion to float last year. It is a terrific company. And like I say, the first four
months are dramatically better.
Now, there's some seasonal in auto insurance. So, the first quarter is usually the best of
the four quarters, but it's not a dramatic seasonal. I think when you read the 10-Q, and you
can take my word for April, I think GEICO was on a good profit track as well as a good
growth track. And the more it grows, the better I like it. Charlie?

Good morning, Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger. My name is Ethan Raposo (02:12:37),
I'm from Omaha, Nebraska. My question is how would Donald Trump's tariffs affect the
manufacturing business of Berkshire Hathaway?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, today, steel costs – so, we've seen this – we've seen steel costs increase somewhat.
But as I said earlier, I don't think the United States or China – there'll be some jockeying
back and forth, and there'll be something that leaves some people unhappy and – but I
don't think either country will dig themselves into something that precipitates, and
continues any kind of real trade war in this country. We've had that in the past a few times,
and I think we've learned a general lesson on it. But there will some things about our trade
policies that irritate others and there'll be some from others that irritate us, and there'll
probably some back and forth. But in the end, I don't think we'll come up with a terrible
answer on it.
Charlie, I'll let you...

A - Charles Thomas Munger

The thing about trade, I've always said that the President, whether it's President – any
President needs to be an educator-in-chief, which Roosevelt was in the Depression. That's
why he had those fireside chats, and it was very important that he communicated to the
people what needed to be done and what was happening around them. And trade is
particularly difficult, because the benefits of trade are basically not visible. You don't know
what you would be paying for the clothes you're wearing today, if we'd had a rule they all
had to be manufactured in the United States or it'd be paying for your television set or
whatever, maybe. No one thinks about benefits day-by-day as they walk around buying
things and carrying on their own business.

Bloomberg Transcript

The negatives, and there are negatives, are very apparent and very painful. And if you're
laid off, like happened in our shoe business in Maine, and you know you have been a very,
very, very good worker. You are proud of what you did, and maybe your parents did it
before you. And all of a sudden you find out that American shoes, shoes manufactured in
America, are not competitive with shoes made outside the United States. You can talk all
you want about Adam Smith and David Ricardo or something and explain the benefits of
free trade and comparative advantage and all that sort of thing. And that doesn't make
any difference. And if you are 55 or 60 years old to talk about retraining or something like
that, so what? So I – it is tough in politics where you have a hidden benefit and a very, very
visible cost to a certain percentage of your constituency, and you need to do two things
under those circumstances.
If you have that situation, you know what's good for the country. So, you have to be very
good at explaining how it does really hurt in a real way somebody that works in the textile
mill like we had in New Bedford where he only spoke Portuguese, half of our workers only
spoke Portuguese, and suddenly they had no job and they've been doing their job well for
years. You've got to do two things. You have to understand that that's the price individuals
pay for what's good for what – for the collective good. And secondly, you got to take care
of the people that are – that – where retraining is a joke, because of their age or whatever
it may be. And you've got to take care of the people that become the road kill in
something that is collectively good for us as a country.
And that takes society acting through its representatives to develop the policies that will
get us the right collective result and not kill too many people economically in the process.
And we've done that in various arenas over the years. The people in their productive
years do help take care of the people that are too old and too young. And every time a
baby is born in the United States, we take on an obligation of educating them for 12 years.
It will cost $150,000 now.
We have a system that has a bond between the people in their productive years and the
ones in the young and old, and it gets better over time far from perfect now. But again, it
has gotten better over time and I believe that trade properly explained and with policies
that take good care of the people who are road kill is good for our country and can be
explained. But I think it's been a tough sell to a guy that made shoes in Dexter, Maine or
worked on a loom in New Bedford, Mass or works with the steel mill in Youngstown, Ohio.

But I did. The shareholder rights, I have watched the movie every year at this meeting.
When you testify in front of Congress on behalf of Salomon, it's the symbol of what it
means to have a moral compass. Investors are increasingly looking to invest in companies
that are socially and morally responsible. So, I was disturbed when you were asked on
CNBC about the role that business could play in sensible policies around sales of guns.
You said you didn't think business should have a role at all, and you wouldn't impose your
values on others. I was even more surprised when you said you'd be okay with Berkshire
owning shares in gun manufacturers. At this meeting years ago, you said you wouldn't buy
tobacco company because of the social issues. The idea that Berkshire would associate
with any company as long as it isn't illegal seems at odds with everything I think you stand
for. Please tell us you misspoke.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, let's explore that a little. Should it be just my view or should it be the view of the
owners of the company? So, if I decide to pull the owners of the company on a variety of
political issues and one of them being whether Berkshire Hathaway should support the
NRA, I don't – if a majority of the shareholders voted to do it or the majority of the Board
of Directors voted to do it, I would accept that. I don't think that my political views – I don't
think I put them in a blind trust at all when I take the job. In the elections of 2016, I raised a
lot of money. In my case, I raised it for Hillary.
And I spoke out in various ways that were quite frank. But I don't think that I speak – when I
do that, I don't think I'm speaking for Berkshire. I'm speaking as a private citizen. And I
don't think I have any business speaking for Berkshire. We've never, at the parent
company level, we've never made a political contribution. I may go out – and I don't go to
our suppliers. I don't do anything of that sort where I raise money either for the school I
went to or for a political candidate I want or anything else.
And I don't think that we should have a question on the GEICO policyholder forum. Are
you an NRA member? And if you are you just aren't good enough for us or something
that. I think I do not believe in imposing my political opinions on the activities of our
businesses. And if you get to what companies are pure and which ones aren't pure, I think
it's very difficult to make that call. I think with that response, I'm almost afraid to call on
Charlie, but go ahead, Charlie.

Okay. Gregg?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Greggory Warren

{BIO 15185326 <GO>}

Warren, this question is also based on something you said more recently. So, I can't
guarantee it's going to be any easier. You recently noted that the preferred share
repurchases over dividends as a means for returning capital to shareholders. Should
Berkshire's cash balances continue to rise and hit the $150 billion threshold, you noted it's
been difficult to defend the shareholders at last year's annual meeting. While I understand
the rationale for not establishing a regular dividend, a onetime special dividend could be a
useful option for returning a larger chunk of Berkshire's excess capital to shareholders
without the implied promise to keep paying a regular dividend forever.
The drawback with the special dividend though is that it would lead to an immediate
decline in book value and book value per share, whereas a larger share repurchase effort,
while depressing book value, would reduce purchase share count, limiting the impact on
book value per share.
If we do happen to get a few years out and Berkshire does hit that $150 billion threshold,
because valuations continue to be too high, both for acquisitions and for the repurchase
of company stock, would you consider a one-time special dividend as a means of
returning capital to shareholders?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, if we thought we couldn't use capital effectively, we would try to figure out the most
effective way of returning capital to shareholders. And you could – I would have probably –

FINAL

I think it would be unlikely we do that via a special dividend. I think it would be more likely
we do it via repurchase if the repurchase didn't result in us paying a price above intrinsic
value per share.
We're never going to do anything that we think is harmful to continuing shareholders. So,
we think the stock is intrinsically worth X, and we would have to pay some multiple – some
modest multiple, even above that, to repurchase shares. We wouldn't do it because we'll
be hurting continuing shareholders to the benefit of the people who are getting out.
But we will try and do whatever makes the most sense, but not with the idea that we have
to do something every day, because we simply can't find something that – we had a vote,
as you know, a few years back on whether people wanted the dividend. And the B shares
– so I'm not talking my shares or Charlie's earning, the B shares voted 47 to 1 against it.
So, I think through self-selection of who become shareholders, I don't think shareholder's
world – or countrywide on all stocks would go for this having to want it all. But we could sell
selection in terms of who joins us. And I think they expect us to do whatever we think
makes the sense for all shareholders. And obviously, if we really thought we never could
use the money effectively in the business, we should get it out one way or another. And
you've got a bunch of directors who own significant – very significant amounts of stock
themselves.
And you can expect them to think like owners. That's the reason they're on the board and
expect the management to think like owners, and owners will return money to all of the
owners, if they think it makes more sense than continuing to look for things to do. But we
invested in the first quarter maybe – I have to look it up on the – well, certainly through
April, probably close to $15 billion or something like that net or something. And we won't
always be in a world of very low interest rates nor high (02:27:07) or high private market
prices.
So, we will do on what makes the most sense, but I can't see us ever making a special, or
it's very unlikely we will just pay out a big special event. I think that if we put that the world
of the shareholders and Charlie and I did not vote, I think we would get a big negative
vote and I'll be willing to – I'll be willing to make a bet on that one. Charlie?

As long as the existing system continues to work as well as it has, why would we change
it? We've got a whole lot of people that are accustomed to and have done well into it.
And if conditions change, we're capable of changing our minds, if the facts change.

Q - Stephie Yu

{BIO 15204874 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger. My name is Stephie Yu from Horizon
Insights, a China-focused research firm based in Shanghai. So, I have a lot of mutual fund
clients in China who are very young, relatively younger, and they manage a smaller portion
of funds. So, my question is, if you only have $1 billion in your portfolio today, how would
you change your investments? Would you consider more investment opportunities in
emerging markets such as China? Thank you.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. I would say if I were working with $1 billion, I would probably find within a $30 trillion
market in the United States, where I understood things better generally than I do around
the world. I'd probably find opportunities there that would be better incidentally by some
margin than what we can find for hundreds of billions. But I wouldn't – there's no way I'd
rule out emerging markets. There was a time, 15 years ago or so, when just because it
was kind of interesting. It took me back to my youth.
On the weekend, I went through a directory of Korean stocks, and I bought individual
small stocks, (02:29:43) standards of either a Korean or American business. They were
big companies. But I found 15 or 20 and they were statistically cheap and bought some of
each one myself. And there are opportunities with smaller amounts of money to do things
that we just can't do. And – but I – my first inclination always would be to comb through
things in the United States. And – but I've combed through – in other countries. I probably
wouldn't get into very, very small markets because there can be a lot of difficulties even in
market execution and taxation, (02:30:36). You can find – if you can't find it in America and
China, Britain and few other places, you probably aren't going to find it someplace else.
You may think you've found it, but that may be – it may be a different game than you
know. Our problem is size, not geography. Charlie?

of line and all of that 30 years ago. And people notice after a while and it disappears. But
there can be – some very strange things happen in markets as they develop. I think you'd

This question, and I would concede it is not a small one, comes from Gideon Pollack of

Hathaway have changed since you began to run the company in 1965. Berkshire was then
a tiny northeastern textile company. And now it is the number-four company on the
Fortune 500. What about the next 50 years? Could you give us your view of what
Berkshire looks like in 2068?

I think it'll look a long way away. No, the answer is, I don't know. And I didn't know, 50
years ago, what it would like now, I mean, It will be based on certain principles. But where
that leads, we will find out and we'll have people that are thinking about different things
than I am. And we'll have a world that's different. But we will be – I very much hope and
believe that we will be – that we'll be as shareholder-oriented as any large company in the
world. We will look at our shareholders as partners and we will be trying to do with their
money exactly what we'd do with our own, not seeking to get an edge on them. And who

Duracell's $82 million of pre-tax profits in 2017 were still well below what it earned as a
subsidiary of P&G. Can you clarify or quantify to what extent transition costs or purchase
price accounting impacts at the segment level were still temporarily burdened last year?
Or is it possible that the gap in earnings contribution simply reflects a commoditization of
the category given the entry of Amazon into the battery market?
I did see that Duracell's earnings were up in the first quarter. Is that a sign of a more
meaningful contribution in 2018 and beyond, as you finish right-sizing the manufacturing
footprint and acquisition-related charges fall away?

FINAL

Yeah. Duracell should be earning more money than it is now, and will be. And as you
mentioned, it's well on its way there. But it is not earning an appropriate amount now,
based on the history of the company.
I was around when – I was on the board of Gillette when Gillette bought Duracell. And I've
seen what it does when it is managed to its full extent. And I saw what Jim Kilts did with it
at Gillette when he ran it. And there were a lot more transition problems in the purchase.
For one thing, there's a lot of rules connected with our swap of our stock in P&G for
Duracell. There are a lot of things which you cannot do that made sense to do in that
period of transition from P&G's management to ours.
But Duracell – the brand is strong, very strong. The product line is very strong, and we are
making more money, and we should, and I believe we will earn really what the property is
capable of earning. We should be earning that relatively soon.
But you're absolutely right that it is – from a profit standpoint, is underperforming. We're
making a lot of changes. And some of those are involved in jurisdictions, countries, where
it is really expensive to change in terms of employment, payments that have to be made
if a plant is changed or something of the sort. But I like the Duracell deal absolutely as well
as when we made it. Charlie?

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Good morning. And I have a question related to the bond market, U.S. Treasury bond
market. And my name is Ola Larsson (02:38:09). I live in the San Francisco Bay Area. And I
never worked in the financial industry. I started out buying penny mining stocks on the
Vancouver Stock Exchange. And then, decades later, I got married. And my wife convinced
me to buy Berkshire shares. That was probably a good decision.
So, my question is, I read the newspapers about the Federal Reserve and the inflation
numbers. And there must be an increase supply of Treasury bonds that must go to
auction. And my question is, how would – what do you expect that to impact yield or
interest rate?
Page 57 of 164

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. The answer is, I don't know. And the good news is, nobody else knows, including
members of the Federal Reserve and everyone. There are a lot of variables in the picture.
And the one thing we know is, we think that long-term bonds are a terrible investment,
and we – at current rates or anything close to current rates.
So, basically, all of our money that is waiting to be placed is in Treasury bills that, I think,
have an average maturity of four months or something like that, at most. The rates on
those have gone up lately, so that in 2018, my guess is, we'll have at least $500 million
more of pre-tax income than we would've had in the bills last year. But they still – it's not
because we want to hold them. We're waiting to do something else. But long-term bonds,
they're basically – at these rates, it's almost ridiculous when you think about it. Because
here the Federal Reserve board is telling you we want 2% a year inflation. And the very
long bond is not much more than 3%. And, of course, if you're an individual, then you pay
tax on it, you're going to have some income taxes to pay. And let's say, it brings your
after-tax return down to 2.5%. So, the Federal Reserve is telling you that they're going to
do whatever's in their power to make sure that you don't get more than 0.5% a year of
inflation-adjusted income. And that seems to me, a very – I wouldn't go back to penny
stocks, but I think I would stick with productive businesses, or productive – certain other
productive assets by far.

Bloomberg Transcript

But what the bond market does in the next year, you've got trillions of dollars in the hands
of people that are trying to guess which maturity would be the best to own and all that
sort of thing. And we do not bring anything to that game that would allow us to think that
we've got an edge. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, it really wasn't fair for our monetary authorities to reduce the savings rates, paid
mostly to our old people with savings accounts, as much as they did. But they probably
had to do it to fight the Great Recession, appropriately. But it clearly wasn't fair, and the
conditions were weird. In my whole lifetime, it's only happened once that interest rates
went down so low and stayed low for a long time.
And it was quite unfair to a lot of people. And it benefited the people in this room
enormously because it drove asset prices up, including the price of Berkshire Hathaway
stock. So, we're all a bunch of undeserving people and I hope that we continue to be so.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

At the time this newspaper came out in 1942, it was – the government was appealing to
the patriotism of everybody. As kids, we went to school and we bought Savings Stamps to
put in – well, they first called them U.S. War Bonds, then they called them U.S. Defense
Bonds, then they called them U.S. Savings Bonds. But they were called War Bonds then.
And you put up $18.75 and you got back $25 in 10 years. And that's when I learned that
that $4 for $3 (02:43:12) in 10 years was 2.9% compounded. They had to put it in small
print then.

Page 58 of 164

FINAL

And even an 11-year-old could understand that 2.9% compounded for 10 years was not a
good investment. But we all bought them. It was part of the war effort, basically. And the
government knew – I mean, you knew that significant inflation was coming from what was
taking place in finance, in World War II.
We actually were on a massive Keynesian-type behavior, not because we elected to
follow Keynes, but because war forced us to have this huge deficit in our finances, which
took our debt up to 120% of GDP. And it was the great Keynesian experiment of all time,
and we backed into it, and it sent us on a wave of prosperity like we've never seen. So,
you get some accidental benefits sometimes.
But the United States government (02:44:15) every citizen to put their money into a fixeddollar investment at 2.9% compounded for 10 years. And I think Treasury bonds have been
unattractive ever since, with the exception of the early 1980s. That was something at that
time. I mean, you really had a chance to buy – you had a chance to invest your money by
buying zero-coupon Treasury bonds, and in effect, guarantee yourself that for 30 years
you would get a compounded return, something like 14% for 30 years of your lifetime.
So, every now and then, something really strange happens in markets and the trick is to
not only be prepared, but to take action when it happens. Charlie, did you ever buy any
War Bonds or...

This question comes from Angus Hanton (02:45:27), who – he and his wife are based in
London, and he says they've been shareholders in Berkshire Hathaway for over 30 years.
He says, we have all read about the zero-based budgeting that has been so effective with
Kraft Heinz and other investments that you've done with 3G Partners. Can we expect
these cost-reduction techniques to be used by your managers in other parts of the
Berkshire Hathaway enterprise?

Page 59 of 164

FINAL

Well, in general, we do not expect the managers, generally, to get in the position where
there would be a lot of change in terms of zero-based budgeting. In other words, why in
the world aren't you thinking that way all of the time?
The 3G people have gone into certain situations where there were – probably primarily in
personnel, but in other expenses as well, a lot of expenses that were not delivering a
dollar of value per dollar expended. And so, they made changes very fast that – to a
situation that probably shouldn't have existed in the first place. Whereas, we hope that
our managers – take a GEICO. GEICO's gone from, I think, 8,000 to 39,000 people since
we bought control. But they're all very productive. I mean, you would not find a way for a
3G operation to take thousands of people out of there. On the other hand, I can think of
some organizations where you could take a whole lot of people out, where it isn't being
done because the businesses are very profitable to start with.
That's what happened with the tobacco companies, actually. They were so profitable that
they had all kinds of people around that didn't – weren't really needed. But they – the
money just flowed in.
So, I – our managers have different techniques of keeping track of – or of – trying to
maximize customer satisfaction at the same time that they don't incur other than
necessary costs.

Bloomberg Transcript

And I think, probably, some of our managers may well use something that's either zerobased budgeting or something akin to it. They do not submit budgets, never have, to me.
I mean, they've never been required to. We've never had a budget at Berkshire.
We don't consolidate our figures monthly. I mean, I get individual reports on every
company. But there's no reason to have some extra time spent, for example, by having
consolidated figures at the end of April, or consolidated figures at the end of May.
We know where we stand. And I'm sure we're the only company that – probably in the
whole Fortune 500, that doesn't do it. But we don't do unnecessary things around
Berkshire. And a lot of stuff that's done at big companies is unnecessary. And that's why a
3G finds opportunities from time to time. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, if you've got 30 people at headquarters and half of those are internal auditors, that
is not the normal way of running a big company in America.
And what's interesting about it is, obviously, we lose some advantages from big size. But
we also lose certain disadvantages from having a big bureaucracy with endless meeting
after meeting after meeting around headquarters. And net, I think we've been way ahead
with our low overhead, diversified method. And also, it makes our company attracted to
very able, honorable people who have companies. So, generally speaking, the existing
system has worked wonderfully for us. I don't think we have the employment that could

well that we'd be very unlikely to change them.

FINAL

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

emulated by our...

Q - Gary Kent Ransom

{BIO 3446828 <GO>}

My question is on small commercial, and specifically, direct small commercial. You seem to
have some websites that enable buyers to purchase small commercial insurance directly;
biBERK is one of them. It's a very competitive, fragmented market. But what is your
strategy for that market? And then, can you ultimately GEICO-ize the small commercial
market?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, we'll find out. I mean, it's a very good question because that's exactly the question
we ask ourselves. And we have this incredible company at GEICO, which has gone direct
in the personal auto field, and is first started in 1936. And there's no question in my mind
that over a lot of years, and maybe not so many years, something like small commercial,
anything that takes cost out of the system makes it easier for the customer, is going to
work over time, if you've got a system that was based on something that had more layers
of agency costs and that sort of thing.
So, we are experimenting, and we'll continue to experiment, on something like small
commercial, workers' comp, whatever it may be. We'll try and figure out ways to take cost
out of the system, offer the customer an equivalent product or better at lesser price, and
we'll find out what can be done and what can't be done. And we're not the only ones
doing it, as you know. But we are not going – we've got some managers that are going to

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

No. I mean, it was a system with all kinds of extra costs that go back to the turn of the 19th
century into the 20th. I mean, it was built on fire insurance and strong general agencies.
And that slopped over into auto when the auto came along in 1903 from Ford or
whenever. And so, it grew within a system that really wasn't very efficient compared to
what was available. But it took State Farm initially to go to a direct, or a captive agency
system, and then it took USAA, and then later, GEICO, and then later, Progressive, to go
to direct systems that are even more efficient and consumer-friendly. And the same thing
is going to happen, to some degree, in all kinds of industries, and certainly small
commercial, somebody will...

lead me to believe the industry has higher barriers to entry than may have originally been
hypothesized, a larger moat, if you will. Would that justify a higher earnings multiple for
established players in the industries, such as PBMs, for example?

FINAL

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, just – though the system may have a moat against intruders, it doesn't mean that
everybody operating within the system has individual moats, for one thing. Now, I – we are
– if this new triumvirate succeeds at all, we are attacking an industry moat. And I'm
defining industry very broadly; healthcare, not just healthcare insurers or this or that. We're
trying to figure out a better way of doing it and making sure that we're not sacrificing care.
And the goal is to improve care.
And like I say, that is a – that's a lot bigger than a single company's moat. It's bigger than a
component of the industry's moat. The moat held by the whole system, since it interacts
in so many ways, is actually – that's the moat that essentially has to be attacked, and that's
a huge moat. And like I say, we'll do our best. But – I hope if we fail, I hope somebody else
succeeds. Charlie?

This question comes from Kiwi (02:56:57) and actually is directly about the issue of moats.
He notes that Elon Musk, this week, on his Tesla earnings call, said the following, "I think
moats are lame. They are, like, nice in a sort of quaint, vestigial way. And if your only
defense against invading armies is a moat, you will not last long. What matters is the pace
of innovation, that is the fundamental determinant of competitiveness". So, Warren, it

technology is impacting everything. Is Elon right?

Let me answer that one, Warren. Elon says a conventional moat is quaint. And that's true
of a puddle of water. And he says that the best moat would be to have a big competitive
position. And that is also right. It's ridiculous. Warren does not intend to build an actual
moat, even though they're quaint.

Yeah. There's certainly a great number of businesses, this has always been true, but it
does seem like it – the pace has accelerated and so on in recent years. There's been
more moats that have been – become susceptible to invasion, than seemed to be the
case earlier. But there's always been the attempt to do it.
And there – here and there, there are probably places where the moat is as strong as
ever. But certainly, you could work at – certainly should be working at improving your own
moat and defending your own moat all of the time. And then, Elon may turn things upside
down in some areas. I don't think he'd want to take us on in candy. But – and we've got
some other businesses that wouldn't be so easy to – you can look at something like
Garanimals out there in the other room. And it won't be technology that takes away the
business in Garanimals. It maybe something else that catches the young kid's fantasy or
something. But, there are some pretty good moats around.
Being the low-cost producer, for example, is a terribly important moat. And something like
GEICO, technology has really not brought down the cost that much. I think our position as
– there are a couple of companies that have costs as low as ours. But among big
companies, we are a low-cost producer, and that is not bad when you're selling an
essential item.
Okay, Gregg?

Q - Greggory Warren

{BIO 15185326 <GO>}

Warren, Berkshire Energy has benefited greatly from operating under the Berkshire
umbrella. By not having to pay out 60% to 70% of earnings annually as a dividend, the
company was able to amass $9 billion in capital the past five years, and closer to $12 billion
in the past 10 years, money that can be allocated to acquisitions and capital spending,
especially on renewables.
While tax credits for solar energy don't run out until next year, we've already seen a
dramatic reduction in Berkshire Energy's capital commitment to solar projects. And even
though spending on wind generation capacity is projected to be elevated this year and
next, it does wind down in 2020 as the wind production tax credits are phased out.
Absent a major commitment to additional capital projects, it looks like Berkshire Energy's
expenditures in 2021 will be its lowest since 2012, leaving the firm with more cash on hand
than it has had in some time. Do you think it is likely at that point that Berkshire Energy
starts funneling some of that cash up to the parent company? Or will it be earmarked for
debt reduction, or just be left in the balance sheet as dry powder for acquisitions?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. The – you're right about when tax credits phase out and all of that. Although, as you
know, they've extended that legislation in the past, and who knows exactly what the
government's position will be on incentivizing various forms of alternative energy? But my
guess is, I mean, if you take the logical expenditures that may be required in all aspects of

FINAL

the public of electric generation (03:02:04) and the utility business generally, I think
there'll be a lot of money spent. And the question is, whether we can spend it and get a
reasonable return on it. And well, there again, we'll do what's logical.
There are three shareholders, basically, of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Berkshire
Hathaway itself owns 90% of it. And Greg Abel and his family, perhaps, and Walter Scott
and, again, family members, own the other 10%. And we all have an interest in employing
as much capital as we can at good rates. And we'll know when it can be done and when it
can't be done, and we'll do – there's no tax consequences to Berkshire at all. So – but the
three partners will figure out which makes the most sense.
But when you think of what might be done to improve the grid in the U.S. and the fact that
we do have the capital, I wouldn't be surprised if we find good uses for capital in
Berkshire Hathaway Energy for a long time in the future. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, I think there'll be huge opportunities in Berkshire Energy as far ahead as you
can see to deploy capital very intelligently. So, I think the chances of a big dividend is
approximately zero.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. And we've not only got the money to an extent that virtually no utility company does
and we've also got the talent too. I mean, we've got a very, very talented organization
there.
So, it's a big field and we've got shareholders that are capitalists and we've got managers
that are terrific. And you would think we'd find something intelligent to do over time in the
field. So far, we have. I mean, we've owned it now for close to 20 years. And we've
deployed a lot of capital and so far, so good. I mean, it's If you look at the improvements that can be made in our utility system in the United
States, you're talking hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars, if not
trillions. So, where else but Berkshire would you look for that kind of money?
Okay. Station 9.

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

I'm Richard Sercer (03:04:34) from Tucson, Arizona. At Berkshire, what counts most are
increases in our normalized per-share earning power. That was in your last letter. What is
our normalized per-share earning power, as you estimate it?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, I would say that what you saw in the first quarter, under these tax rates, would
probably be a reasonable guess. Obviously, it depends on the economy in any given year.

Page 65 of 164



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2018-05-05

FINAL

I would say that would – is a reasonable estimate. But we have firepower we haven't used.
And we'll have more firepower as we go along. So, we do expect that normalized earning
power to increase over time. And if it doesn't, one way or another, we're failing you
because we're retaining those earnings.
So, I don't see anything abnormal in our earnings figured now at a 21% federal rate. But as
I look at the $5.25 billion in the first quarter, seasonally – insurance is better in the first
quarter, but seasonally, most of our businesses, the first quarter is not the strongest
quarter for us. So, I don't see anything abnormal with it. And then I think you can expect –
you should expect, we expect, substantial capital gains over time in addition to what
comes from the operating businesses.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, how much you figure in for that, I would say that the retained earnings beyond
dividends of our $770 billion of equities, in other words, how much they're keeping from
us, but that our share of the earnings, which can be used by them, whether it's Apple or
American Express or Coca-Cola or Wells Fargo or whatever, our share is in many billions of
dollars annually. And one way or another, we think that those dollars will benefit us as
much as if they had been paid out. Now, in certain cases, they won't, but in certain cases
they'll excel the amount in terms of market value created.
So, there's many billions of dollars we are not showing in our earnings that is being
retained by our investees. And one way or another, I think we'll get value received out of
those. So, you can take $20 billion or $21 billion under present tax rates, present economic
conditions, and then we should get something from that and we should get more when
we get $100 billion of cash invested. And we should get more as we retain the earnings.
So, we hope it adds up to a bigger number as we go along. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, I don't think our shareholders are going to see another increase in net worth of $65
billion in a single year. They may have to wait a while for another. But I don't think that – I
think eventually there – another will come, and then another. Just be patient.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. We don't regard the present situation as disadvantageous, except we'd like to get
more money out. We like the businesses we have. We like the businesses that we own
part of. We are not reflecting in the way we look at earnings, the dividends we get from
those partially-owned companies falls far short of what they're going to contribute, in our
view, to Berkshire's overall earnings over time. We wouldn't own those stocks otherwise.
And then, so...

Q - Carol Loomis

{BIO 7137249 <GO>}

This question is from Daniel Kane (03:09:05) of Atlanta. Your annual letter this year
pointed out that Berkshire has become a leader in real estate brokerage in the United
States. Congratulations. That is a significant feat in less than 20 years. But let me mention
a sticky point. If fees charged by stock market active managers are a drag on investor
performance, I would argue that real estate commissions are no different, and perhaps
more detrimental, especially when one considers the lifetime effects of large, forgone,
upfront cash flows and the power of compounding interest. I would be pleased to hear
your rejoinder on the points I've raised.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, the purchase of a home is the largest financial transaction for a significant
percentage of the population that they make. And, people – a lot of people need a lot of
attention. And you can show a lot of houses before you sell one. I would say this. If you
look at our close to 50,000 agents now, I think they make a good living or decent living.
But I would say that people who manage money make a whole lot more money with
perhaps less contribution to the welfare of the person that they are dealing with.
So, I don't think that there are unusual profits involved in being a real estate agent. I don't
think there are unusual profits involved in the ownership. We like it because it's
fundamentally a good business. But here we are, doing 3% of all the real estate
transactions in the United States, and we're making maybe $200 million a year, which –
well, we won't get into what the comparative efforts are in Wall Street to earn $200
million. But, I think, I have to tell them about Roy Tolles a little bit on this. Roy Tolles, for
example, Charlie's partner many, many, many years ago, decided he was going to want to
buy a house in San Marino. He's going to have a number of kids. So he sent his wonderful
wife, Martha (03:11:56), out. And for six months, he had her look at houses in San Marino.
And this was many years ago. And if they were priced at $150,000, she would offer
(03:12:09), or offer $75,000. And, of course, the real estate agents were going crazy
because they're never going to get something listed at $150,000 sold at $75,000.
And then, finally, when she found one that they both really liked, he had her offer
something like $120,000 and the real estate was so happy to get a bid that was in the
general area of that offering price that he would work very hard on the seller to take that
bid, because he knew what he did not want six more months of Roy bidding at the lower
prices. So, you don't sell them on the first trip.

Page 67 of 164



FINAL

Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2018-05-05

Incidentally, I had Roy buy a house for me, sight unseen, because this was a guy that knew
human nature. You don't get rich – real estate agency – the people earn their money, and
they earn it in a perfectly respectable and honorable manner in terms of what they get
paid. And as in every single industry there is – there can be excesses or mistakes or that
sort of thing. But we will continue to buy more brokers. In fact, we'll probably have another
couple to announce before long. And we will feel that if we get to where we're doing 10%
of the real estate brokerage business in the country and we're making $600 million or
$700 million a year, pre-tax, we will not think that's a crazy amount of money to make for
enabling 10% of 5 million people to change their homes every year in the United States.
Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, the commissions in real estate may get unreasonable if you're talking about $20
million houses. It seems a little ridiculous to pay a 5% commission on a $20 million
transaction. But do any of us really care of the kind of people who pay $20 million for a
house have a slightly higher commission? The ordinary commission is not – is pretty wellearned.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. We have a number of brokerage firms. So, the highest has their average transaction
in one section of the country would be close to $600,000 a unit. But the – in terms of the
sales price of the house. But the – in most of our real estate operations, the average price
is more like $250,000 or something in that area. And you can show a lot of houses to
make one $250,000 sale. And, of course, you split – the listing company and the selling
company are usually two different companies. So, it's – it does not strike me as excessive.
And incidentally, it doesn't strike the people in the industry that way either. It has not been
particularly susceptible to online-type substitution or something of the sort. The real
estate agent earns their commission in most cases. But Charlie's had more experience
with $20 million houses. So, he will comment on that area.
Okay. We'll have one more question before we break. Jonathan?

Q - Jonathan Lawrence Brandt

{BIO 17988091 <GO>}

Given the changes in consumer tastes in the food business, and Kraft Heinz's already high
margin structure, do you think the brands they own today, plus new product introductions,
can together maintain or increase the current level of profits over the next ten years
without the benefit of acquisitions? Is there anything in their portfolio besides ketchup that
is enjoying growing demand?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, in effect, you're asking me whether Kraft Heinz is a good buy. And we don't want to
give information on marketable securities, like, in that manner. But, yeah, there are a
number of items besides ketchup that enjoy growing demand. And some vary quite a bit
by geography. There's enormous differences in the penetration of various products in the
portfolio.

FINAL

Consumer packaged goods are still a terrific business in terms of return on invested
assets. And – but the population, worldwide, grows fairly smally (03:16:40) and at – a fairly
minor rate. And people are going to eat about the same amount. And there is some
more willingness to experiment, or go for organic products of the sort.
It's a very good business. And there are new products coming out constantly. It's not one
where you're going to get terrific organic growth, but it never has been. And – you know, I
like the business and we own 26-or-so-percent of it. But there are a number of items
within Kraft Heinz that enjoy pretty fairly healthy growth that – and I think you'd find that at
most food companies, and I think you'd find very good returns on invested – on tangible
net assets – at those businesses.
And with that talk about food, we will now break for lunch. And we will come back in about
an hour and look forward to rejoining you.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Well, I think it was interesting when Buffet and Munger talked about the relationship with
China and the trade deficit. And, of course, it's a political hot potato right now, Jen. And
Buffet said, it's not such a bad thing that we get goods from China and we send them
back paper. It's only when someone wants to win more than the other.

All right. So, Jen, what about you?

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

I was really interested about the Wells Fargo question that came about an hour in on Wells
Fargo. Charlie also getting a little bit of a zinger there. But before that, Warren Buffet
really making impassioned backing of Wells Fargo which, of course, is kind of
beleaguered, given all the issues that they have been having. But he says he really likes
Tim Sloan. He's sticking with his stock.
Charlie Munger, though, saying that basically after you've had something bad happen,
you're pretty good bet because you're going to ride that ship and you're not going to do
the same thing again. And he said that he thinks that Harvey Weinstein has improved
behavior.

morning, Jen and that is what was going to be the first question of the day. Carol Loomis,
a veteran journalist always asks that question and it became a little parlor game for us to
try to figure out what she was going to ask. She likes to do the toughest question and the
first question that's the most salient, and I think we were all wrong.

You said you'd never own it and now you're such a huge shareholder, but let's find out
what Carol Loomis really asked.

Q - Carol Loomis

{BIO 7137249 <GO>}

The question came from William Anderson (03:20:48) of Salem, Oregon and he said, Mr.
Buffett, you have previously said that there are two parts to your job. Overseeing the
managers and capital allocation. Mr. Abel and Mr. Jain now oversee the managers, which
leaves you with capital allocation. However, you shared capital allocation with Ted
Weschler and Todd Combs. Question, does all that mean you were a semi-retired, or if
not, please explain?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

I've been semi-retired for decades. The answer is that I was probably – well it's hard to
break down the percentage at the time that I was involved in. What now the jobs that are
now done by Ajit and Greg and in the case of investing, the subpart of the job that is
done by Ted and Todd. Ted and Todd each manage $12 billion or $13 billion. So, in total,
that's $25 billion. And we have in equities $170-some billion probably now and $20 billion in
longer-term bonds and another $100 billion in cash and short terms. So they're managing
$20 billion, $25 billion and doing a very good job and I still have the responsibility basically
for the other $300 billion, so...

Q - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

So he's still busy. A little bit of a tongue in cheek way to get at the succession issue
certainly.

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Exactly. And I love the fact that I basically do nothing. I mean I don't think that's quite the
case. He's an extremely busy guy.

So can you talk to us a little bit about why you're here and how you're involved in with
Berkshire Hathaway?

A - Jeffrey Towson

{BIO 19999716 <GO>}

Well, I wouldn't say, I'm directly involved, but Peking University where I am a professor in
Beijing, for the last couple of years, we've taken about 20 students per year from the
MBA program Undergraduate Master of Finance. And we bring them out to Omaha, and
it's part of a Q&A with many schools, but for the last couple of years what's happened is,
after Q&A, Warren has sat down with the Chinese students and...

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Oh, that right there. You can see, Jeff. Right?

A - Jeffrey Towson

{BIO 19999716 <GO>}

Right. This was from February, so a couple of months ago. And he spent a couple of hours
each time just talking and having lunch with the students from China. And I mean, the
students are ecstatic. They're on the edge of their seat. They bring questions prepared.
They write up the whole thing in English and Chinese. It goes out on social media and it's
turned into a really nice thing for the last couple of years.

Q - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

I think for a while, Warren Buffett, and Charlie Munger have been hugely popular, idolized
in China. That relationship seems to be going both ways now though. We had Charlie
Munger talking about China. Talk to us about Berkshire Hathaway's, the possibilities for
them in China? Like how big can it get?

A - Jeffrey Towson

{BIO 19999716 <GO>}

Right. Both times, Warren has made comments about certainly the Berkshire companies
that are in China. Coca-Cola, Dairy Queen, I mean there's a Dairy Queen two blocks from
my house. They use Warren's picture in the marketing.

Q - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

We keep hearing this. So Duracell and Coke and Dairy Queen.

Now, I don't know any other country where the Dairy Queen does this. And every Cherry
Coke can in China or most of them, it seems, have his face on there. So you go any to
little store, little village and you'll see his face everywhere. So you know the Berkshire
companies are doing well and it helps that he is so well known, revered, admired. Outside
of that, I mean I've heard him say comments in the past that he was looking at various
companies in China; real estate, insurance the areas you'd expect and not a lot to do with
just the scale of Berkshire. There's not that many markets that you can go to at this point
to make the size of acquisitions they want. So it's U.S. and China maybe one or two
others.

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Do you think it'd be difficult, Jeff, for him to buy a really big company in China just because
of the regulatory environment that we're in right now?

A - Jeffrey Towson

{BIO 19999716 <GO>}

Well, right now it's sort of an interesting situation, particularly this year and they alluded to
this and talked a little bit about it. My take is pretty much the same that China and the U.S.
when it comes to business is basically a marriage without the possibility of divorce. There
may be some arguments from time-to-time but neither party is going anywhere. And big
acquisitions I think CEOs in China would line up to have Berkshire as a partner and that's
pretty much what happened with BYD in the past.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Now, didn't you sense, you told us that you sensed maybe that something might be
brewing or that certainly there's interest via a comment that Munger made?

A - Jeffrey Towson

{BIO 19999716 <GO>}

Charlie Munger did mention China a bit and you know Charlie Munger is an investor in
Himalaya Capital run by Li Lu. Li Lu is very, very famous in China. When we talk to students
about investors, Li Lu is who they want to talk about. And I know him and his folks are in
China all the time. They actually teach – Himalaya Capital teaches a course at Peking
University down the hall from me. So yeah there's a lot of interaction between Pasadena
and China. And I think Mr. Munger is involved in that to some degree, but I don't know
specifics.

Q - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

What are you looking forward to this afternoon? Is there anything else that you haven't
heard, that you want to hear?

A - Jeffrey Towson

{BIO 19999716 <GO>}

I am hoping Charlie will cut loose a little bit more. He was a little bit – I like when he's not

Well, I went to business school there and there's a long history of Ben Graham, Warren
Buffett, a lot of the value investors, Mario Gabelli, he's here as well. And there's a
contingent from Columbia Business School here which is pretty much every year. A lot of
what I'm doing in China, I teach about legendary investors, Warren Buffett, Ben Graham,
Seth Klarman and Phil Fisher, and I'm pretty much copying Columbia Business School. I
mean I'm taking the curriculum they have developed over 60 years and sort of readapting it to China. And the classes are very, very popular. I don't think it's me. I think the

Bloomberg Transcript

First, I want to ask you you're coming up on your 21st year on the board of directors, that'll
happen in August. What are the changes that you've seen both in the meeting and in the
company over that time?

A - Ronald L. Olson

{BIO 521861 <GO>}

Well, I think the one-word description would be bigger. Company is bigger, the meetings
are bigger. I think this year, we've got 42,000, 43,000 people here for this meeting. I
think the only meeting in the country that makes money in connection with its annual
meeting. The businesses have continued to grow, those we had 20 years ago and those
that we've acquired since. So as Warren has clearly reported year-after-year, we continue
the process step-by-step. And we don't have any magic. It's a slow, steady, constant focus
on becoming more so.

Q - Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

All right. And a question that I think has come up a lot in the media and a question that I
think that a lot of shareholders have is succession at the company, who will replace
Warren? A couple of moves have happened over the last few years. Todd and Ted have
come on as investment managers. And then we've had Ajit and Greg join as Vice
Chairman of the board. You've talked in the past about succession, the board's view on
succession. How have those moves changed what the board is thinking or perhaps what
Warren and Charlie are thinking or what you are thinking about the next steps for
Berkshire out in 10, 20 years?

Date: 2018-05-05

Well, succession for the board is a regular topic. And we know what we would do if a bus
hit Warren tomorrow, but I think, to some extent, the media has overplayed this whole –
the Vice Chairmanship given to Greg Abel and to Ajit Jain. This is not a bake-off for
Warren's successor. To the contrary, I think people have missed one very important point. I
see it as very much an extension of the Charlie and Warren show. As you've taken note of
with your first question, the greater size of Berkshire, it has become increasingly more
difficult for one person namely, Warren, to oversee not just the use of our capital but the
ongoing businesses.
And while I think he's done a terrific job all these years, it's obvious to him as well as the
rest of the board members that getting some help in that regard will extend this unique
asset that we all share and want to extend as long as we can by giving him a little more
support and giving two very able people the opportunity to get to know a broader
segment of the businesses than they had been operating themselves, and I think I'm
already seeing that.
I mean, Warren would be the first to admit that there're things that he procrastinated on,
didn't get done that should have been done. He recognized that. Well, I've seen Greg and
Ajit get things done and will continue to get things done. So well, obviously, these are two
very talented people. And if something happened tomorrow, they'd be on our plans, but
this is not about the next CEO and a run-off between them. I really think more emphasis
should be put on how this is going to help Warren and Charlie remain in the saddle. And
from my perspective, they both deserve to stay in the saddle for a long time. Neither one
has deteriorated upstairs, (03:40:37). If anything, they've only become more able, more
experienced, better judgment. And given Warren's unique ability to communicate, to
teach, to see the next big investment opportunity and take advantage of it, the patience
they use in waiting for that opportunity, we want to extend that as long as we can extend
it.

A - Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, as Warren said earlier today, it'll help him remain semi-retired, perhaps. Yeah,
Ron Olson, I want to thank you so much for joining us. We'll go back to the floor with Jen

Q - Julia La Roche
Now you said that the biggest takeaway for you didn't necessarily happen in the arena.
What was that?

FINAL

A - Whitney Richard Tilson

{BIO 5473807 <GO>}

Sure. Well, Berkshire concurrent with its annual meeting, always releases Q1 earnings and
they were blowout earnings and yet the new accounting rules require Berkshire an almost
$200 billion stock portfolio and it just bounces around, doesn't mean anything, but some
of their stocks were down this quarter. So, Berkshire has to report their quarterly earnings
deducting losses of their bouncing around stock portfolio. So the headlines are Berkshire
has a rare loss, loses $1 billion and in reality it was blowout quarter.
They reported $6.6 billion of pre-tax earnings driven by 130% gain in insurance, 25% gain
in manufacturing, a 12% gain in railroad. So, you add it all up, Berkshire's pre-tax operating
earnings grew 30% pre-tax. And then with the change in the tax law, Berkshire was a full
tax payer. So, as one of the biggest corporate beneficiaries, their tax rate dropped from
30% to 20%, so that means after-tax earnings rose 49% for one of the largest companies
in the world. That's just extraordinary and I think people are going to look at the headlines
and think it wasn't a good quarter. It was exact opposite.

Q - Julia La Roche

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, you've been coming here for 21 consecutive years now. So now you're in the money
management business now, but you're helping teach folks the next generations. What do
you get out of coming here?

A - Whitney Richard Tilson

{BIO 5473807 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, initially I came here because I was learning value investing, I was running my
own little funds. And so I was coming here for investing lessons. What I realized though,
over 21 years is, I think I've gotten more out of these meetings and going to other, like
Charlie Munger's old Wesco meeting, et cetera, I've learned more from these old guys
outside of investing, that's made a bigger difference in my life.
They've been just great role models and the things they teach about developing good
habits and being super high integrity, never going close to any ethical lines. And Charlie is
always riffing on avoiding calamities. He always says, all I want to know is where I'm going
to die, so I never go there. And those are things that I have internalized over the years,
that have helped me think about our life differently, live my life differently and even now
that I'm not managing money professionally anymore, I still keep coming because who
doesn't want to be a better human being and learn from wise old guys about that.
So in fact, I'm writing a book about it, coming out in August called Beyond Value Investing,
life lessons from Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, a little parenthesis, and me, right? So,
this is my – I've written three investing books. And now, I'm going to write a non-investing
book about all the things I've learned from them in life, for all the wisdom.

A - Whitney Richard Tilson

{BIO 5473807 <GO>}

FINAL

It feels like more. Have you been counting? I would guessed over 21 years, it's probably
been dozen or more, but probably more than anyone else is my guess.

Q - Julia La Roche
So I have to ask you, what question would you ask Warren and Charlie today?

A - Whitney Richard Tilson

{BIO 5473807 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I've been curious. I like the fact that they're buying Apple and that even at their age,
they're sort of expanding their investing horizons and being willing to buy a tech stock,
right? I've looked hard at a lot of the big tech stocks and personally, I'm a little bit more of
a fan of Google. I like Apple. I think Google's equally cheap, equally strong balance sheet,
but it's just a better business model. They don't actually have to make things. And I think
they can grow more easily over the next 10 years. So I think it's a little bit better business
model with a bit higher growth rate, equally cheap as Apple. So when I saw, Berkshire
already has a $28 billion holding in Apple and they just bought another $12 billion, which is
already up a couple of billion just since they bought it. So it's been a great buy.
On the other hand, as a shareholder, I actually would've liked to see them add $12 billion
to Google to the $28 billion of Apple. So, they don't like talking about their stocks. I don't
think it would be worth asking the question here at the meeting because I think they'll sort
of puns on it, because maybe they do want to buy Google someday, maybe at a better
price, right? So they won't really talk about it. But I were sitting one-on-one, off the record
with Mr. Buffet, I'd want to hear his thinking on that because I come out differently than
they were came out I think.

A - Julia La Roche
All right. That's Whitney Tilson of Kase Learning. Back to you, guys.

How do you operate in the retail world right now when Amazon is just seems to be

A - Kathy Ireland

{BIO 1642528 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

It's so critical how we work with our retail partners with the click versus brick and there are
new and innovative ways, in which we can do this. We partner with our retail partners very
strategically. We have proprietary programs where we share revenue if somebody
purchases online for certain products within a certain radius. We come up with incentives.
We're very engaged with our retail partners and we've built our brand grassroots.
Something that Mr. Buffett says is that the independent channel will always remain
competitive against the big box, and I believe this to be true. Yes, Internet has changed
everything, but there's something special about that independent retailer and we've just
got to work ever stronger, ever more vigilantly and efficiently. And there's wonderful
creative ways to really make it an experience and drive the customers in.

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Kathy shifting gears a little bit. I want to ask you about the Me Too movement both from
your former career as a model and now as a female executive. Do you see this as a real
reckoning for America in a time where we need to change behavior?

A - Kathy Ireland

{BIO 1642528 <GO>}

I was speaking with a young lady, 15-year-old girl here on the floor today, Cecilia
(03:50:27) who shared with me that she wants to be a model. And something that I
shared with her is be alert. And yes, I do see this movement growing. And I think it's
wonderful that we're having these conversations because unfortunately there will always
be predators out there. And it's so important for young people to understand their value
and to put boundaries in place to protect them because they will be challenged. And to
first of all try everything not to put yourself in a compromising situation, but get out of
there if you are in one. And something I'm so grateful for in my life is to have parents who
always encouraged me that I could do anything for a living and to walk away from a
situation that would dare to compromise.

A - Jennif er Rogers

(03:51:34), a noted Buffett authority and author.

Q - Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Jen. Bob (03:51:39), thanks so much for joining us. I wanted to first ask you you've
been coming to this meeting for a long time. We heard Ron Olson talked about how it's
mostly just gotten bigger. What's your view on how you've seen it change over the years?

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Well it indeed has gotten bigger like Ron said, but I'm also seeing for the first – well, these
last few years a very large Asian contingency of discovering Warren Buffett. It's being
translated simultaneously in Mandarin. So, obviously that's translated into more
attendance.

Q - Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

So I want to talk a little bit about your work and your study of Warren Buffet. You teach a
class about the – what you call the genius of Warren Buffet. As a manager, now a lot of
people I think view Warren Buffet as an investor. Do you think that those two skills are a lot
different? Do you think they're related and how would you define his managerial prowess
against his skills as an investor?

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Actually he's wildly heralded as the greatest investor ever to live, but he's also, should be
known for being the greatest manager. His most proudest accomplishment he told me
was that in 47 years of being CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, he has not lost one subsidiary
CEO to a competitor and that's his most proudest accomplishment. And when I asked him
how he would measure his successor? He said, if he or she too could say, I never lost a
sitting CEO of a subsidiary business to a competitor.

Q - Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

Now, how would you maybe one or two principles that you have found in your work that
Buffet tends to follow that maybe created the situation where he didn't lose a CEO for
almost five decades?

FINAL

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Well, this is a group of managers who don't want to be micromanaged. So he leaves them
alone. They're able to call him as often or less as they wish, but they are to send a
monthly financial statement and that's the only requirement that he has of them. And any
major capital expense that they are going to experience, he wants to know about and
every other year, he wants them to name their successor. If something happened to
them, they have somebody to put in place to take over their role as CEO of the subsidiary
business.

Q - Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

Now I want to, your book first came out, The Warren Buffett CEO in 2002 I believe I've
been 16 years since then. How or has Buffett's view on managing rather not changed over
that time or has he made evolutions in the last decade and a half ?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Yeah. He says his investment principles are principles because they do not change. And
what I have found in the CEOs that have been added since I wrote the book, they're
same cloth and fabric as all the ones that I profiled in the book. He tells them to forget
that they've sold the business to Warren and to keep running the business as if this was
the only asset they and their families owned and he will forget he bought it and he hopes
they forget they sold it.

Q - Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

Yeah. Now, speaking of CEOs, we have to talk about Warren Buffett as a CEO in
succession and Berkshire Hathaway. We've got a lot of shareholders are thinking about it.
A lot of people are discussing it, they're here at the meeting or on the side leading up to
it. So what's your view on succession? Maybe who do you think will be the next CEO of
Berkshire Hathaway and what are the changes that they've made in terms of bringing in
Ted and Todd and adding members to the board in the last two years. Signal to you
about where the leadership of Berkshire Hathaway might be headed?

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Well, he said early on that he really admired the GE model where Jack Welch was put in
place and given a 20-year runway, of which to run GE. So he would like that model to be
followed by Berkshire Hathaway. So it really depends when he retires which he says will be
about five years after his death and then he's going to communicate to the board through
regular séances, but it's already in place. His job will be split into three parts. There'll be a
non-executive chairman of the board, most likely his son, Howard Buffett who's on the
board. There'll be a CEO in-charge of Asset Allocation already in place with Ted and Todd

Page 85 of 164

and now there'll be a CEO in-charge of Operations most likely to be Ajit and Greg all
depending on when he retires, which we as shareholders hope is a long, long time away.

FINAL

Q - Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

Sure. And now very quickly I want to get your thoughts on Apple, a company that
Berkshire Hathaway didn't own just two years ago and now it's one of their largest
holdings. I think it's their largest holding in fact added to it just yesterday – or news came
out they added to it yesterday. You were skeptical about a year ago of why they bought it.
They've roughly doubled their stakes since then. How have you, kind of, changed or
evolved or thought more about their position in Apple?

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Well, I actually went around the world this summer and I visited eight countries. And what I
observed in the countries that I visited is there is an addiction shared by all countries, no
matter their social economic level, and the addiction is the smartphone. So, I began to
see where Ted and Todd may have saw initially making their $1 billion investment before
Warren followed them into Apple. This is a moat that is not going away and is an addiction
shared by the world.

A - Myles Udland

Yeah. And I think moat was one of the operative words of the morning. Bob Miles
(03:57:21) thanks so much for stopping by. Jen and Andy, back to you.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

All right. Thanks a lot, Myles. You know there're a number, of Buffettologists out there.
Buffett experts and Bob Miles (03:57:31) is probably the foremost of them.

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

It was very interesting to hear his thoughts. I love it. I do think moat is one of the themes.
And Charlie said, he's not going to build an actual moat.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Yeah. That's probably a good idea. Anyway, Jen, a popular booth here on the floor is

Thanks, Julia. It's good to be here.

Q - Julia La Roche
All right. So tell us the benefit of being a Berkshire Hathaway owned company?

A - James M. Weber

{BIO 1916112 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Here is the business side of it. The truth is, it's a great competitive advantage for us
because we're trying to build a brand and a good business over the long haul. We're
really focused on runners and all who run all around the world. And having Berkshire as a
platform to build a brand from it, doesn't get any better because we want to make our
numbers every quarter, every year. We work hard at that, but the real focus is that our
brand is getting stronger year-after-year and the support from Berkshire to build our
brand is total. So it's a real advantage for us.

Q - Julia La Roche
Now we have some special limited edition sneakers here. Show us what we have?

A - James M. Weber

{BIO 1916112 <GO>}

So this is our number one selling shoe, The Adrenalin. And we really deck it out with
probably two of the best celebrities in investment. This shoe is the left hand shoe and
we've got Charlie Munger in this one and Warren's on the other shoe on the right, but
The Adrenalin is one of our best selling shoes of all time. It's a great running shoe and we
do a Berkshire Hathaway Special Edition just for this weekend.

Q - Julia La Roche
Now I know you all just had your record quarter, your most profitable quarter. How are you
able to find that success?

A - James M. Weber

{BIO 1916112 <GO>}

It's a really interesting time at retail and the consumer world because there's so much
choice for everyone. And we decided when we stalled running slowed down a little bit in
2015 and 2016, we doubled down on performance. We reinvented our product line and
we're distinguishing ourselves right now. People have so many choices and right now our

product is fantastic. All new technology, all new design and I think runners are choosing
Brooks. So it's an exciting year for us right now.

FINAL

Q - Julia La Roche
Well, you just mentioned the topic that everyone's talking about in retail, and especially
specialty retailers, the sports apparel stores closing. So where are you finding success in
terms of selling your sneakers? Are you finding it online, in store?

A - James M. Weber

{BIO 1916112 <GO>}

Retail, in our category, I think is stabilizing and settling out a little bit. In 2016, we lost over
800 stores globally to bankruptcy and closure, but it settled out in 2017 and 2018 and so
right now, our best retailers are actually doing really well. And many of them have gone
omni-channels. So the direct-to-consumer business continues to grow for us and many of
our retail partners, even the small specialty shops, they're testing home delivery, many of
them are very active in social media and creating running communities. So retailers are
evolving, and we're trying to support and help evolve with them, but retail is good right
now, I would say. It could be better, but it's good.

Q - Julia La Roche

Bloomberg Transcript

A lot of the major shoemakers have partnered with celebrities. And when I think of Brooks
Running, what I'm recently thinking of is that Boston Marathon and Desi Linden's finish. Tell
us how that's been helping your business?

A - James M. Weber

{BIO 1916112 <GO>}

It's inspiring. Desi Linden has been focused on Boston for many, many years. She's been a
second a few years back. But that victory for her was epic. And it was a grind, and she
earned it and she raced it and won it. So for us to be associated with her, I think she's
going to inspire thousands of young runners, hopefully boys and girls. But it's just a great
story and a story like that, first American woman in maybe 33 years to win a Boston, it
inspires a lot of people to get out and run.

Q - Julia La Roche
Thank you so much, Jim. All right. Back to you, guys.

A - James M. Weber

I am running. I signed up and it's a great thing. I mean, the party continues all different
kinds of people, people from around the world wearing different outfits. Actually, I heard
the theme is rock and roll. And so I was in line with an executive from the Oriental Trading
which is one of the Berkshire companies, and he said he has an Elvis suit. And I said well
then, you got to wear it. If you got an Elvis suit and there is a rock and roll race, you got to
put it on. But there's a lot of Brooks stuff down there. $17, Brooks Berkshire Hathaway
socks.

Q - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

I have to admit that I did buy the $17 Brooks socks. The most expensive socks I've ever
bought. Now I can't wait to wear them. Have you gotten anything on the floor?

A - James M. Weber

{BIO 1916112 <GO>}

I got the socks and I also did step by (04:02:15) place to buy some intimates. Is that the
right word?

Q - Jennif er Rogers

So we're about 15 minutes away now for, when we think the afternoon session of the

there a lot more about Apple and also Google. I think that people were expecting that
there would be more conversation or more questions maybe around Apple. Will we get
that this afternoon?

FINAL

A - James M. Weber

{BIO 1916112 <GO>}

I mean I think so. It's a company that everyone cares so much about. And Berkshire is such
a large shareholder now and they increased their position, the stock is up. The market
capitalization is getting close to $1 trillion, Jen. And it's a consumer-facing company.
Everyone has the iPhone and of course, Buffett said, he was never going to own a
technology company and it wasn't until Todd Combs and Ted Weschler came on board as
his investment advisors that he was doing it and that he made that purchase. And of
course, it was actually their decision.

Q - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

Yeah. It's hard to believe that, that first purchase was made what Q1 2016 and how fast
that's become so big for them. One question that seemed to get a lot of attention from
people was the question on guns that Andrew Ross Sorkin asked. Let's take a listen to
that.

Q - Andrew Ross Sorkin

{BIO 6340618 <GO>}

I should say this may be one of the most pointed questions I've ever received for you.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

But you elected to give it, though anyway.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andrew Ross Sorkin

{BIO 6340618 <GO>}

But I did. The shareholder writes, I have watched the movie every year at this meeting,
when you testify in front of Congress on behalf of Salomon, as the symbol of what it
means to have a moral compass. Investors are increasingly looking to invest in companies
that are socially and morally responsible. So I was disturbed when you were asked on
CNBC about the role the business could play in sensible policies around the sales of guns.
You said you didn't think business should have a role at all, and you wouldn't impose your
values on others. I was even more surprised when you said you'd be okay with Berkshire
owning shares in gun manufacturers. At this meeting years ago, you said you wouldn't buy
a tobacco company because of the social issues. The idea that Berkshire would associate
with any company as long as it isn't illegal seems at odds with everything I think you stand
for. Please tell us you misspoke.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, let's explore that a little. Should it be just my view, or should it be the view of the
owners of the company? So, if I decide to poll the owners of the company on a variety of
political issues, and one of them being whether, Berkshire Hathaway should support the
NRA, I don't – if a majority of the shareholders voted to do it, or if a majority of the Board
of Directors voted to do it, I would accept that. I don't think that the – my political views – I
don't think I put them in a blind trust at all when I take the job. And in the elections of
2016, I raised a lot of money.
In my case, I raised it for Hillary. And I spoke out in various ways that were quite frank, but I
don't think that I speak – when I do that, I don't think I'm speaking for Berkshire. I'm
Page 90 of 164

speaking as a private citizen. And I don't think I have any business speaking for Berkshire.
We have never – at the parent company level, we have never made a political
contribution. And I don't go to our suppliers. I don't do anything of that sort where I raise
money either for the school I went to, or for a political candidate I went to, or anything
else. And I don't think that we should have a question on the GEICO policyholder form,
are you an NRA member, and if you are, you just aren't good enough for us, or
something. That I think I do not believe in imposing my political opinions on the activities
of our businesses. And if you get to what companies are pure and which ones aren't pure,
I think it is very difficult to make that call.

A - James M. Weber

{BIO 1916112 <GO>}

It's a very interesting conversation about guns. And obviously, it's something that's taking
place at all levels of society, companies, individuals, the regulatory process lawmakers, et
cetera. Interesting to hear those guys talk about that.

Q - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

Yeah. Definitely.

All right. Shifting gears, Julia has now moved over to the Nebraska Furniture Mart. And
she's with the Chairman, Ron Blumkin. Julia?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Julia La Roche
I'm here with Ron Blumkin, the Chairman of the Nebraska Furniture Mart. Ron, welcome.

A - Ronald Blumkin
Thanks, Julia.

Q - Julia La Roche
Now, your grandmother, Mrs. B, the Founder of the Nebraska Furniture Mart, she did a
handshake deal 35 years ago with Warren Buffett. So, tell us a bit about who she was.

A - Ronald Blumkin
Well, my grandmother, Mrs. B immigrated from Russia. She actually tells a great story. She
had to get out of Russia. It was no choice. And she actually bribed a border guard with a
bottle of vodka, said, I'm just going to go across the border. And when I come back, I'm
going to bring you a bottle of vodka. And that was the only time I'm aware of my
grandmother ever didn't tell 100% the truth. She never came back.

Q - Julia La Roche
Now what kind of business woman was she?

A - Ronald Blumkin
Page 91 of 164

FINAL

Well, when she was in Russia, believe it or not, as a late teen, she actually ran a small
business for her boss. And she talked about it in terms of a big business. She actually had
six people working for her. And remember, she's only a teen. And even back then, she
had great business instincts and was quite driven. But when she came to the United
States, married, lived in Omaha, Nebraska, raised her family up until 1937. And then of
course, you might remember 1937 was the height of the great depression.
And my grandmother, who spent her time prior to that raising the family, she got tired of
the family, the neighbors, the country, complaining about how tough times were and by
then, her youngest child was high school, beyond high school age, actually in senior high
school. And she decided that she is going to show him. And she says, I'm going to start a
business and I'm going to show you how to run a business and with $500 of borrowed
money in the basement of her husband's pawnshop, she started with, it's now Nebraska
Furniture Mart.

Q - Julia La Roche
And it certainly caught the attention of Warren Buffet. What's been the benefit of being a
Berkshire Hathaway-owned company?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Ronald Blumkin
I can't begin to tell you all the benefits. First of all, having Mr. Buffet is not only a friend, but
a business partner in a manner has been incredible for me, my brothers who are my
business partners, just the learning lessons. And the simple philosophy of integrity is
what's it's really about. And you can lose money for the company but not one shed of
honor or integrity and just simple kind of lessons. Plus, having them there to bounce ideas
off of which is very interesting because of, he'd never exactly tell you do this or do that.
But he'll tell you stories based on what he's seen or what he's done, kind of give you a
clear path as to where you need to go.
And by the way, speaking of Mr. Buffet, my grandmother, she adored him. She absolutely
adored him. And when they did that famous handshake in 1983, and again, at the time,
there were other offers on the table that were higher. But she was extraordinarily
comfortable with the idea that we could sell the business to Berkshire Hathaway and
she'd still be in charge and she could still run it as she always wanted to.

Q - Julia La Roche
Ron Blumkin, Chairman of the Nebraska Furniture Mart. Thank you so much.

Q - Ronald Blumkin
May I also suggest that since it's still pretty early in the event, Nebraska Furniture Mart is
offering special deals to our shareholders here in Omaha, Kansas City, Texas, come on in.
We want the business and we love our customers.

Your third.
Yeah.
And, in a way, it's sort of the same thing but it doesn't get old. How is that?
No. Because, well, the world changes and they have very, very interesting questions and
even though I have to say I don't understand everything that they're talking about, the fact
that we learn that Warren spends probably most of his time reading and thinking. So what
– his answers are worth listening to. And I just find it remarkable and then he'll defer to
Charlie and then say three words.

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Well, I was interested in the question that he said I can't – they basically said we can't
answer it. And that was about investing in public. I mean, to me it was like infrastructure

Well, I think seeing Warren when he was working for Salomon Brothers and was so open
and honest in inviting people to inspect every aspect of their company. And expecting, he
said, I don't mind if people fail, but I do mind if they don't treat this company with respect.

FINAL

Now you're talking about Salomon Brothers, Glenn (04:13:40). And then at first you said
you don't really know anything about business. It sounds like you follow business pretty
closely, right? I mean you're up on all the stuff.
I mean just – and I wouldn't say I am but I really care. I mean the book I'm reading now is
called Can Democracy Survive Global Capitalism? And I have to say to anybody who's
watching, thinking that a book like that would be unreadable and boring, it is really, really
interesting and it's vital to understand why we are the way we are right now, and what's
pulling our democracy, what forces especially in the financial side are pulling our
democracy. So, I'm learning a lot and I really care about it.

Well, you can tell us what there about.
Whether they're good or bad?
No, whether – well they're good or bad, I'm assuming they're good.
Sure they've done them, yeah.
But you can't talk about the nature of them, the title?
Well, no – because to me – to me, I feel like what I'm going to do in the fall is kind of the
find for theater. It's what one must do, where one must appear to be a truly hardcore
New York actor.
Then you like to go back and forth between the stage and the screen?
I do yes.
Right. And singing at Mets games, are you going to do that anymore? I really enjoyed that.

Q - Julia La Roche

FINAL

That's right. I'm here with Guy Spier. He is the CEO of the Aqua Marine Fund and he also
won one of those charity lunches with Warren Buffett several years ago and wrote a book
about it. So, Guy, was the lunch worth it?

Q - Guy Selmar Spier

{BIO 2291523 <GO>}

It was absolutely worth it. It's the gift that keeps giving. It's paying dividends till today I can
tell you.

Q - Julia La Roche
And what did you take away from that lunch that was so valuable?

Q - Guy Selmar Spier

{BIO 2291523 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Just so much. I don't think I would have chosen to move to Zurich, if I kind of hadn't gotten
permission from Warren Buffett to do it. But perhaps and the more important thing was
the realization that wealth is – we all think of wealth and money as a leading indicator. It's
actually a trailing indicator. What I noticed was how much Warren, even the billionaire that
he was, gives to people around him. That included us at the lunch.
But it also include the – he's got the, he had this reputation of being very stingy with
money, with tips, and things like that. He gave the staff at the restaurant, a must have
been several hundred dollars. He's extraordinarily generous. He creates goodwill
wherever he goes.

A - Julia La Roche
All right, well, that's an important lesson. Back to you guys, Andy and Jen.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Close and closer to the second half of the annual meeting. And Warren and Charlie are
going to be making their way back onto the stage. It's interesting, it does seem like
there's a lot of questions asked in the first half of the day. But believe me, there are
plenty more questions to go. There are people from around the world. There are Wall
Street analysts, there are journalists, all of them have tons more questions. So it's going
to be an exciting, exciting afternoon.

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

This isn't half over, right? Because we still have the business meeting, we're going to be
back as well after this next section of Q&A, before the business portion gets done as well.

FINAL

I'm trying to think of the first question of the second half.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Well, we talked about Apple, that hasn't really been flushed out. And I think there is
definitely going to be something there. At least, that would be a surprise if there wasn't,
and I think people will still ask more questions about trade. I do think that's the hot topic.
And we haven't really gotten the real Trump question yet. And to my mind, that's

Right, when we had that young kid get up and start off asking a Trump question. I thought
maybe it was going there and then it veered off into a more substantial question. But I do

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Right. Right. Exactly. But you know right now we have to probably wait for Glenn Close
(04:20:17) to get back into the arena. It was great to talk to her and have her stop by. And
as well as all the different guests. So I think it really gives you a flavor of all the different
types of people. And we really could just go out in the crowd and get any number of
people to come up and they all have incredible stories. And as you can imagine, some of
these people, Jen, bought shares of Berkshire Hathaway 30 years ago and they put in
maybe $25,000 and that has amassed into and turned into a huge fortune and they're all
manner of millionaires out there.

A - Jennif er Rogers

But as we keep saying, there's a lot of families. I had said that I thought maybe the first
question could be about GE and, we haven't got to talk about GE, but it did get
mentioned and that was in reference to 2008 and just some of the terms that they
extracted from other companies during the financial crisis and I thought it was really
interesting, Warren Buffett talking about it. They could have gotten better terms maybe.
But in the end that could have been counterproductive and sort of like, his long-term
thinking really comes to bear in a lot of these questions.

Last year, for several years, we had a wonderful woman who carried this meeting off
without a hitch, Carrie Sova. And she just had her third child here about two weeks ago
and decided that – she decided right after the last meeting that, that was going to be her
full-time occupation.
And this year, again, we've had everything carried off without me having to do anything
without a hitch and we just like to have Melissa Shapiro stand up. We'll get a spotlight on
her.
I can't believe how she does it. It's remarkable. I mean, I just tell her the date and that's all
the help I have and it goes on from there. So, Melissa. Thank you.
Okay. I think we next go to station 10 and we will continue until 3:30. And we'll take a 15minute break. And at 3:45, we'll convene the actual annual meeting. Station 10?

Hi. I'm Theresa Lukasinski (04:24:13). I'm from Omaha, Nebraska. And I have a question
about Microsoft. You have gotten into the tech world with buying Apple. You have Mr.
Gates there. I'm just wondering why you never bought Microsoft?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, in the earlier years, it's very clear. The answer is stupidity. But the – since Bill has –
particularly since Bill has joined the board but even earlier than that because of our
friendship, it would be – it just would be a mistake for Berkshire to buy Microsoft because
if something happened a week later, a month later, in terms of them having better
earnings than expected or making an acquisition, anything, both Bill and I would,

incorrectly, but would be a target of suggestions and accusations, perhaps even, that
somehow he had told me something or vice versa.
I try to stay away from a few things just totally because the inference would be drawn that
we might have talked – I might have talked to somebody about something. So, I've told
the fellows, Ted and Todd for example, that there just a few things that are off the list
because there'd be a lot of people who wouldn't believe us if something good
immediately happened after we bought it, and of course we – to buy a lot of stock, it can
take six months to buy it or something of that sort. We just don't need it. But both that
and my stupidity have cost us a lot of money. It's a very – it's a good question and I think
the answer makes sense. Charlie?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Becky Quick

{BIO 16400962 <GO>}

All right. This question comes from Dave Shane (04:26:50). He says, Warren, you are a big
believer in the U.S. political system, the financial system and in every American. You've
said that regardless of who is president, the economy and the U.S. consumer will continue
to prosper over the long run. All that said, do you believe that people in this country are
more divided today than 50 years ago, or is it just social media and media in general that
blows this divide out of proportion? And if you do believe the divide has grown, what
words of wisdom do you have to possibly help remedy it?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. I would say this. Multiple times in my life, people have felt the country was more
divided than ever, and I've gone through periods where people I knew and admired
thought that because the other party was in power, that there never would be another
election, that the Constitution – I've heard everything.
Now, the interesting thing is this paper from 1942. Since then, there have been 14
American presidents. Just since my young venture into the stock market at 11, I've lived
under 14 of the 44 presidents the United States has had. Now, they call Trump 45, but
they count Grover Cleveland twice, so there's really only been 44 presidents of the
United States.
And 14 of the 44 have been during this period when that $10,000 became $51 million, 7
have been Republicans, 7 have been Democrats, 1 has been assassinated, 1 has resigned
under pressure. It works. It – if you'd told me at the start that you'd have Cuban missile
crisis and you'd have nuclear weapons and you have a panic, financial panic, and you have
many recessions and you'd have war in the streets in the late 60s from a dividing country

and say why the hell are you buying socks? And through it all, America in fits and starts,
but America really moves ahead and we are always – we survived the civil war.
I mean I hate to think of having to do it that way but this country in only less than three of
my lifetimes. If you go back three of my lifetimes, you go back 263 years, I guess. And
Thomas Jefferson is 12 years old. And that's just three – and there was nothing here.
You've flown in from all over to Omaha today and you flew over a country with more than
75 million owner-occupied homes and 260 million vehicles and great universities and
medical systems and everything. And it's all a net gain in less than three of my lifetimes.
So – and we've had these events since I started buying my first stock.
This country really, really works, and it always will have lots of disagreements, and after
every election, you'll have people feeling the world is coming to an end and how could
this happen. And I remember my future father-in-law in 1952, he wanted to have a talk
with me before his daughter and I got married. So, kind of reluctantly, I sat down with him,
and he said, Warren, he said, there's just one thing I want to tell you. He said, you're going
to fail. He said, the Democrats are going to take over the country and you're going to fail
but don't feel responsible for it because it's not your fault. I mean, he wanted to absolve
me from this feeling that while his daughter was starving to death, it was my fault.

Bloomberg Transcript

And I kept buying stocks and doing a little bit better all the time. But if the Republicans
were in it, it was okay and it was because of them that I was doing well. And if they were
out, forget it, it was all going to disappear. So, I've seen a lot of American public opinion
over the years. I've seen a lot of media commentary. I've seen the headlines.
And when you get all through with it, this country has six times the per capita GDP growth,
the GDP per capita that it had when I was born. One person's lifetime, six-for-one change.
Everybody in this room essentially is living better in multiple ways than John D. Rockefeller
Sr. was, who was the richest person in the world during my early years. And we're all living
better than he could live. So, this is a remarkable, remarkable country and we found
something very special.
I would love to be a baby being born in the United States today. Okay, Charlie, you give
the other side of this.

Well, there's a tendency to think that our present politicians are much worse than any we

Q - Gary Kent Ransom

{BIO 3446828 <GO>}

Yes. On reinsurance, I know we've talked in the past about reinsurance not really being as
attractive an industry in say the next 10 years as the last 10. But I don't think we've talked
specifically about General Re and I looked this morning at the 10-Q and I see General Re
has grown nicely. I know there's been some changes in the management. And I wondered
if you could just give us a sense of what's going on at the company to bring about some
of that growth and what looks like improvement.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Well, the reinsurance business, I don't think I'd say this, it's tougher than it was 10
years ago. But if we go back to 40 or 50 years ago, it was not brutally competitive. I'll put
it that way. And at Gen Re, Tad Montross, who did a fantastic job for us at Gen Re, retired.
And we have under Ajit – and then Kara in addition. But under Ajit, the focus of the place
has changed somewhat. And probably is more growth-oriented than before. But I can
assure you that anything associated with Ajit is also has underwriting discipline attached to
it. But there has – as you correctly noticed, there's been some pickup. And I think you
actually will see the property casualty reinsurance business grow a fair amount.
And the life business, reinsurance business, and it's really the only place we do much in
life, but that has grown very substantially ever since we took it over particularly
internationally. And so, that part I like. And I think we'll have a somewhat larger operation
at Gen Re. But we have various methods, as you know, of being in reinsurance, we do this
huge bulk deals. That's why our net revenues are down this year. We did that $10 billion
deal with AIG, which was the biggest deal in history last year, and we don't have a repeat
of it this year. We will be in the reinsurance business 5 years from now, 10 years from now,
20 years from now, and 50 years from now in my view.
And we will have some unusual advantages that stem both from our capital position, our
attitude towards the business and the talents that we have. We have a way better-thanaverage insurance business generally. We have some real gems and nobody really knows
much about. And we have a very, very good reinsurance business that will be subject to
more ups and downs and something like GEICO will be, which it moves ahead every year,
but it will be an important part of Berkshire. Charlie?

Q - Charles Thomas Munger

FINAL

Hey, Warren, Charlie. Thank you again for having us and having me. Just can't thank you
guys enough and appreciate you guys enough for the body of work that you guys have
delivered to us and the exemplary example that you guys have set with your principles.
Thank you. Charlie, you've mentioned that, if given a chance or a same chance with a
smaller capital base, you would still look for mispriced stock opportunities.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Of course.

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

And that would be determined through obviously what we call the intrinsic value of the
organization or the company in question an aggregate of discounted future cash flows.
Would you work the arithmetic using a fictional dataset to illustrate the mathematical
principia to determine an intrinsic value?

Bloomberg Transcript

And I hope you include the comprehensive mental model of the key metrics considered
and qualitative assessments of the management and any assumptions of its industry to
determine the durability of its earning power. And, Warren, same to that effect, would you
also demonstrate or illustrate an arithmetic problem set using with a significant capital
base and provide the object lessons on how those have changed from a small to a large
capital base?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, I can't give you a formulaic approach because I don't use one, and I just mix all the
factors in, and if the gap between value and price is not attractive, I go on to something
else, and sometimes it's just quantitative. For instance, when Costco was selling at about
12 or 13 times earnings, I thought that was a ridiculously low value just because the
competitive strength of the business was so great and it was so likely to keep doing
better and better.
But I can't reduce that to a formula for you. I like the cheap real estate. I like the
competitive position. I like the way the personnel system where I like everything about it.
And I thought even though it's three times book or whatever it was then, that it's worth
more. But that's not a formula that anybody. If you want a formula, you should go back to
graduate school. They'll give you lot of formulas that won't work.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

This is the longest we've ever gone in the Berkshire meeting without Charlie saying that
getting to the point where he prefers Costco to Berkshire. Okay. Andrew.

Q - Andrew Ross Sorkin

{BIO 6340618 <GO>}

We've got a handful of questions relating to Apple. This is a bit of a mash up of a couple
of them. Warren, you have bought in and sold out of IBM. You have praised Jeff Bezos but

Page 105 of 164



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2018-05-05

never bought Amazon and you have double down on Apple. Can you tell us what it is
about Apple? And given your sometimes critical views on buybacks, do you think Apple
would do better spending $100 billion on buybacks or buying other productive businesses
the way you have generally preferred? $100 billion is a lot of money.

FINAL

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

I used to think so. The Apple has an incredible consumer product, which you understand a
lot better than I do. Whether they should buy in their share – they shouldn't buy in their
shares at all unless they think that they're selling for less than they're worth. And if they
are selling less than they're worth and they have the money and they don't see an
acquisition, that's even more attractive. They should buy in their shares and I think that
that's very – because I think it's extremely hard to find acquisitions that would be accretive
to Apple, that would be in the $50 billion or $100 billion or $200 billion range. They do a
lot of small acquisitions, and I'm delighted to see them repurchasing shares. We own –
let's say we own 250 million or so shares. They have, I think, $4,923,000 million or
something like that (04:41:26).

Bloomberg Transcript

And mentally, you can say we own 5% of it, but I figure, with the passage of a little time,
we may own 6% or 7% simply because they've repurchased shares. And I find that we've
got an extraordinary product in the ecosystem and there's lots to be done. I love the idea
of having our 5% or whatever it may be grow to 6% or 7% without us laying out a dime. I
mean, it's worked for us in many other situations. But you have to have some very, very,
very special product, which has an enormously widespread ecosystem. And the products
are extremely sticky and all of that sort of thing.
And they're not going to find $50 billion or $100 billion acquisitions that they can make it
remotely a sensible price that really become addictive to that. They may find it. Who
knows? But there certainly – as I look around the horizon, I don't see anything that would
make a lot of sense for them in terms of what they'd have to pay and what they would
get. Whereas I do see a business that they know everything about and where they may or
may not be able to buy it at an attractive price when they repurchase their shares. That
remains to be seen. Incidentally, that's one thing that always enjoy people.
People say, well, you're talking your book or something if you talk. From our standpoint,
we would love to see Apple go down in price. They're going to – well, just put at this way.
If Andrew and Charlie and I were partners in a business that was worth $3 million, so each
of us had a $1 million interest in it. If Andrew offered to sell out his one third interest at
$800,000 and we had the money around, we jump at the chance to buy them out. I
mean, it's so simple. But people get a lot and if you want $1.2 million for it, we wouldn't
pay it to him. It's very simple math, but it gets lost in all these discussions. And, of course,
like I say Tim Cook can do simple math and probably do very complicated math too.
So, we very much approve of them repurchasing shares. Charlie.

I think generally speaking in America, when companies go out hell-bent to buy other
companies. They worth less after the transaction is made than they were before. So, I
don't think you have a general way to wealth for American corporations to go out and buy
other corporations. Averaged out, it's a way down, not up, and I think that a great many
places have nothing better to do than to buy on their own stock and nothing is
advantageous to do as like as buying their own stock.
So, I think we know pretty damn well what's going to happen to Apple. Maybe very lucky if
there was something available the whole price they could buy. I don't think the world is
that easy. I think that the reason these companies are buying their stock is that they're
smart enough to know that's better for them than anything else.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

And that does not mean we approve of every buyback at all.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

amoral. But apart from the matter, it's fine.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

Okay, Gregg.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Greggory Warren

{BIO 15185326 <GO>}

Warren, if we look at the performance of your equity investment portfolio over the last
three to five years. Some of the strongest performance has come from Visa and
MasterCard, which put up returns that were three to four times greater than American
Express.
Unfortunately, you're holdings of the two names which we assume were held by Todd or
Ted have accounted for less than 1% of stock holdings on a combine basis in the past five
years While American Express is tending to be a five holding accounting for 10% of the
portfolio and averaging closer to 8% of late.
Given that all three firms benefit from powerful network effects along with valuable
brands, were there any particular reasons Berkshire did not ramp up its stakes in Visa and
MasterCard to meaningful levels especially during those years when American Express
was struggling? After all, you've shown a willingness to own several stocks from the same
industry, holding shares in several competing banks and buying stakes in all four domestic
airlines in fairly equal amounts when you pick them up at late 2016?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. When Ted and Todd or either one of them, I won't get into which specifically – which
one I'm specifically ordered for that matter that could both have bought Visa and
MasterCard. They were significant portions of their portfolio and there was no embargo

or anything on them owning those stocks because we had a big investment on American
Express and I could have bought them as well and looking back I should have. And then I
think American Express has done a fabulous job. And now we own 17% and a large fraction
percent of a company that not that long ago we may have owned 12%. We've done it
without spending a dime and without – it's a company that has really done a fantastic job
in a very competitive field where lots of people would love to take their customers away
from them, but they have more customers than ever, and they're spending more money
than ever, the customers are.
And the international growth has accelerated. The small business penetration. It's really
quite a business. And we love the fact we own it. Like I said it didn't preclude me from it
anyway from buying Master, Charter or Visa, and in fact have been the smartest haven't
thought would have. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, we would have been a lot better in all of our stock picking. And we do it in
retrospect. But at the time, we have a big position in American Express and there is one
tiny cloud on the horizon of the payments processors and that is the system of which we
added China. And so, it isn't as though there isn't a little cloud somewhere (04:48:24).
And I don't have the faintest idea how important that cloud is and I don't think Warren
does even.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

No. No. Payments are a huge deal worldwide and you've got all kinds of smart people
working at various ways to change the payment arrangements.

Q - Greggory Warren

{BIO 15185326 <GO>}

To destroy what we have not?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Sure. Sure. And you've got some very smart people that are building a company. And
American Express made a decision few years ago not to (04:49:02) somebody else did
to retain the Costco business and I think Charlie and I disagree on this, but I think it was a
smart decision
He doesn't think it was a smart decision. But one of us will be right, and one of us will
remind you that they were right.
But, if you look at American Express, it's a remarkable company. They came after with
Sapphire last year. People want that business and payments are changing, and you can
see in different countries different ways things are going on on their end.
And there are a lot of people that will play the game, up-gaming the system and switch
from one to another based on rewards on this card or that and all of the sort of thing.

FINAL

But there also is – I think there's a very substantial group for which American Express does
something very special and they keep capitalizing on that premier position with that group
and they're doing it successfully around the country. And you'll see in the first quarter,
you've seen in the first quarter, we're in Britain and Mexico and Japan you're seeing gains
of 15% or better in local currencies, and the base is not – it's not tiny. It was not huge. So,
there's a lot of room left to go in that and the small business penetration is good.
The loan portfolio has behaved sensationally compared to really just about anybody. So, I
like very much our holdings of American Express. The first half, because of the accounting
changes, they had to suspend their repurchase program for six months, but they've
announced that they expect to renew it and, someday, we'll even – we'll own a greater
percentage of American Express and it will be a bigger company, in my opinion, and I think
we'll do very well.
But as Charlie says, nobody knows how payment, for sure, comes out. And nobody knows
how autos, for sure, come out. That is true of a great many businesses we're in and we've
faced it before. We used to buy things that were certain failures like textiles and secondrate department stores and trading stamps in California. Now we just face things that face
real difficulties, so we're actually moving up the ladder. Okay, station 1.

Mr. Buffett. My name is Daphne Collier Starr (04:51:34). I'm eight years old and live in New
York City. I've been a shareholder for two years, and this is my second Annual
Shareholders' Meeting. Berkshire Hathaway's best investment on which the company built
its reputation have been in very capital-efficient businesses such as Coke, See's Candy
(sic) [See's Candies] (04:52:10), American Express, and GEICO. But recently, Berkshire has
made really big investments in a few businesses that require huge capital investment to
maintain and that offer only a regulated low rate of return such as Burlington Northern
Railroad.
My question to you, Mr. Buffett is, could you please explain why Berkshire's largest recent
investment have been departed from your old capital efficient philosophy? And why
specifically have you invested Burlington Northern instead of buying a capital efficient
company like American Express?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

You're killing me, Daphne (04:53:28).

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yeah. I'm certainly glad she's not 9 years old.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. I'm just sitting here thinking which of the six panelists we're going to bump next year
and put you in. Well, I thought I was doing well when I bought that city service in 2011
(04:53:55). The answer is that we'd love – we always prefer the businesses that earned

FINAL

terrific returns on capital like a See's Candy (sic) [See's Candies] (04:54:10) when we
bought it or a good many of the businesses.
And American Express earns a terrific return on equity and has for a very long time. The
fact that we buy Burlington – BNSF Burlington Northern means that essentially we can get
more money deployed in capital-light businesses at prices that make sense to us. And so,
we have gone into more capital-intensive businesses that are good businesses, but
wouldn't it be wonderful if we could run the railroad without trains and track and tunnels
and bridges and a few things?
We get a decent return on the capital-intensive businesses. We bought most of them at
very decent prices and they've been run very well since we bought them. We still love a
business that takes very little capital and earns high returns, and continues to grow and
requires very little incremental capital.
We can't deploy as much money as we have in doing that. And so, as the second-best
choice, still a good choice, the answer is yes. It's not as good as the best choice.
Charlie?

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yes, I like the aspiration of that young lady. She basically wants her royalty on the other
fellow's sales. And of course that's a very good model, and if everybody could do that,
why, nobody would do anything else. The reason we're satisfied with our utility returns
and our railroad returns is they're quite satisfactory. I wish we had two more just like them.
Don't you, Warren?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

So the answer is they're good enough, and you're asking us to get perfection, if you
wanted us to have all our money in Coke and say, 5% of what it's now is so important.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. And a business like Apple really doesn't take much capital but – so, we've got to
spend a lot of money to buy businesses like that, very few are for sale, and the answer is,
we have not foregone any opportunity to buy businesses that earn high returns, very high
returns on equity capital or when we could buy them at a sensible price to buy these
other businesses. So they haven't shut anything else off the table. But you definitely have
a job in our capital allocation department.
Okay, Carol.

FINAL

This question is from Max Taylor (04:57:14) of Chicago and it concerns the newspapers
that Berkshire owns. In your 2012 letter to shareholders, Mr. Buffett, you had a section
devoted to Berkshire's buying 28 newspapers during the year just passed. Since then you
have not come back to the newspaper subject.
But this year at the end of the annual report, you published a list of the newspapers
Berkshire owns today along with their circulation. I compared that list with the one you
published five years ago at the end of 2012. As you no doubt know better than anyone,
the circulation of the 26 newspapers that Berkshire still owns, of the 28 originally bought,
fell sharply, in many cases by big amounts like 30% to almost 50%.
I know that five years ago you acknowledged the risk in owning newspapers but you still
said Charlie and I believe that papers delivering comprehensive and reliable information
to tightly-bound communities and having a sensible Internet strategy will remain viable for
a long time. Skip to today and imagine that you are writing about Berkshire's experience
with newspapers, what would you be saying?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. I would say that – I forgot the modifying word on Internet strategy, but I guess I said
sensible. The problem has been there are about 1,300 daily newspapers in the United
States, there were 1,700 not that long ago, is that, no one except The Wall Street Journal,
The New York Times, and now probably The Washington Post has come up with a digital
product that really, in any really significant way, will replace the revenue that is being lost
as print newspapers lose both circulation and advertising.
And if you look at the communities in which we operate or the communities in which, you
name it, other newspapers operate, the community could be prospering. We're in a
prosperous economy presently, and all are losing daily circulation, they're losing Sunday
circulation, they're losing street sales, they're losing home delivered. And it is just – I've
been surprised that the rate of decline has not moderated in the last five years.
We bought all the papers at reasonable prices, so it is not of great economic
consequence to Berkshire. But I would like to see, daily newspapers, actually, be
economically viable, because of the importance to society. But I would say that the trends,
which I put those circulation figures in there, because I think the shareholder is entitled to
look, year-to-year, at what is happening.
And it's not only – it's happening to 1,300 newspapers throughout the United States. And
it happens in small towns, where you would think that the alternative sources of
information would not be that good, it happens every place. And The Journal, The Times,
and probably The Post, have a viable economic model in the digital world, and probably
will continue to shrink, I'm almost certain will continue to shrink in the print world.
But the digital world will be big enough that, and they'll be successful enough, so that they
have, in my view, a sustainable business model. But it is very difficult to see, with the lack
Page 111 of 164

Date: 2018-05-05

FINAL

of success, in terms of important dollars arising from digital, it's difficult to see how the
print product survives over time. And I'm afraid that's true of 1,300 papers in this country.
And we'll keep looking to see if there is a way to do it. But you'd have to look at our
experience, and look at the experience of everyone else's.
McClatchy newspapers came out the other day, and I think that newspaper – which is very
good – fine cities that they operate in, and advertising revenue is down something like
17% or 18%, and circulation. But it isn't just them, it's everybody in the business. And I wish I
had a better answer for you, but I don't. I would say that the economic significance to
Berkshire is almost negligible, but the significance to society, I think, actually is enormous.
And I hope that we find something. I hope others find something, because we'll copy it.
But so far, we have not succeeded in that. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, the decline was faster than we thought it was going to be. So it was not our finest bit
of economic prediction. And I think, it's even worse, I think, to the extent we
miscalculated, we may have done it because we both love newspapers, and have
considered them so important in our country. These little local newspaper monopolies
tended to be owned by people who behaved well and tended to control the politicians.
And we're going to miss these newspapers if they disappear. We're going to miss them
terribly. And...

I think you may continue...

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

...I hope to God it doesn't happen, but the figures are not good, Warren.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

No. No, they aren't. And it isn't just – it isn't some town that has a particular problem with
unemployment or anything of the sort. It isn't due to general economic conditions. It's due
to the fact that a newspaper, if you wanted to know the baseball results from the present
day, and the box scores, and everything else, they told you the following morning and it
was still news to you. And the financial material that I read from there, and in terms of
looking at the stock prices and everything, they were news to you the following morning.
And the – what was developing in the Pacific in terms of the war was news to you when
you read about it in the morning in The New York Times. And news is what you don't know
that you want to know. And those Help Wanted ads, segregated as they may have been,
still were the place to go to look to find a job. And you can go up and down the line and
one element after another where the daily print newspaper was primary, they're no
longer primary.
And the business has changed in a very material way, and we haven't been able to figure
out any solutions to that, and we'll keep trying. Like I say, it's not of economic
consequence, but I think it is societal consequence. And we haven't been able to solve it.
Okay, Jonathan?

TTI has been a nice growth story since Berkshire acquired it 11 years ago, more than
doubling its pre-tax earnings to about $400 million due to fine organic growth and at least
two successful bolt-on acquisitions. Business momentum appear to accelerate in the first
quarter. Can you please talk about the competitive landscape in the electronic
components distribution industry and what TTI's advantages are? Is it just a great industry
to be in or is TTI's business model and/or management team special? Do you expect it to
continue to be one of Berkshire's faster growing non-insurance subsidiaries?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

TTI is run by a fellow named Paul Andrews who's done an absolutely sensational job with
us. He's a wonderful man. He's a wonderful manager. And in the last – he's quadrupled
the business, basically, but in the last year, and accelerating right to this point; they
distribute little electronic components. They're a many-billion dollar business, and their
average item is less than a nickel that they sell. So it's kind of like being in the jellybean
business or something like that; except these things go into all kinds of fancy machines
that I don't understand.
And we have a worldwide operation based in the Dallas, Fort Worth area. And built by one
man who left a division of General Dynamics 45 or 50 years ago, and step-by-step built
up this business, like we just bought within the last two months, we bought an operation in
South Korea that will be another substantial addition. We do business worldwide. And
electronic components that have absolutely taken off in the last year, and they use
something called, you know, well, it's essentially a measure of backlog. And book-to-bill is
the ratio they call it. But it's just kind of a special term. I mean, it's just improved
dramatically in the last year. And it continues month-after-month. So something is going on
out there, because nobody buys these things to store them in their basement or anything
of the sort. I mean, these get used, these electronic components.
Some of them are on allocation. We have a great relationship with suppliers. We have a
very good relationship with our customers, because we carry more inventory than most of
our competitors. So particularly, when the business is tight, we can deliver and do a very
first-class job doing it. So I give credit to Paul. And he increased his physical facility, started
on that a few years ago. And it's a godsend that he did it, because with the business
going through there now we wouldn't have been able to handle it.
But it's a competitive business. I mean, if you look at Arrow Electronics, on the New York
Stock Exchange and we've got competitors. I think, Paul is doing a better job, by a
considerable margin, than they are. And I'm delighted as a part of the Berkshire family,
there will be times when that business slows down because their customers, will have
their own cycles. And what it does, it will go down. But over time that business is going to
grow. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yeah, it's a wonderful business because it's so difficult to do that – competitors don't want
try it. When I lived in Omaha there was a man who lived in great prosperity and almost no

work. And his business was gathering up and rendering dead horses, and he never had
any competitors. He used to come up to the Omaha Club and start drinking about 11 in
the morning, it was not a difficult business. But nobody ever crowded him with new
competition.
And very few people want to distribute zillions of electronic parts that are worth a nickel
each, it's very complicated. And of course that business is terribly good at it. And it keeps
getting more and more of the same. So you're right. It's a huge growth business which is
sort of the electronic equivalent of gathering up and rendering dead horses.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Imagine keeping track of close to a million different items, with very small values attached
to them and getting them out to your customer fast because they want them fast, all over
the world, and those things are not easy to manage. I mean...

My question is about the recent decision to sell shares back of Phillips 66. Not to put you
on the hot seat. But right after that, share prices jumped up about $22 a share. You
mentioned at the time that there's some regulatory requirements if you own over 10% of
a company. Could you talk about the factors that go into how you decide whether to
retain more than that or get under that threshold? And then what are your thoughts longterm on Phillips 66, like their business mid-stream refining?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, it was the City Service preferred of last year. We sold the stock at around $93
or $94, and it's probably $115 now. But we own just under 10% of the company. And the
more Ted, and Todd, and I think about various problems connected with regulatory
problems and trading problems and so on, overwhelmingly we will stick below 10% on
marketable security holdings. We've done it with the airlines. Now that does not mean
we're going to reduce our holdings in American Express or anything of the sort.

Bloomberg Transcript

But – and Greg Garland has done a great job at Phillips 66. We've had very good relations
with the company. They're very – he's a very, very, very experienced and sensible
manager. But I did decide that, I wanted to be below 10% in that holding. And like I say,
we'll stay just slightly under 10% of Wells Fargo. We've actually sold a few shares just to
stay below 10% in the case, I think, of both American Airlines and United Continental.
Unless there's something unusual we're going to stay under 10%. We believe we have
nine and a significant fraction percent (05:13:32) of Phillips. And I think they've been good
at operations. I think they've been good at capital allocation.
We traded them stock for a business some years ago, which has been a very nice
business that we've retained in operation. So we've got a lot of money still in Phillips. And I
wish I'd made the deal at a higher price. But we made money on what we sold and we
accomplished an objective. Charlie?

{BIO 16400962 <GO>}

This question comes from Vlad Koptev (05:14:36) in Ukraine. He says, capitalization of
cryptocurrency has approached that of Berkshire and Apple last year. And clearly the idea
behind crypto will affect conventional banking groups where Berkshire is a shareholder.
You always say you didn't go into too much detail to obtain an understanding on
cryptocurrencies. So what factors caused you to say that it's a bubble?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, generally non-productive assets remain not only – if you'd bought gold at the time of
Christ and you figured the compound rate on it, you know, it may be a couple tenths of
1%. It essentially is not going to deliver anything other than supposed scarcity, you know,
because they'll only – you can only mine so many. But so what? I mean, what does it
produce itself ? The check is a wonderful idea. Just imagine how the world would be
without being able to write checks or have wire transfer of funds. But it doesn't make the
check intrinsically itself worth a lot of money. And if you said you can't use something
called check with a little piece of paper you'd do something else to transfer money.
I think that anytime you buy a non-productive asset, you are counting on somebody else
later on to buy a non-productive asset because they think they can sell it to somebody for
more money. And it's been tried with tulips (05:16:15) and it's been tried with various
things over time. And it does come to a bad ending. I mean, having – you have a hard
time. You can think of raw land. I mean, the Louisiana Purchase was, say, $15 million for
800,000 or so square miles of land. In fact, you're sitting on land that came with the
Louisiana Purchase.
And so what'd we pay? We paid $20 a square mile, and 640 acres in a square mile. And
you're down to $0.03 (05:16:49) or something. So that was a pretty good purchase of
what was then a non-productive property. But it's very hard. You can buy stamps. Bill Gross
got, collected a wonderful stamp collection. It sold for more money in the end. But it's
dependent on somebody else wanting to buy, hoping they will sell it for more money and
so on.
And in the end, you make your money on productive assets. If you buy a farm, you try to
estimate what the crops, what amount per acre of soybeans or corn or whatever may be
raised, and how much you have to pay that farmer that farms it for you, and what your
taxes will be, and various things. And you make a conclusion based on what the asset
Page 116 of 164



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2018-05-05

itself will produce over time, and that's an investment. When you buy something because
you're hoping tomorrow morning you're going to wake up, and the price will be higher,
the only reason, you need more people coming into it than are leaving.

FINAL

And you can get that. And it will feed on itself for a while, and sometimes for a long while,
and sometimes to extraordinary numbers. But in the end – but they come to bad endings.
And cryptocurrencies will come to bad endings.
And along with the fact that there's nothing being produced in the way of value from the
asset that you also have the problem that it draws in a lot of charlatans and that sort of
thing who are trying to create various sorts of exchanges or whatever it may be.
It's something where people who are of less than stellar character see an opportunity to
clip people who are trying to get rich because their neighbor's getting rich buying this
stuff that neither one of them understands. It will come to a bad ending. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, I like cryptocurrencies a lot less than you do. And so to me it's just dementia. And I
think, the people who are professional traders that go into trading cryptocurrencies, it's
just disgusting. It's like somebody else is trading turds and you decide, I can't be left out.

To the extent that this – we are being webcast around the world, I hope some of our stuff
doesn't translate very well, actually. Okay, Gary?

Q - Gary Kent Ransom

{BIO 3446828 <GO>}

Yes, I had a question on the corporate tax rate. And we have a debate in my investment
world about where the benefits of that cut fall. And I'd say the consensus is going to the
consumer as it gets competed away over time. But perhaps some of it sticks to
shareholders. And my question is, do you think over the long run, some of the benefits
sticks to shareholders? And maybe it's even beyond auto insurance? Maybe it's other
businesses you have as well?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, what people do generally with that is they take what they want to be the answer for
them and then they hire – or they just attach themselves to some economist that gives
them a more complicated way of saying it's all going to be wonderful because it's
happened.
But the answer is that, in the case of our regulated public utilities, the benefits are all
supposed to go, and will go to the utility customer, because we're entitled to a return on
equity if we perform well. And we're not entitled to get excess returns because our tax
rates changed. And similarly, if the tax rates would go back up, we would expect to get
compensated for that, so in that area – and that was $5 billion or $6 billion for us. But in
that area, absolutely, it goes to the user, the consumer, and it should.
Page 117 of 164



FINAL

Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2018-05-05

Then the question is, with the remainder, does it get competed away or not? And the
answer is sometimes it does, sometimes it gets competed very quickly and substantially.
Sometimes it may be slow. And other times it probably won't. The one thing to know is
that, the change in the corporate tax law was good for shareholders, generally, and
Berkshire shareholders. I mean – and that's what Congress passed. And the intent had to
be that, if you were going to cut taxes that shareholders would get a particularly large
portion this time. And some of you will agree with that politically and some of you won't
agree with it politically. But you'll all benefit equally. And I think it's human nature if you're
getting a break to say it's going to work wonderfully for everybody else. And we'll find out
whether it will or not.
It's very, very, very difficult in economics to measure the impact of single variables. You
cannot just do one thing in economics. People kind of learn that in physics and talk about
butterflies in China and all that sort of thing. But the – every question you get in economics
the next, (05:22:30) any statement, you should say and then what?
And when you get into the, and then what, you get start favoring people who give an
answer to that in political life that happens to usually help you in some way or another,
including your pocketbook. And we've see that with this. And it's helped the shareholders
of Berkshire Hathaway. I would say that some will be competed away. Some (05:22:58)
and some will benefit Berkshire shareholders. Charlie?

Hi, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger. My name is Kevin (05:23:14) and I'm from Shenzhen, China,
currently studying finance and philosophy at Boston College. I have a rather broad
question. In this more and more globalized world, what do you think our younger
generation can do to best leverage our background and experience of both China and
U.S. to create values and for the benefit two countries' economy and relationship? And
what do you see valuable in a person with a multicultural background? Thank you.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, I think in answer to the last question, I think it's terrific to have a multicultural
background. And I never was any good at languages. But if I were in college today, in
either country, I'd be learning the language of the other country, because I think it'd be a
great advantage over time.
The first part of the question, I'd like to have that stated again to me. I want to make sure
I'm answering your specific aspect there on the – I think it's going to be good for your
future. But can we have the microphone on up there again?

to best leverage our background and experience of both China and U.S.?

FINAL

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, I'd start with being multilingual, I mean, certainly, in terms of, I mean, obviously you
want to be able to express yourself in both. And the better you can understand, obviously,
the culture of another society, obviously, that's a benefit.
But I think the market system, modified as it may be, both in China and in the United
States, in a way, it really does. There will be an invisible hand, to some extent, that does
work to improve the lot of future generations by the fact that both China and the United
States, and the rest of the world, is improving. I mean, it is much better, in my view,
particularly in a nuclear world. But it's much better to have people prospering throughout
the world, partly through their own efforts, but partly through their interactions with the
rest of the world.

Bloomberg Transcript

And we've made a lot of progress in that respect particularly since World War II. I mean, it
was a terrific idea to have the Marshall Plan, instead of behaving like we did after World
War I and getting the result that we got. I think we behaved much more intelligently after
World War II. So I'm bullish on the future of United States. But I'm bullish on the future of
China, and to a significant extent, you know, the rest of the world. And people are going
to be living better 10, 20, 50 years from now. And I don't think that's something that can
be stopped even. Charlie? Absent weapons of mass destruction.

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yeah, well, the multicultural stuff, it wouldn't do you much good to be fluent in both
English and Chinese if you were, say, a proctologist in China or a proctologist in Nebraska.
So if you're going to use your multicultural background, you've got to work at some
interface between United States and China. And you can raise money in the United States
and invest it in China like Li Lu does or you can be some kind of an importer or a trade

Q - Andrew Ross Sorkin

{BIO 6340618 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. this question comes from someone who says, I am a Berkshire employee and
shareholder. I read an investigative article from ProPublica and The Washington Post that
many of Berkshire's various units only offer 401(k) plans with high fees that are actively
managed rather than the low-cost indexes you have advocated as the best path for
savings for retirement. The article's author said he contacted the company and nobody
would comment. Will you do something to improve our 401(k) offerings to match your
investment philosophy? And from an operational perspective, how did this happen, given
your strong views on the topic?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, I've absolutely said what – many, many times through Annual Reports and -our
managers know what I think about the attractiveness of having an index fund option. But
they all have different plans, different histories. And they run their businesses. And who
knows, which particular – if you go back to the older businesses, they have defined benefit
pension plans, generally. Nobody puts them in anymore. Then the question is, do you
transition to something else?
In the end, we overwhelmingly thought our managers make those kind of decisions and
others. And my guess is that a very high significant percentage of people who have
worked at a company that has a 401(k) plan will have an index fund option, but they may
not, in some cases. The only thing we – I think we have asked the companies to have a
limit on the percentage, I think, that they might put in Berkshire's stock through the 401(k).
We don't want people to lose jobs who are tied to Berkshire.
We certainly don't want to be in the position of encouraging to put 100% or something of
their savings in Berkshire itself, I don't want to be in that position. But I don't think even
there, we've insisted on any company doing that. I think we've probably made that, when
we've been asked about it once or twice, I think we've given that suggestion.

But the managers will run the companies. The employees, if they feel – and some of our
companies have human relations departments – if they feel that they'd like different
options or something like that, they should make those views known to the managers.
And in some cases the managers, I think, will pay attention to them (05:30:42). We've got
a wide variety of managers that run our businesses. And we're not going to start trying to
run them from Omaha. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, you're right. That has happened, that business of the high-fee choices, because
we've delegated the whole subject to the managers of the subsidiaries. And so no
attention at all is being given to the employee choices at headquarters. And what you're
pointing out is that a lot of the employees in the subsidiaries would do better if they
indexed instead of choosing what they did choose. And my guess is, you're absolutely
right about that.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Greggory Warren

{BIO 15185326 <GO>}

Warren, you've noted time and again that there is a strong common culture shared across
Berkshire subsidiaries built on a commitment to honesty and integrity, a focus on the long-

Page 121 of 164

term, and an emphasis on customer care. And it is also critical to find cultures that mesh
well with Berkshire's when acquiring operating companies.

FINAL

In most cases, the managers that are currently running these subsidiaries are the same
individuals who are members of the families that originally sold their firms to Berkshire,
leaving them with a vested interest in the businesses they are running and a strong
connection to the culture they tend to share in common with Berkshire.
It seems to me that the greater challenge is in ensuring that the large publicly-traded
firms that have been acquired and account for a meaningful and growing amount of
Berkshire's overall value, stay the course. Could you comment on whether or not this is
the case and what the greatest challenge is for you and Charlie when it comes to not only
maintaining Berkshire's culture but in finding firms that would fit in well with what you've
built?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, I think the culture is very, very strong. And I think it gets reinforced – frankly, I think it
gets reinforced by the shareholders we have. I mean, we have a different body of
shareholders and we look at those shareholders, I think, in a somewhat different way than
a good many other companies do.
I mean, I think there are fair number of public companies that wish they didn't have, public
shareholders. We're happy to have public shareholders. And we like having individual
shareholders. And we don't favor institutions. And we're not going to, give guidance and
talk especially to them on investor calls and all that sort of thing. We want our – we want it
to be directly with – we want shareholders who are partners, basically.
And it begins with that, it goes to the directors. We have directors who are not – well, I've
been on 19 boards, and I've never seen another board like ours. And I think it's terrific that
we've got the people who represent, in many cases, lots of shares themselves. They
didn't gets special deals. It's a group of owner-oriented, Berkshire-conscious, businesssavvy owners.
And we don't have anybody on the board because they're a leading, educator or
whatever it may be. We want people who, basically, think about how to run a business well
for themselves and for their partners. And we've got managers who fit into that culture,
who have chosen that culture in coming with us.
And sometimes we have the second or the third or fourth generation, and say, at the
Nebraska Furniture Mart, that share that. Is it perfect? No, it's far from perfect. I mean, you
don't get everybody thinking the same way. We have people – we have people that are
very independently-minded running a lot of businesses. And some of them have, they
have different political beliefs, they have different – they see through different lenses than
we do, to some degree.

But in terms of having a common, strong, positive culture, I don't think there's any big
public company that has it any better than Berkshire. And I think that will continue because
people opt into it to a great deal. Cultures get passed along. You do things that are
consistent with the culture, so you do – what you talk about is what you do. And you don't
find people saying, you know, we're a wonderful partnership, and then voting themselves,
huge options. And then a whole bunch of other people will say options beneath them
because they can't look like they're taking it all for themselves, and arranging – I read
about some deal where it could pay off with many, many, many billions of dollars, the
other day. We won't name names.
But we've got as good a culture as you can get. And I would say, net, it grows stronger.
We have a few people all of the time that really don't buy into it entirely. I mean, it is not
100%. But it's as close to it. And I think it gets closer all the time as we go along. And we
will try to keep behaving in a way that reinforces it and doesn't dilute it. And I think that will
not only work for Charlie and me, but it will work for our successors very well. It won't be
perfect. Charlie?

Every time I come to one of these meetings and sit in the manager's luncheon, I feel
more strongly at the end of the luncheon that the culture and values of Berkshire
Hathaway will go on and on for a long time after the present management is gone.
In fact, I think, it will go on after go on after all of the present managers are gone. I think
we've started something here that will work well enough that it will last. And one of the
reasons it will last is, it's not that damned easy to duplicate. So the one that is present is
likely to just keep going and going. Think of how little direct copying of the Berkshire

Q - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

My name is Christian Marx (05:37:54). I'm a proud shareholder from Cologne, Germany. It
is my pleasure to be here. My question relates to the Berkshire insurance operations.
When I look at the quarterly balance sheets of the last two decades, I noticed a pattern
that I kindly ask you to discuss.
The sum of cash plus fixed income always hovers around 100% of the amount of
insurance float. Therefore, my question is, is it fair to say that from the $128 billion of
consolidated cash plus fixed income as of March $116 billion are actually needed to
support the insurance operations?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

No, I appreciate...

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The answer is no. Yes.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

The answer is no. But the – it deserves an explanation of how this – maybe I haven't
looked at it the way he's looked at it. We would much rather have a number closer to $20
billion than to have $116 billion. And we do not correlate or, in effect, measure the float
and then decide how much to put or leave in cash, in fixed income.
The fact, our float keeps growing. And lately, our (05:39:26) which is by design and has
been terrific for us, and our cash and cash equivalents has grown because the
competition for acquisitions has become much stronger as – both as money has piled up
with the buyers of businesses, and because debt has been so cheap and a variety of
factors. But I don't think those are necessarily permanent. In fact, it'd be reasonably true
they aren't permanent. It's just a question of when they change. We are not tying, as
Charlie said, we're not tying the cash and cash equivalents at all to float.
The float has surprised me – float went up $2 billion in the first quarter. And there is no
way that that that float can shrink a lot in any short period. It just structurally has been set
up in such a way that it will not – it cannot shrink. And actually, I think it'll grow a little bit for
a while.
I mean, I've always been amazed by how much it has grown. We've got so much more
float than any property causality company in the world. And it's pretty amazing that it all

was near the tennis courts. Okay, Carol. Oh, Charlie.

FINAL

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

There are encouraging recent developments. Some of the cash has gone out recently for
securities we vastly prefer over the cash. And we have a lot of cash remaining that could
be deployed in securities we might like a lot better than Treasury notes. So stay tuned.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah, to make it very simple, in the first quarter we earned five and – from operations we
earned a little over $5 billion. Now, we only spend about our depreciation. Normally, we
would spend somewhat more than that. But that's 5-and-a-fraction billion (05:41:35), $2
billion came in net from float. So that's $7 billion that – basically in the first quarter that
would have been added to our cash if we hadn't done something with it.
And instead our cash and equivalents went down, because we, net, invested more in
equities by some margin than the $7 billion (05:41:59) that came in. But we do have this
position where, even absent a change in float, about $400 million comes into Berkshire
every week, which is very comfortable. And we want to get it so that more than $400
million is going out into productive assets. And we succeeded in doing that in the first
quarter. And net, net we improved our position in the first quarter. Carol?

Q - Carol Loomis

{BIO 7137249 <GO>}

In your 1999 article in Fortune magazine, you stated your belief that after-tax corporate
profits were unlikely to hold much above 6% for any sustained period, due not only to
competition but also to public policy. You stated in the article, if corporate investors, in
aggregate, are going to eat an ever-growing portion of the economic pie, some other
group will have to settle for a smaller portion. That would justifiably raise political
problems.
Since 2008, after-tax corporate profits have been 8% to 10% of GDP. Do you believe that
is a permanent shift in the U.S. economy? And of course, we have to think about the latest
tax bill. Or will corporate profits revert back to the 4% to 6% of GDP range that was
normal in the 20th century?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, it's been an interesting development during that period. It goes back a little bit
before that period. But you now have the four largest companies, by market value in the
United States, a $30 trillion market; you have four companies that essentially don't need
any net tangible assets. And if you go back many years, I mean, if you looked to the
largest companies, Carol used to put out the Fortune 500 list. And you know, it would be
AT&T and General Motors, and it was companies that – Exxon Mobil – it was companies
that just required lots of capital in order to produce earnings.

FINAL

So American industry has gotten incredibly more profitable, in aggregate, in the last 20 or
30 years. You look at the return on the S&P 500, the earnings as a percent of net tangible
assets, and the rest is just, if you buy a company that has $1 million worth of net worth and
you pay $1 billion for it, it still only had the $1 million of net worth. I mean, you just paid
more for it. So the basic profitability of the company is huge, even though your investment
may be at a significantly higher price.
So that what has happened is that, I think, if you look at the earnings on tangible net worth
of the S&P 500 and compare it to 20 years ago, it is amazing. And that is really due to the
fact that, this has become somewhat, you could call it an asset-light economy.
And those four companies that earn 10% of the – they comprise close to 10% of the
market value of the entire publicly-traded corporate America, they don't – and they don't
take any money, basically. And that is a changing world. And they will earn even more
money with the tax rate going down. And I don't think people have quite processed all
that information in terms of what has gone on in the market.

Bloomberg Transcript

You don't – Carnegie built a steel mill, and then he paid it off, or he borrowed a little
money, and then he built another steel mill, and all of that sort of thing. But it was
enormously capital-intensive. And one industry after another, AT&T was enormously
capital-intensive. And now the money is in the asset-light – I mean, huge money is in the –
not only asset-light business, but the negative asset.
IBM even, it has no tangible, it has net, minus tangible net worth. There's nothing wrong
with that. It's a terrific – but it is not the world we lived in 30 years ago. And in that sense, I
didn't see that coming in 1999 when I wrote whatever I wrote there. It hasn't changed the
profitability of the asset-heavy companies particularly. I mean, it isn't like oil.
If you take the five most capital-intensive industries in the 1990s, I don't think you'll find
that their earnings on tangible assets have increased a lot. But you will find that this group
has moved in that really doesn't – they don't need any net tangible assets at all, or they
need very minor amounts. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

There's also a lot of financial engineering that's raised leverage, even in the capitalintensive businesses. And while Warren may have predicted a little wrong when he wrote
that very scholarly article, he didn't invest wrong. And so it just shows that it's hard to
make these economic predictions.

Q - Jonathan Lawrence Brandt

{BIO 17988091 <GO>}

Berkshire received a $10.2 billion retroactive premium from AIG early last year. If the
upwardly revised estimate of $18.2 billion of ultimate claims proves to be correct, will the
cost of float, adjusted for favorable tax attributes, likely be lower or higher than what
Berkshire would have paid to borrow $10 billion for a similar duration?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, we certainly go in with the idea that it will be – the cost will be lower. And it's an
interesting situation. Essentially, AIG, which is one of the largest property-casualty,
particularly commercial property-casualty companies in the world, said, we want to give
you all of the losses that we incurred in a very big percentage of our domestic business
before December 31 of 2015, and we will pay the first $25 billion. And then after we pay
$25 billion, and AIG pays $25 billion, then you pay 80% of the next $25 billion. And they
gave us $10 billion for doing that.
And that's – if we are correct about our estimates of how much money will be paid, and
when it will be paid, we should come out being better off than if we had borrowed a
similar amount. We have a history of doing 10 or so – maybe 12 big deals like that, we hold
the record. We did it for Lloyd's of London 10 or more years ago, and we did it now with
AIG. And sometimes we've been on the low side in our estimate, and sometimes we've
been on the high side so far.
AIG just said that they – I think they paid $15 billion and a fraction on these pre 12/31/2015
losses. They paid $15 billion or a fraction, but the payment tend to trickle down over years
as you get further away from, when the losses occurred. So I would say that we still feel
okay about it, and we'll be wrong one way or the other. Everybody is when you estimate
losses that may not get settled for 20 years or 30 years. But so far on the group as a
whole of these deals we've done, we've been okay. And I think on the AIG thing, we think
we'll be okay, and I think AIG things we'll be okay. I mean, they entered into it for good
reasons of their own. So it looks okay. Sorry to get in this technical stuff, but Jonathan
always ask me questions like that. So I have to be ready to – I want to answer them. Okay.

Hi, Warren. Hi, Charlie.

Q - Adam Brett Bergman

{BIO 1947327 <GO>}

Our question for you is how you go about attempting to forecast the degree of future
success of one specific product in a good business versus another such that you invest in
American Express and Coca-Cola rather than Diners Club or RC Cola, for example?
Thanks.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, with American Express this was an interesting situation because Diners Club got
there first. I think American Express in a certain sense, I mean, they did it for a lot of
reasons, but they went into the credit card business because they were worried about
what was going to happen to traveler's checks and although traveler's checks still exist in
a significant way. But the interesting thing when American Express went into competition
with Diners Club and with Carte Blanche, as I remember, that was also existed at the time,
was that instead of charging less than Diners Club and going in figuring they were going
against the established guy and they'd come in at a lower price, they went in at higher
prices I remember. And the American Express Centurion was on that card. I've got one
that I got in 1964, but they were in that before that, it had more value in time. I mean, it
got better representation.
And frankly, if you were a sales person out with somebody, and you could pull out that
American Express card with Centurion, you look like you're with JPMorgan. If you pull out a
Diners Club, it had a whole bunch of flashy signals, you look like a guy that was cutting his
checks from one month to the next and – (05:53:18) Ralph Schneider and Al Bloomingdale
developed the Diners Club, and they were very smart about getting their first, but they
weren't smart about how they merchandise it subsequently. RC Cola, there are all kinds of
colas that came after Coke. I mean, you go back to 1886 and come up with something like
Jacob's Pharmacy that's incredibly successful. Fairly soon, you're going to get lots of
imitators. But Coke really is the real thing. And you offer me RC Cola, and say I'll give it to
you at half the price of Coca-Cola in terms of drinking, and I mean this is a product that's
6.5 ounces sold for $0.05 in 1900, and now if you buy it on the weekend in by and large
quantity and everything you're not paying that much more. This newspaper was $0.03 in
1942. The amount of enjoyment per real, in terms of the real of what you pay for this has
gone dramatically down in inflation adjusted money.
So it is a bargain product. You have to look at See's Candy (sic) [See's Candies]
(05:54:44) if you live in California and you were a teenage boy, and you went to your
girlfriend's house and you get a box of candy to her or to her mother or father and she
kissed you, you lose price sensitivity at that point. So we really want products where
people will feel like kissing you rather than slapping you. It's an interesting thing. I mean in
order to effect we're betting on the ecosystem of Apple products but led by the iPhone.

And I see characteristics in that that make me think that it's extraordinary. But I may be
wrong. And so far, I would say we've been right on American Express and Coca-Cola.
American Express had this huge salad oil scandal in 1960, happened in 1963 in November,
right around the time Kennedy was shot. And that was really worry about whether the
company will survive, but nobody quit using the card, nobody quit using the traveler's
checks, and they charged a premium price for the traveler's check. So there are things
you can see around consumer products that sometime can give you a pretty good insight
into the future, and sometimes we make mistakes. Charlie?

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

We want to see a lot of – and we're talking about a consumer product. We want to see
how a consumer product behaves under a lot of different circumstances. And then we
want to use something – actually, there was a book by Phil Fischer written around 1960
called Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits. It's one of the great books on investing,
and it talks about the Scuttlebutt Method of investing which was quite a ways from what
Ben Graham taught me in terms of figures, but it's a very, very good book. And you can
learn a lot just by going out and using some shoe leather.
Now, they call them channel checks now or something like that. You can get a feel for
some products and then there are others you can't, and then sometimes you're wrong.
But it is a good technique. It's an important investing technique I would say that. And Ted
and Todd do a lot of that and they have some people to help them out on doing it too.
Charlie's done it with Costco. I mean, he's – I mean, all the time he is finding new virtues in
Costco and he's right incidentally. I mean, Costco has an enormous appeal to its
constituents, they surprise and delight their customers and there is nothing like that in
business, you have delighted customers, you're a long way home. Okay. Becki.

This comes from [ph.] John Haggerty (05:58:26), Brightstar Capital Partners who writes,
Warren you're stepping down from the Kraft Heinz board at a time when the company is
looking to do a large acquisition, Unilever for example. Do you fundamentally disagree
with a combative nature of hostile bids, activist investing and competitive proxy contest?

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, we will not make Costco offenders ourselves. I do not believe that there's anything
fundamentally wrong with the idea. I mean, if you take the Fortune 500 Companies, I'm
sure that all 500 are not managed by the best or in some cases even the friendliest
investor and managements in the world. So I don't think it's evil or anything to conduct a
hostile offer for a company it's just we won't do it, and we don't want to get into that. We
like being liked by the managements that we joined because we're counting on them to
run the company, and we're not bringing in a whole bunch of people that know how to
change businesses. We seldom take a position opposite to management, very seldom on
anything involving a proxy but contest of sorts. But we don't rule it out.

Bloomberg Transcript

We don't think every management is entitled to be that they don't have a lifetime hold on
their business, but it's not our style at all to, well, we won't do it in terms of initiating it
ourselves, and we'd be very, very, very unlikely to support the contest. But we have voted
against a couple of propositions over 50 years that managements have had made in
relation to stock options we withheld a vote at Coca-Cola a few years ago to express our
opinion. But we don't think its evil for the shareholders. In some cases they have different
opinions about who should run the company or whether compensation is appropriate or
are matters of that sort. The stockholder still own the company. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

I've got nothing to add to that. I don't envy these people other than these unfriendly
uppers all the time. Imagine doing that after you're already rich. It's insane.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. We are definitely not looking for it but there are certainly companies that deserve
challenge, and they propose things that deserve challenge occasionally. But again, it's not
our main activity. And the question was asked in reference to Kraft Heinz. The people at
3G are great, great managers. They've been wonderful partners. I have made a
determination before we got involved where I was going to be no more public boards.
I've been on 19 of them and it takes a lot of time. And they ask me if I'd go on for a while,
and I did. But it really is like seven-and-a-half days or something. And if you're on a bank
board, it may be quite a bit more than that.
I mean, they're just – they on a public board and usually means quarterly meetings, plus
maybe an extra one. And at 87, I think I've now learned what happens, and it's fine, but I
don't want to spend seven-and-a-half days a year when maybe I can call up people that I
trust and admire or who are on the board in five minutes, find out what's going on or
whatever it may be, any questions that come up. And so we are their partners and
delighted to be their partners. And now, we have two people on the board of Kraft Heinz,

A - Charles Thomas Munger

Boy that goes way back. But basically, it hasn't happened. I don't envy people who float
around with a lot of different board meetings.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

No, generally speaking, you have very little influence and spend a lot of time. And the
trouble is, if you're going to a board meeting, particularly to get to the international, I
mean sometimes they feel they have to have one international. They feel they have to
take up a fair amount of your time or it wouldn't have been worth coming thousands of
miles for. So you get a lot of the show-and-tell stuff that I find my mind drifting. Okay.
Gary?

Q - Gary Kent Ransom

{BIO 3446828 <GO>}

Yes. You've said that you are looking for non-insurance large acquisitions to put that cash
to work, and when you've said that I've usually thought of the United States because
you're a big fan of the U.S. business. And I just was wondering whether you're seeing
more opportunities as the rest of the world opens up, grows, whether there's
opportunities for some of those mega transactions in other parts of the world, say, Asia
or Europe.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Gary, I would say that I've been disappointed in that because we do see some
outside the United States, and thank heavens, we saw the one we saw in Israel some
years ago when (06:04:47) wrote me a letter. But we bought a business which is a very
important part of Berkshire now. But we are still not – they're certainly aware of Berkshire
Hathaway outside the United States but they don't sort of pick up the phone

automatically. In the United States, I think any large, particularly private company that is
thinking about doing something, they at least think about Berkshire.
But that in Europe or Asia that we are not embedded in the minds the same way. They
know about us, they know we got a lot of money and they know we like to buy things, but
we are really – we're on the radar screen big time in the United States, and we're not as –
we don't – immediate desire to be sure that they thought about Berkshire option does
not occur the same way outside the United States. And we've tried to encourage a few
ways, but I would say that the results have not been a greater law. But I hope tomorrow I
get a call from Germany or Britain or Italy or you name it, and Australia, wherever it may
be, and I hope I get a call and we get an opportunity to do it. There's a good many
countries we'd be quite happy to put substantial money into it, and like I say, our
experience in Israel has been just terrific. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yeah. But the corporate acquisition came now, it's so driven by the leverage buyout and
the so-called – what do we really call them – strategic. Yes, strategic. I usually translate that
into barnyard language. And there's so much craziness in price from our viewpoint, of
course, it's very hard for us to do it. The people in the leverage buyout gain who love
massive leverage and don't mind high prices, even they are getting those leads. It's hard,
and it's not an environment that means that it allows Berkshire just to go out and buy
whole lot of companies. We have to wait.

today, does it still just fall back to chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor, and what do you
think of programs and designations such as CFA, CFP, et cetera, which purport high
standards yet rooted heavily into academia? And I'd like to challenge you to a round of
bridge tomorrow.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Business schools and all that.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

New business schools and all that.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

I didn't catch the last one. Oh, he challenged me to a round of bridge. Okay. I went to
three business schools, and at each I found a teacher or two. I went to one specifically
that got – given each, but each one I might found a teacher or two that I really got a lot
out of. So we're not in a business school there at all. We do think that the priesthood, say
30 years ago, for example, or 40 years ago in terms of efficient market there anyway,
they strayed pretty far in our view from the reality of investing. And I would rather have a
person if I could hire somebody among the top five graduates of number one, two or
three of the business schools. And my choice was somebody that was bright. But had
Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor absolutely it just was natural to them. They had it in
their bones basically. I take the person from Chapter 8. This is not – what we do is not a
complicated business. It's got to be a disciplined business, but it does not require a super
IQ or anything of the sort, and there are a few fundamentals that are incredibly important.
And you do have to understand accounting. And it helps to get out and talk to consumers
and start thinking like a consumer in many ways and certainly and all of that. But it just
doesn't require advanced learning.
And I certainly – I didn't want to go to a college, so I don't know whether I would have
done better or worse if I'd just quit after high school, and read the books I read and all of
that. I think that if you run into a few great teachers, and they really change the way you
see the world to some degree, you're lucky and you can find them in academia and you
can find them in ordinary life. And I'm extraordinarily lucky and having great teachers
including Charlie. I mean Charlie been a wonderful teacher. And any place you can find
somebody that gives you insights into things you didn't understand before maybe makes
you a better person than you would have been before, that's very lucky and you want to
make the most of it if you can find it in academia and make the most of it, and if you can
find it in the rest of your life make the most of it. Charlie?

Well, when you found Ben Graham he was unconventional and he was very smart, and of
course that was very attractive to you. I know when you found out at work that you could
make a lot of money while sitting on your ass, of course you are an instant convert. And
so...

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

It still appeals to me actually I mean.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

But the world changed before he died, Ben Graham. I mean Ben Graham recognized that
the exact way he sought undervalued companies wouldn't necessarily work for all times
under all conditions. And that's certainly the way it worked for us. We gradually morphed
into trying to buy the better companies when they were underpriced instead of the lousy
companies when they were underpriced. And of course that worked pretty well for us,
and Ben Graham, he outlived the game that he played personally most of the time. He
lived to see most of it fade away. And just to find some company that's selling for onethird of its working capital and figure out it could easily be liquidated and distribute $3 for
every $1 of market price. Lots of luck if you can find those in the present markets. And if
you can't find them as so small that Berkshire wouldn't find of any use anyway. So we've
had to learn a different game, and that's a lesson for all the young people in the room. If
you're going to live a long time you have to keep learning what you've formerly knew is
never enough. So if you don't learn to constantly revise your earlier conclusions and get
better ones way you are – I always use the same metaphor, you're like a one-legged man
in an ass-kicking contest.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

If anybody has suggestions for another metaphor, send them to me. Very incidentally, one
point, an important point. Graham was not scalable. I mean, you could not do with really
big money. And when I worked for Graham-Newman Corp. Harry was the dean of all
analysts and he was an intellect above all others around that time. But the investment
fund was $6 million and the partnership that worked in tandem with the investment
company also had about $6 million in it. So we had $12 million we were working with.
Now, you're going to make adjustments for inflation and everything, but it was just a tiny
amount. It wasn't really scalable. And the truth is, Graham didn't care because he really
wasn't interested in making a lot of money for himself. So he had no reason to want to
find something that could go on and on become larger and larger. And so the utility of
Chapter 8 in terms of looking at stocks as a business is of enormous value. (06:15:0306:15:29). The utility of Chapter 20 about a margin of safety is of enormous value. But
that's not complicated stuff.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

I finally figured out why the teachers of corporate finance often teach a lot of stuff that's
wrong. When I had some eye troubles very early in life, I consulted a very famous eye
doctor. And I realized that his place of business was doing a totally obsolete cataract

operation. They were still cutting a little knife after better procedures, and I said why are
you in a great medical school performing absolute obsolete operations. And he said,
Charlie, it's such a wonderful operation to teach. Well, that happens in corporate finance,
they get these formulas and it's a fine teaching experience. You give them a formula. You
present a problem. They use the formula. You get a real feeling of worthwhile activity.
There's only one trouble, it's all boulder dash.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Whenever you hear a theory described as elegant, watch out. Okay. Andrew
(06:16:47).

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

This question, we got a couple like this one. It comes from Lauren Taylor Wolfe, Managing
Partner at Impactive Capital. Warren, you've recently said that one of the things that
makes you optimistic about America is women entering the work force and the "doubling"
of the talent that's effectively employed in that workforce. When it comes to positions and
leadership, however, women make up less than 21% of boards of S&P 500 companies,
and even smaller 5% of the CEOs. What can Berkshire do and what is Berkshire
specifically doing as a major investor in many of these large companies to advance
gender equality both at the board level and amongst senior leadership?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, again, as I've pointed out in the past, one of my sisters is here, and I have two
sisters that are absolutely as smart as I am and they have better personalities as anybody
that knows both of us or all of us can attest. And they remotely have the same
opportunities I had. I had this 1942 New York Times, and women could be nurses or
teachers or retail clerks or sonographers, and that actually worked enormously to my
advantage when I was a kid and I'm on the 30s because I had way better teachers
because that was a job open to women. I didn't have a single male teacher in grammar
school. And Charlie didn't when he went to Dundee, I don't think either. And we had this
huge talent pool that was being funneled into very few opportunities, and therefore, we
got better than we deserved in terms of our market system producing it.
Again, our managers run their companies, but I've probably named – before we made this
management change, I probably named only six or seven CEOs in the last five or six
years. We don't change that much, but I would say that half of them that I've named had
been women which is about what should turn out to be the case in terms of ability. Now,
there is a certain pipeline problem but that it's cured with time and you can't use that
forever as an excuse. And I feel very good about the decisions we've made for CEOs. I
prefer all our CEOs to live forever, and one woman almost did that that we hired, Mrs. B,
lived to be 104, she retired at 103.
And that's a lesson to our other managers that if you retire prematurely, no telling what
will happen. But it is absolutely true. It does make me bullish. It makes me bullish on the
human race. But it's certainly our country because if you look at what happened before
the 19th Amendment and then after the 19th Amendment for a long time and continuing

to this day. But there's been significant improvement. I do feel more optimistic about the
future because I think there will be more selection by merit rather than by gender or by
race or by inheritance. I think that if you had a system where all businesses got passed on
to the eldest son or something, I think that society would make a lot less progress than
the one that's merit-based. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, we did live in a different age. There's an old saying that the past is a very strange
country. The people behave quite differently there. And it was just totally different. And it
was ridiculous that I cannot remember. I had one or two male teachers in my high school,
but almost none, and the world has really changed. And within Berkshire, I've never seen
any over-discrimination anywhere on the grounds of gender.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

There probably has been some, though.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

Q - Greggory Warren

{BIO 15185326 <GO>}

Warren, in this year's annual report it was noted much as it is every year that payments or
dividends by the company's insurance subsidiaries are restricted by uncertain statutes and
other regulations with Berkshire's Insurance operations currently allowed to declare up to
$16 billion as ordinary dividends during 2018. My question here is, should we view this
annual regulatory threshold for dividends as a benchmark for allowable share repurchase
as well, and in the event that Berkshire wanted to buy back more stock from that or pay
out even more as dividends, would there be an issue with you using capital from
operations that aren't held by the insurance operations to return additional capital with a
side question here being with the annual cash distribution from BNSF which is held on
national indemnities books be excluded?

Yes. We will obviously follow the rules of the states in which we're domiciled and all the
rules of course, but basically it's the state of domestication in the insurance companies.
And they do restrict the amount of dividends in any given year, although you could if you
wanted to request some additional amount. But we don't ever consider that. But if
repurchases were really attractive, we would do it in a very big way. And I wouldn't rule –
there's all kinds of ways that we could arrange things to do either a very large acquisition,
which is what I would (06:23:31) a very large repurchase, which I don't think is probably in
the cards just because the way our stock trades, not because we wouldn't like it at a large
discount.
So Charlie and I, we've got the appetite and we would have – we've got a lot of cash, but
we could have a lot more cash. We can make any deal of even one of a very large size.
We could make anything that came along. We could work on how to get it done. We
would have – we're not going to be doing this, but we would have partners who would
come in and give us a preferential part of a partnership. That's not going to happen at all
probably. But there's a lot of things that we could do. So don't rule out anything based on
statutory limitations of distributions from insurance companies.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

And that we could get special promotions fee. You got bigger dividends? We are not –
you should not assume we're constrained by the laws of nature to the amount that we
can take out under the statute. No.

(06:24:58), Investment Manager in Shanghai. I've been here for eight years. If the
investment is a sport in the Olympics, you are our champion team. So my question is,
facing the fast-growing machine intelligence, how would you see the new competition
impact the capital allocation productivity in the future? For Charlie, what is the first
principle of capital allocation from a general economic interest point of view? Thank you.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, two questions, machine intelligence. I'm afraid the only intelligence I have is being
provided by something that's not a machine. And I don't think I'm going to learn machine
intelligence. If you ask me, how to beat the game of Go with my own intelligence, I
couldn't do it. And I think it's too old for me to learn computer science. Generally, I think
that the machine intelligence has worked. After all, the machine now can be the best
human player of Go, but I think there's more hype in that field than there is probable an
achievement. So I don't think the world is going to be changed that much by machine
intelligence, some but not hugely. And what was the other question? Well, one was
machine intelligence.

FINAL

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, that's such a general question. Generally speaking, we're always trying to get
the best to get something that's worth buying. And the human mind rejects that if you're
in academia because you can come in and make one declaratory sentence at the opening
of the semester, you're going to do for the rest of your time. So people want to find
some formula. It's what I call physics envy. These people want the world to be like physics.
But the world isn't like physics outside of physics. And that false precision just does
nothing that get you in trouble. So I would say you got to master the general ideas, and
you've got to work to improve your judgment slowly, the way all the rest of us had. And I
don't think most individuals have much hope of individual gain from machine intelligence.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

No, I don't think that – I'm impressed what machines be it Go or something of this order,
or even when the chess or whatever it may be. I don't really think they bring much to the

Dear Mr. Buffett and then Mr. Munger, thank you very much for hosting the meeting. It's
truly being remarkable. Thank you. My name is Yen (06:28:33) and I'm Partner at Tiger
Brokers, a leading electronic brokerage firm from China. Let me rephrase that. So I and
my colleagues flew half away from the globe with IT and (06:28:52) to be here, and it's an
honor, just like everyone else in the stadium, we're honored to be here. My question is,
you mentioned earlier that investors don't really have to be struggling in picking the right
stocks. They would do well in picking probably the right market and the right country.
China is the second largest economy and probably has the biggest growth potential. Just
by passively rating a portfolio by passively evaluating a portfolio, U.S. investors are
significantly underweight in China. So in your opinion, what are stopping the investors from
investing in China? Thank you.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Oh, I think the answer is that you're absolutely right that we are – American investors are
missing China, and they're missing it because it's a long way away. It looks different.
They're not used to it. It's complicated. The headlines confuse them. In other words, it just

Page 138 of 164

looks too hard, (06:30:01) to outsmart the Chinese market. But I think you're absolutely
right, it's where they should be looking.

FINAL

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Okay. We had a couple of investments in China. We've done pretty well, but there were –
well, if you go back a number of years, one of the (06:30:28) in terms of getting a lot of
money into something, many billions, and we have to get billions into things and to move
any kind of a needle, that can be tougher in markets that you've got – you're unfamiliar
working in, and it's difficult under any circumstances. But accumulating a $6 billion or $8
billion or $10 billion position in investments outside the United States can be very difficult.
For example, in UK and much of Europe, we have to report when we own 3% of a
company.
In fact, we can be asked to report if we even have less than 3%. That really gets very
tough when we get a bunch of followers and a lot of publicity that probably isn't deserved
in terms of what we're doing in the markets and everything. So some of the problems are
just by the nature of our size. It'd be a lot easier for running. It's more refined. PetroChina,
we managed to get a very big position, but the government owned 90% of it. So we
bought 14% of what the government didn't know, but it was only 1.4% of the company. But
Charlie actually keeps pushing me to do more in China and we've tried a couple of times
actually, and that was one operation that we got involved in.

Apple, but all the tech stocks like Amazon and Google because you've avoided them, you
stated in the past because they're complicated. You should stick with something you
understand. On the other hand, Amazon and Google have what you call a very durable
competitive advantage. They really hardly have any competitor. And that's true in China,
too, of Alibaba and Tencent. So it seems like it's a conflict, and I'm wondering if you're
going to be turning the corner and going into these tech companies that seem to have no
serious competition.

Well, we certainly look at them. We don't think it whether we should be in tech companies
or not or that sort of thing. We are looking for things where we do get into the durability
of the competitive advantage, and whether we think that our opinion might be better than
other people's opinion in assessing the probability of the durability, so to speak. But the
truth is that I watched Amazon from the start, and I think what Jeff Bezos has done is
something close to AmeriCall and promise of I think something will be AmeriCall I tend
not to bet on it. It would have been better – a far better obviously if I had some insights
into certain businesses, but that built only early on, Bill Gates only early on, that I think I
was on destiny suggested I turn to Google, but the troubles I saw the Google was
skipping past all of this, and I wonder if anybody could skip past Google.

Bloomberg Transcript

And I saw at GEICO that we were paying a lot of money for something that cost them
nothing incrementally. We've looked at it. I made a mistake in not being able to come to a
conclusion where I really felt that at the present prices that the prospects were far better
than the prices indicated. And I didn't go into Apple because it was a tech stock in the
least. I mean, I went at Apple because I made certain conclusions about both the
intelligence with the capital, with the employee, but more important, about the value of
an ecosystem and how permanent that ecosystem could be and what the threats were to
it and a whole bunch of things. And I don't think that required me to take a part on iPhone
or something and figure out what all the components were. I think it's much more the
nature of consumer behavior and some things strike me as having a lot more problems
than others.
But the answer is we'll miss a lot of things that, or almost a lot of things that I don't feel I
understand well enough, and there is no penalty in investing if you don't swing at a ball
that's in the strike zone. As long as you swing at something at some point, then eventually
you find the pitch that you should like, and that's the way we'll continue to do it. We'll try
to stay within our circle of competence. And Charlie and I generally agree on sort of
where that circle ends, and what kind of situations where we might have some kind of an
edge in our reasoning or experience or something that what we might evaluate
something differently than other people. But the answer is, we're going to miss a lot of
things. Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yeah. We have a wonderful system. If one of us is stupid in some area, so is the other.
And of course, we were not ideally located to be high-tech wizards. How many people of
our age quickly mastered Google? I've been to Google headquarters. They looked at me
like they're – it looks like a kindergarten.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

A very rich kindergarten. It's extraordinarily impressive what they've done. And like I say at
the ICO, we were paying them a lot of money at the time they went public. And all three
of them, the main characters, Eric and Larry and Sergey, actually came and saw me, but
they were more interested in talking about going public and the mechanics of it and
various things along that line. But it wasn't like what they were doing was a mystery to me.
The mystery was how much competition would come along and how effective they would
be, and whether it would be a game where four or five people were slugging it out

without making as much money as they could have one company dominate. Those are
tough decisions to make. You're going to have industries where there's only two people
in it and they'd still be very good because they beat each other's brains out.
And that's one of the questions in the airline business. It's a better business now than it
used to be. It used to be suicide. And you know that the competitive factors are
extraordinary in airlines and how much better business it is with four people operating at
85% capacity than it was with seven or eight operating it in the mid-70%s and with more
planes around. Those are tough decisions. But I made the wrong decision on Google and
Amazon, I really consider that a miracle that you could be doing Amazon Web Services
and changing retail at the same time without enormous amounts of capital and do it with
the speed and effectiveness of what Amazon has done. I underestimated. I had a very,
very, very high opinion of Jeff's ability when I first met him and I underestimated him.
Charlie?

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, my comment would be that shareholders have one thing to be thankful for. Some of
the age-related stupidity at headquarters has been ameliorated by Ted and Todd joining
us. We are looking at the world with the aid of some younger eyes now and they've had a
contribution significantly beyond their own investments. And so, you're very lucky to have
them as your shareholders, because there's a lot of ignorance in the older generation
that needs removal.

FINAL

Hi, Warren, Charlie. My name is Adam Mead, Mead Capital Management from Derry, New
Hampshire. In the past, you have touched on certain compensation arrangements with key
executives. Could you please provide some specific examples of compensation
arrangements within Berkshire that speak to incentivizing good behavior while not
penalizing the manager for size or the relative ease or difficulty of the business or
industry? Thank you.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, that is a very, very good question and a very, very tough question, because some of
our...

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

He really doesn't want to answer.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, some of our managers – no. Some of our managers are in businesses that are just
much easier. I mean, we bought in a variety of businesses. People are obviously influenced
by what pay arrangements are elsewhere, and it wouldn't be human if they weren't.
And trying to come to the right answer when you have different degrees of capital
intensity, very different degrees of basic profitability, and how much you scale up based
on size, because there is an incentive that grow businesses – usually businesses get much
larger. Everybody from the CEO down expects to earn more money for something that –
where they really bring the same amount of intensity, and work (06:43:34) to it. It is really
a tough question. I think that if you engage compensation consultants at public companies
which they all do, they're going to recommend things that cause them to have CEO to
recommend them to other companies. It's just you're working against human nature when
you have an arrangement like that.
I would say that we have obviously kept a very, very, very high percentage of the
managers that we hope to have stayed with us. In fact, just about 100%. It's – and I think
people do like – they do like to make their own decisions, they do like recognition. Most
people respond – they like doing a good job and they like the fact that we understand it
and compensation is part of that, but it's not the whole thing. And I wish I could give you
some precise formulas, but there aren't any.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

I think you really don't, Warren.

It's an advantage at Berkshire to keep our individual deals private. There would be no
advantage to just publish them all.

FINAL

No. We're not going to do that.

A - Charles Thomas Munger

No. Of course, not. So, what we're saying, he makes all those decisions personally, he's
got every formula in the book and he keeps them all private. That's our system.

you've had a good time both at the meeting and in Omaha and we look forward to
seeing you again next year. Thanks.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

All right. Hello, and welcome back to Yahoo Finance's coverage of Berkshire Hathaway's
Annual Meeting Live from the CenturyLink Center in Omaha, Nebraska. I'm Andy Serwer
here with my co-host, Jen Rogers.

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

So, as expected, in the afternoon session, we had multiple questions about Apple. It
came up a bunch, Apple versus Microsoft, Apple and its cash. Then, just really in the last
few minutes, they're talking about Google. So many companies coming up.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Yeah. I also thought there was a tremendous amount of conversation about China and
trade and tariffs. And in fact, I've never heard so much talk about that at this meeting, but
Glenn Close said it best. She said, it's always the same and it's always different, and it's
always different because of the news and the changes in Berkshire Hathaway in terms of
their investments and the investment environment that changes as well.
Definitely, a lot on China there. Let's bring in Myles Udland. He is on the floor for us. He's
been in the press box. Miles, what's your big takeaway?

FINAL

Yeah. Andy mentioned there and talking about Apple and I think people who are watching
the meeting, people who saw the beginning of the second half, they'll remember Daphne
the 8-year old girl from New York City who brought up the question about Berkshire's
investments in more asset-light businesses. And then, Buffett eventually, later in the
meeting, in response to a different question and talked about the asset-light nature of
the U.S. economy. I think Apple plays into that theme quite a bit.
So, if I had to define a second half theme, it would be the asset-light nature of sort of
modern commerce, the beginning to Andy's point, a lot of discussion about China and
moat was the word that came up a number of times. Elon Musk got mentioned in that.
And then, of course, Wells Fargo really didn't change their tune there. This is now the
second year in a row that Buffett has essentially said, well, there is an incentive problem,
but I'm not too worried about what happened at the bank.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

I think we need to track down, Daphne. We live in the same city as Daphne. Maybe we can
get her to come on when we get back to New York.

A - Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

A lot of smart young people in New York.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Yes, definitely. That's very good. Value investor, John Rogers, right now, Chairman and
CEO of Ariel Investments with over $13 billion under management. Welcome.

A - John Washington Rogers

{BIO 1401923 <GO>}

It's great to be here.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

So, why do you come every year? What keeps bringing you back?

A - John Washington Rogers

{BIO 1401923 <GO>}

Well, I have so much respect for Warren Buffett. It's just great to be here, and see him
answer the questions every year. But it's also kind of a value investors' convention. You
see great value investors everywhere. I spent a lot of time this weekend with Mario
Gabelli, for example; my friend, Tom Russo is here. It's just a great place to network, get
great ideas, share ideas.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

John, you said that you founded your firm in 1986, the same year that Gabelli did. And I
think it really speaks to your ability to create a sustainable business model as an
investment firm, not easy to do. To what do you owe your success?

FINAL

A - John Washington Rogers

{BIO 1401923 <GO>}

Well, I think – well, for Mario and I, we both, there were six of us who started our mutual
funds in 1986 that are still active today. And I think part of it is that we have maybe the
intestinal fortitude to deal with the inevitable dramatic ups and downs in the market, and
the ability to be contrarians to buy when others are selling and not chase the latest fab of
the moment. And I think most importantly, like Warren talks about, how that long-term
perspective to really keep looking out over the horizon and not get swept up in all the
energy and passions of the moment.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

So, we all cover the market on a daily basis. 2018 has really seen a return to volatility. I'm
interested on your outlook for the balance of the year.

A - John Washington Rogers

{BIO 1401923 <GO>}

I'm quite optimistic. I continue to think that the tax reform has been a big deal generating
lots of cash for companies and I think the regulatory reform sometimes is underestimated
how powerful and important that's going to be the probability of American businesses.
And then, finally, with these low interest rates, valuations are not that high. And there's a
lot of pessimism still out there. I'm involved with a lot of investment committees and
people keep thinking that the market is going to collapse, because it's had this long bull
market. And when everyone's worried about a market collapse, it usually doesn't happen.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

So, John, you are one of the leading business lights of the City Chicago, your town.
Obviously, Chicago has some issues. And a lot of other cities do as well. Do you feel like
the political environment can improve, so that we can start addressing problems like
infrastructure and those types of issues?

A - John Washington Rogers

{BIO 1401923 <GO>}

I think in Chicago, we are well positioned. We're getting better and better. We're getting
stronger and stronger. We have experienced leaders in place, and we have some great
people who've come back actually from the Obama administration to pitch in; people like
Valerie Jarrett and Arne Duncan. Arne is working on this extraordinary work to help young
men of color get great career paths and stay away from the gang life and it's great to
have all this talent coming back to our hometown to pitch in and help keep the company,
help keep the city going in the right direction.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

So, you're sticking around tonight. As you said, it's the time to network, to socialize and
see people, what do you think everyone's going to be talking about from that Q&A
sessions?

FINAL

Well, I think there's going to be a lot of conversation about China. I've been already at the
luncheon after the morning session, people talked about how important China is going to
be, how important the country it's going to be as the world evolves over the next 30 to
40 and 50 years. And I think that's going to be the thing that people are going to talk
about. This trade war what we have will be temporary. And our two nations will be the
ones that will really survive and thrive over the next 30 to 50 years.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

So, would you agree with Charlie Munger that Americans are underweight, China right
now in their investment portfolios? Are we not giving it the attention that we should be?

A - John Washington Rogers

{BIO 1401923 <GO>}

I think so. I think people have underestimated the power of the economic engine there
and how they really are getting things going in the right direction.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

I'm sorry, not to harp on the longevity issue. We've both been around in this business for a
while. And my question is, so for young people starting out, I mean, you started in 1986,
started with your fund, I should say. Is it still the same type of business to get into? Is it still
a good business for young people to get into today?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Washington Rogers

{BIO 1401923 <GO>}

I tell young people that it's a great business. I spoke to a young – a group of young AfroAmerican females here yesterday for lunch, kind of about a dozen people and they were
concerned about their children's economic futures and how to build wealth in the AfricanAmerican community. And I told them get into the financial services world, get your kids
involved with financial services, there's going to be a lot of wealth created.
And one place that I talked about that people often don't think about is, go and work for
your college endowment. There are so many huge endowments now that are $10 billion,
$20 billion, $30 billion. They've got lots of jobs, lots of opportunities to learn about all the
different sectors of this great industry. So, I tell young people think about working for your
alma mater, you can give back and actually do really well at the same time.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

And learn.

A - John Washington Rogers

{BIO 1401923 <GO>}

Thomas Murphy, Ron Olson, Walter Scott, and Meryl Witmer have been elected as
directors.
The next item of business is a motion put forth by Freeda Cathcart on behalf of
shareholder, Marcia Sage. The motion is set forth in the proxy statement. Motion requests
that the company provide a report reviewing the company's policies, actions, plans, and
reduction targets related to methane emissions from all operations. The directors have
recommended that the shareholders vote against the proposal.
I will now recognize Ms. Cathcart to present the motion to allow all interested
shareholders to present their views. I ask that the representative of Baldwin Brothers limit
the presentation of the motion to five minutes.

A - Freeda Cathcart

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning, Chairman, Buffet; Mr. Munger, members of the board, and fellow
shareholders. I am presenting this proposal on behalf of Baldwin Brothers on the issue of
methane asset risk. This is the second year for this methane focus proposal. Last year,
10% of shareholders approved of it.
Methane asset risk is a serious financial safety and environmental issue across the entire
natural gas supply chain. The failure of a gas injection well at Southern California Gas Aliso
Canyon storage facility in Los Angeles revealed major vulnerabilities in the maintenance
and safety of natural gas facilities.
In that situation, cleanup and containment costs have soared to close to $1 billion.
Governor, Jerry Brown of California has threatened to shut down the facility.
Berkshire Hathaway owns the largest interstate natural gas pipeline system in the United
States. It has natural gas storage distribution and transportation facilities that may face
similar safety risks through the Northern Natural Gas Company, Kern River Gas, and MidAmerican Energy Corporations.
On an environmental front, research indicates methane leaks could erase the climate
benefits of reducing coal use to meet internationally agreed upon climate change targets.
Methane emissions have an impact on global temperature of roughly 84 times that of
CO2 over a 20-year period.
Berkshire is a voluntary member of the EPA's Methane Challenge and ONE Future
Emissions Intensity Commitment Framework and should be applauded for reducing its
leakage rates to below the 1% target along its value chain.

FINAL

Since this framework is a cost-effective versus prescriptive approach, shareholders would
like to understand if this cost-effective approach employed at Berkshire is sufficient –
maintenance and enhanced disclosure should help mitigate the potential for these
financial and regulatory risks.
In closing, we think it prudent that Berkshire Hathaway issue a report revealing and
disclosing the company's specific best practices, policies, and safety standards for
methane assets and required upgrade costs to facilities to mitigate potential business
risks.
The report would make it easier for investors, customers, and regulators to understand
Berkshire's overall approach to managing methane emissions and risks. Thank you for
your consideration.

Ms. Cathcart , could you help me out, as there's some other people there to speak? I
can't quite see it from here.

A - Unverified Participant
No. There are no other shareholders who wish to speak on this issue.

Greg, could we put up slide 1 and then somebody will give Greg a microphone, it'd be
helpful. He could elaborate some on this chart and tell us how we're doing.

A - Gregory Edward Abel

{BIO 1416724 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Warren and appreciate the comments there. What we've prepared
here is in response to the proposal. It demonstrates the ONE Future Initiative goal as it
was highlighted. They'd like to see our pipelines operating by 2025 at a 1% throughput or
a loss of throughput at 1%. I'm happy to report, as this slide shows, that in 2017, our
throughput loss was 0.046%, 20 times better than the request in 2025.
Thank you. It's a great compliment to our operating team, obviously. They take the issue
that as it's been highlighted very seriously. I would also add, as it was noted, we're part of

Page 152 of 164

the EPA program where we report on a voluntary basis. Our practices are disclosed and
reviewed by the EPA and additionally added on our website.

FINAL

Accordingly, I strongly feel we're getting the results and disclosing the appropriate
information. Thank you.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. And thanks, Greg. And Ms. Cathcart, we are on the same side you are on this
basically. We just are not looking for ways to conduct more studies and prepare reports
that may cost us money and generate more reports and all that. But I can tell you two
things.
This is something that is reported to the Board of Directors of Berkshire Hathaway Energy
quarterly, and I'm on that board. And we believe in achieving the same as it, and we think
Berkshire Hathaway Energy is both sensitive and effective – sensitive to and effective in
reducing methane emissions.
So, I think we're now ready. The motion is now ready to be acted upon. If there are any
shareholders voting in person, they should now mark their ballots on the motion and
deliver their ballot to one of the meeting officials in the aisles. Ms. Amick, when you're
ready, you may give your report.

My report is ready. The ballot of the proxy holders in response to proxies that were
received through last Thursday evening cast 48,040 votes for the motion and 558,640
votes against the motion.
As the number of votes against the motion exceeds a majority of the number of votes of
all Class A and Class B shares properly cast on the matter, as well as all votes
outstanding, the motion has failed. The certification required by Delaware law of the
precise count of the votes will be given to the secretary to be placed with the minutes of
this meeting.

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Thank you, Ms. Amick. The proposal fails. The next item of business is motion put forth by
shareholder, Freeda Cathcart. The motion is set forth in the proxy statement. The motion
requests that Berkshire adopt a policy to encourage more Berkshire subsidiary companies
to issue annual sustainability reports.
I will now recognize Freeda Cathcart to present the motion. And to all interested
shareholders who've been interviewed, I ask her to limit her remarks to five minutes. You
have the floor, Ms. Cathcart.

FINAL

Thank you so much. It is a privilege to be here and a privilege I can give thanks to my
grandfather, James Cathcart who started out in the mailroom of Gen Re and worked
himself up through the company to become the Chair of Gen Re. During that time, he
accumulated a lot of Gen Re stock which he bestowed generously upon his family. And
when he did so, he encouraged the members of his family to do good and to pay it
forward to do something that would make a difference in the world and in our
communities.
For my father, he did so by being philanthropic with educational institutions with a theory
that if you give a person a fish, you feed them for a day, but if you teach them to fish, you
feed them for a lifetime. My focus has been on the environment. With the thought that
when people fish, it would be nice if they were able to eat the fish.
I want to take this opportunity to clarify my proposal about the sustainability reports and
put the emphasis on the word encourage. It is evident that Berkshire Hathaway's
management of allowing these subsidiaries to work without getting guided – mandates
from you is being very successful and I wouldn't recommend changing it. You're doing a
great job. Please keep it up.

Bloomberg Transcript

But I do think that there's something to be said to encourage them and support them in
many ways you already are. There is a high level of interest from investors and the public
in corporate social responsibility. One-fifth of investments are based on socially
responsible investment strategies.
And back in 2012, I found an article by Planet Earth Herald where they wrote, when Warren
Buffett talks, people listen. He is now talking about the environment. He believes that
companies need to have a triple bottom line and respecting the environment is absolutely
critical to a company's economic performance. In times – then this is a direct quote from
you, Mr. Buffett. In times such as these, a company must invest in the key ingredients of
profitability; its people, communities, and the environment.
One-third of Berkshire Hathaway's subsidiaries already have a sustainability presence on
the web. And one of them is Berkshire Energy that has the acronym RESPECT, which
stands for responsibility, efficiency, stewardship, performance, communication and
training. And Berkshire Hathaway provides an annual sustainability summit to help bring
the subsidiaries together so they can learn how to be more sustainable, how to share tips
and how to be profitable. And that's excellent.
But when I tried to find a web presence about the sustainability summit, I wasn't able to
find it. And that's where I think that we can do a better job in Berkshire Hathaway when it
comes to communication with our shareholders and with the outside world about the
good work that we're doing. A simple solution to that would just be to create a link on the
Berkshire Hathaway website to sustainability that people could click on and go and find
out about initiatives like the sustainability summit. And from there perhaps, they could click
on to go to the subsidiaries that have a web presence about sustainability to see what
they're doing.

FINAL

In doing so, we give a window to the world where they can see what we're doing to make
a difference that might inspire other corporations to follow the example , or perhaps a
college student working on a paper would read about it and think that that is a good
business model, that that's something that he wants to bring forward when he goes into
his career.
There is a Facebook page called Berkshire Hathaway Sustainability that will be available
for shareholders in the outside world to look at to see research and to encourage each
other to learn how we can support sustainability practices. And that is available now.
I greatly appreciate this opportunity to speak with you today and to clarify what my
proposal is. And I do greatly applaud and appreciate all the work that you're doing on
behalf of our corporation and the world. Thank you so much.

A - Warren Edward Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Thank you. Many of the managers – a great many of the managers of Berkshire are here
and are listening to you. And I suspect that a very high percentage of them agree with
what you're saying. Whether they – what they do in terms of web pages and so on, in our
view, is basically up to them.

Bloomberg Transcript

But I can tell you that one leading proponent, as you mentioned, was Greg Abel, who until
recently was running Berkshire Hathaway Energy and now is Vice Chairman. And Greg may
want to say a few words on this, too. But, I can assure you that the managers are listening
to you.

A - Gregory Edward Abel

{BIO 1416724 <GO>}

Thanks, Warren. Thanks, Warren. Yeah, we do everything that was touched on. I'll just
maybe add a few points for our shareholders. Obviously, sustainability is a priority for
Berkshire and each of our operating subsidiaries. It was highlighted that a number of them
have sustainability reports. But I would go beyond that. If you go to our various companies'
websites, you'll see specific actions they're taking relative to sustainability. So, it may not
be summarized in a specific report, but that type of information is available.
I can also add that when you think of the Berkshire Hathaway Energy Corporation, we're
trying to lead by example with support from Warren, Charlie, Walter Scott. I'm happy to
report, if you look at where our energy production is right now at the end of 2017, 50% of
our energy that is produced and consumed by our customers comes from renewable
energy.
That's something we're strongly communicating across the U.S. and globally as an
example of what can be done in our industry. And I'm happy to report by the end of 2021,
100% of the energy utilized by our customers can be met through renewable energy in
Iowa.
So, I understand the concept of sustainability. We're working across our organizations to
share best practices. But as Warren highlighted, it really resides in each of our companies.

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. We want to start with Nebraska Governor, Pete Ricketts. We had just begun our
interview with the Governor when the Berkshire Hathaway business meeting began. So,
we got to talk with him a little bit while some of the business was going on. Here's a look.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Joining us now is Nebraska Governor, Pete Ricketts. Governor Rick, it's great to see you.

A - John Peter Ricketts

{BIO 1866542 <GO>}

Great to be here. Thank you very much.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

So, let me ask you about this meeting. How big a deal is the Berkshire Hathaway meeting
to the State of Nebraska?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Peter Ricketts

{BIO 1866542 <GO>}

Well, this is a huge deal. As you know, they sold a record number of tickets, over 42,000.
And this is something that allows us at the state to be able to showcase the state and
really show off all the wonderful things. Omaha is just a brilliant community. We've got so
many great hardworking people here. So, it really is a wonderful opportunity for us to be
able to tell the world our story.

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

One part of that story that we have learned this week being here is how low your
unemployment rate is. It's below 3%.

A - John Peter Ricketts

{BIO 1866542 <GO>}

Yeah, 2.8%

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

That's going to – it's got to be a challenge though. We've been talking to business leaders
just about hiring. How do you stay competitive with that?

A - John Peter Ricketts

{BIO 1866542 <GO>}

Yeah. We've got like the fifth lowest unemployment rate in the country, 2.8%, the lowest
we've had since 1999. But one of the things we do to really kind of be innovative about
how we connect companies with people is we've changed our unemployment system into
a reemployment system. And by that, I mean, we're requiring everybody taking those
benefits to sit down the jobs coach, first, create a resume, get job, pointing to job
training, how to find that new tips on find the next best thing. So, we've actually reduced

Page 157 of 164



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2018-05-05

the amount of time people are spending unemployed, reduced amount of claims being
paid out. And that's a lot to reduce our unemployment insurance tax as well, saving
Nebraska businesses last year about $20 million.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

FINAL

So, by the way, I like your Nebraska red tie, you're looking good.

A - John Peter Ricketts

{BIO 1866542 <GO>}

Thanks. Thanks.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

So, obviously Nebraska, a huge agricultural state and you export a tremendous amount of
those products to China. And my question, of course, is where do things stand right now
with the trade friction that we're seeing?

A - John Peter Ricketts

{BIO 1866542 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, actually, the President invited us out to the White House, I would say, a number of
lawmakers from the Midwest about three weeks ago to talk about agriculture and trade.
And I would say farmers and ranchers in Nebraska are nervous about the potential for
retaliatory tariffs from China. And we want to see how this all works out, but we also have
time. We're just now getting to planting season for example for soybeans. So, we won't
be in harvest for several months.
Obviously, China has still got some time before they would actually implement some of
these tariffs. So, what we're really just looking for is we know China has to be held
accountable. Our farmers and ranchers get that with regard to things like intellectual
property, but we want to see this trade deal get worked out and make sure that there
aren't any tears put on our agricultural products, because we don't want to have our
farmers and ranchers impacted.

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

And it's not just China. Japan is a big trading partner for Nebraska...

A - John Peter Ricketts

{BIO 1866542 <GO>}

Absolutely.

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

...as well. So, talk to us about TPP and also NAFTA. And what those mean and what you –
for Nebraska? And what you think is going to happen on both those fronts?

A - John Peter Ricketts

{BIO 1866542 <GO>}

Yeah. So, I actually had a chance to talk to the President when he was still a candidate
about TPP. And as you know, he's not a fan of TPP. At the same meeting we had a few
Page 158 of 164

Date: 2018-05-05

FINAL

weeks ago, he did express an openness to taking a look at TPP, which is certainly quite
different from where he's been in the past. Though he was very clear, he prefers bilateral
trade agreements. So, I don't have a big preference, either, as long as we get that trade
agreement with Japan. So, again, we just encourage him to get that trade deal done.
Japan is a huge market for us for our beef, our pork. We've had just – this week, we had a
delegation from Keidanren, which is one of the most prestigious Japanese business
federations here. The Vice Chairman of Toyota, Hayakawa-san, is the Vice Chair of Toyota
who also runs this federation.
So, it's a big deal. They were here because Japan is the largest foreign direct investor in
Nebraska, so we've got strong relationships, and we want to – don't want to see that
trade relationship disrupted, and we don't want to see the NAFTA trade relationship
disrupted, either.
That's been a very successful relationship, not only for Nebraska, but for Canada, Mexico,
and the United States. So, certainly opportunities to really make all of these trade
agreements better, just we also want to remember, we don't want to disrupt these very
important relationships too.

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Yeah, right, coming here.

A - John Peter Ricketts

{BIO 1866542 <GO>}

Absolutely. So, one of the things that we do is, we've got the Raikes School, which is – Jeff
Raikes was the former Microsoft executive to really help train our young people. And we
have seen a lot of companies, Facebook, for example, just mentioned their – or just
announced they are tripling their investment in Nebraska. They will take it up to about $1
billion for their data center.
In fact, we've really got an expertise around data centers with other companies like
Yahoo! and Travelers and Fidelity, all having their data centers share in Nebraska. We've
got inexpensive public power. We're able to promise, for example, Facebook 100%
renewable energy for their data center which is increasingly becoming important for our
corporate partners here in the state. So, we really have a great community to help grow
those tech jobs.

FINAL

I want to ask you about guns, because you just came from the NRA Convention in Texas
and Warren Buffett was actually asked about guns earlier today. And it was really
interesting just going by the applause lines in the crowd, it was really divided. And I want
to know what you think can be done on this issue to bring people together and make
some progress on it?

A - John Peter Ricketts

{BIO 1866542 <GO>}

Well, I think that the key thing we want to look at right now is school safety. And so, one of
the things I've done is organize a group of educators, a group of mental health care
professionals and a group of law enforcement to start talking about different ideas that
we could do to help improve school safety, and then bringing them together with what
are some of the ideas that we can do. One of the things I've thrown out there for
example is allow off-duty police officers to be able to carry guns onto a school campus or
something like that. But that's just an idea.

Bloomberg Transcript

What we really want to do is see how can we get to folks ahead of time? And that's
where again I think the mental health care aspect is so important. Actually, Nebraska won
an award from Mental Health America this past year for the work we're doing around our
system of care to improve our mental health care services for children, trying to really
organize all the resources in the community to get to them sooner, to make sure they
don't get pulled out of school, pulled away from their families, not disrupt that child's life.
And so, I think that's really what we have to look at is, how do we address the underlying
causes for why these things are happening and look at it from the education side, mental
healthcare side, law enforcement side.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

And regulatory side. There's a lot – that's a bigger conversation. And obviously, we could
talk about for quite some time.

So, the team is all back together here. Joining Andy Sewer and myself, we've got Myles
Udland and Julia La Roche, who've been super busy all day.

A - Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

FINAL

I feel like I'm returning home after a long journey out in the wilderness.

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

It feels like way more than a day that we last saw you. But, Julia, let's start with you, your
big takeaway from today.

A - Julia La Roche
This was my first Berkshire Hathaway meeting. So, I'm so excited to be here. And I spoke
to Buffett in that scrum earlier in the morning. I asked him, what are you going to buy or
what has to happen for you to buy the next company? He said, I'm waiting for the phone
call. And I also spent the day talking to executives from various Berkshire Hathaway
portfolio companies. And I've asked them what's the benefit of being a Berkshire-backed
company and they said, you know, it's the hands-off management style. That was
something I heard constantly. But they also felt that they had the full support of Buffett for
the long term.

Bloomberg Transcript

And Buffett also said during our time in the scrum that that's what the culture, that handsoff style, that is the moat at Berkshire Hathaway. So, that's my big takeaway.

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

Waiting for the call, that came up a lot during the meeting as well. Like, where were you to
know when the phone rings, like who's calling, and where people are calling from? Myles,
what about you?

A - Myles Udland

{BIO 20165611 <GO>}

Well, I think if you look at kind of the fundamental way that Warren Buffett likes to talk
about investing in the U.S. economies, he said the S&P 500 is essentially most of the
economy and you get all the benefits of that. And today, he used Apple as an example of
a company right now that best – I think it exemplifies where we're at the in the U.S.
economy.
Ultimately, yes, they sell iPhones, but it's an asset-light business. It's the theme that I think
dominated the second half of the meeting. The U.S. economy, Buffett said himself is kind
of asset-light. And if you look at the way that companies make money, Google, Amazon,
Facebook, Apple, the companies that are defining our modern moment are not
companies that are like what we see behind us here.
It's not BNSF, it's not really Duracell, it's not really Coca Cola, and I think that direction that
shift – and that's kind of a big theme for him, for Charlie, and I think something everyone
who is here today and heard them talk should think about the future of the economy I

Page 161 of 164



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2018-05-05

think looks at lot different than the past did. And I think that Apple to Buffett is a perfect
example of that.

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

FINAL

All right, Andy. You're up.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

So, I actually had a good takeaway, I thought from Glenn Close of all people.

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

Of all people, award-winning actress.

A - Andy Serwer

{BIO 15136542 <GO>}

Yeah. And I thought it was really interesting. She's come here a number of years and we
asked her, why do come? And she had a really great answer, which is, it's always the same
and it's always different.

Bloomberg Transcript

And I think that is so true, and it's the continuity of the wisdom that is the sameness. And
then, frankly, it's the news and investing decisions, and the new investments, that's
different. And so, between those two things, you get a really pretty exciting package. And
for instance, what was new this year, a bunch of things, but what resonated with me was
the discussions about China and trade. And that's obviously very top of mind.
And the interest amongst Chinese investors about Warren Buffett and Berkshire
Hathaway, and Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffett in China continues to rise, and they
address that. And I just think that it's really interesting and really topical and you can't
predict what it's going to be year-to-year. What's it going to be in 2019? We don't know.

A - Jennif er Rogers

{BIO 2325313 <GO>}

This goes a little bit to what you and Miles were talking about. But, I just think it's fun and I
love it when he's talking about the companies that we talked about all the time. You
talked about Amazon. He said, I have watched Amazon from the beginning and I missed
it, but I wouldn't bet on a miracle, I never would have.
Talking about Google, just a little bit ago, saying I looked at Google and then I thought
how did Google get there so fast. Is somebody going to get ahead of them that quickly?
And I think that really also is Todd and Ted's influence and to see that playing out, and
that really goes to the Apple news that really started this meeting, then upping that
investment and the trends there, I don't think are stopping.

It's so interesting, there's so much to talk about. And people may not realize this, but the
conversation continues, because there are all manner of gatherings and parties that go

on after the meeting, at hotels, all around the city, and even beyond that, and all this
community, Berkshire Hathaway investors will be talking the whole year.

And Charlie said that during the meeting. He said that I think when there's a new
management team, when the current management teams have long moved on, he thinks
there will still be a Berkshire Hathaway meeting, because we can talk about how people
connect digitally, you follow someone on Twitter, you can slack them. But really, there is
nothing like talking to someone in person. And this is such a great event for doing that.
And yeah, we live in New York, but it just doesn't feel like people get together as much as
you would like. You come here. Everyone's nice, everyone talks and you make a lot of new
relationships.

Thumbs up for the first time, but also just that reconnecting. I connected with people that I
hadn't spoken to since college who are here, who saw me and they said, oh, you're here
at Berkshire, me too, and via social media whether it was Facebook messaging or
Instagram messaging, and then, also meeting new people and then seeing people you
see in New York as well. So, this is a great event to reconnect.

Well, the conversation could go on for a long time, but we are going to have to wrap this
up. It's just been a great full day of coverage here from Omaha at the Berkshire-Hathaway
Annual Meeting. Thanks to everyone around the world who watched this and we hope you
really enjoyed it. And thanks to all the people who pitched in doing a tremendous amount
of work today on the team.
