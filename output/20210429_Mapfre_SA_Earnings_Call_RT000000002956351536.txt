{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to MAPFRE's Result Presentation for the First
Quarter of 2021. This is Felipe Navarro, Head of Investor Relations and Capital Markets.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have the pleasure of having here with us, Fernando Mata, our CFO, who will walk us
through the main figures and highlights of the quarter.
Additional information can be found on our website, including the MD&A, the 2020
Embedded Value Presentation, as well as the usual spreadsheets. At the end of the
presentation, we will open up the Q&A session. You can submit questions, ask -- using the
Ask a Question link on the bottom of your screen. We'll try to answer all your questions as
the time allows. The IR team will be available afterwards to answer any pending questions.
Before we start the presentation, I would like to give you an update regarding MAPFRE'S
response to the pandemic. We have maintained our focus on the three main priorities.
First, the health of our employees and collaborators. Second, business continuity,
guaranteeing the commitment to our clients and shareholders. Third, our solvency and
capital strength. As the vaccination process continues, we have initiated a return to the
office, always keeping in mind the highest health standards. Currently, around 89% of our
employees in Spain and 39% in the United States are working on the premises. In Brazil,
due to the negative development of the pandemic, 100% of the workforce are currently
working remotely. We will continue adapting to the changes in conditions in every country.
Now, let me turn the call over to our CFO. Fernando, the floor is yours.

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Felipe, and thank you everyone for being here with us today. Hopefully, you
and your families are coping well during the pandemic and staying safe and healthy. First
of all, I'm pleased to present strong first quarter results that are confirming that we are on
the right track to reach the guidance announced at our AGM.

Top line performance is excellent, taking into account the impact of the pandemic on the
macroeconomic situation, as well as the drag from currency movements. On the bottom
line, Motor frequency is still below pre-pandemic levels and mitigating COVID-related
claims. Performance has been especially strong in Iberia, where we are outperforming the
market in key segments, while maintaining best-in-class technical performance in NonLife. In the United States, thanks to the reorganization that started several years ago,
underwriting results are strong, especially in the Northeast, although the top line is still
reﬂecting this streamlining process.
The impact of COVID in Latin America is especially relevant with a strong increase in cases
and mortality, with further mobility restrictions. Furthermore, the vaccination process has
been slower than expected in many countries. We are seeing higher level of Life
Protection and Health claims across the region, especially Brazil, Mexico and Peru,
although in the latter, these claims were compensated by other positive eﬀects. Brazil is
still beneﬁting from excellent top line performance in Agro, and there has been a change
in trend in Motor with a return to growth in local currency. The Life Protection business is
deeply aﬀected by lower branch activity due to a semi-lockdown situation, which started in
mid-March.

Bloomberg Transcript

Since the onset of the pandemic, MAPFRE's strategy has managed headwinds from lower
economic activity, mobility restrictions and currency movements. This quarter, MAPFRE is
again delivering recurrent and stable proﬁtability metrics with limited impacts from COVID.
I would like to comment that the group recently received approval from the Spanish
supervisor for use of the longevity risk internal model, bringing the Solvency II ratio to
around a 193% at 2020 year end. Finally, we're happy to announce that the final dividend
will be paid on May 24th, one month earlier than other years, which is proof of our
commitment with both institutional and retail shareholders, while injecting -- helping inject
cash in the real economy.
Now, I'll take you through the main ﬁgures of the ﬁrst quarter. At constant exchange rates,
premiums are up around 3.2%, with outstanding performance in Non-Life, up 3.5%, and
Life Premiums up a little under 2%. In euros, they're down around 3% due to currency
depreciation, mainly the Brazilian real as well as the U.S. dollar, and the Turkish lira. The
Group combined ratio is in line with 2020 full year ﬁgures and stands at 94.3%, a 6 point
decrease compared to the pre-pandemic ﬁrst quarter of 2020 and below the 2021 target
of 95%.
I would also like to highlight the signiﬁcant 1 point reduction in the expense ratio, thanks to
strict implementation of our cost contention plan. Combined ratio for insurance units
remains low at 93.8%. And MAPFRE's net results amounts to over EUR173 million, up over
36% and in line with our guidance for adjusted net income for 2021 of EUR700 million.
Assets under management are up around 0.2% with the investment portfolios slightly
down, but compensated by growth in pension and mutual funds. Lastly, embedded value
was down 0.5% to over EUR7.8 billion, mainly due to the impact from currency

FINAL

depreciation in Latin America during the year. You can see the full disclosure of our
embedded value at our website.
Please turn to the next slide. On this slide, I'll take you through the breakdown of the
adjusted attributable result. First of all, due to the oﬀsetting nature of the diﬀerent COVID
impacts at insurance operations, we have not considered this in the adjusted result as the
ﬁnal eﬀect should be neutral. In addition, winter storms in Spain are not being considered
extraordinary, because they had been recurring for the last three years. Nevertheless, the
Filomena snow storms in January has been one of the largest events in Spain with over
40,000 claims and a EUR20 million net impact for the Group.

Bloomberg Transcript

Regarding other Nat-CAT claims, it has been a quiet quarter, fortunately, with nothing to
report. As a reminder, last year there was a EUR54 million impact from the earthquake in
Puerto Rico. Financial gains and losses are down over EUR28 million due to a real state
gain at MAPFRE USA last year with a 14 -- approximately EUR14 million net impact as well
as lower gains on the actively managed portfolio, as a result of our decision to accumulate
gains this year in line with a prudent approach. Excluding these impacts, adjusted net
result reached a EUR163.5 million up over EUR20 million.
Please turn to the next slide. On this slide, we show the main trends this quarter.
Performance at the insurance unit is remarkable with a combined ratio below 94%. The
main drivers of the improvement are technical measures implemented in previous years,
mainly in Brazil and USA, and lower Motor frequency from the pandemic. In Iberia,
premiums are up 3% with excellent performance in Non-Life. Motor premiums are up over
1%, mainly due to a good contribution from renewals, along with new business from
Santander. The total number of vehicles insured increased by around 56,000 units yearto- date and up nearly 3% year-on-year. MAPFRE is outperforming the market in the most
relevant lines showing solid growth in Health 8%, Condominium 5.5%, Homeowners 3%.
The attributable result is up 5%, contributing over a EUR108 million with excellent technical
performance reflected in a combined ratio of around 93%.
In Brazil, currency headwinds were relevant with average real exchange rates down 23%,
while premiums are up 13% in local currency. The net result is down EUR14.5 million, as the
strong improvement in the combined ratio, now at 88%, was not able to compensate
COVID claims, particularly Life Protection and a reduction as well in ﬁnancial income.
Premiums in LATAM South grew 3.9% in euros, oﬀsetting currency eﬀects. On the other
hand, premiums in LATAM North are still down, mainly due to the depreciation of the
Mexican peso. Local currency growth in both regions was remarkable with Colombia up
29%, Chile up 27%, Peru up nearly 11%, and Mexico over 8%. Combined ratios in both
regions remain at good levels with a slight deterioration in LATAM North, but still at 93%
due to you to COVID-related health claims. Performance in North America was excellent
with a 15% increase in the net result and a 5 point reduction in the combined ratio, now at
96.6%, mainly due to the earthquake in Puerto Rico that I already commented last year.
The region shows remarkable stability with recovering profits after restructuring. In
Eurasia, premiums are down due to the non-renewal of the dealership channel in Italy as
well as the depreciation of the Turkish lira. All countries have contributed positively to
results except Italy, where expenses have to be adapted to the new business model.

At MAPFRE RE premiums are also up, supported by positive pricing trends. The combined
ratio was 95%, in line with previous quarters, with excellent performance both in
reinsurance and global risks.

FINAL

And in the Assistance business, results are up nearly EUR10 million and last year was
extremely affected by travel cancellation claims. Volumes are down 46% as we continue
with our streamlining process.
Please turn to the next slide. On this slide I would like to comment on the Life business at
insurance units. In Iberia, premiums are performing well, despite the challenging market
context with Life Protection down only 1% and Life Savings down 2%, but in line with
market growth in both segments. As I already mentioned, bank activity in Brazil has been
hurt by the pandemic situation, which has taken its toll on Life Protection premiums, which
are down 7% in local currency in the banking channel. Life savings premiums are also down
in Mexico and Panama.

Bloomberg Transcript

Regarding results, performance in Iberia was stable, despite lower business volumes and
lower financial income. In Brazil, the result is down due to the COVID-related claims, lower
financial income and currency depreciation.
This slide includes a full disclosure of the breakdown in variations of the investment
portfolio and total assets under management. Spanish sovereign debt continues to be
our largest exposure, now a little over EUR12 billion and Italian debt with around EUR2.6
billion is the second largest. Both sovies are mainly allocated to immunized portfolios. The
fall in the investment portfolio is due to higher yields with the Spanish sovereign up over
35 basis points year-to-date. Pension and mutual funds have had strong performance
both due to market movements as well as positive net contributions of EUR22 million in
pension funds and EUR98 million investment funds at the end of March. Please remember
that these ﬁgures do not include Bankia MAPFRE VIDA portfolios.
Please turn to the next slide. On the top left are the details of our euro-area actively
managed ﬁxed income portfolios. Market value of these portfolios is around EUR13 billion.
The accounting yield is around 1.6% in Non-Life and 3.6 in Life, well above I mean the
market yields. Realized gains and losses in these portfolios were around EUR7 million,
down EUR22 million compared to the previous year. As right now, as I mentioned, we
prefer to accumulate unrealized gains in order to compensate the fall in value of ﬁxed
income portfolios. On the bottom left, you can see the details of the ﬁxed income
portfolios in other main markets. Accounting yields in LATAM and also in the U.S. are still
well above those in Europe, and we have even recently seen rising rates in some markets,
like Brazil for example.
Please turn to the next slide. Shareholders' equity stood at a EUR8.3 billion, down around
3% during the year. The most relevant changes are a decrease in net unrealized gains on
the available for sale portfolio, with a EUR271 million negative impact due to rising rates,
which especially impacted the Spanish Non-Life business with a EUR96 million impact,
EUR53 million in North America, U.S. and Puerto Rico and around EUR42 million in both

FINAL

Brazil and LATAM South. On the other hand, the impact in the Spanish Life portfolio was
very limited - EUR13 million - and it was due to the high share of immunized portfolios.
As you can see on this slide, unrealized gains are completely matched by shadow
accounting adjustments in this immunized portfolio. Currency conversions diﬀerences had
a positive net impact of EUR79 million during the quarter, mainly due to the 4%
appreciation of the U.S. dollar, which oﬀset the depreciation of Emerging Market
currencies, especially the Brazilian real. The breakdown of currency conversions
diﬀerences, and also, the sensitivity analysis are shown in the table on the right.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the chart on the left, you can see the breakdown of the capital structure, which
amounted to EUR12.6 billion, of which over two-thirds is equity. Leverage is slightly up at
23.7%, but we are comfortable at this level, which supports our current ﬁnancial needs. On
the right, you can see the Solvency II provisional ﬁgures for 2020 year-end -- they're
provisional because we have to report and also to be approved by the Board in mid-May - but which now reﬂect the approval for the longevity risk, internal model for the Spanish
Life business. This brings the ratio to a 193%, comfortably within our range. And keep in
mind, that we estimate a 6% uplift from the Bankia exit, assuming no change in Eligible
Own Funds. The ﬁnal ﬁgures with a full disclosure will be released on May 20th.
Please turn to the next slide. Embedded value was down 0.5% to over EUR7.8 billion,
mainly due to the impact from currency depreciation in Latin America during 2020.
Embedded value attributable to the parent company is up 7%. There was a positive
contribution from new business during the year, especially Life Protection. Furthermore,
the Life Savings environment is still challenging due to the low interest and a lack of ﬁscal
incentives, particularly in Spain. There was also a positive impact from the fall in risk-free
rates.
On the right, you can see the sensitivity analysis. This year, we have included the impact
from the exit of Bankia-related Life business, which will imply a reduction of EUR715 million.
At this point, I would like to make a few comments on the current status of the
bancassurance agreement with Bankia. As you are aware, we have communicated all
developments in a timely manner. The process began in September of last year with the
approval of the proposed banking merger of CaixaBank and Bankia, which was later
approved at the AGM of both entities in December. After receiving all necessary
regulatory approvals, the merger was ﬁnalized on March 26th, being the trigger for the
change of control of Bankia. MAPFRE informed CaixaBank that the put options stipulated
by contract for MAPFRE's 51 [percent] shareholding in Bankia MAPFRE VIDA as well as
termination of the agency contracts for both Life and Non-Life insurance distribution were
eﬀective March 31st.
The change of control also triggered the established procedures to assess the
compensation for the termination of the bancassurance agreements, deﬁned as a 120%
of market value of MAPFRE VIDA's 51 [percent] in Bankia MAPFRE VIDA and the Non-Life
insurance business, excluding the value of the insurance portfolio. Any results earned by
Bankia MAPFRE VIDA as of April 1st will correspond to CaixaBank.

FINAL

Finally, the process of appointing an independent appraiser has been initiated in April.
And as we mentioned, MAPFRE will inform the market of any new developments as they
arise.
Before moving on to the Q&A session, I would like to make a few closing remarks. First of
all, in Iberia, growth is excellent and we are outperforming the market in our main
segments, while maintaining strong technical margins. Our leading positions and strong
brand recognition is helping us to come out of this crisis even stronger than before.
Underwriting results are robust in the United States, especially in the Northeast region and
we continue making progress in the restructuring process.
In Latin America, the pandemic and economic outlook remain challenging and we are
monitoring this closely. The impact of COVID in Latin America has been especially relevant
with a strong increase in cases and mortality with further mobility restrictions. The
vaccination process has been slower than expected in many countries. A reduction in
COVID-related losses and full economic recovery will depend on the speed of
vaccination.

Bloomberg Transcript

At MAPFRE RE, results have been robust, excellent, and both the reinsurance and global
risk segments are on the right path to more normalized proﬁtability levels, supported by
tariﬀ increases. We expect similar trends to continue in the second quarter, assuming no
signiﬁcant changes in the pandemic context, proving that MAPFRE is able to adapt to this
constantly changing environment while delivering solid results.
Regarding our formal bancassurance agreements with Bankia, right now, we're focused
on completing the procedures and formalities of the exit process. And ﬁnally, we continue
to prove our strong commitment to shareholders, reﬂected in the dividend payment, that
has been advanced from June to May, which is supported by a strong ﬁnancial position.
Thank you. And we'll now hand the call over to Felipe to begin the Q&A session.

Questions And Answers
A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

(Question And Answer)
Thank you very much, Fernando, for this thorough presentation. We'll start with the Q&A.
The ﬁrst question is coming from Andrew Sinclair from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and
it's related with the Life and Health business that have COVID-related claims in Brazil and
LATAM, and he's asking what was the cost of these in the ﬁrst quarter.
And Ivan Bokhmat from Barclays, the COVID impact of EUR190 million remains substantial
in the ﬁrst quarter '21, with most of it coming through the Life and Health business. Can
you explain how long may that impact persist and what are the key indicators you monitor
in that expect? There's also another question related with this topic, which is Paco Riquel

Page 6 of 18



Company N ame: M apfre SA

from Alantra. Can you comment on the losses of the Life Risk business in Brazil, and what
shall we expect for the coming quarters in this segment and from Brazil overall?

FINAL

Finally, Jonathan Denham from Morgan Stanley is asking what in LATAM oﬀset the Life
Protection COVID losses, and do you expect these positives to continue in the second
quarter? So, there's a lot of interest on the situation in Latin America for the COVID
related losses. Fernando?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you very much. Quite comprehensive series of questions. First of all, we
haven't disclosed the information of COVID losses by regions, we only have included in
ﬁnancial report by line of business, but in the text, I'm going to take some of the -- I'm
going to get you to the page -- but we have put by regions. The reason for this lack of
disclosure, probably we'll increase information probably at June, but the thing is that
some of the impacts are happening in some of the countries, in countries in which we're
holding business with minority interests, particularly in Brazil.

Bloomberg Transcript

And since BB Seguridade, the Bank of Brasil Seguridades is a listed company, haven't
published results yet, it wouldn't be fair I mean just to disclose this information that are
aﬀecting as well their accounts. So for MAPFRE, sorry, for Brazil, the information is on Page
24 and the impact of COVID-19 for this region both mainly it's Health and Life, but
particularly Life is EUR33.6 million, Page 24. And it's for both I mean the bancassurance
channel and also MAPFRE channel.
For LATAM North, the disclosure is on Page 26. And in that case, the impact of COVID-19 is
EUR31.4 million. In the case of LATAM North, it's aﬀecting mainly Mexico, but also Health,
particularly in the Dominican Republic. In that case Health business as you well know, there
is a JV with BHC, it's a ﬁnancial institution and -- it's an institution regulated. So we do not
consider fair I mean just to publish the impact.
And for LATAM SOUTH. On Page 28, in that case, the impact of COVID-19 is EUR19.5
million. In that case it's aﬀecting both, Health and Life business, but we're running Life
business as well with a minority shareholder. So, we will see. I know that this information is
quite important for you and quite sensitive, but perhaps, as of June, we will be able to
give you a full disclosure by line of business and also by regions or countries.
Regarding more question. I mean, it's extremely diﬃcult to foresee what is going to -how big is going to be the impact in the following quarters. We know that Brazil, I mean,
we've been hit, particularly in March in Brazil because of the lockdown measures and the
amount of Life losses. But April looks, I wouldn't say much better, but better. And we
should expect, I mean in most of the regions with diﬀerent intensity and frequency a sort
of decrease in impacts.
On the other hand, other lines business, particularly P&C, Automobile as well, we should
expect an increase, moderate increase in combined ratio, and lower proﬁtability. But
moderate I will reaﬃrm moderate, since lockdown measures are being lifted. And also
there is an increase in mobility. On the long run for Non-Life I will say that the 95%
Page 7 of 18

FINAL

combined ratio that was given by our Chairman at the AGM, it was just in March. We feel
comfortable with this guidance. Now it's a little bit lower, but there is a seasonal impact as
well, seasonal reason for this situation, particularly in Automobile.
And we believe that we will ﬁnish this year, if there is no signiﬁcant changes in the
pandemic, below this 95%. And in the rest of regions, Spain, compared to Latin America,
looks more promising. I mean, the pace of vaccination is increasing day by day, and
hopefully, we will have a high percentage of the population fully vaccinated by summer.
We're seeing some increases in mobility, particularly in the big cities. I mean, we are
seeing traﬃc jams in Madrid which is good, I mean, because means a re-vamping of the
economy, but it's extremely diﬃcult to foresee what is going -- what we're going to face
in the in the future. I mean I'm not sure this is the fourth or the ﬁfth wave of the pandemic
but fortunately I mean April looks better and more promising. Any question I mean we
haven't answered, I don't -- Felipe, please help me.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

I think that we completed, we covered the main part of the questions related with a Life
and Health business, because the main interest was on the impact in Latin America, As
you said, we are going to try to do some kind of disclosure on the regional results.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. I promise I will try to do our best in order to increase our disclosures regarding
COVID-19 by regions.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much, Fernando. We'll move now to another topic, which is the
Motor business. We have several questions, and I'm going to read them as I did on the
previous one, so we can we can give a broad answer on all the topics. The ﬁrst one is
coming from Paco Riquel from Alantra, and he's saying the Motor premiums in Spain
grows by 1.3% gross but the net premiums earned fell by 2.8%. Can you please explain
the difference?
The next one is asked by Alex Evans at Credit Suisse. You reported premium growth in
Spain Motor at 1.3% versus a fall in the market of 1.8%, what is driving your
outperformance here? Have you been more competitive on price in the quarter?
And Ivan Bokhmat from Barclays is asking about -- is asking the following question. Spain
Motor business increased number of insured vehicles by 2.9% year-on- year, suggesting a
market share gain. What do you think helped you most?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah, thank you for the questions, Felipe. I mean, we're quite happy, I mean with this
premium growth in this ﬁrst quarter. Probably in the next quarter, we see this catch up of a
premiums earned. Basically it's due, if you remember, if I remember well, it was the third
Page 8 of 18

FINAL

quarter when it was signiﬁcant drop in the average premiums because we started
implementing discounts on an individual basis to our best drivers in order to transfer part
of this decrease in frequency to rates.
And so we'll see probably in the next quarter I mean, this catch up in premiums earned.
Regarding this increase in units, frankly, I mean this quarter has been -- was extraordinary
in terms of both distribution channels - bancassurance. I mean we had Bankia that came to
an end at the end of March, and we had as well Santander, that the net premiums for
Santander exceeded EUR10 million I mean, it's a big chunk of new business. And also well
the RED MAPFRE performed extraordinary well during this period. I mean, the churn ratio
is quite good, even lower than the standard periods, showing that, what we mentioned,
that the brand recognition of MAPFRE is a must and is a plus in this moment.
Regarding number of units, it goes parallel to increase of premiums, and it's a strong
contribution from Banco Santander. And also, there is a small increase as well in fleet, not
relevant. But we overall, I mean, we're quite happy. We're outperforming the market in
both premiums and units, and we see what we mentioned, what I mentioned in the past.
During these hard times, the brand of MAPFRE, I mean it weighs a lot. And when we see
the net promoter -- NPS, net promoter score, I mean, it's quite good for MAPFRE. And
when we ask shoppers and they said that the MAPFRE is a guarantee of solvency, and
good quality of services in these diﬃcult moments.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay. Now, we are going to move to some questions related with Bankia. Marina from JB
Capital is asking, could you please elaborate more on the valuations you presented on
the impact of the exit of the JV in Bankia. I don't think that we presented anything, but I
mean, you will be able to answer.
And there's another one related coming from Andrew Sinclair from Bank of America. And
she is -- he's asking, what is the carrying value for -- of both the Life and Non-Life entities
of Bankia JV that is now set aside for this for the sale.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes. Marina, as Felipe said, as far as I know, and I am the one presented numbers, there is
not any valuation published by MAPFRE regarding this potential transaction. It was just the
other way. As we mentioned in previous presentations back in September and due to the
new merger presentation, I mean, it was some information regarding any potential
valuation of the exit of the JVs. But MAPFRE, from our side, we haven't published any
valuation.
Obviously, we are expecting, I mean the -- as I mentioned -- next step we're working with
Caixa -- is just to appoint an independent appraiser, that they will assess, he will assess,
the value of the business to be transferred. And also the 20% penalty, I mean for the
change of control.

FINAL

Regarding other information on the carrying value, Andrew, we do not publish, I mean, we
do not disclose this information. The ﬁnancial report, the management discussion &
analysis, on Page 5, there is a disclosure. The main, the main metrics, for BANKIA MAPFRE
VIDA, in that case, those are the statutory, let's say the numbers from the statutory
accounts. And from BANKIA MAPFRE VIDA it's premiums, net results, and net equity and
also a balance sheet metrics for the full year 2020 and also for the ﬁrst quarter. But we do
not publish the carrying value of our business with Bankia.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Together linked, always linked with the same topic. Andrew Sinclair from Bank of America
is asking just to get the latest update on the PC side - has distribution of MAPFRE
products now ceased? And what was -- and what renewal experience are you seeing so
far for customers previously sourced through Bankia?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

This is a path that we walked before, Andrew, this is a very interesting question. And
because we have terminated, because it wasn't in our wish, but we have terminated
because of the circumstances and reasons other bancassurance agreements. And let's
say MAPFRE is very well prepared. It happened with -- originally with BBVA with our
coinsurance agreement to sell Automobile, and also with Caixa and then later with
DUERO. I mean we have a lot of power I mean, ready to reinforce our retention
procedures in order to keep the portfolio. This is a business we pay that was retained in
our books.
So far, I mean is that we are an early stage and even we do not have ﬁgures, I mean for
April. But let's say that we are quite positive. And so renewals from the portfolio, and
portfolio means Non-Life policyholders till 31st of March, we will protect, because it's our
business.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much, Fernando. Marina from JB capital is asking, where do you see
your Solvency II at the end of the year? Is there any negative impact that we should be
factoring in going forward?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Marina. We should expect Solvency II ratio to move between, just my guess,
between 190 and 195. The only if you call extraordinary or let's say recurring on a quarterly
basis is the transitional eﬀects for provisionals that is like a one point something I don't
remember 1.5 I guess, that we will book in the ﬁrst quarter. But -- and also as you know we
published as well, I mean the exit of Bankia will have a signiﬁcant impact on Solvency II. We
already know it, but only the exit or the reduction of the SCR will be like a 6 point at least
in the Solvency II ratio. But we have to know this before any speculation.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay. To sum up, there's no negative impact that we are expecting on this.

No, no negative impact. I mean, it will be positive in any case, but in this range between a
190 and 195, I will highlight that this it is not included this six-point uplift from Bankia.

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay, thank you very much Fernando. Alexander Evans -- Alex Evans from Credit Suisse is
asking Solvency II ratio is now back towards the middle of -- the middle end of your range.
I mean in fact is in the, right in the middle. Where do you view yourself an adequate level
of capital at this current environment? Is there any need to hold more because of impacts,
like we have seen in LATAM this quarter?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

We're quite comfortable in this range of the target, it's not a target, it's a framework of
200% with a 25 percentage points tolerance, higher -- lower and higher ends. We don't
see any additional capital needs from Latin America. Even some of the countries
particularly in Colombia for instance in which we have a production on business, we're
holding quite let's say prudent solvency ratios. And -- but let me say as well, which is key
for us is keeping the current ratings at this level at A plus. And let's say that we set 200%
Solvency II ratio based on maintaining I mean the current ratings for ﬁnancial strength.

Bloomberg Transcript

And so far, let's say that we shouldn't expect any change in both, as long as there is no
change in the capital models of both ratings agencies, I mean Fitch and Standard & Poor's.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Fernando. Now we're going to move to the MAPFRE RE which had
an outstanding quarter, I mean going back to good proﬁtability. The ﬁrst one is coming
from Paco Riquel from Alantra and he is asking, can you update the business interruption
losses at MAPFRE RE?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes. We published in the ﬁnancial report, Paco. there is just 4% increase in the cost, in the
accumulated cost of the COVID-19 losses. And I mean it's a negligible increase, and it's
based on just an update of the provision. Also, we have published as well the amount of
provisions, outstanding provisions as of March. If you see numbers practically there is no
payments so, practically is the same, the COVID losses from last year and also this EUR4
million increase.
And there is not any signiﬁcant change. We assume that there are losses, there are claims
that they're going to last in our balance sheet for more than months. And there are a lot
of diﬀerent interpretations and probably some litigation as well, and we had to wait some
rulings as well. But so far, the good thing is that there is not any negative impact on both -I mean the valuation or the expectations of any negative run-oﬀ.

Okay. Another question related with MAPFRE RE coming from JB Capital from Marina, and
she says that RE had a solid set of results. Should you, should we assume positive
dynamics will continue for 2021. And Evan -- Alex Evans is asking, what would be a fair run
rate for a yearly NatCat losses? I mean, it's most related with the activity of MAPFRE RE.

FINAL

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Marina. This expression I mean, it comes from my heart, to say MAPFRE
RE ﬁnally, I mean some of you mentioned that we need a quarter without any
extraordinary I mean topic on MAPFRE RE. Finally, I mean, we had one. And this is the ﬁrst
quarter of 2021.
And the solid performance is based on of let's say stricter underwriting processes; we've
retained less risk on global risk, so less exposure. And also and as you know the market is
hardening particularly in reinsurance on those geographies that were aﬀected by CAT
losses, NatCat losses. I will mention obviously Puerto Rico, but as well the U.S. and also
Japan in the past.
So let's say, that let's keep our ﬁngers crossed. MAPFRE RE will keep this performance
across the regions and also across lines of business. And hopefully, I mean we have a very
good return to a stable proﬁtability for this unit.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

That's our hope of course. There's a comment - Paz Ojeda is asking us from Banco de
Sabadell. She's asking us to do some comments on the performance of the Northeast
region that seems a little bit for her a little bit weak but with stronger deterioration in the
combined ratio, what is related to -- is this related to one-oﬀs?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Let's say thank you, Paz. Let's say that North America, I mean there are diﬀerent
interpretations. I mean, ﬁrst on top-line, on premiums, we're not satisﬁed. There are both
effects - I mean ﬁrst is currencies but the second is the lack of new business. And
practically Northeast has been in a lockdown permanent situation. There is no new cars
sold in this territory. So let's say, that premiums are hurt by this situation. On the combined
ratio, I wouldn't say that. I mean, we're happy. I mean it's let's say is a very good number,
a very good ratio.
And if you compare I mean with recurring combined ratios as well for the last quarter
2020, it's quite similar. And the only unit in which there is a diﬀerence and it's seasonality,
the explanation as well, is Brazil, in which there is a slight increase in combined ratio. But
the remaining units is quite similar; the ﬁrst quarter is quite similar to the fourth and the
third. And we should expect a similar trend for the second at least quarter of 2021. I
mentioned as well and Felipe said that the ﬁrst quarter 2020 should be considered as a
peak COVID quarter. so let's say the comparison is not apples to apples, when we put the
2021 numbers and compare it with the previous quarter.

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay. We have a question coming from Alex Evans of Credit Suisse. Have been any
remittances back to the group in the quarter? Coming from the dividend flow from,
subsidiaries coming from back to the company -- to the main company. I think that there's
was no declaration of main dividends in the first quarter but the second quarter is acting
as expected. So probably most part of not in the totality, the dividend that we are
announcing and we're going to pay against 2020 financial year is going to be paid with a
dividend coming naturally from the rest of the group.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Also the dividend will be paid in April this year, this month, sorry. And also it's important to
mention we hedged U.S. dollar for the dividends coming from the U.S. And we booked a
good proﬁt as well. Well let's say, we oﬀset part of the loss.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

That -- we stabilized the profit from the U.S. and the change from the U.S. to the euro.
Marina from JB Capital. She's asking, could you update us on the contract with PEMEX in
Mexico. How is it going? Has it been renewed?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. This is a two-year policy. Thank you, Marina. It expires in June, if I remember well. It
would be the fourth time that we are tending I guess we will participate in the tender. And
also we will be more than honored if ﬁnally I mean, we are the company that they cover
damages from PEMEX. I mean it's a quite -- it will be the fourth renewal. I mean, this is
very important for MAPFRE. It gives us a lot of conﬁdence and also, let's say -- I mean, it's
a good ﬂagship policy, I mean, for MAPFRE in LATAM.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay, good. There is a question coming from Jonathan Denham from Morgan Stanley.
And he's, he's asking about Linea Directa. I mean, he's asking if the listing of the company
will change the competitive environment in Spain.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

I don't expect, Jonathan, any change in the, particularly in the Motor line of business in
Spain. I mean it's very good. I mean, to have rather than two, three entities listed in the
Spanish stock market. We're happy. I mean, having another peer being public. And also it
gives a lot of transparency as well to the market. But I don't see any change in the
strategy coming from Linea Directa in that way.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Fernando. We have now question coming from Alex Evans of Credit
Suisse, and it's related with the Asistencia business. Is it possible to keep some details on
the losses as a lot of companies are now reporting positive travel results from the lower
rate? Lower travel sorry.

Yes. There is a disclosure on the page 35. We disclose losses by regions and also by
coverage. As you see as you could see, I mean, out of this EUR2 million net loss for the
entire unit, EUR5.4 million are coming from travel insurance. And I can say that most of
them EUR3.7 million -- it's in the chart - is coming from the UK, and also France, and
Belgium. We'd practically, I mean close this business so most of this is coming from the
UK.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay, thank you very much Fernando. Ivan from Barclays is asking that, saying that the
interim report also talks about other disposals like the annuity portfolio in Chile, Industrial
RE, Rastreator and Preminen. How substantial could these transactions be if completed to
your 2021 result?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Yeah, thank you Ivan. They are minor disposals. Regarding MAPFRE, but I can give you
more information regarding this. Regarding Industrial RE, it's a small subsidiary, practically
with no activity, like a EUR35 million, if I remember well, total assets. So if there is a proﬁt
that -- we should expect a proﬁt, but it will be extremely small.
Regarding Rastreator and Preminen, I mean the two subsidiaries with business with
Admiral, let's say that in that case we should expect a higher gain, and probably we can
get it, I mean one of these days, I mean anytime soon. We've been told by Admiral that is
practically coming to an end, I mean discussions. So probably we'll see one of these days.
It will be a little bit higher, probably in the 2-digit area.
Regarding other in Chile, Chile is the project that I mean, probably is one of the projects
that is taking longer time, I mean, for MAPFRE M&A department. I guess is more than two
years. In that case, it's like a EUR115 million assets to be transferred to the potential buyer.
And in that case, the result will be probably, I mean, since the -- this is some unmatched
annuities and we don't like to have -- to hold it in our balance sheet, probably we will
report a small loss but one single-digit loss in any case.
But all-in-all I mean those are small transactions. We want to let's say improve our capital
allocation. Those are non-strategic activities, and we will keep on this streamlining
processes in order to have a better capital allocation. The one that will be important that
we will focus on is the Bankia exit, obviously.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Thank you very much Fernando. Now, we have a number of questions related with the
impact of the COVID in the frequency in Motor, and the Motor activities in the combined
ratio. First one is coming from Ivan from Barclays and he's asking, Motor combined ratio
across the business has improved by 2.4 percentage points in ﬁrst quarter 2021 year-onyear, which appears reasonably low to the -- for the substantial drop in driving globally,
including Spain and the U.S.

As the world comes back from the lockdown what run rate do you expect for the
remainder of the year? Andrew Sinclair from Bank of America, He's asking, can you
provide an update on the latest trends for Motor frequency beneﬁts? How much do you
allow it for your EUR700 million of net income guidance for the year? Marina Massuti from
JB Capital, Could you please touch more on the claimed ratios? Do you expect claims
ratios in Non-Life to normalize? Do you expect the speed to be diﬀerent across regions?
How do you see the combined ratio for Motor evolving during the second half 2020? And
Alex Evans from Credit Suisse. How would you categorize the net impact you have seen
from lower mobility versus COVID losses in the quarter.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

A lot of questions, and believe me even in the best moment of my life, I wouldn't be able
to answer these questions. I mean, as I mentioned at the beginning of the Q&A, let's say
the increase of mobility and economic recovery will depend on the pace of vaccination
basically, across the regions. What we see is sort of asymmetric trends in diﬀerent
countries. Hopefully, I mean. But particularly in the U.S. we're seeing a nice bounce in
recovery in the economy. And also we'll see as well in Spain. But in other countries
extremely diﬃcult.
What I can say at the moment is that the, with the information we have, and we stick to
the 95% combined ratio for the Non-Life business, for the Non-Life lines that we
published at the AGM. But what we should expect is a sort of variation, fluctuation in
trends across the regions and also, across the lines of business. And one quarter ago, I
mean, nobody in MAPFRE expected a dramatic increase in Life Protection combined ratio
as the one we published this quarter.
On the other hand I mean combined ratio on other Non-Life lines of business is
performing quite well because of the lack of economy. Everybody wants to have a full
recovery, and -- but we're going to see a quarter by quarter it's a sort of catch up of
activity, and also of increase of mobility. But so far, the longest scenario I can give you is
just the 95% combined ratio for this year, sorry about that.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. Thank you very much, Fernando. Understand perfectly well. There is a
question related to the emerging markets. Marina Massuti from JB Capital is asking how
do you see the outlook evolving of the emerging markets which have been heavily
impacted by the pandemic?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Let's say that more promising than one quarter ago. And even today, I mean there is a
nice rebound as well or this week, by the Brazilian real, that it was the one that hit our top
line, basically our top line or net [profit] during this ﬁrst quarter.
But the most relevant and -- as you know, is the Mexican peso, Colombian peso, Peruvian
peso, and above them the Brazilian real and the U.S. dollar. As long as the U.S. dollar
Page 15 of 18

FINAL

remains in a range between USD1.20- USD1.22, we're ﬁne. But -- and also as you see as
well in the, I mean, they are not emerging countries, but it is the one that moves really the
equity base for MAPFRE. And the real between this range of BRL6.4 and BRL6.7 we ﬁnd as
well. Other emerging countries' currencies such as Turkish lira, doesn't have a signiﬁcant
eﬀect and because after year-by-year depreciation, the base for devaluation or
depreciation is much lower.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

We have a question related on the outlook, it's coming from Paco Riquel from Alantra, and
Alex Evans from Credit Suisse. They're asking on the same topic. If we annualize the ﬁrst
quarter net proﬁt, you will fall short of the EUR700 million of net proﬁt target for 2021, and
the Bankia joint venture will be consolidated from second quarter. Do you think that the
target is challenging? And if not, what level do you see to improve profits in the coming
quarters?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Paco, Alex. I said that we're happy with -- let's say with the current result for
this quarter. As extraordinary, there is only EUR10 million capital gains, and it was the
normal peak's rotation, frankly. And we got plenty of leeway to realize extraordinary, we
didn't do it and we're not going to do it. But let's say, that the -- well we're happy and we
stick to the EUR700 million net equity guidance for the entire year.
Usually the ﬁrst quarter I mean is lower than average proﬁt contribution quarter. As I
mentioned, Gloria last year and this year Filomena, we didn't consider extraordinary. We -I'm sure, we're not going to have the same storm over Madrid in the second quarter, nor
in the third quarter. And also, the third quarter usually is by far historically is the best
quarter in terms of proﬁt contribution for MAPFRE. So I don't think it would be fair just to
multiply by 4 the recurring proﬁt for the ﬁrst quarter. So let's say that so far, if there is
nothing extraordinary, mainly from COVID, we will stick to the EUR700 million recurring net
proﬁt for the entire year.
Regarding Bankia you asked for the contribution. It was smaller than last year, I mean, the
net contribution, and let's say that it was this proﬁt from Bankia was already included in
the EUR700 million net income as a guidance.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much, Fernando, that clariﬁes very much the situation. Ivan from
Barclays is asking when looking at the gross PC premiums which were down 2.6% yearon-year in ﬁrst quarter 2021, how much of that is lower exposure, and how much is lower
price. Now that the economies are recovering and some regions are seeing inﬂationary
pressure, how do you think about your ability to increase pricing?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

As a general trend, because I don't have numbers, I mean, for each region or for any
country, Ivan, but let's say that we've seen an increase for a number of reasons. I
mentioned particularly in Spain because of the -- our brand recognition, also as well in
Page 16 of 18



FINAL

some countries in Latin America. But on the other hand, there is a decrease in premiums
and also in units in the U.S. and also, in Italy because we decided to quit this car dealers
distribution channel. On average premium, let's say that we're seeing a reduction which is
lower month-by-month on Spain and was based on this strong eﬀort to protect our
portfolio. And in the remaining regions, particularly in the U.S. I mean there is no changes
in the tariﬀs or let's say there is not any change in the average premium. And in the rest of
countries, I don't see -- I don't remember any relevance. So, so let's say most of the
growth is coming from an increase on risk number.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Thank you very much. We have a question now related with the M&A activity, coming from
Paz Ojeda of Banco de Sabadell. It is related with Italy activity. There have been a lot of
M&A operations, around Aviva and Allianz bancassurance et cetera. Could MAPFRE
consider at some point this business as non-core? She is referring to Italy.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you for the question, Paz. Regarding Italy, I mean we are focused on digital
business. When we decided to quit the car dealerships, it's because we want to
concentrate -- because it was loss making channel, obviously, first; it was 80-20 decision.
And we decided to focus on the digital channel.

Bloomberg Transcript

Obviously, we're selling as well digital business with white brands as well in other
countries, particularly in Germany, where we have agreements with some car makers. And
probably we can do as well.
I mean we will be quite active in looking for digital business growth in both countries. But I
don't see, let's say any standard bancassurance agreement because we have a digital
business just in Italy.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

And no disposal in Italy?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

And no disposal, absolutely.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. It seems that there are no more questions. So we come to
the end of the meeting. Thank you very much. Thank you, Fernando. Before we close the
call today and moving on to logistics, next Wednesday, the 5th, we will be hosting two
group meetings during the afternoon. First, there will be a group in Spanish at 4 o'clock
Madrid time followed by another group in English at 5:15 Madrid time. Both meetings
would last around 45 minutes, and as we published updated provisional Solvency II ﬁgures
applying the partial internal model as well as our 2020 embedded value disclosure, these
meetings will be a good opportunity for any questions you may have on those topics.
