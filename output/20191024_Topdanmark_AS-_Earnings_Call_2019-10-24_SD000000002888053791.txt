Welcome to the presentation of Topdanmark's results for the ﬁrst 3 quarters of 2019.
Despite a negative investment return, proﬁt after tax for the ﬁrst 3 quarters amounted to
DKK 1.150 billion, up from DKK 1.071 billion in the ﬁrst nine months last year. The
combined ratio improved to 82.1% compared to 84.2% in the same period last year.
Premiums increased by 2.4% in nonlife and by 13.5% in life.

Bloomberg Transcript

For full year 2019, the assumed combined ratio has improved between 85% and 86% to
between 84% and 85%, excluding run-oﬀ in Q4. And the proﬁt forecast model for 2019
has been improved by DKK 50 million to between DKK 1.3 billion and DKK 1.4 billion,
excluding run-oﬀ in Q4.
For 2020, we assume a premium growth in nonlife that is on the same level as in 2019 and
a combined ratio of around 90%, excluding run-oﬀ. These are the main points of my
presentation.
Pretax earnings increased by DKK 65 million to DKK 1.436 billion. The technical nonlife
proﬁt increased by 130 -- by DKK 172 million to DKK 1.260 billion. The improvement was
due to higher run-oﬀ proﬁt and a lower claims trend on the SME and the agricultural
business. On the other hand, the discounting had a negative impact on the technical
result due to a lower yield curve.
The investment return in nonlife decreased by DKK 222 million to a loss of DKK 145
million. And negative investment return was, accounting-wise, negatively impacted by
DKK 260 million, owing to a lower volatility adjustment component, primarily as a
consequence of a change in the method for calculation.
In Q3, the investment return was furthermore negatively impacted by a negative return on
Danish mortgage bonds. Proﬁt in life insurance increased by DKK 109 million to DKK 291
million due to a higher investment return and an improved risk result.
The claims trend improved by 1.8percentage points to 66.4% in the ﬁrst 3 quarters this
year. Adjusted for run-oﬀ proﬁts, weather-related claims, large-scale claims and other

positions, including change of risk margin, the claims trend deteriorated by
0.2percentage points to 70.3%.

FINAL

The adjusted claims trend improved in all major product lines, except house, illness and
accident. And workers' compensation. But the yield curve used for discounting the
reserves was lower compared to the ﬁrst 3 quarters last year, thus having a negative
impact on the claims trend of 0.7percentage points.
Premiums increased by 2.4% in life. In nonlife, the premium growth was split between
8.6% increase in the private segment and a 4.6% increase in the SME segment. The
premium growth in the private segment was negatively impacted by lower sales of illness
and accident insurance and by the termination of the distribution agreement with Danske
Bank at the end of Q2. We continue to assume a premium growth for 2019 higher than
the 1.7% growth in 2018.
As stated, the combined ratio was 82.1% in the ﬁrst 3 quarters of 2019, an improvement
from 84.2% in the same period last year. For the full year, we have adjusted the assumed
combined ratio from between 85% and 86% to between 84% and 85%, excluding run-oﬀ
in Q4. This improvement is caused by the positive development in Q3 with run-oﬀ proﬁts
at a lower level of large-scale claims than assumed.

Bloomberg Transcript

Proﬁt in life insurance increased by DKK 109 million to DKK 291 million because of a
higher investment return and an improved result on insurance risk. For 2019, the assumed
proﬁt in life insurance has been upgraded by DKK 20 million to between DKK 320 million
and DKK 350 million.
In life insurance company, premiums increased by 13.5%, split between a 12.5% growth in
regular premiums and a 14% increase in single premiums. Adjusted for the loss of the
distribution agreement with Nykredit, regular premiums increased by 15.4%. For 2019, the
assumed growth in regular premiums continues to be around 10%.
Excluding life and adjusted for revaluation and return on nonlife insurance provisions, the
investment return for the Topdanmark Group was a loss of DKK 51 million. This includes
the result of Topdanmark's asset management company of DKK 68 million.
The investment return was aﬀected by the change in the method of calculation of the VA
component and a market-based reduction in the VA component, which had a negative
one-oﬀ eﬀect of DKK 260 million. The changes in the VA component is solely an
accounting issue. And it has no impact on the cash ﬂow in Topdanmark.
In Q3, the investment return was hit by the sharp fall in the yield curve, which had a
substantial impact on Danish mortgage bonds market. Mortgage bonds were prepaid at
extraordinary scale and new bond issued at the lowest coupons ever. Hedge eﬃciency of
the mortgage bond portfolio was, hence, strongly reduced in Q3. And the losses due to
the poor match between assets and liabilities were only partly oﬀset by the high returns
on equities, index bonds and properties.

FINAL

Based on a number of assumptions described in the Q3 report, the assumed post-tax
proﬁt for the remainder of 2019 is upgraded by DKK 50 million to between DKK 1.3 billion
and DKK 1.4 billion, excluding run-oﬀ in Q4, representing earnings per share of DKK 15.6.
For 2020, we assume a premium growth in nonlife at the same level as in 2019 and a
combined ratio of around 90%, excluding run-oﬀ. Compared with the assumed combined
ratio of between 86% and 90%, excluding run-oﬀ for 2019 announced in the Q3 report for
2018, the assumed combined ratio for 2020 is negatively impacted by 1.6percentage
points due to lower interest rates.
