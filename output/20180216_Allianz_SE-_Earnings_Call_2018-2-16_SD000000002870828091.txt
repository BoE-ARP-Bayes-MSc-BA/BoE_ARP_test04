Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon, from my side as well. Welcome to our conference call. As you know, we have
2 presenters today. Oliver will kick it off and share his assessment of our result. And after that,
Giulio will explain the numbers in detail. We intend to keep it brief and to close the call after 90
minutes. Therefore, without any further ado, I'll hand directly over to Oliver.

Oliver BÃ¤te
Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for joining on a Friday afternoon. Oliver told me to be
quick and crisp. So since you have all the slides in front of you, I'll try to hit the highlights.
I'll start on Page A2 with the overall numbers that we've had. And I'd like to highlight a few of them.
You are all aware that we are still battling declining interest rates in our investment portfolios that
we had to deal with. They're probably the strongest NatCat year in our history as an industry and
regulation. What I think some people haven't had on their mind or, at least not in the spreadsheets,
was the development of the U.S. dollar, who has weakened significantly, as you will see later, in a
number of ways that is affecting us not just in '17 but also again in '18. So please bear that in mind.
We have worked very hard to put our capital and our investors' capital to productive use. And the
market has nicely rewarded us for that. Thank you very much. Capitalization is with 229%, very
strong. And we are, therefore, in the position to increase dividend per share to EUR 8. That is 5%
up and in line with what we've been telling you since November of 2015, that we want to grow
earnings and dividends per share by 5% on a CAGR basis. And I think again, a few people didn't
have on their mind that we're sticking to our 50% payout ratio. But given the fact that by the AGM,
we will have bought enough shares to go to 8% and still stick to the 50% payout ratio.



FINAL

We're in the process of executing the second share buyback, the EUR 2 billion, over the First
Quarter and hope to be done by April. This program will be executed. I think there were some
concerns that M&A or so would disturb that and we may stop the buyback. We will not stop the
buyback and fully execute it. And that's why it's consistent with the EUR 8 dividend per share
proposal to the Supervisory Board, who's supporting it. And then to the AGM.
Now just a quick -- a few -- a quick look at the highlights, A3. We are very proud of our colleagues
that they have weathered the NatCat season very strongly. We've turned around the LatAm
business after five years. And the results are very good. And by the way, continuously, to go better
and we are now the third largest P&C insurer in the United Kingdom with a very innovative joint
venture that we have formed with LV, strengthening our direct business in the group and
particularly strengthening our focus on client. LV is the brand with the highest customer loyalty in
the United Kingdom. There's a lot that we can learn for our customer satisfaction journey.
On the Life and Health side, really resounding success. We are close to achieving our targets for
'18 already. In '17, the value of new business is 30%. And the new business margin is 3.4% despite
again the decline in the (effective) earned rates.

Bloomberg Transcript

Asset Management has more than EUR 150 billion third-party net flows. Our AUMs have reached
the highest ever level. And that is despite the exchange rate effect that was exceeding EUR 100
billion negative. And cost-income ratio has improved by 1.5 points. So really outstanding results.
Let's look A4 that gives you a little bit of a view of what the industry losses were, EUR 100 billion
when you just take the 4 ones we've mentioned here. The Allianz share in that was negligibly small;
even the largest one, in terms of our market share, 1.7%. That's actually partially due, I think, to
some of the (remaining points) that we still have from the old Fireman's Fund portfolio. The rest
has been far below our market share. And I can only congratulate the colleagues for good
underwriting here.
Page A5 gives you a view. And we've deliberately taken '13 as a starting point because this is when
we really launched the program and accelerated in '15. At the time, we still had more than half of
our new business production in traditional products with significant long-term guarantees on the
interest rate side, not just Tom Wilson who doesn't like them. I don't like them either. So we got to
work. And now we have 76% of our new business production on the products that we'd like to be
in. Again, target for this year is 80%. And I'm very comfortable that our colleagues will achieve that.
And more importantly, we have translated that into higher new business value, 30% above the
2016 level, which was already more than 25% up from prior year.
Now on Asset Management, a fantastic story. Thank you, both colleagues in PIMCO and in AGI. A6
gives you the picture. It looks really beautiful, like if we had designed it for this chart. You have sort
of, the last time, negative flows in the Second Quarter of '16. And we have broken the waterline in
the Third Quarter of '16 already and then consistently had very strong flows. Again, in the -- we will
talk about it a little later. Also, the first two months of 2018 are very positive. In line with -- that is
the development of the 3-year outperformance versus benchmark. And again, congratulations.
91% outperformance is a spectacular number. And with the flows obviously and the efficiency
programs that we had launched, you'll also see the result in improving margin. I think we're one of
the few places in our industry where you actually not just have very strong flows. I would bet that in
the active management arena, you will hardly find any other company with a strong level of flows
but also really driving productivity up.
Now that leads me to Page A7, capital. We have had that in -- over the last two years. And we have
the aim to return over this year more than EUR 5.4 billion in cash that makes us in 13 -- EUR 23
billion in cash returned to our shareholders. That's dividends plus share buybacks. And it includes,
obviously, our dividend and the program that we have running while at the same time, our Solvency
has improved consistently. And that's also no small feat because we did not know how the
implementation and introduction of Solvency II in '16 would work. We had a number of additional



FINAL

challenges, whether that's the volatility, adjust their changes and other things that are constantly
going against our solvency. But I can only tell you the colleagues have worked very hard and it -the solvency is strong.
Now it has to be strong and has to remain strong. And I'd like to mention that because we have a
very cautious outlook. Everybody is back (parting) because equity markets are stabilizing. We have
to be very cautious for the outlook because as central banks have to normalize our policies. As
interest rates in the U.S. have to go up to balance inflation, there will be disruptions. We said that -we said that the last few weeks. And therefore, we are remaining on the cautious side and
protecting our balance sheet.

Now we're not just using our money for buybacks. Page A8 shows you that we do something else
with it. Most of that is bolt-on, whether that's buying out the Euler minorities or investing in the joint
venture we have with LV and a couple of other things that we've done last year. We'd also like to
reiterate the point that it's not just about investing. It's also about disinvesting or divesting. And we
have finally sold OLB. We've got a portfolio in Allianz Taiwan out at least in terms of agreeing with
the buyer. And we exited the general insurance business in Korea.
So overall, we have invested about EUR 3 billion for external growth and just to say that we're in
the business of growing our business, not shrinking it to death. Therefore, we'd like to invest more
in our core business. However, the prerequisites, ladies and gentlemen, are that we earn a decent
return on these investments. And the continuous questions that we get, why are you not buy
anything larger, is not for the fact that we're not looking. But given the very high valuations in equity
markets, any acquisition at a larger scale needs to absolutely make strategic sense. But as
important it is, it needs to make sense for our shareholders. When you look at the buyback, we
know that it's an implicit sort of cost of capital of 9%. So we need to really compare an acquisition
with the impact of a buyback. And we are doing that just we -- rest assured we will not waste our
shareholders' money.
Now when you go to A9, the delivery against our targets has been very consistent through all the
years that you see on this page. And by the way, the EUR 300 million overachievement for '17 is
understated. If you take the effect into account, it would have been EUR 300 million larger. And
that's despite the fact that the euro swap rate for 10 years is still at a very low point. So we have
been able to drive profits up with very low volatility in an environment that was far from being
benign.
Because we have been able to do that -- and please turn to A10 now, we believe we are going to
get to our targets as we have set them. We've said we want an ROE of 13%. Now you say, "Well it's
only 11.8% for the year." This is a very sensitive number to very small changes particularly due to the
fact that capital moves around, in the accounting terms, FXs, for example. One of them, it was
12.2% adjusted for the OLB disposal. And we are pretty confident that we are going to get to or
very close to the 13%, which is an outstanding number given the fact that our cost of equity is -- has
been reduced to 9%.
The second thing, earnings per share growth. We've said we would like to have a 5% CAGR. We
are very confident to get to this number as we are for dividends per share. That's another 5% that
we have to deliver in '18. And again, we are highly confident that we are going to deliver that.
Now what is the outlook? What are we working on? I think some of you may be interested in what
are we working on. We have, by and large, completed our turnaround. Our colleagues in AGCS are
still working hard on the integration of Fireman's Fund that will take until about 2020 to get to the
right direct profitability levels. But by and large, in the P&C portfolio, we're done with turnarounds.
The 94% combined ratio -- Giulio will talk about it -- is very much in reach because the attritional
loss ratio is really improving net of NatCat on large losses.



FINAL

So what are we having to do going forward? We have a transformation job to do now. We have
worked on digital innovation the last 2.5 years. What becomes crystal clear is that digital is not a
sideway or something extra. It has to be introduced into the core business. And we now need to
dramatically simplify our processes and business models and take the technology to achieve much
more simpler product and services for our clients that have to be more reliable. And that's why
we're looking at customer-centricity as the #1 priority in our Renewal Agenda.
On the Life and Health side, the -- a business shift change is proceeding as expected. We're
continuously working on the in-force management. But given our level of new business profitability,
we would like to grow further. '17 was the year where we, again, grew in Life, not just new business
value but also revenues. And that we would like to continue now that we are working in the right
race car and we would like to accelerate for the future.

Asset Management. The PIMCO turnaround is complete. AllianzGI cost-income ratio has further
improved. So again, here, the story is around continued profitable growth. And we know a lot of
people are saying, "Yes. With wobbly markets, can you do that?" We believe actually that active
Asset Management will prove in a crisis -- or not prove. But we believe Allianz will prove that it's
better to be having an active management partner. And that's particularly true for fixed income
because the worse you can do is buy a passive product when interest rates rise because the only
thing you do then is lock in a loss. And so we believe it's a huge opportunity for PIMCO to show its
differentiation.
Now on capital, let me reiterate. I think we have optimized capital and cash generation. We have a
very attractive dividend policy. At the current level, it's about 5% dividend. We'll just think about
that. And I think that the markets have not really internalized Allianz' ability and willingness to
continuously grow its dividend. Now people may say, "In a rising interest rate environment, is that
really attractive?" It's highly attractive because -- I tell you it's not so clear how and when interest
rates will rise and whether they will actually compensate for the proper increase in inflation. While
in Allianz, you get that baked in. So very attractive investment. And we'll make sure that with
whatever we do, whether that's organic or inorganic, we make our cost of capital. We make the
appropriate spreads to grow the value of the company.
So Oliver, that -- was that quick enough?

Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

Perfect. Thank you.

Oliver BÃ¤te
Very good. I'll now hand over to Giulio. And we are ready for your questions thereafter.

Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Perfect. Thank you, Oliver. Good afternoon to everybody. I will go first to the Fourth Quarter results
and then speak more in details about the results for the full year 2017.
If you go to Page B3, you can see the key indicators for our Fourth Quarter. We had a good Fourth
Quarter performance. Those -- some of the minus signs on this slide might not give that
impression. But I'd like to give you some perspective. When you take the operating profit of EUR
2.8 billion and you annualize the EUR 2.8 billion, you get to more than EUR 11 billion of operating
profit, which is about the midpoint of the outlook that we had for 2017.
Also, there were 2 effects which are affecting the comparison to the prior period. First of all, the FX
development has been in our disfavor. And this has impacted our operating profit compared to the



FINAL

last year by EUR 100 million. And also, if you remember, in the First Quarter 2017, we did a
restatement for Allianz Life. That restatement caused, in the Fourth Quarter of 2016, a positive
onetime effect of EUR 140 million. So if you adjust for these 2 effects, you can see also that the
performance in the Fourth Quarter of '17 is very much in line with the performance of '16.
Also, when you look at the operational KPIs, you can see that they are improving. This is clear for
the new business margin. This applies to the cost-income ratio. But even the combined ratio is
improving. You see on this slide a deterioration of 50 basis points. Reality is if you adjust the
combined ratio for the impact of natural catastrophe, there is an improvement of over 1%.
Finally, on the shareholder net income, we have the impact coming from the disposal of OLB. And
also, we have the impacts coming from the tax reform in the United States. So all in all, when you
look at the performance of Fourth Quarter and you adjust for some special effects, this is again a
picture of resilience and good performance.

Moving to Page 5. We see here the main KPIs for the full year 2017. I'd like to highlight that we were
able to grow our revenue by 5%. This was driven by Life/Health and Asset Management. On the
operating profit, you can see that we were able to close the year in the upper half of the range.
And this is by the natural catastrophe that has impacted the industry in 2017. So that's a very good
result. Also, if you look at the comparison between 2017 and 2016, we had a negative impact due
to currency translation of EUR 140 million. So when you look at the quality of this operating profit in
2017, it's very high.
On the shareholder net income, you see a reduction of 2%. This is predominantly driven by
restructuring expenses. I'm going to come back later on this topic. On the EPS, you can see they
are generally flat. And if we adjust the EPS number for the numbers of shares that we have at the
end of the year instead of using an average, the EPS is EUR 15.5. And this will also explain our
dividend per share of EUR 8, which has increased by 5% compared to the level that we had last
year.
Moving to Page 7. We can see the development of our solvency ratio. It says improved by
11percentage points. I'm going to come back on the solvency ratio development in a slide. On the
shareholder equity, you can see there was a drop of EUR 1.5 billion. This is all driven by the impact
out of the fixed rates. On the sensitivity, they are relatively unchanged compared to the
sensitivities you saw in the Third Quarter except for the sensitivity to an up movement on the
interest rates, which went down from plus 8% to plus 2%. But in general, the picture is consistent
with the sensitivities that you saw in the Third Quarter.
Moving to Page 9. We can see here the development of the own fund and also the capital
requirements. When we look at the main drivers, we had several changes in models. And these are
explained in 9percentage points of improvement in solvency ratio. The main change was due to
the introduction on negative interest rates. The business evolution, if you take out taxes and
dividend, has contributed about 15percentage point to the improvement of the solvency ratio.
Then the market impact has been very positive. We had a situation last year where interest rates in
Europe went up. The spread have been narrowing. The markets were, in general, favorable. So all
kinds of things have moved in the right direction. This explains why we got also some positive
impact from the market development.
Under the section capital management, you see the impact from share buybacks, dividend accrual
and also the impact out of the acquisition, like increasing the stake in Euler Hermes or the
acquisition of the LV that we completed at the end of 2017. And finally, tax in the other is simply the
taxes. And plus, we had some transferability (registration), which applied to this calculation.
Some indication for the future. So our solvency ratio, it's clearly very high, 229%. We are expecting
a couple of negative impacts in the First Quarter. One is coming from the change in the way we



FINAL

are treating the deduction and aggregation for Allianz Life. This is going to impact us by
3percentage points. Also, we had the change in the UFR. This is going to impact us by 1percentage
point. Then also, we are anticipating that somehow during the year, we are going to get an impact
out of the tax reform in the United States. And we think this impact might be about 3percentage
points. So I'd like you to keep this in mind as you draw your consideration about our solvency level.
We go to Page 11. We go now into the discussion of our Property-Casualty segment. You can see a
growth rate of 2.3%. And in general, you can see also that most of our companies have been able
to post a positive growth rate. There are just a couple of exceptions. But in general, we have a
good picture in the sense of the growth that we have been able to achieve. Even more important
is the outlook for 2018. And right now, we think that the rate changes we're going to see moving
into '18 that they will be either stable or positive. So this is fundamentally a benign outlook as we
go into 2018.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving to Page 13. You can see the development of the operating profit by drivers. And also, you
can see the combined ratio development. The combined ratio has deteriorated by 90 basis points.
This is, however, driven by the impact of the natural catastrophe. Indeed, if you do a calculation
where you adjust the combined ratio for the natural catastrophe and also for the runoff -- so if you
go to a sort of accident here, combined ratio adjusted for catastrophe, you can see that there was
an improvement of 40 basis points compared to the prior period.
We always do our normalization of the combined ratio where we adjust the combined ratio for the
differential between the extra cat losses and our average expectation. We adjust the combined
ratio for the actual runoff and what we think is a mid; or long-term expectation. And also, we adjust
the combined ratio for the impact of weather-related and large losses. When we do this
normalization, our combined ratio has improved compared to the prior period. And it is slightly
north of 94.5%. So now the question is how we go from 94.5% plus to 94%. 30 basis points will
come from expense ratio. We are very committed to reduce our expense ratio from 28.7 to 28.4.
And the other 30 basis points that we need together, they would come from underwriting
discipline. And as I was talking before, also, the environment seems to be rather benign. So we are
confident that we're going to get to the 94% combined ratio in 2018.
Moving to Page 15, this is more for your eyes. You can see here the operating profit development
of the different company and also their combined ratio. In general, you see that the majority of the
companies had a positive performance. There are a couple of exception, like Germany or AGCS. In
that case, these 2 companies have been affected by natural catastrophe and also, in the case of
Germany, weather-related losses. In the case of AGCS, there were some large losses more than -at least expect in our trend. But in -- overall, I think this is a strong picture. We should keep in mind
there are not many companies in the insurance industry, property-casualty, that have -- had these
kinds of results. And despite 2007 (sic) (2017) having been the costliest year for the insurance
industry in cat losses, we were able to keep the performance of the segments within the target
range. So I believe this is a strong achievement for our Property-Casualty segment.
Going to Page 17. You can see the development of the investment results, which has been
relatively flat, if you want. So there was just a decrease of about EUR 65 million. What happened
here -- clearly, we are still suffering from the decrease in interest rates. But on the other side, our
investment income on equity has partially compensated for that. So the development that you see
in 2017 has been relatively benign and, indeed, a little bit above of our expectation.
Now we can go into the Life/Health segment. In the Life business, our production went up about
4%. This is something different compared to what we saw in 2016. In 2016, as we were trying to
change the business mix, our production went down compared to the level of 2015. Now you can
see that we are capable to change our mix and also to get growth into the system. When you
combine this growth with an improvement in margin of 70 basis points, the result is that the new
business value is going up by 30%.



Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

On the quality of the business, as you know, we have a target to achieve 80% of production in
capital-light products. This is the target for 2018. We are now at 76%. Last year, we were at 72%. So
you can see there is an improvement. And we are confident that by 2018, we are going to get to
our target of 80%.
Moving to Page 21. You see the operating profit for the Life segment. That's a EUR 4.4 billion
operating profit, which is record profit for the Life segment and also above the target stage. When
you look at waterfall by profit sources, you see a lot of movements. In the case of the loadings and
fees, this is driven by Asia and also by (production) unit-links. The investment margin, which is
negative by about EUR 400 million compared to the 2016 level, is driven entirely by the United
States, where we had the impact of the restatement that I was mentioning before. There was
about EUR 120 million. Then we had also a combination of unlocking and hedging efficiency. And
this is a swing between 2016 and 2017. In '16, the hedging efficiency and unlocking were positive. In
'17, they have been on the other side. So when you combine, you'll see a little bit of a swing, which
is, however, partially compensated in other profit sources, like in the technical margin, you see
there is an improvement of over EUR 200 million. Allianz Life is contributing EUR 180 million of
those EUR 220 million. So there is a little bit also of geography going on. Bottom line is that we
have achieved an operating profit of EUR 4.4 billion. I believe a few years ago, nobody would have
believed that the Life segment could have contributed this kind of performance.
Moving to Page 23. You see again the picture of our value of new business, new business margin,
operating profit by the different companies. When you look at the value of new business, you'll see
that there are just plus signs. So that's not only good growth at the group level. But basically, all
entities are contributing to the growth in value of new business. I'd like also to highlight Asia, which
is now contributing to our value of new business in a significant way. And after Germany and U.S.A.,
Asia is the third largest contributor to our value of new business.
Just one word on the U.S.A. since we talked so much about Allianz Life in the previous slide. When
you look at the operating profit in 2017, it's pretty much in line with the 2016 operating profit.
Indeed, if you put the numbers, U.S. dollar is basically almost flat. So all the geography and noise
that you saw on the waterfall, in reality the performance of the company, has been extremely
good also in 2017.
And with that, I would move to Page 25, where you can see that the investment margin is strong at
97 basis points. There is a reduction of 10 basis points compared to the level that we had in 2016.
These, however, are not unexpected. And indeed, we had this conversation several times in the
last quarter. We always attempt to normalize our profit a little bit below the level that we usually
see in the quarters. And also, for next year, our guidance will be that the investment margin should
be between 90 and 95 basis points. So this is our working hypothesis when we look at our
numbers for the Life segment.
And now we come to the Asset Management segment, Page 27. 2017 has been exceptional for our
Asset Management segment. We had EUR 150 billion of inflows. And clearly, PIMCO, as you know,
did the heavy lifting. But I'd like also to point out that AGI was able to change the direction
compared to 2016. In 2016, the flows in AGI were negative. And in 2017, you can see positive flows
with AGI. One thing that I'd like you all to keep in mind is when you look at the FX impact, you see
EUR 120 billion of assets, which are affected, if you're wondering, because of the exchange rate.
So this is something that we need to keep in mind. However, despite this big impact, we have
been able, in 2017, to grow our third-party assets under management.
Moving to Page 29. You can see the development or the revenue colors, basically the
development of the assets under management. So you can see an internal growth rate of about
8%. What is important for us in this slide is to look at the fee margin. When you look at PIMCO, the
fee margin is relatively consistent with the level of 2016. When you look AGI, you see there is a
deterioration of 2.4 basis points. But of this 2.4 basis point, 2 basis points are due to technical
factors and just 0.4 is real deterioration. What is important, we are looking at this measure on a



FINAL

quarterly basis, as you know. And in the last 3 quarters, this metric has been stable. So we don't
see that there is a continuous drop of the fee margin. But at least in the course of the last 2, 3
quarters, we saw stability in this KPI.
At Page 31, you can see the (power), the operating leverage, that you have in the Asset
Management segment. Clearly, where revenue are growing, the expense ratio is reducing. This
creates a situation in which the operating profit is growing more than the growth of the revenue.
Indeed, the growth in operating profit has been double digit. So very good performance from the
Asset Management segment. And as you see, they were able to grow at 10.6% despite the impact
of EUR 50 million coming from exchange rate.
Page 33. On the corporate segment, I'd just like to highlight that all subsegments have contributed
to the (positive deviation).

Bloomberg Transcript

And so we can move now to Page 35, where you can see the reconciliation between the operating
profit and the shareholder net income. As usual, you can see a lot of movement in this view. I like
to draw your attention to the restructuring charges. They went up by EUR 300 million to EUR 450
million. Of these restructuring charges, 1/3 applies to our Allianz Technology business and the rest
is -- applies to the P&C business. This also explains why we are confident about our ability to
achieve a 28.4% expense ratio in 2018. We have already taken measure that should support the
achievement of that target.
On the tax rates, as you see, despite the impact of the tax reform, the tax rate was slightly better
than what we had last year and, in general, was not so far away from what could be our
expectation moving forward. We expect the tax rate to be, if you look at the notes, 26% to 28%. I
will say 28% is a very conservative estimate. So I would say my expectation for the tax rate in 2017
is more between 26% and 27%. That should be somehow where our tax rate is going to eventually
land.
At Page 37, we can speak about the outlook. As you see, we have an outlook of EUR 10.6 billion to
EUR 11.6 billion with a midpoint of the range of EUR 11.1 billion. Now the EUR 11.1 billion is EUR 300
million over the guidance that we gave last year. What is also important to notice is when you look
at the guidance of 2017 and then you look at the guidance we are giving now for '18, the swing in
the fixed rate is about EUR 300 million. So at the end of the day, when you look on a constant fixed
basis, you can say that we are giving a guidance for 2018, which is EUR 600 million above the level
that we gave for 2017. So this is a massive improvement in the level of guidance that we are
providing when you adjust for the fixed rate.
When you look at the different segments, we expect to get to EUR 5.4 billion in Property-Casualty.
The underlying combined ratio is obviously 94%. On the Life/Health side, we expect to be at EUR
4.2 billion. As I was mentioning before, this is below the EUR 4.4 billion level of 2017. But here, we
are considering for a normalization of our investment margin. And in the case of Asset
Management, the EUR 2.4 billion, which is in line with the level that you are seeing for 2017, is
driven by the fixed effect. On a constant basis, we would expect the Asset Management business
to grow high single digit. But clearly, the depreciation of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro is
somehow offset in this operational improvement. So this is the way we determine our EUR 11.1
billion outlook for 2018.
And now moving to Page 38. We have here this (forecast) for our Renewal Agenda. And you can
see how we are doing now compared to our targets for 2018. We are confident that we are going
to get to our 5% earnings per share growth. And also, we are confident that we're going to get at
least close to the 13% ROE. Why I'm saying that? When you look at the income -- net income that
we need to get to a 5% EPS growth, we need, in 2018, about EUR 7.3 billion of net income. In 2017,
our net income was EUR 6.8 billion. And if you consider that we had some special effect in '17, if you
consider that we have a higher participation in Euler Hermes and also if you consider the swing in
the tax rate because of the United States, then I think it's relatively easy to make a possibility check



of our ability to achieve a 5% EPS growth and also to get close to our ROE of 13%. The other KPIs, I
think, I have already covered at least with respect to the financial KPIs.
And with that, I would just open up to Q&A.

(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from James Shuck with Citi.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - James Austin Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

I had 3 questions for you this afternoon, please. Firstly, the capital generation, Solvency II capital
generation, it seems like you're upping in the guidance slightly from 8 to 10 points, massive
dividends. That's what you previously guided to. And I don't think you're saying above 10 points
now, which presumably is explained by the tax situation. Could you just kind of give some insight
into the -- how you expect the SCR to evolve going forward? I think you mentioned that the Life
capital requirements are offset by the Life capital release. So should we be thinking that the SCR is
actually going to be flat going forward? And at what stage does the Life capital release kind of run
off and then you start to get an increase in the requirements from the Life side in particular?
Second question, a more general question around capital allocation within the group. But I
understand that you -- when you were kind of assessing projects and choosing to invest capital in
the group, you sort of -- you have a hurdle rate of about 15% return on capital on P&C and you
have a 3% new business margin on the Life side. Could you just kind of explain a little bit how that
works when you're trying to grow and innovate and invest? Because obviously, you don't always
get a 15% ROE to begin with in year 1. Then finally, just a quick one on the restructuring charges,
EUR 450 million. I don't remember that really being flagged. And it's sort of occurring below the
line as opposed to above the line. Can you just give an indication of the outlook there and whether
that number has actually turned out bigger than you expected?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Okay. So I can start with the question about the guidance that we are giving about the generation
capital on an organic basis. Yes. We moved the guidance up a little bit compared to what we were
saying just maybe a few quarters ago. And the reason why we move the guidance is not because
we have a different expectation on the own fund generation. But it is because we see that the
business evolution tends to be indeed favorable. And that's because of the issue you mentioned.
We see that we get capital relief coming out of the Life segment. So from that point of view,
moving forward, we would expect to see the same picture also in 2018 and also at least for the
next years. It's difficult for us to say exactly when this is going to change. But our expectation right
now will be to see this development also in the future. I'll just put a caveat. These models are very
complicated. And sometimes, they might not always give the intuitive answer. But fundamentally,
based on what we see now, we would expect to see a negative, which means positive from an
economic point of view, business evolution also, in the following years. The other question was on
the capital allocation. So what we do when we speak about capital allocation, I'd like to go back to
the topic that Oliver raised before. We are going to -- we are looking somehow at what are the
possibilities that we have to invest capital. And then we look at what is the cost of equity or cost of
capital or the opportunity we are looking into. And usually, we try also to achieve a spread clearly
above the cost of equity. And this is how we are determining capital allocation. And clearly, we
have different cost of equity dependent on the segment. But also different cost of equity
dependent on what is the profile of the opportunity we are looking into. So this is the way we are
allocating capital. And the final question was about the restructuring charges. We had overall EUR
450 million restructuring charges. I think your question was whether this was unexpected. No,
because clearly, we are controlling how much restructuring we want to do. So this was not a
surprise to us. And the second point is what is the expectation for, let's say, 2018. I would say that if
you do a sort of average between '17 and '16, you might get close to what the expectation could
be for this year.



FINAL

Q - James Austin Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Can I get just a quick follow-up in terms of the capital allocation within the group? I think my
question wasn't so much to do with kind of M&A starting. It's more to do with how the individual
business units are competing for capital within the group and the actual internal hurdle rates that
you want them to achieve. So I thought that in Property and Casualty, the capital -- there was a
hurdle rate of about 15%. And in Life, you need to make a new business margin of 3%. But please
contradict me if I'm wrong. But if that's the case, they both sort of have implications for how you
allocate capital based on growth and innovation.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yes, okay. I mean, okay, on this one -- okay, in the case of Life, we had a 3% new business margin.
And also we have a clear statement we want always to be at 10% ROE. In the case of P&C, we are
not speaking of 15% ROE. You might remember maybe 15% RoRC, which is a little bit of a
difference metric. But if I translate this into ROE, I will say that on the P&C segment, we -- definitely,
we expect also to have at least 10% ROE. The situation is we are doing more than 10% ROE on the
P&C segment. And by the way, also, on the Life segment, the ROE in 2017 was 12%. So we have a
target where every company should be at least at 10%. But we shouldn't forget that the ROE of
the segment is 12%. And this is an ROE without any leverage. So when you put leverage into the
question, we are speaking of a 14% ROE in the Life segment.

We'll go next to Peter Eliot with Kepler Cheuvreux.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

I had 3 questions, please. The first one was on M&A. I know you can't comment on market rumors
and thank you very much for the comments you've already given, Oliver. But could you also confirm
that you were still only really looking at friendly deals? And within that, could you also give us a bit
of color on your strategy for asset gathering in Italy especially in light of the 8% ROE that the Life
segment shows there? The second one is on the solvency modeling changes. Can you explain
what led to the -- exactly what led to the 10-point increase that we saw in Q4? And also, what
caused the sensitivity to interest rate increases to fall? Because the plus 50 basis points went from
8 points in Q3 to 2 points at full year. And finally, on the outlook. Sorry if I missed it. But I was a little
bit surprised that the corporate and consolidation showed you're going to a bigger loss in 2018
than 2017. Sorry if I missed that comment. But could you explain why that's the case?

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
Yes. Thank you for the question. I'll start with M&A. Yes. Absolutely, we do only friendly deals
because otherwise, you destroy value. I can hardly imagine one -- maybe there is one, that one
would do unfriendly. But practically, I have never seen it in our industry. And certainly, Allianz would
not want to do that. Then on the background asset gathering in Italy, we are very happy there were
some rumors that we would do something with the asset gathering strategy. No. In Italy, we're
super happy. We are growing very fast both in the Life side and with Allianz Bank. By the way, I
would like to mention their outstanding performance in the last year. What we are now trying to do
in the Life side in Italy, grow our risk business. So while the ROE is very high, what you also have at
the other side is what is the net number of earnings, I think. So that the absolute amount of
earnings can increase in terms of -- given the strong distribution power we have in Italy. So we are
building a risk product strategy now at the moment that is in full swing. We have plans to grow on
the Health side. So we believe it's a fantastic franchise. And we're just starting. And with that, I'll
hand over to Giulio for the solvency and the corporate segment question.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yes. Talking about the impact from the model changes, as I said before, this was 9%. That was
primarily driven by the change in interest rates. So the introduction, negative interest rates and -or the 9percentage points, 6percentage points is coming from the introduction or the negative



FINAL

Bloomberg Transcript

interest rate. On this 6percentage point, we need to consider that at the end of 2016, we had put
a sort of buffer because we were not able to model the negative interest rate into our Solvency II
calculation. This buffer was 2%. So in reality then, at the end, the calculation showed up to be
favorable. But the real swing will be 4percentage point. The question remains anyway why in
introduction, negative interest rate might be a positive rather than a negative. The point is that
when we were using the old model, which didn't allow interest rate to go negative, then the
calibration or the scenarios around the central estimate gets really counterintuitive. And so we
were exposed to an upshot in interest rate of about 12percentage point after one year, just to
simplify the story. Clearly, this is not something intuitive. And clearly, as we have introduced a new
calibration, now we get a better quality of scenarios. What I'd like all of you to keep in mind, when
we speak of Solvency II, we are speaking of a model which is trying to capture what can happen in - with a probability of 0.4%. So clearly, when you run all these scenarios, you might get sometimes
to very counterintuitive results. And the new model is now producing scenario which -- if you were
more consistent with what one could expect. So from that point of view, if you want, is an
improvement of the entire model and this is not just about introducing negative interest rates. The
consequence also of introducing this model is that we have more capacity. And you see this
reflected in the sensitivity. So the sensitivity are now different. It is, at the end of the day, driven by
the same reason, different scenario, different calibration and this is what the model is telling us
that we have more capacity in our Solvency II calculation. Then you had a question about the
outlook for corporate. And you miss the comment because I didn't make the comment. But it's a
fair point. So indeed, if you look at comment about the segment, we had said there that in 2017
and also in '15 and '16, in the last three years, we had a positive impact of EUR 150 million. And we
always disclosed that, by the way, in the First Quarter. And this impact is going away starting 2018
and this impact is due to a cost allocation scheme between the holding and the German
companies and because of the policyholder participation, this was creating a positive contribution
to our operating profits. So this is going away and this explains why our outlook for the corporate
segment is -- was compared to what we had in '17.

We'll go next to Michael Huttner with JPMorgan.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

I have 3 questions. One is on the -- my colleagues asked me not to ask that question. But I couldn't
make sense of it. This is the phrase you used or I saw in Bloomberg, "Too many share buybacks
lead to greed." If you could -- I don't know. Any comment would be helpful. On more detailed
questions, when you look at deals, what are kind of funding constraints you look at? I noticed the
leverage is relatively high. So if you were -- if I were to -- I'm not owning your company. But if I were
to own the company, I'd love to -- and if I were looking at a really attractive deal, I would actually
also consider rights issues and that would be the question. Then the last one is on the U.S. tax, you
mentioned this negative impact of 3%, which, I guess, works out about EUR 1 billion in available
capital. What does that do to the internal cash flow? Does it mean you have to put cash into the
U.S. or you suddenly get a shortfall of dividends for two years? And how does that impact your -how you look at dividends and buybacks and things?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Okay. On the 3 questions you asked, Michael, I could get one. I answer the question regarding -we can answer the other 2 -- on the funding constraints for M&A. I will say, it depends on how you
define funding constraints. If you define funding constraints in the sense of just utilizing cash and
debt. This depends on the size of the acquisition. If you assume that we had the ability to raise
equity, then I would say the funding constraints are not really (inaudible) unless we get extremely
creative. So -- but if you refer to cash and debt, I will not give you a number. But I will say we have
definitely the opportunity to do an acquisition, which is, let's say, higher than putting together
(inaudible) just to give you an idea. The other 2 questions really you need to tell me because I
didn't get.

(inaudible).

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Yes. The first one was about the Bloomberg citation, "Too many share buybacks lead to greed." I
didn't understand what that could imply...

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Too many share buybacks lead to greed...

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Too many share buybacks lead to greed. That's what it says on Bloomberg. Yes. Then the second
one was in the U.S. tax -- cash flow. So you've got a note that solvency will be reduced because of
U.S. tax changes. That means you need more capital, that's about $1 billion. And I just wonder what
does that do to cash flow? How you looked internally at dividends and buybacks?

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
Michael, could you also, on the first question, say who was quoted. So we know who should answer
on Bloomberg on what?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

I have no idea. It just says -- it just says it's in inverted signs. (And answers) -- this is -- I'll cite you, it's
line 52 according to Bloomberg News. And the answer is BÃ¤te, "Too many share buybacks leads
to greed." That's the citation.

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
Ah. So it's me. So from this morning. So my English was so bad (inaudible). I think what the
message is that one has to be very careful which instruments used. It depends always on where is
the share price trading, what is the right mechanism you can also always think about dividend
increases. So we are not hooked on one particular mechanism. I think that's very important.
Second, you obviously have cases in this industry and others where management stops thinking
really about investing capital in its own business to innovate and grow and rather focuses on just
repatriating capital (return). So what we are having us a framework is very simple to say, we want to
invest the capital that our shareholders have entrusted with the best returns that we can achieve
for them. And therefore, the buyback or other mechanisms, capital repatriation are always the
benchmark. But what we would like to do, obviously, is that we would like to invest it into the core
business and grow it. So the quotation was in the sense of we would like, over time, to grow the
business organically and organically (sic) (inorganically) and, therefore, people should not
continuously pencil in billions and billions of share buybacks over the next few years. There might
be other mechanisms to invest the capital properly. And we will always look out for your interest.
But the key thing is, we would like to grow this business profitably in the way to grow jobs,
customer satisfaction and shareholder value, where we do not have the intention to put Allianz in
either mental or practical runoff. Is that a proper answer?

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Yes. That is a very nice answer.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yes. Then on the question of the cash flow or the impact of the change in the capital because of
the tax reform. We need to distinguish what happens at our level and what might happen at Allianz
Life level. So we assume that NFC capital is going to go up. In the case of the Solvency II



FINAL

calculation, we are taking this number. We are multiplying the NFC requirement by 1.5. And then
also we are deducting 50 -- starting in Q1, we are going to deduct 50% of this number from the -on (funds). So this is going to happen automatically. In the case of the United States, what counts is
going to be the reaction of the rating agency to this change in regulation. So if the rating agencies
are going to adjust their threshold level, the reality now is going to happen from the point of view
or the ability of Allianz Life to pay dividend to Allianz SE. In the case the rating agencies are not
going to adjust the threshold or they're not going to adjust completely the threshold, this would
have an impact on the distribution dividend to Allianz SE. We are running clearly some scenarios. I
will tell you that, that might be a situation where for the next two years, we are going to get
instead of, let's say, EUR 400 million to EUR 500 million dividend, we are going to maybe able to
get EUR 250 million dividend and that will be maybe a possibility. But again, it might be that Allianz
Life is going to be able to continue to pay dividend in the same amount as before in the case the
rating agencies are going to give full credit for the change in tax rates.

We'll go next to Farooq Hanif with CrÃ©dit Suisse.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

You mentioned in-force management of the Life business during your introductory speech. Now
the low-hanging fruit has probably been addressed into the ALM and Solvency II. What kind of
things are you looking at? And how material could they be? Secondly, Allianz Partners continues to
grow at really strong rates. So it's, I think, 13% to 14% of the Fourth Quarter. I mean, soon it's going
to become your second largest business at this rate in the next 2, three years. Is that what you
want it to be? I kind of -- you mentioned travel insurance, is that the real reason why it's growing?
And the last question I had was just a bit more detailed AGCS pricing. So it turned sort of neutral to
positive in your -- in 2017, is it going to be more materially positive, let's say, 2% to 3% in '18?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

So maybe starting from the Allianz Partners, we don't expect them to become our biggest
business in the next 4 or five years. But we still expect to see growth in Allianz Partners and growth
is coming definitely from the travel business. But we see also growth in some part of our
international health business and also, we see some growth in the so-called business, it's called
NEXtCARE. So there are a few growth engine in Allianz Partners. This growth engine should make
sure that there is enough diversification for them to continue to grow. But clearly, the expectation is
not to see that they are going to grow forever. But we see that is -- also, that's more important
expectation that they're going to grow at a profit. So we really see this company in a positive
trajectory for the next 2, three years. And then it's hard for us to make any prediction beyond that.
On AGCS and the pricing, we see that there is and you heard that definitely also from others that
there is some positive development on the pricing side. If you are then referring to the quality of
the business that we have because the combined ratio has been disappointing and that's not just
because of cat losses. But we had also some large losses. What we do to make sure that the
quality of the business is the right one, every time we get large losses, we have a sort of loss
review. And this is the way you can determine whether the large losses you are getting are
because of bad luck or if you are getting large losses because you have some issues in your
underwriting capabilities. The outcome out of these large losses is that we -- review is that we
believe is more due to bad luck. So we're kind of confident about the ability of AGCS to underwrite
properly. And also if you ask me what will be a driver of improvement for next year in our
combined ratio, we'll definitely assume that unless there are other significant cat losses, AGCS is
going to contribute to our improvement in 2018 versus 2017. Then there was another question, inforce management. Okay, what are the next steps? On the Life side, I will say, it's a point where
we are comfortable with the quality of the new business. So that's really about getting the organic
growth like we got in 2017. So we are capable to do this kind of organic growth consistently and the
quality of business we see also in the future and there is no reason why we shouldn't be able to do
that. But then this is the best way to grow a profitable book of business. And as you remember, we
have shown the calculation about what is the translation of the value of new business into
(operating) profit. So as long as we are capable to increase the value of new business, eventually



this is going to translate also in a long-term growth in operating profit. So if you ask me, it's about
doing the right thing in a consistent manner, also in the future years.

FINAL

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
And maybe I can add. There is quite a few areas that we would like to further work on. For
example, we have said in the past, we would like to grow the risk part of the insurance side. So
there's more to be done. We believe that health insurance is a very difficult business. But a strong
growth opportunity for Allianz, particular in the emerging markets. So that's where we're working
on. So we are at the beginning of the right journey not at the end of it. And actually, we have
retooled the ship in order to now full go steam (sic) (go full steam). So we need to look for
distribution opportunities and innovation. And it's a great place to be in because a lot of people
haven't even started to retune the machine. And that one I, at least, personally, am very happy.
Now the last thing is there is a lot and that is I think people do not understand the (synergy) behind
that, is the intersection between Life Insurance and Asset Management. We always look at these
segments differently. But when you look at institutional solutions, many international companies,
many pension funds, use an integrated solution set from Allianz to solve their need. It can be a
CTA here. It can be the support of a pension fund there. It can be a life insurance solution. And
people underestimate what the power of the combination is. In many markets, particularly in
Europe, we're already succeeding in the U.S. PIMCO is a strong provider for Allianz Life of North
America. So as you see pressure on margins, you can withstand this pressure much better if you
have both the life and the fund profit inside of the product rather than if you were just to wrap it
like on the Life side or you just substitute your fund provider. So we really believe in the power of
the combination. And I think it's nowhere yet to be seen in our evaluation.

The next is William Hawkins with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

On Slide B 21, could you give us a bit more color about the outlook for the 4 key segments of the
Life operating profit? So when you're talking about a EUR 200 million net decline this year, can you
just sort of help me understand how that's being driven by the 4 segments? Then once we get to
that baseline, are we assuming that the 3 kind of growth segments then start growing aggressively
and it's just guaranteed savings is falling gently or could we be more nuanced about the mediumterm outlook for those 4 segments? Then very briefly, the asset management flows, I'm sorry if
you already said this earlier this morning. But where are we on the asset management flows yearto-date, please?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Okay. Coming maybe for the last question. Year-to-date, we are at PIMCO, it's about USD 20
billion. Now coming to your question about Page 21 and, if I understood it right, it's about how we
see the operating profit by segment to develop over time, also considering the compression in
the -- or the reduction in investment margin. I would say that -- I would expect that reduction to
come through the guaranteed savings and annuities. The capital-efficient products (inaudible), we
should see growth there, also because the German product slowly, slowly is going to kick in with
some growth. So this is the area where you should see high operating profit or the unit-linked
without guarantees also because we are growing that block and protection and, hence, I would like
to see more growth there. But for the time being, we are still finding the right recipe. But that's
definitely a strategic target. So as I look into the near future, we'll say guaranteed savings and
annuities, it is rather the area where we are going to see a moderation. In the capital-efficient
product, we should see growth kicking in. Same for unit-linked and protection, I think we need to
wait before we see some -- really this number moving a little bit higher.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}



Great. So particularly in capital-efficient products, my assumption was that the U.S. could be
continuing to fade if for no other reason than the FX impact next year. But you're saying that
should be offset by Germany?

FINAL

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Okay. Sorry. I was not considering for the FX impact. Clearly, when you put FX into consideration,
then this might somehow dampen, first, the growth. But FX are moving. So I'm looking more at the
growth in operating profit from an organic point of view. But yes, you're right, once you put fixed
into the picture, you might not see that growth translated in euro in 2018.

We'll take our next question from Paul De'Ath with RBC Capital.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Paul De'Ath
A couple of questions, please. Firstly, just going back on the M&A topic. But kind of from the other
side. You obviously made a few disposals so far. I just wondered if there's anything else in the
portfolio that you're currently looking at as noncore and whether you'd be looking to release some
more capital by selling a few more things? Then the second question was on the P&C business
and the normalization that you do on the combined ratio. So -- I mean, you quote in the slides
about essentially using a 10-year average. Is that what you're thinking about when you're doing the
normalization? Or is there another number that you would use there? And linked to that on Slide -where is it, B 38, I just wanted to clarify the target for the combined ratio is 94%. Is that a
normalized combined? And if so, why is the 2017 number, not a normalized number, next to it?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Okay. I go maybe first. Okay. Let's talk about the combined ratio. Yes. The 94% is kind of
normalized in the sense of, if we're going to have massive cat losses next year, then it will be
difficult to do 94%. Or on the other side, if we're going to add on our cat losses, we would expect
to be better than the 94%. So that's a normalized view on how we derive the normalized
combined ratio. I can tell you how we do the exercise. You have almost all pieces of the puzzle. But
you don't have all pieces of the puzzle. When you go to Page 14, the -- Oliver and investor relations
guys are giving you the 10-year average of 2.1%. So we adjust the actual cat losses against the 10year average. Then you get also the average run-off that's also something that we put into the
normalization. The only piece of information that you don't have is the amount of weather-related
losses and large losses. And the only reason why we are not sharing that information with you is
because the quality of this number is a little bit more discretionary. So we don't like to give out
numbers where you might agree or disagree whether the number is actually that number or a
different number. But my point is in a situation like 2017 where you have significant natural
catastrophe activities, you can imagine there is overall a weather-related system, which is going to
create small weather-related losses that maybe they don't make to the level of a cat loss. But they
are still significant. That's the reason that if you do that normalization just based on the numbers
that you got from Oliver, you get to 95.2%. But then you can definitely assume that the level of
weather-related losses in 2017 was higher than what would be a long-term average and also in the
large losses we had a little bit of a deviation. So that's the reason why it's very easy then to go
from 95.2% to a number, which is significantly below the 95.2%.

A - Oliver BÃ¤te



FINAL

Very good. Nick (sic) (Paul), Oliver here. In addition to your question on what is to sell and not to
core, I'll give you sort of an actual number and a little bit of a facetious answer. I call -- start with the
facetious answer, is, I think, it's really, really intelligent of CEOs to go in and say, "Ha! You're a core
business, you are noncore business." By the way, the best thing is to say you are other business.
Yes. So people in these businesses, particularly those that are noncore, they feel really great when
the CEO gets that. So what we are not doing, we are not doing that. What we're looking at is very
simply economic terms. And let's get more serious, it is where are we deploying capital
inappropriately because we are not earning appropriate return. Then we try to turn it around as
we've done it in the case of Latin America and only if we find that we do not have the
management capabilities to profitably grow our business like it was in the case of Korea because
regulation in the environment is not conducive to us applying our management skill then we sell it.
But then we do sell it. Sometimes we, by the way, don't sell. We closed it down. Remember when
we started to build a direct insurance business in the United Kingdom five years ago, we tried
hard, we failed. We closed it, it costs us a lot of money, more than EUR 200 million. And then we
found a much better solution with a joint venture with LV that we believe is going to be much more
successful. So there are various ways on how to react. But we have very clear hurdle rates that our
business have to meet and if they don't meet them on a consistent basis. And we can't see
improvement in trajectory and performance, then we sell them. And I would be pretty foolish if I
would go now and here's the 3 businesses that we are looking at and we may sell tomorrow. You
will see it when it's closed or sold. Sorry for the (ambiguous) answer.

We'll go next to Nick Holmes with Societe Generale.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

I just wanted to ask about your variable annuity book. Just because it's growing so rapidly, I think
you've gone from #9 to #6. Really 2 questions. One is, is now the right time to grow when the S&P
500 may be near its peak? I mean, who knows. And secondly how confident are you that the
hedging really will protect you, if we get a more serious correction?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Thank you, Nick. Maybe we should change the way we present the numbers because what we are
referring as VA is a hybrid VA. And this has nothing to do from a risk profile with a VA business. In
reality from a risk profile, it's more like a fixed-index annuity. But just because of the way the
product is being created from a regulatory point of view for standard definition of variable annuity.
But think of that product as fixed-index annuity product. Indeed, it's even better than a fixed-index
annuity product because it's a short-duration product. So there is definitely less, less risk even
compared to fixed-index annuity product. So from that point of view, yes, I would say, it's definitely
a business that we want to grow. And yes, I think that we should make the change at the finish, or
at least, you should keep in mind when you see growth in the VA, in Allianz Life, this means growth
of the hybrid VA and upgrowth of traditional VA.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Great. Just very quickly, though, as a follow-up, I mean you are deemphasizing general accounts.
You're focusing more on risk and health. How does your strategy in America fit with that? Because I
mean, it's still a general account product, right? I mean, it's a fixed guarantee product.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

We're not really deemphasizing general account because the hybrid VA, the majority of the assets
that go into the general accounts but some of the assets have to go into a variable account and
that's the reason why because of that, it gets classified in a different way. And also because
fundamentally the customer might lose some money in a hybrid VA, which is not the case in the
fixed-index (annuity business) VA. But fundamentally, the majority of the assets are going into the
general account. With respect to protection -- growing protection in the United States, this is



FINAL

something, which is maybe not a core expertise to be perfectly blunt of Allianz Life. But we're
always looking at possibility to grow our Life business and, indeed, 2017 has been relatively
successful. So that's what we tried to do. To be completely realistic, the bulk of the business is
fixed-index annuity and there are good growth prospect in fixed-index annuity. So even if we are
capable to grow our Life block a little bit more, this is still going to be compared to the big block
and not the most relevant parts of the business of Allianz Life.

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
Maybe Oliver can follow up with you on the risk profile. It's really attractive from a risk and a
hedging standpoint. And we are -- actuary is nodding very quickly because we got -- for a long
time, thinking about innovation to give the clients the variability of the outcomes and the upside.
But making sure we have all the hedging under control. And I think it's a very nice innovation for you
to look at.

A - Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

Sure. Nick, I would be happy to do that, of course.

Operator
We'll go next to Vinit Malhotra with Mediobanca.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

So just 3 questions. One on each segment, please. Just on the asset management, Oliver, it looks
like the fixed momentum is quite strong, I mean, one of the highest net flows with maybe ever or
for a very long time at least. So how far do you think are we from obtaining part of the 2012, 2013
kind of (pre-glory) operating profit base. Because I know the outlook is still capped at 2.7. But if
volatility plays to your strength and (close) remain at where they are, then is there a reason to not
be more bullish on asset management? That's the first question. Second question is more on the
slide details on the Life side. I noticed in the capital-efficient products in Fourth Quarter, there's a
bit of operating profit pressure from unlocking (inaudible) assumptions. Are these market volatility
or are these mortality or some other kind of assumptions? Could you just clarify? And in the same
line, I know, Giulio, you mentioned that VA is actually a hybrid VA. But in the past, you also said that
your traditional VA of EUR 30 billion liability benefits on low vol in the market and volatility is quite
unpredictable at the moment. Are there any risks there? And just last very quick clarification, P&C.
After all the normalizations, how should we think of the full year '17 versus '16? Sorry, I missed that.
Is it flattish or slightly better versus '16?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Okay, maybe I can start with the question on the capital-efficient products and the unlocking. The
unlocking is -- at least, it's unlocking. So we're looking at all assumptions. So we're looking at
annuitization's assumptions, earned rates, mortality, morbidity. At the end of the day, as I said
before, there was a swing between 2018 -- '17 and 2016. In the sense of when you look at the
Delta, it looks relatively significant. But keep in mind, it was a positive unlocking in 2015 and a
negative unlocking in 2017. The primary reason anyway for the negative unlocking in '17 was an
adjustment to the earned rate. But again, this is a very normal process and when you look at the
performance of Allianz Life for 2017, it has been very good. Your question about VA should do
good in an environment where there is low volatility. That's sure. That's also the reason why Allianz
Life has very good performance in 2017. You see the low volatility reflected in the guaranteed
savings and annuity numbers at Page 21, now you say, why is the number is not going up more?
Remember that in 2016, we had this restatement and so we got this onetime profit. So in reality, if
you adjust the 2016 number for the restatement, you will see a growth of EUR 130 million in that
bucket and that growth will be driven by Allianz Life and specifically by the VA business of Allianz
Life. And the other questions I think you need to -- asset management operating profit. Okay.
When we look at the asset management operating profit and the question was about, first of all,
our outlook for 2018. As I was trying to explain before, we expect on a constant FX basis to get to



Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

a high single-digit growth in profit for '18 and maybe I'm even a little bit conservative on this view.
The point is, the FX is going against us and that's the reason for the 2018 outlook. As I look at the
projection for 2013, in order to get to a level of EUR 3 billion, I would say if you put back the U.S.
dollar to a level of 1.11 and this will give us automatically EUR 100 million more profit (inaudible).
Then I would say, it would take us most likely -- I would say 3 or 2 full years before we get there. So
it's not something that we're going to achieve in the next two years. But I would say 3 or four
years, we might get there.

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
Can I add to Giulio? I think we're having a very important debate and for those of you who sort of
look beyond the year longer term, what you can basically see is that we are very cautious because
of 2018 expected volatility. Politics, normalization of QE, interest rate going up, markets being able
to correct. Second, there's a lot of leverage in the system, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to
say that a lot of investments, for example, in Asia have been done on a leveraged basis. If we get
a market correction that is more material then a lot of money can flow out of the system and affect
us, right? So we just have a view that the market are overheated. And we would not find it to be
prudent, nor professional to just not support artificial growth in earnings that we know because of
what happened to the U.S. dollar are for '18 going to be less than what we normally would expect.
Now on the other hand, when you look at the underlying trends, that should really drive valuation.
What are the flows and asset management and the margins relative to the competition? What is
the new business value growth? What are the new business value margins? First, on growth, again.
When you look at the underlying dimensions in P&C relative to the market, net cat losses versus
industry, clear that we're going to improve productivity, then we're going to get to the 94%, then
we're going to get close to the 13% ROE. All KPIs are going in the right direction. So if you were to
look a little bit beyond the professional and prudent outlook that we have, Allianz is firing all
cylinders. And when I buy stock, I buy on fundamentals. I don't buy based on the spreadsheet and
that's not a criticism. But I think we shouldn't miss the forest for the tree here.

Operator
We'll go next to Andy Hughes with Macquarie.

Q - Andrew Hughes

{BIO 1540569 <GO>}

I've got 3 questions. And the first one, if I could, is about the 9% cost of capital on big acquisitions. I
might be able to help you out here. Because if I flick on Bloomberg and I look at the rumored
target XL lease rate at 11x 2019 earnings, which as we know is a 9% cost of capital. So maybe you
can clarify 3 synergies. Maybe you can clarify exactly what you meant by hard to achieve the 9%
return. The second question is about the decision to maintain the prospective bonus of 3.7% for
next year. Because the bit I'm struggling with is the new business margins are positive for this
contract on an MCEV basis, which clearly assumes a very different bonus pattern to what you're
actually paying. So should I ignore the MCEV numbers? Maybe you can tell me what bonus is
implied in the MCEV number, please. And the third question is about dividends and holding
company. So on Slide B 40, I think you mentioned about attitude to return capital, increase
dividends. I can see the only answer is to increase the senior debt in the group by EUR 2 billion
during the year. Are you actually looking to use senior debt to fund the buyback or in this case is it
being used for Euler Hermes and other stuff ? And would you do additional -- add on additional
senior debt? Could you comment about how the cash flow position of that holding company
currently stands?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Okay. So maybe starting from the last question. I will not give you the number of our cash at the
holding level. But I can tell you that the level of cash to the holding level has increased in 2017
compared to the beginning of 2016. And when I say, it has increased, I don't mean by EUR 100
million. But I'm speaking of numbers above the EUR 1 billion level. Just to give you a sense of what
we are speaking. And also, as you know, we have a so-called (strategic liquid reserve) of EUR 5
billion. We are way above the EUR 5 billion strategic liquid reserve. In the sense of the question



FINAL

whether we are raising senior debt to fund buybacks, no. In reality, we are able to switch. But I just
want to give you an idea about internal financing and senior debt. So the reality has nothing to do
with raising debt to fund senior -- share buybacks, that's, in reality, more about creating if you want
even more financial flexibility in the future because it's a good moment to get senior debt into the
books. So that's something that you should consider also how the internal funding might move.
Then you have a question on the product in Germany and whether the MCEV reflects what we are
doing? Yes. You need to think about the fact that in Germany, you need to apply portfolio view. So
clearly, if we were doing things like prospective without having a portfolio view, which is the way
the German system works, then you would get to a very different math. But in the case of
Germany, we have a portfolio view. So as long as you are adding business and, in general, you
have a yield, which is going to be above the guarantee level, you're going to get profit on a
marginal basis by adding business. So think about the fact that is not a product-by-product,
generation-by-generation business. But this is about a bigger swimming pool and this makes a big
difference. And the first question I really didn't get is about the 9% cost of equity. But yes, I didn't
get the question -- sorry, I didn't get the -- I didn't understand you a little bit acoustically...

Q - Andrew Hughes

{BIO 1540569 <GO>}

All right. So if something is on less than 11x P/E on Bloomberg for consensus forecast, if you buy at
the current share price, you will get a 9% return, assuming that growth.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yes. If we buy something at 9% that's implied, yes, then you have the synergies, right? Then if you
-- in reality, one could look this way in theory, just theoretically, you should always imply that when
you buy something on the market, you buy at the cost of equity of that thing, otherwise something
will be wrong. Then usually you create synergies and then you split the synergies maybe half and
half and this would create the extra value for the shareholders of the target company, for the
shareholders of the acquiring company. So that could be a logic to apply.

Q - Andrew Hughes

{BIO 1540569 <GO>}

I was just a bit confused because you said, it was hard to find something with a 9% cost of capital
and yet you were looking at XL, which is less than 9% cost of capital on consensus forecasts. And
you would have your synergies on top as well. Am I getting something wrong here or...

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

We are not speaking about any specific companies. This is a general conversation and, now, as I
said before, if you believe anyway in the market price that this, then you should apply the cost of
capital in this market price. We might also argue that market prices of some companies might be
overvalued. And in that case, implied cost of equity will be lower than the 9%.

Operator
We'll take our final question from Andrew Ritchie with Autonomous.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Three very short ones. You talked several times about interest rates, you think interest rates will
rise, albeit in a volatile fashion. I guess, I'm trying to understand how I think about the benefit to the
insurance business, I can make my own mind up on PIMCO if interest rates rise. It looks like you
effectively neutralized the Solvency II position. And I guess, for IFRS earnings, there's no benefit
until the reinvestment rate matches the portfolio yield. Am I wrong? Am I missing something? Are
there more management actions you can take to reposition for higher rates? And also, I'm just
checking there's no negatives, for example, hedging costs, swaptions, et cetera, that will start to
impact if rates rise. So just how you think about the benefits of the insurance business should rates
rise, given all the data I can see. Second, very quick question is, I'm afraid it's about the debt. What
is the binding constraint on debt? It's clearly not the Solvency II buckets, you have tons of room



there. Is it Moody's? Is it the headline IFRS gearing number? What is the headline constraint? And
the final very quick question, the 13% ROE has been a fairly long-term target. What was the tax rate
assumption in that 13%?

A - Oliver BÃ¤te

FINAL

The tax rate assumption.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yes. Okay. Coming maybe from the question about how we view interest rates and the impact on
our insurance operation. On the P&C side, before we go into the Life segment, we would expect
that increased interest rates are going to have a positive impact. If you think about how much
investment income we had a few years ago and how much investment income we have right now
in the P&C business, we are speaking of a difference in value of EUR 300 million, EUR 400 million
easily. So clearly, we would expect this to reverse. On the Life side, on the in-force business, I
would say you wouldn't see maybe a significant amount of profit more. But at the end of the day, I
would say, there is always some -- what you're projecting is low interest rate forever, you might get
into some situation where you might assume that there is a little bit more stress into the balance
sheet. So higher interest rates are definitely always beneficial from the point of view. And also the
new business value would most likely be positively affected. So in general, if you ask me, higher
interest rates are rather positive, obviously, for our P&C segment as opposed...

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

(inaudible) Solvency II -- in the Solvency II, I mean, obviously, you (showed) limited move for 50 bps.
But I guess, with convexity, above 50 bps, there's more material impact. Is that how I think about it?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yes. If you say -- if you move the interest rates even higher what happens to the sensitivity of the
Solvency II, that's the question?

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

I would say if you move the sensitivity even higher, you will get most likely a sensitivity which is not
as good as a plus 2. It might be potentially even lower because of convexity but that will be driven
by the SCR. And so I wouldn't say that calculation, which is an instantaneous shock as a proxy for
what can happen to our profit. Because there is a difference by running an instantaneous shock as
opposed to have a sort of greater increase in the interest rates, you'll get a different answer. Then
the question about the 13% ROE, what was the tax rate included in the 13% ROE? I'm sure that it
was more than 27% that we mentioned before. But if your question goes, okay. But you are making
the 13% ROE just because of the tax rate, we need to consider that a lot of things have changed
between 2015 and now. And just to give you an idea, think about the equity market run. And there
is definitely more capital that we have in our books compared to what we assumed a few years
ago and also think about Korea, which had a negative cost of value. So these are all things that are
clearly also have to be considered when you look at the ROE of 13%, what is bringing us there. On
this topic, I like to be very clear. Is it coming back to the point that Oliver was making before? You
have to look at the development of our operational KPIs. So if we are delivering on the 94%
combined ratio, if we are delivering on the new business margin above 3%, if you are delivering on
the mix, if you are delivering on the cost-income ratio of PIMCO, (inaudible), I would say all the
things that we could control have been implemented and executed against and this will support
the fact that we've been able to drive to the 13% outcome. Then clearly, you have plus and
minuses and this might put us a little bit ahead or below the 13% ROE.



Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. Finally, on the debt constraints, what's the (inaudible) that you've got...

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

FINAL

Ah, the debt constraints, yes. On that, are you talking of senior debts? Because if you are talking of
subordinated debts, you might -- Sorry.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Well total debt -- the total debt leverage or I guess, how do you look at it? I mean...

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Ah, total, yes. I would say eventually that the first constraint to come into the equation will be the
Moody's or S&P's leverage ratio, the calculation is slightly different. But they are not giving
complete different answers. So yes, the constraint come into play wouldn't be Solvency, Solvency II,
the first constraint come into play will come from the leverage ratio. But we are not close to the
constraint. So that manages the first constraint that would come into the question. Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
So we have lots of room on various dimensions. But we are always cautious on our financing
structure as you know. We have sort of when you run the S&P and other models, we are sort of at
the upper end, we would say, of our current rating scheme. And we'd like that. Again, we believe
the world is going to be a little more difficult than other people think, given that the markets are
steaming ahead. We are nearing strong economic numbers. But then camouflaging very difficult
trends.
Let me repeat that at the end. And thank you very much for your interest. The governments are
still dramatically overleveraged. And that leverage issue has not been solved. When you believe
that the current gross numbers will address the issues, they won't. With what the U.S. is planning -it's great to invest in infrastructure. But their leverage and their debt ratio is already very strong. My
personal opinion that the U.S. dollar might be weaker than everybody thinks, not because people
are talking it down. But because people are worried about the credit rating of the United States
and sustainability of the financing, that would be something to really worry about in the long run.
We've had a lot of progress in Europe. We now, hopefully, have a government in Germany. But we
have elections in Italy and who knows what's happening there. We have a lot of problems in the
Middle East every day. So this is a very difficult place. And we are part of a very large animal in a
very difficult environment. So we are planning very conservatively that might disappoint a little bit of
the enthusiasts. But those that have long-term investors should really cherish that. And with that, I
say thank you to the shareholders and thank you for the support from my side and hand it over for
Giulio for the closing.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Okay. Let me just say thank you for listening to the conference call and for your questions. And I
guess, we're going to see most of you -- some of you, I'm not sure in the next days. So I'm looking
forward to get to know you in person.

A - Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

All right. Thanks from my side as well. Goodbye to everybody. And we wish you a very nice
weekend. Thank you.
