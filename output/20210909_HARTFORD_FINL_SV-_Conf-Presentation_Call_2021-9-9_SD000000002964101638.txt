{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. It's Meyer Shields from KBW. We are thrilled to have our next
session. It's Hartford Financial Services Chairman and CEO, Chris Swift; and CFO, Beth
Costello. It's been an interesting year for everyone. It's been an interesting year, I want to
say for Hartford because of all the stuff that's going on. I'm going to pause briefly and ask
Chris and Beth for some introductory comments. Then we're going to jump into Q&A.
(Operator Instructions) So with that, let me stop and turn the floor over to Chris and Beth.

Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Thank you, Meyer. It's great to be with you. It's good to see you. Sorry we can't be in
person. But this is the next best thing to connect with you digitally. It's always a pleasure to
participate in your investor conferences.
What I would just share at a high level, just in the opening comments here is I'm very
pleased with the way The Hartford is performing through the 6-month mark. We've had
an interesting 18 months with COVID and other marketplace activities, but it really hasn't
deterred our focus on performance and execution and the things that we've been
building over a longer period of time.
So as we sit here today Meyer, I am extremely confident in our ability to deliver on a lot of
the results that we foreshadowed over the next 12 to 18 months, whether it be our growth
plans, whether it be our ROE plans, whether it be our efficiency programs, with our
expense savings. Beth will talk about buying back our shares and returning excess capital
to shareholders.
But I just think we're in a good place, and it's really a culmination of a lot of hard work over
many years by many talented teammates that we have here at The Hartford. So -- that's
what I would just share at the opening.

Yes. fantastic. Beth, do you want to add anything to that?

A - Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

FINAL

No. I think Chris covered it very well. I share his enthusiasm really with the path that we're
on. We've laid out some, I think very clear goals as to where we're headed, and we're
executing to get ourselves there.

A - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

So let me jump in with that. You have laid out, I would say an ambitious -- but we've
described as ambitious and achievable -- set of goals for The Hartford over the next
couple of years.
I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the macroeconomic assumptions that are
baked into, let's say the commercial premium growth goal. What are you expecting in the
broader economy as a backdrop for what Hartford is targeting to achieve?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Sure. Yes. I think again at a summary level, there are tailwinds that we're going to benefit
from, particularly our employment-centric businesses as the economy heals, as people
get back to work, as there's some wage inflation. So I think the backdrop is just really
constructive to many industry participants with growing economies, exposure is growing,
wages growing is all part of the equation that we saw pricing still remains robust, at least
in my judgment because there's still a lot of need for price in certain aspects of our
product. But I would characterize it, to answer your question directly, as we do expect
above trend, economic growth through '22. It's hard to predict '23 at this point in time. But
again with all the stimulus that is out there from old stimulus programs, potentially new
stimulus programs that the policymakers are talking about. I still believe we're in above
trend economic growth, at least for the next 18 months.

A - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

I guess the corollary to that, just to make sure that we're not seeing anything with the
Delta variant and hesitation that would jeopardize your expectations.

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Well I think the fact that life is Delta or other variants are going to be with us probably for
the foreseeable future as these types of virus run their course particularly given this is a
global virus these days. So I mean we might have, I'll call it, fits and stops and starts. You
could look to August in some of the travel data, the restaurant data. I know you monitor a
lot of data, Meyer, I mean there is a slowdown, no doubt as people hunker down a little
bit.
But on the positive side, we think COVID is -- Delta is peaking as we speak. It might
continue a little bit into October. But I think that's just going to be sort of the nature of this
virus that there is going to be sort of peaks and valleys to it. That said, I don't think it

Page 2 of 13



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity

disrupts an overall trend line that we're going to outperform historical trend from an
economic side. But there might be slow patches.

FINAL

A - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Great. This is -- it's a general question, and I'm hoping the answer will be more specific.
But there's always a balance when we've gone through a period of compounding rate
increases of balancing exposure unit growth against additional rate. Can you talk us
through the questions and the considerations that Hartford is contemplating for that
balance?

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. I think if you put it in context of what we and other industry participants being able to
achieve over at least the last two to three years. We needed to take rate, and we've had
some compounding effect, as you said, that has gotten at least what we think most of our
product lines are closer to rate adequate. I wouldn't say we're completely there in certain
lines, and that has to do with inflationary forces that are hard to predict beyond the short
term when you think in terms of social inflation and things along those lines. So there's
always a balance, but I think the weight has to go to make sure you're getting adequate
pricing for the exposures you're taking on at that point in time.
Then you can worry about, I'll call it, growth new business growth, you could begin to see
some pickup in exposures that will provide a natural lift. So all that is happening right now.
If you look at our Second Quarter numbers, we have returned to growing our book of
business, particularly after coming out of a difficult retraction in 2020 due to COVID. There
is going to be some natural expansion of insured values, whether it be workers' comp,
disability, property values, more equipment being deployed in manufacturing. All this will
have the impact of exposures growing, which would then provide an additional lift, Meyer.

A - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Fantastic. I'm trying to make sure that I'm on the quick draw hitting the mute and unmute
buttons. I'm probably not going to get it perfectly over the course of the session.
One element of the story has also been the re-underwriting initiatives within middle
market, global specialty. Can you talk us through what you've done and the current status
of those individual segments in terms of profitability? Then maybe looking forward, what
should we expect for these segments over the cycle?

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yes. It's a great question. We've talked about it in the past on some of our forms. I would
say that both middle and in global, particularly really since we closed the Navigators
acquisition, we've been re-underwriting the book of business. We've been shedding
certain aspects of the book of business, adopting our standards from an ROE and
targeted return side. So Global Specialty has really gone through a fundamental
transformation, which I think you're beginning to see the fruits of our labor emerge with
combined ratios in the low 90s. I expect that they will go lower from here as a lot of that
rate gets earned in.
Page 3 of 13



FINAL

Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2021-09-09

Middle market, maybe less dramatic. But still, over the last two or three years, there were
certain aspects of the book in our general industries category, we would say Meyer, that
needed to be pruned a little bit, needed some rate in certain aspects, both comp and
general liability. So after a period of a little bit of shrinking and retooling, again I was
equally pleased and excited to see that the growth is starting to return in our middle
market book of business. If you look at, again underlying combined ratios, they have
drifted down into the low 90s, which is very good. I expect, again a lot of that to continue
as additional rate is earned in.
So yes, we're pretty bullish on both of those segments. I know there was a little bit of
controversy with some shareholders when we did the Navigators transaction. But looking
back in hindsight, I think it was perfectly timed. It is producing the returns that we
expected.

A - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

No. Phenomenal. We've certainly commented a lot on the timing of the deal as well
because that makes things a little bit easier. On workers' compensation, there's a lot
going on and maybe a lot not going on. I don't know that we're seeing dramatic price
increases there. But we are seeing wage inflation. We're seeing people come back to
work. What are you seeing in terms of the attractiveness of this line of business?

Bloomberg Transcript

And if we can take a step back, how does Hartford understand the really favorable
frequency that we saw before COVID. COVID was its own, hopefully, temporary
exception. But what's the sense -- what are the lessons that you've taken from that
favorable string of frequency declines that you're applying going (inaudible)

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yes. There's a lot to unpack there. So I'll try, and I'll have Beth supplement any of our
perspective. So I think the context of this whole discussion and comp, at least for us is -- I
mean it's a line of business we have deep, deep expertise in -- We have rich data across
multiple segments of our economy from small commercial to middle to even large or we
have some deductible programs. So our history and knowledge is very deep, which gives
us, I think an advantage both from a data side and ultimately, a claims side. So that's first.
Second, I think even during sort of this declining price environment over multiple years,
we've been able to manage to a great outcome. It is still a very highly profitable line of
business for us, strong ROEs well in excess of our cost of capital. So we've been able to
perform during, I'll call it, robust rate environments and now rate environments that have
been challenged. You would say well, why were the rate environments challenged for the
last four or five years, and you would have to say that the line has performed well, both
from a frequency side and a severity side. So again our powerful insights and data
analytics, we have our arms around our frequencies and severities by SIC code by region.
We know what to watch and we know what levers to pull.
So I put it all together. So where we are right now, there isn't anything new, Meyer. And
maybe that's unsatisfying to you because you're looking for a headline, but there's no

Page 4 of 13

FINAL

breaking news here, is that line continues to perform well. Obviously during COVID, we
saw frequencies really come down. I give Beth a lot of credit for being transparent on
what we did with our frequencies and the benefit that we took. Then more importantly,
what was the incremental COVID-related losses that we put up over the last 18 months.
And I think on balance, that was prudent, probably a little conservative compared to
where we sit here today but you'd rather be in that position as opposed to being caught
short. So that's what I would say as far as where we're at today. And Doug Elliott
commented last quarter that pricing and workers comp turned slightly positive. It's hard to
predict, and we're not going to predict here today Meyer, where pricing is going to go in
'22 and '23. Particularly at this time of the year, it's critical as we work with NCCI or other
rating bureaus to really determine the levels of rate next year. So we're cautiously
optimistic, but there's still a lot to manage, but we had our arms around the levers, and
we've had for a long period of time to produce a good outcome for our shareholders.
Beth, what would you add?

A - Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

I think you covered off on all the pieces very well. I'll just to reiterate, it's a very profitable
line for us, one that, as Chris said, we have deep expertise in and has allowed us to
produce the returns that we've seen. So even with some of the pricing dynamics that
have been there and that Chris mentioned, still see it as highly profitable and very
pleased with our overall results.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Great. I certainly am always looking for a headline. But if there is no change, then I need to
know that, too. So I appreciate the --

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Well -- and not to talk past to close on that topic. But I mean there is a little bit of wage of
fleshing that's occurring in a lot of the service sectors of the economy and the whole
inflation discussion in my mind, you really got to get down to a macro level because
there's a lot of cross currents and signals that are pointing in a different way whether it be
commodities, whether it be auto parts and chips, whether it be labor and then how you
match that specific SIC codes. But generally, as we've said in previous discussions, Meyer,
a little wage inflation should provide a little tailwind to us also.

A - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Right. No, completely understood. We're definitely seeing that. So that will be interesting. I
take your point because the expertise will be critical here because it's not something
that's uniformly applied across SIC codes or across CPI indices, however you want to
frame that.
I want to move on to another segment, personal lines, because here, again we've got this
macro picture of the economy more or less coming back with some volatility and people
driving more. But Hartford's book of business fairly specific. Can you talk about what

Page 5 of 13



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2021-09-09

you're seeing, both in terms of pricing to the extent that you can talk about that and the
competitive environment? Then on the loss side, frequency and severity?

FINAL

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Sure. Yes. I think again the context here is our personal lines book is primarily ARP
members, and we've always described that as a preferred class of business as much as
we're trying to grow with AARP in the 50- to 65-year-olds. Some of that growth will come
as we've refreshed our products and rolling out new technology, supported by Duck
Creek. We have a new contract with AARP that we're thinking about marketing and digital
activities totally differently, telematics.
But the simple fact is that we're still in a preferred class of business, and it is historically
and even during COVID and as things have begun to recover, at least all our internal
metrics on frequencies and severities, we're still outperforming a general mass market
population, which you would expect if you're highly preferred and have generally safer
drivers that aren't working during working hours and community as much. I think the
outcome is pretty self-evident.

Bloomberg Transcript

That said, I mean things are coming back to normal. So even in our book, we're seeing
frequencies rise. We're seeing some elevated severity, particularly dealing with the auto
parts supply issue. But nothing that I would say is on a pattern from what we generally
expected, nothing out of pattern from what our loss picks were at the beginning of the
year, we established. Beth could comment there that I think our loss picks were prudent.
And had a little bit -- not a little bit, had a reversion to the mean and normalization in
them.
So as we sit here today again there's no news. There is anything outlier that we should call
out, either from a positive side or a nonpositive side. So -- but we're going to have to
watch our rate increases. I think we've been disciplined during the COVID process where
we've done only one refund. We haven't enrolled back rates during this process because
we knew eventually, there would be a reversion to the mean. We wanted a little bit more
predictability with our customers as opposed to moving rates and filings around on them.
The same thing for the homeowners business. The homeowners business is about $1
billion book of business that we'd like to bundle within auto. We lead with auto and then
bundle or home where it makes sense. So that's what I would say. Beth, what would you
add?

A - Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

You always say everything, Chris, and asked me to add. I think you covered it very well.
Yes, as you said, when we made our loss picks for the year, we expected to see uptick in
activity as it relates to auto. We definitely have been seeing that, and we're watching
closely some of the other trends that Chris mentioned.

A - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. We've seen Hartford, and this is something that you 'put in the supplement, which
just as an aside, the amount of detail that you provide is tremendously helpful. So I do
Page 6 of 13



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2021-09-09

want to give you kudos for that. where you've been taking a little bit more rate on the
homeowner side, both before and during this period where building materials and labor
costs have been going up. Can you talk about what's informing that pursuit of rate on the
homeowner side?

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yes. So I appreciate the question. So again the context I said in most of those homes are
AARP members. We might have some independent agent business still on the books. But
I think the context of your question is how are you managing cat, how are you managing -changing climate patterns these days? And I would say we've been very proactive over
many, many years, but particularly the last four or five in dealing with wildfire in our West
Coast exposure. So my heart and emotions go out to the millions of people dealing with
wildfires from Seattle to Oregon to California to Arizona to Colorado.
It's devastating to see the pictures and watch the human toll. But I think we've managed
our exposures down where we did have some concentrations three, four years ago in
fire-related areas. We've taken a risk review of our existing in forces and where risk has
changed and the property instituted, I think the appropriate action of either getting off the
risk or re-underwriting it. So again being proactive. Our philosophy generally has been
more stable and predictable. And as you said, Meyer, if you look back over say the 5-year
period of time, we probably averaged 6 to 7 points in that book just because we felt that
it needed it. We felt the climate was changing in certain areas. Tornado, hail, still continues
to be our largest peril in our homeowners book and that activity has been up over a
number of years, but it's not a large book. We've improved our models on these perils,
both primary and somewhat secondary these days. So we feel like we've gotten our arms
around it, and that's dictated -- the rate actions that we've taken in the book fairly
consistently over the last 5-year period.

A - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Perfect. Question is coming from one of our clients, and I'm sure it's a question that
you've heard a bunch of times. If we look at the various segments, and I'll make this point,
feel free to correct me, although I'm not sure you will. It doesn't look like Hartford's
valuation reflects the returns in maybe some of the non-P&C segments, whether it's
mutual funds or group benefits. How do you think about the ideal business mix,
particularly when you've got this undervaluation compared to what maybe you might be
able to get in the market if there was a divestiture of some of these segments?

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yes. It's a question we challenge ourselves all the time. So I don't mind addressing it,
hopefully, to your satisfaction that, again when we do strategic planning and analyze our
portfolio. We're always challenging ourselves what's good and where do we need to
continue to improve? How can we add to the potential portfolio through organic means?
Primarily are there things that we should considering? So that's routine in our practices.
I would say specifically on mutual funds, I think we've described the asset between Beth
and myself in different forms, and I give her credit for phrasing it this way. It's a good

Page 7 of 13



FINAL

investment. It's an investment that continues to grow in value. It's been innovative,
produces strong ROEs, IRRs, cash flows, dividends to the parent. I think they've been
remaining relevant in a highly competitive place. It's a unique model. So some might say
well, yes, why don't you just sell it, but a sub-advised model where you have two strong
strategic partners that have contributed to that value creation over a longer period of
time, a mutual fund board of trustees that has fiduciary duties to the mutual fund
shareholders, not The Hartford shareholders, adds a complexity to just saying, yes, it's
easy to monetize because everyone wants to be in a mutual fund business and scale
matters. I'd point that out to you. I think it's self-evident that those are just considerations.
It's not a driving force.

Bloomberg Transcript

But there isn't, I'll call it, a broad-based demand for a model that we have. That's why
we'd like to continue to grow it because we think harvesting the cash and creating that
value does make sense. But we will always challenge ourselves, Meyer, are we the best
owner of that business over the long term? Every -- annually, when we challenge
ourselves with that, we've always concluded -- yes, we're still an owner. We like the
investment as long as it continues to perform according to our expectations.
On group benefits, it's a different equation, I would say because, obviously as the second
or third largest provider in the group benefit space, we have scale. We have great
capabilities. We have great customers. We have all the products, I think we need in that
space to compete. I think it's more we can maybe improve the way we characterize that
business to make sure all our investors and analysts understand the nature of this
business being more akin to the P&C business as opposed to life insurance. And as you of
all people know that life insurance is usually you sell a product, and you've got to be very
precise with all your assumptions that go into it. Here, I mean if we get a chance to reprice
our products, generally every two to three years. We have great claims synergies with
comp and disability claims. They're in the same genre.
We've built a voluntary benefit capability, which are more in demand these days. So I think
our growth potential is higher in the future. So I just think we need to continue to tell a
compelling story to investors of why these businesses belong together. In addition to -remember, our distribution, 45% of our distribution partners have some form of benefits
in their portfolio. So there is a blurring on the distribution side that only continues to
accelerate between P&C and benefits, and we like our position. We like our ability to
cross-sell both disability and comp going forward.
We've rolled out some integrated product capabilities that are only available to
policyholders that uses on the disability and comp side, which we think are value added.
We're just going to continue to try to tell our story the best of why this is a highly
profitable low-volatility business, except during a global pandemic. We still like how these
businesses fit together, Meyer.

A - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Yes. That makes perfect sense to me. I think one of the points that you made that I find
particularly compelling is that some of the upside from the group benefits is the
information flow to workers' compensation because those lines are so complementary to
Page 8 of 13

FINAL

one another, makes a little tricky to just isolate the financial return on equity within group
benefits and say well, that's not the entire upside, but I think it's an important point even if
I need to do a better job of broadcasting that.
I do want to spend some time talking about Hartford Dex because it's an important -- it's
an ambitious program. Let me start with sort of a simple question. So when you cut
expenses, there are a number of opportunities that, that provides. You could reinvest, you
could pass along in terms of lower pricing, you could keep it in terms of expanded
margins. How are you balancing those considerations and any of the other ones that you
may not be thinking of ?

A - Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Do you want me to take that? Yes. I'll take that.

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

I don't want to steal your thunder.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

No. Well it's a great question. And any time that you start talking about expense programs
like this, that's always the question is where does it show up, which is why when we
announced the program and we described the dollars that we were anticipating to save,
we also translated that into what we were going to see from an expense ratio
perspective because we do expect to see some margin expansion coming from the
program. We're always looking to invest in our businesses, and that was contemplated
when we sort of put those markers out there. And as you've seen from a performance
perspective on the dollar side, we've increased our expectations since we announced the
program a year ago in July. So I've been very pleased to see that and extending that into
2023.
At the time we announced the program, we said that we anticipated the expense ratio in
our P&C business would improve 2 to 2.5 points using 2019 sort of as the anchor point.
We would see that benefit in 2022. We're well on our way to achieving that. When you
look between commercial lines and personal lines, it's definitely more weighted towards
commercial lines because of some of the investments that we're doing in personal lines.
But again when you put the two together, we're at that 2 to 2.5. On group benefits, it was
1.5 to 2 points. I would and group benefits, a combination of some of the investments that
we're making as well as just some of what we've been experiencing on the top line
perspective. We're probably going to achieve that kind of on a run rate basis, kind of
going towards the end of 2022 into 2023. So maybe a little bit more delayed than we
originally thought. But I'll also just comment that all of that was contemplated in the
financial projections that we provided back in April.
So all of those things were taken into consideration as we laid out our expectations of
achieving that 13% to 14% ROE. So overall, very pleased with the program. I think we do
have the right balance as we think about where we want to harvest savings, but it is

Page 9 of 13



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The

Date: 2021-09-09

important to continue to invest obviously in our businesses and our capabilities because
that drives a lot of the growth that we expect to achieve over the period as well.

FINAL

A - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Great. Thank you. If I can switch topics a little bit. We touched earlier on your thoughts on
looking back on the Navigators deal. You've also been, I think very consistent in saying that
you have the product portfolio that you're looking for. So we're not expecting any sort of
transformative M&A going forward. I want to talk a little bit about past and future bolt-on
acquisitions. So in the past, we've had wire risk, which is sort of an interesting, I'll call it, a
tech-related play. I was hoping to get an update on how that's performing? And how we
should think about maybe other similar small bolt-on acquisition opportunities as part of
the capital deployment strategy?

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

You were just cutting out a little bit, but I understood the question. So I think the
overarching theme, Meyer, is we're focused on organic growth. As we've said, colloquially,
we have all the capabilities and products in the house today. We're trying to mature them.
We're trying to expand them maybe into different industry verticals, broader parts of the
economy. But I really do fundamentally believe with what we've built organically over the
years and what Navigators has brought to us. We have a fulsome set of products. I think
with each quarter, our agency and brokerage partners become more familiar with them. I
think that will have a self-fulfilling prophecy of just higher growth and capturing more
business from them or maybe we weren't able to fully serve their needs many years back.
So organic focus.
You mentioned Y-Risk. Just a little color there. I mean that was a small acquisition of really
of a team of eight to 10 folks out in Farmington here. We're so glad that they're part of
the organization because it's helping us learn important aspects of the sharing economy.
It's not a lot of premium yet, honestly. It's probably less than $20 million of premium. But I
think what's important that Bernie and his team are going to bring to the group is we're
using sharing economy in on-demand insurance now in sort of the same group. So I think
both will have important components to our economy going forward, but they've brought
a lot of sharing economy. but we've also charged them with more of the on-demand type
of coverages that could be for sharing economies or just sort of broad-based economies.
So that's that.
I would say though, honestly, we're aware of what's happening in the marketplace,
particularly with dispositions, nothing appeals to us at this point in time. We spend a little
time in the fintech space. But again I think we have a road map, particularly in small
commercial that is robust and really cutting edge, and that's all I'll say that anything that's
available in the fintech space is already predominantly in our road map going forward. So
with our data and analytics, with our tools, with our core systems capability that we've
invested over a longer period in, I really do think we control our destiny and can build
things that we think we need for the future. So again M&A is just not on my radar screen
these days.

Okay. Fantastic. Delving a little bit more into group benefits if we can. What does the -- I'm
a little premature in saying this, but the post-COVID group benefits operating
environment, what does that look like? What are the key issues that we on the outside
should be focused on in terms of anticipating returns?

FINAL

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yes. As we said earlier, there's going to be some element of COVID always with us, right?
So I don't -- I can't envision a sort of a pure post-COVID world. In fact, as we've said
during our last quarter call, we still expect mortality to decline compared to the second
half of the -- compared to the first half of the year. But given this delta spike, I think that
decline will probably come more in the Fourth Quarter than in the Third Quarter. If I sit
here today we had about $85 million to $90 million of mortality claims in the Second
Quarter. I would expect our Third Quarter to be in that similar range today.

Bloomberg Transcript

Like, the Second Quarter, we had substantial positive prior year -- prior quarter
development with our life mortality. We expect some level of modest positive mortality
development on prior quarters and prior years. But it's still going to be a little bit of an
elevated quarter. That said, I think what we're really focused on is building out our digital
capabilities, for our group benefits area, I think more and more customers and their
employees want to operate and interact with us on a digital basis.
These platform providers, such like Workday are going to become more important. So
we're investing in connectivity between these payroll providers that would allow more
digital exchange of data. We've built out our voluntary product capabilities, but it needs a
little bit of a refresh going forward to make sure we're being competitive with features
and benefits. So those are the things that are top of my mind, and we'll always look at our,
I'll call it, technical currency and just making sure that our technology is remaining current.
We are running some older base technologies in how we administer a lot of those
policies. So there will be a modernization that we'll have to go through and we'll keep you
informed on. But those are the drivers that I would ask you just to pay attention to.

A - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Great. Just one quick question on Group Benefits. Is there an accelerated mortality
component to it? We've heard that concept in terms of some whole life insurers. I'm just
wondering whether that translates into group benefits in any way.

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yes. Beth and I and the Benefits team, we debate it quite a bit. Intuitively, I think you're
right -- particularly in our retiree book of business, there've probably been a pull forward.
But again most of our I'll call it insured values are in actively working people, as I say in the
sort of 18 to 65-year-old category.
We have seen an elevation across all age demographics of mortality due to COVID and
Delta here, particularly. So I don't know if that's a pull forward or if that's just people's
comorbidities and maybe lack of vaccination that are creating that increase. So it's hard to

mathematically say that's a pull forward. There's probably some -- but it's probably, again
unfortunate that the virus is spreading more rapidly than we all wanted it to.

No, completely understood. I do have a question coming in, and I know this is a sensitive
question in terms of what you can answer, but any updates that you can provide on
discussions with the Boy Scouts of America or reinsurance protections that Hartford has?

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yes. It's probably not best to comment on it other than -- it's -- it would be good to get it
behind us.

A - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Fair enough. Then we've got basically one minute left. So I just want to ask your thoughts
on capital deployment. I know you laid out a very specific plan with regard to the ROE
targets. But if you can just remind us of prioritization in terms of capital deployment,
capital return.

Beth?

Yes. So really nothing has changed on that, as Chris said. Right now we are obviously
investing in our businesses and with the capabilities that we have and expanding those.
We think right now that the best use of our excess capital is returning it to shareholders.
So we are executing on our share repurchase program. We've said that we anticipate
using about $1.5 billion of that capacity this year, and we're well on our way to doing that.
quarter-to-date. For the Third Quarter, we repurchased about $383 million worth of
shares. So that brings us to roughly over $1 billion for the year. So again well on our way
towards executing that $1.5 billion this year.

A - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. This has been phenomenal. I appreciate, again information. We recently identified
Hartford as I think one of the most compelling investment stories for now, whatever that
time frame would be. So I appreciate the information and the time that you spent with us.
Thank you very much, Chris and Beth. We look forward to speaking and hearing from you
soon.

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Thank you, Meyer, for having us.

Thank you.
