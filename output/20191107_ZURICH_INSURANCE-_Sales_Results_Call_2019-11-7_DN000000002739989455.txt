Presentation
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Zurich Insurance Group Q3 Results 2019 Conference Call. I
am Shai, the Chorus Call operator. I would like to remind you that all participants will be in listenonly mode and the conference is being recorded. The presentation will be followed by Q&A
session. (Operator Instructions) The conference must not be recorded for publication or broadcast.
At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over to Mr. Richard Burden, Head of Investor Relations and
Rating Agency Management. Please go ahead.

Richard Burden

{BIO 1809244 <GO>}

Good morning and good afternoon everybody, and welcome to Zurich Insurance Group's third
quarter 2019 call. On the call today is our group CFO, George Quinn. Before we start with the
Q&A, George will make a few introductory remarks, and when we come to the Q&A, as usual, ask
you to keep your questions to a maximum of two, if we have time we will come back to you after, if
you have follow-up questions.
George let me pass over to you now.

George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Richard. And good morning and good afternoon to all of you. And thanks for joining this
call on our Q3 results. So before we move to the Q&A just a few initial remarks on the third quarter.
Just as a reminder, the focus of the third quarter releases as you've known from the past typically
on revenue trends, we've got some qualitative commentary around the performance of the
business and we will of course, provide the full detail of the full year. However, I can confirm that
we remain fully on track to meet or exceed all of the targets for this year.



FINAL

Over the first nine months, we've continued to progress the strategy of focusing on customers
and developing our distribution, while at the same time simplifying operations. And I'm pleased to
say that this has been rewarded by solid development across our business. If you allow me, I'll turn
briefly to P&C, because I'm sure that many of the questions will relate to the kind of pricing and
claims trends that both we and the industry in general are experiencing.
P&C pricing trends have continued to accelerate, particularly in specialty and in North America with
rates comfortably ahead of lost cost trends. I would say that North America commercial lines rates
also show signs of improvement. And in addition to tier [ph] rate, but also increasingly seeing
improvements in terms and conditions. We're also increasingly optimistic that the current trends
will sustain themselves through 2020, and continue to broaden in each of the geographies.
The increases that you've seen from today's press release are also increasingly been seen within
P&C. Top line and now it will be supportive to earnings over the coming years as both the growth -the growth and the rate tends [ph] into the P&L.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to claims trends, which I know has received a lot of attention in recent weeks. We're
obviously not immune from the general market trends and recognize many of the comments from
TP [ph] as particularly in the US. But I would remind you that we took action beginning already four
years ago, and those actions are focused to a large degree on the lines that have been in the
headlines, namely commercial auto and general liability, where we're taking clear action in terms of
loss picks and on volume. And as such, I feel that we are probably in a relatively -- position to
manage some of these trends, than maybe the average and the industry.
Just turning to recent weather, weather trends and following on from the relatively light weather
and nat cat trends in the first half, trends have been more normal since the half year. Based on our
current expectations around crop and the impact of cat that we've seen in Q3, we would expect
the combined ratio to be slightly higher than the midpoint of the 95%, 96% combined ratio range
that we've talked about previously.
Our life business continues to deliver on a strategy of focusing on capital like savings and
protection business with our Swiss and Irish businesses continuing to show particularly strong
performance particularly in corporate life and pension sales. And, I mean, we continue to believe
that the strategy is the right one, especially in this low yield environment. But it cannot ancillary [ph]
us completely. We will work hard to compensate, but I expect that the life business will face some
modest headwinds from interest rates, against that P&C will not only benefit from a positive trend
that's continuing longer than we had initially anticipated, but also one that is still accelerating and
one as I mentioned earlier that we expect to see broaden into the European markets. Farmers
continue to deliver steady performance and continues to execute on its customer-focused
strategy and the surplus continues to build, and is now at an all-time high. I mean that business
continues to perform very well.
Z-ECM ratio is 113% in the upper half of our target range, and the reduction since the end of Q2,
principally reflects the falling yields over the course of the quarter. I mean, as you would imagine,
we continue to have substantial capital flexibility. Mario, I and the entire team look forward to
seeing, many, if not all of you at the Investor Day next week. We will give you further insights into
how we're thinking about the future. So if you don't mind, please focus your questions today on
the quarter or the year-to-date.
We'll now be happy to start the Q&A.

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first question
comes from the line of Nick Holmes, Societe Generale. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Hi there. Thanks very much. I have just one question which is, what are your thoughts about making
changes to the bond yields sensitivity in the Z-ECM ratio calculation, because it's just clearly too
conservative isn't it, compared to peers?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thank you. I wondered how long I'd have to wait for that question. So maybe, its sort of benefit
everyone who may be doesn't understand quite as well as you and some of your colleagues. So
obviously we apply an internal model. Let me model the impact of interest rates. That model is
entirely based on swap curves. There is no ultimate forward rate. And I think, I mean, that has the
impact that well, I think most observers can readily easily recognize that in the real world, we
probably have less sensitivity to interest rates than some of our European peers, public
sensitivities are higher, principally because of the absence of that ultimate forward rate.
I mean, you have seen the impacts of interest rates in the quarter and that's principally driven by
Germany. So I mean it is a very strict market view of things. I mean despite that the capitalization is
still strong, but we are going to take a look at it. I can't tell you today, what we'll do. I mean, I think,
as you probably also aware, the (inaudible) is looking today at the Solvency II and UFR [ph]
construct. We did some rough back of the envelope work. And we estimate that if we apply the
Solvency II type UFR to model with increases that ECM ratio by about 20 points. So we need to
take a careful look at this, because of course, I mean these things are very complex, and they kind
of unintended consequences. I mean, probably all I can say today is I'll update you further when we
come back at the full year, but as a topic, we're looking at trying to find a way to be more
consistent with the peer group.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

That's really interesting. Thank you. So are you saying that 113% would be 133% with UFR?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So, we estimate roughly. So I mean, we obviously have a very sophisticated internal model. We've
done a far more simplistic calculation. I'm not sure I'd necessarily claim that we'd be precisely
133%, but we estimate the difference of the current Solvency II UFR apply to Z-ECM is of the order
of 20 points versus where we are today.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. That's very clear. Thank you very much.

Operator
Next question comes from the line of Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca. Please go ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Well, yes, good afternoon. Thank you very much. So one question on the top line reported today.
And George, you just said that you expect pricing (inaudible) to improve outside US as well. Now in
the EU segment, we can see very strong growth, as well, so I think it was 5%, 1H and 6% for nine
months like-for-like. And in the past it was linked to the Swiss business, and you mentioned Italy, I
think in the past. Could you just comment a bit about where this growth in the third quarter
probably came in.



FINAL

My second question is just on the Swiss Solvency, sorry on the Z-ECM, the kind of volatility is like, I
was advised that as of now the Z-ECM is probably closer to 120%. Now, if I just look at the euro
swap curve simplistically, it's up around maybe 30 basis point, you show a 10 point of sensitivity. So
again, you know from 113% to 120%, is there something else that has happened in quarter-to-date?
Or does it just the fact that we can't just simply liquidate [ph] at euro swap and apply to the
sensitivity because of definition? Just any comment would be helpful. Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah, great, thanks Vinit. So on the growth topic, the -- I mean Europe -- Swiss business is the one
that still stands out as driving growth, but I mean we see growth across mainly driven by
commercials. So commercial is the one that I actually see most of the rate in Europe and in fact if
you look at retail in Europe, we will see the impact of pricing on retail as being, I mean, quite a bit
lower than the -- far more positive environment we see around commercial. But Swiss is the
strongest than the UK, but for example, both Italy and Spain also contribute over the course of the
quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

On Z-ECM, I think the challenge with Z-ECM -- one of the challenge with Z-ECM, the challenge was
modeling interest rates as the sensitivities tend to be parallel shift and if everything was parallel
shift there would be perfect guides. The challenge for us, and it goes back again a bit in the
answer to Nick earlier, I mean, it's really a long end to some markets has had an impact on us. And
because we have no UFR in the model, I mean we are exposed to that entire movements,
whereas for example if the German curve flattened, if we'd have UFR, you probably wouldn't see
the impacts of that. So I made apologies that it's hard to use those simple sensitivities, but it's very
hard to give you a sense of, I mean how the model responds to steepening or flattening or twist, I
mean it's obviously a very complicated topic.
But I mean just to go back to what you said, I mean we haven't formally estimated it. But given the
interest rate moves you've seen, given other changes that we anticipate, I mean, today, we would
anticipate that we will be back lately very close to the top end of our target range.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Thank you very much.

Operator
Next question comes from the line of Andrew Ritchie, Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi, there. George is inevitable, I'm going to touch on the US casualty topic. You used the phrase at
the beginning, not immune. Just want to explore what you mean. I guess you mean you're seeing - you're observing those trends for severity and a bit of frequency. It's not requiring you to further
increase loss picks or is it and that's being offset by something else? Or is it causing you to think
about the seasoning of loss picks and maybe holding onto reserves for a bit longer because of the
uncertainty of the environment. So I'm just trying to reconcile the phraseology not immune versus it
doesn't sound like it's causing you to kind of change guidance. Any other phrase I picked up in your
opening comments was you talked about headwinds from low rates in life. Are you referring to the
sort of economic effect of low rates or on IFRS earnings. And I'm curious to know what you're
referring to just some things like, is it just (inaudible) drag or something what you intending to
mean by that? Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thank you. So the, let's start with liability. So the no immune comment. So if we had a full quarter as
well as the disclosure, and we were talking about PYD, I'll be giving you a number for PYD that you
would all instantly recognize, I know you would ask me to break it down. And within that you would



FINAL

discover, there are several gross loans positives, and maybe a bit further forward in the list would
be an adverse number and that would be, what we've done in general liability reserving in the
quarter.
I think we obviously we look at the same market dynamics as everyone else. The -- I mean from as
far as we can tell excess (inaudible) is still the main issue in the US, certainly as broadened across a
larger group of lines, but we see it mainly in excess GL [ph]. It seems to be more a severity issue
than a frequency issue from our stacks. But again, I mean, within the the scope of our overall loss
picks, are overall reserving, I mean we are happy that we can manage that, and if I maybe one
comment is slightly forward-looking.

Bloomberg Transcript

And I think that we had not yet done in Q3 with the complete of what is comp reserve review. And I
think as we've talked about before, I mean, we benefited from the fact that we've seen pretty
strong posted it on there in workers' comp and that's certainly been a significant benefit for us in
managing the market challenges that we see around GL. One of the comment on commercial
auto, because that was also a topic, some of the peers last week, I mean we haven't -- we've seen
almost no movement in commercial auto. I think if you look at the '16 and '17 absolute years, we
have a very immaterial positive reserve development.
I think if you look at the industry on (inaudible) cards and compare them to us we compare very
favorably. And in fact, I mean if you isolate say the top four carriers of which I would view as one.
Again I think we compare favorably within that group. So I think the comment was just to recognize
that there is something taking place, we benefit from on the pricing dynamics. So, I mean this line
of business sees the most price action. I mean if you look at the year-to-date rate on the GL,
probably enter double-digit sometime end of Q1, beginning of Q2. By the very end of Q3, it's
almost doubled again. So I mean there is a market pressure that's driving that. I think we are happy
that we can manage the challenges, that is lying currently quarters to it.
So on the life comment. So the life comment was intended to be, I mean, not a very scientific or
mathematical comment. So maybe one that was a bit more economic in terms of outlook, rather
than immediate IFRS impact. I mean really just to reiterate, I mean we have a book that is generally
positioned well for a low interest rate environment, but positioned well. It doesn't mean that at
every circumstance which is significant earnings growth. And as I look forward, and if I compare to
the last three years where I mean life has been the -- I guess the positive surprise on accounts
perspective well, and see that we work hard to deliver net [ph] performance.
I mean, I suspect we'll see P&C pickup some of the significant benefits we talked about really from
rate, but I expect life to slow down a bit, just given some of those economic headwinds.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

Operator
Next question comes from the line of James Shuck from Citi. Please go ahead.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon. Two questions from me please. On Farmers, you had some issues around kind
of trying to sell life products through the Farmers networks. Q3 seems to got a bit better versus
H1. Just be interested to see whether you actually seen any tangible improvement there? And also
on the P&C side, Farmers only grew GWP at 1% at nine month as the same as H1. I'm still waiting for
that to accelerate a little bit. I know you mentioned the Eastern states improving, but the headline
still isn't. And I would have expected the Uber deal to contribute towards that. And I guess, kind of,
how is your claims experience going with Uber in the light of one of Farmers' competitors
withdrawing from that segment. That's the first question.



Secondly, just around crop insurance, please. What was the crop insurance experience in Q3? And
when you're guiding towards slightly above the midpoint of 95%, 96% for full year, what are you
assuming for crop within that, please? Thank you.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

That's the longest, two questions I've ever heard. So on the -- first of all, on Farmers. So I think the
short summary here would be that we -- there's a long way to go. I think before, we'd be happy
with the progress that we see on the life side of Farmers. I mean I know that Jeff and the team at
Farmers -- for working hard there. I mean there are some operational changes. They've made to
try and create focal points. So we really have the expertise to do this well both within Farmers or
life within these changes. So we think the benefits are still yet to come. And we wouldn't
necessarily yet start to celebrate what we've seen in Q3. There's room for very significant
improvement.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the growth topic for the exchanges. I mean in this case, I think, Uber actually works against
them, because of course this is a GWP story. So, we're talking of a comparison to a period that
had, I guess one of the first Uber contract against one that doesn't. And while I hesitate to say if
you take something out and the comparison looks fabulous, I mean if you do look at the ex-Uber
picture, it is pretty consistent with what we've seen in the last couple of years. So, I mean the
growth rate would be higher if I take the growth in the prior period, driven by Uber. So it's a slightly
strange, but I think Uber works against them (inaudible).
On -- I mean, it's almost impossible for me to comment on the motivation for the -- that was -- of
the exit of this relationship. Otherwise exist between Uber another insurance company, all I can say
it's only based on the feedback that I've heard from Jeff and the team this relationship runs well.
We don't see it deviate significantly from the expectations. And I know the team enjoy working with
Uber and hoping to be able to support them further in the future.
On crop insurance, so what am I assuming. So again, I'm not sure if I had the opportunity to speak
to you guys as a group, so as to make sure that everyone has got the same information. I was
asked about crop back at the BAML conference, by the investor side and basically what I said to
them there is that prevented planting as I guess, you guys have heard already from some of the
more important peers in the market. I mean that is going to produce a cost to the business. So
having had, I mean, what really three absolutely fabulous years on crop, we're going to pay a bit
(inaudible) this year. The estimate I gave around the end of September was that we would expect
to see -- and just to keep it simple, combined ratios for crop probably edging into the three digit
area. So I think then I was thinking maybe high double-digits, low-triple, but I think today that would
be in the low triple-digit range. So we're talking, somewhere 7, 8 points above our normal
expectations. That assumption is purely prevented planting. So there's nothing in there about the
revenue outcomes, and we don't see any sign from the market, that there is any cause for an
expectation around the revenue outcomes that would be different from the plan, but we won't
know for sure, until we get through a period that will run out to somewhere, early December, just
given the late planting for a number of farming clients, the season will play run a bit longer than it
normally does. But it prevented planting, and I'm assuming about 7 or 8 points one crop versus a
normal expectation.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Great. Thank you, George.

Operator
Next question comes from the line of Farooq Hanif of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}



Hi, there. Thanks very much. Can you comment in the year-to-date, what's been happening in your
shift towards the kind of mid-corp segment in US commercial that you highlighted and kind of what
progress you're making there? And then secondly, the strong LatAm growth in P&C, to what extent
is this inflationary versus a real customer growth? Thank you.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Farooq. So the story on the mid market part of the commercial business in the US and
what progress that we made, we got some more expenses and we did a main summary so far. So
I mean Kathleen and her team are working hard to reshape our existing mid-market business. But I
think more importantly to create footprint that will serve mid-market clients and the brokers in a
way that mid-market segment expects to be served. But I mean, to be honest, I don't expect that
to be a significant generator of identical profit.

Bloomberg Transcript

I mean in fact not only this year, but also in next year. We are more likely to see additional costs in
the US as we build the necessary footprint. But I mean that's within the guidance we have given for
the cost outcome for this year, and you need to come to next week's Investor Day to hear more
about the cost picture that we assume for the next three year period.
Strong LatAm, so the -- I think if you're look at like-for-like, so that adjusts for the impact of
transactions, but also for foreign exchange. And of course the synergy, adjust for foreign
exchange, you will pick up some inflation impact. We have a reasonably sizable business in
Argentina, that's mainly retail auto focus. That's a business that is almost entirely -- it is imported,
so therefore it carries quite a bit of inflation risk. But has the products are structured in the way
they typically reprice very quickly deductibles typically float with the result that I mean you get back
to a dollarized answer pretty quickly, but it will tend to overstate the growth on a like-for-like basis.
So inflation in Argentina post slightly flattening the growth rate than we're achieving in Argentina.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Just coming back on that, I mean, you're still quite happy that you're getting decent double-digit
growth, underlying?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. So I think the -- I mean again if I look to -- I mean a good indicator across the entire region,
which is the joint venture. I mean their back well into double-digit growth again. I mean I think we're
back in the 20s. So even if I extract a reasonable number for the impact of inflation in some of the
stronger inflation markets, I mean the underlying is still strong positive growth.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks very much.

(Operator Instructions) The next question comes from the line of Jon Hocking, Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead.

Q - Jonathan Hocking
Hi there. Good afternoon everybody. Just got two questions, please. Just given what you're saying
about that your sort of reserving position in the US on both rates and tenancies moving the right
direction. Are there any lines of business where you had sort of reduced exposure on just a note
attractive enough to sort of tilt back into those lines. That's the first question. Secondly on Farmers.
Given where the surplus sits now, is there an opportunity with the exchanges to accelerate into the
expansion states vis-a-vis capital really not what's holding that back. Thank you.



FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thank you, Jon. So the -- on the reserving and the impact of things we've done in the past in terms
of reduced exposure could we reevaluate risk appetite. So the answer is yes, but it quite goes in
both directions, though. So, on the positive side, I mean, I think you guys are all aware that I mean
we have a reasonable -- we have two very substantial core shares in place in the US. One is around
the casualty book, and one is around property. The casualty one is intended to be strategic and
therefore longer term. And therefore, you shouldn't expect to see any significant change there.
That's not true of the property position. That was always intended to be a bit more tactical. I mean
we have been looking at that quite closely. Just given the trends that we're seeing in property, I
mean, we may reduce the session to the core share as we come up to renew at the beginning of
next year. I don't think we'll eliminate entirely, well, we just see how the market circles, but certainly
that would provide some, I mean, reasonably modest incremental growth to the US book.

Bloomberg Transcript

One additional comment to make on that though, we're not intending to carry more cat risk. So we
will spend a bit more money at the same time making sure that we hold the retention at the levels
that you guys have seen in the prior presentation.
On the flip side, though, the -- it was done to limit the -- and this is a global comment rather than
North America. We're looking to limit the business around credit and surety. I mean based on the
feedback that we get, I mean, growth is almost limitless around that topic or the potential for
growth is almost limitless. And we've told the business earlier this year that at least a step one, we
do not want to see capacity grow around that topic. And that's principally driven by the fact that, I
mean, we don't see broad themes in credit and surety, you do see an individual markets,
idiosyncratic topics and they range from things like (inaudible) in the UK a year ago to most
recently Thomas Cook in Germany. And you guys have seen the impact of that on us, where we
have a combination of both retention at the level that you are fairly familiar with and the additional
costs that we'll incur in reinstating the reinsurance.
So I think probably the book will shift a bit into next year and the year after, more likely and looks a
bit more short tail. But with the additional caveat that I think we've currently reached a tipping point
for our appetite around credit and in fact that may even start to scale back as we move into the
latter stages of the credit cycle. And I've talked so long in answering your first point, and I have
forgotten your second point. What was the second question Jon, sorry?

Q - Jonathan Hocking
Just on the Farmers surplus and whether that giving you the opportunity to expand faster?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So Jon, that's a yes. So the -- I mean the issue with Farmers, I don't think it's not a capital issue that
holds the exchanges back here. I mean you need, the right people with the right skills and the right
capabilities to divest in the right way. And of course they don't grow on trees. So when that tends
to be something that limits it, play more than in many other factors.

Q - Jonathan Hocking
Okay. Great. Thank you very much.

Next question comes from the line of Jonny Urwin, UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi there. Thanks, and thanks for taking my questions. Just to focus on the casualty stuff a bit more.
So I was just trying to gauge, George is that comment that you're not immune to these trends? Is



that incrementally more cautious versus 3Q. Secondly the -- I think you mentioned in the past the
US loss trend was running around 10 bps higher than Europe. Is that still the case? And then, are
you seeing any deterioration on your GL book or is it just building in a bit more prudence? Thank
you.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So the -- I think, I mean the real reason for the comment I made at the start with simply to relate
the fact that, I mean we recognize with in our portfolio, that the general trends that I think we hear
from others, they haven't had the same financial impact on us for a number of reasons, which
range from some of the steps that we took some time ago to reposition some of these
businesses. So that could be loss picks, it could be the size of the business. It could be the
reinsurance program that we have in place around casualty in the US.
But I mean, there's no doubt and if I think I mentioned already last year when we had either Q3 or
full year. I mean, we already so adverse on the US GL book, but we had the benefit that we had a
very substantial positive for that development around workers' comp. That trend hasn't changed
into this year. We've tried to make sure that we reflect our expectations for this year and the loss
picks that we made earlier in the year, but the selling more inflation across the entire market than
we would have anticipated a year ago.

Bloomberg Transcript

I don't expect that's going to cause us a significant challenge in our results for 2019. I mean, we
believe that we can manage that within the overall portfolio we have. So I guess, maybe slightly
more cautious, but I'm not trying to signal that we think we have a problem there. I mean, quite the
contrary, I think we've got the ability to manage this.
On lost cost rent -- on loss cost trends, so if you look at the US. And the US is probably up by
maybe 20 basis points, 30 basis points over the figures I gave back in the Q2 call. I mean Europe
tends to be a bit more stable around this topic. So I wouldn't expected the picture to have change
markedly other than, net-net, we see a bit more loss cost inflation in the US.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thank you very much. First of all, George, is there any chance you could give us an
update on where you think you're SST ratio has moved to by the middle of the year or may be at
the end of September? Some kind of update on that would be helpful. And then secondly, I think
you've alluded to this passing but just to be explicit, you made the comments about your
combined ratio. Given that you said that you -- at the first half, you expect your investment income
to be stable for the full year versus prior year. Are you sticking with that statement or would you
like to be a little bit more cautious on the outlook for P&C investment income given how yields
have fallen. I suppose, if you can just think about next year, as well as the ouster would be helpful?
Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. Good. Okay. So apologies on the SST topic, I cannot give you an update today on that. I
mean SST has a different methodology from Z-ECM. SST does permit a slightly -- a bit more
conservative UFR methodology than the Solvency II. So, I do have a number for you, but
directionally, I mean if you applied that SST permitted UFR, you would now expect to see the same
size of movement that you've seen in Z-ECM.

On the investment income topic, with the caveat that I gave earlier that you need to adjust for the
hedge fund topic and the investment income. So for the yield component, no change to our view
that may -- we will expect to see something broadly similar, but of course if interest rates
remained where they are -- where they where, if that makes sense, where they are and when
they're still lower than they were certainly the first half of the year. I mean that would have an
impact on investment income expectations for next year and potentially beyond.
I think the only thing to bear in mind there is that, I mean the duration of the liabilities and therefore
the assets is around five years. So it's a reasonably slow burn. But I mean, just given where we are,
if interest rates remain where they are, more lately that's a bit of a headwind, rather than a tailwind
for us.

And I know it's a really complicated equation in practice, but I mean, are you guys comfortable in
general, you can pass on the strain of low yields to the customer by adjusting the combined ratio
down, even at this very low level for yields?

So I think that -- I think -- whether it's because of interest rates, whether it's because of the GL
topic, whether it's because of net accumulations over the last few years, when you've got a rate
environment that is way ahead of loss cost trend. And in fact that gap has opened up again in Q3.
So I think there is a piece in there that I guess you could attribute to the impact of yields, but it's
hard to do that very scientifically. So I think the overall rate environment is doing more than enough
to help us with the yield issue coming.

That's great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Peter Eliot, Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thanks very much. George, just want to follow-up quickly on your comment on Thomas Cook.
Because this fund is behind the curve here, but last time we spoke, I thought that the message
was we shouldn't really expect anything material. And it seems -- were a little bit different. So I was
just wondering if you could update me anyway, on your thinking there and any quantification you
could give would be great?
And the second thing was just since we're on SST in modeling, what if we take the opportunity to
ask your interest rate sensitivity in your SST is relatively high and that compares to peers who
showed very little sensitivity. I mean my understanding was that the new SST framework with very
insensitive to interest rates. So I was just wondering if you could explain that to me or what you
know, why you have the largest sensitivity. Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks, Peter. So on Thomas Cook, I think last time we met, I talked about the loss, I gave a
very broad indication where the loss would fall. The thing that I'd like to have that conversation with
the impact of reinstatement premium. I don't expect the combination of these two things to be
particularly significant in the group's results for the year. But certainly, if you look at -- what you can - what I can, if you look at our Q3 results, I mean there's a delta in there that's driven by crop in
Thomas Cook. But I mean for example the -- I mean if you think of our normal retentions, I mean,



FINAL

today, I would expect Thomas Cook, the net claim payment, plus the reinstatement premium to be
around twice normal retention levels.
On SST modeling, so the answer is relatively simple and straightforward. Currently, I mean
modeling of interest rates, doesn't take full advantage of the UFR that SST permits, and that's why
you see this much more sensitive picture than our SST than you might see elsewhere. I mean that's
obviously a topic that as we look at the, the need to be a bit more consistent, but we're also going
to consider as we approach the year end.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Yeah, I mean, if I can just follow-up that very quickly. I mean obviously just that Z-ECM is used for
your internal view and management view and my interpretation was with the SST really it's only
purposes is regulatory. So I guess I'm just wondering why there should be any need to divert from
the regulatory framework.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah, I --

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Make sense in their lines on --

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So, specifically, we don't deviate from the regulatory framework because that wouldn't be
permitted.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

I'm sorry.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

We agree with them and the approach that we take and of course, I mean one of the challenges
with these complex models as the overhead of running these things is pretty substantial. So to the
extent that we can have consistency between them, it makes life a bit easier. So we've taken a
relatively pragmatic approach to some of these topics in the past, an agreement with the
regulator, but I guess that did not anticipate the size of the move that we saw back in Q3, but I
agree with you, I mean the SST serves an important part of this for the regulator. I mean we will
have another look to see if there is something we should do, but I just -- recognizing. Of course, I
mean we don't have a freedom in SST, that's something that if we do wish to change things,
(inaudible) will expect to review and take their decision on whether they are comfortable with any
change we may or may not propose in future.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

That's great.

A - Richard Burden

{BIO 1809244 <GO>}

Okay. As we have no more questions on the call, I'd just like to thank everybody for dialing in today.
If you have any follow-ups, please feel free to contact the IR team. Otherwise, we look forward to
seeing you all in London next week. Thank you.
