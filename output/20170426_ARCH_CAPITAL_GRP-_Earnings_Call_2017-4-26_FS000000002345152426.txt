Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Thank you, Chanel. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This is
our first quarter to include the combined results of Arch MI and United Guaranty, and we
are very pleased with the early days of our integration process. Marc will discuss the
integration and more details in a few minutes, but let me say that we are happy with the
progress achieved in the first quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Although, it is still early, we are very pleased with the resilience of the United Guaranty
Corporation's customers as they make the transition to our systems and platform
maintaining the strong relationships they achieve with United Guaranty over the years. As
we discussed last quarter, our guiding principles for the integration of these companies is
to find and deploy the best parts of each organization on a going forward basis.
I am referring not only to our most important resource, the people who come to work for
us every single day, but I'm also including the operating systems, pricing approach and
algorithms, along with all back-office functions that they provide customer service.
Our number one task is to create a high quality experience for our customers as we
continue to enhance Arch MI's position as a market leader that should earn good returns
through this cycle and for many years to come.
One additional benefit or opportunity that comes to or just results of the acquisition of
United Guaranty is the opportunity for us to move our headquarters of our global services
group to North Carolina. Our global services group manages a lot of the back office work
for our insurance, reinsurance, and mortgage businesses. And consolidating the
operations over time in one location increases our flexibility to fill jobs that are lost
through attrition in other parts of the country to a lower cost environment.
Now, turning to first quarter results, our reported combined ratio on a core basis, Mark will
define that in a moment, improved by 7.7 points from the first quarter of 2016, led by
excellent results in the mortgage segment, offset by the effects of higher attritional and
catastrophe losses in our property and casualty segments.

FINAL

Accident year results decline in both our insurance and reinsurance segments, reflecting
soft market conditions. Our mortgage segment improved its accident year combined
ratio quarter-over-quarter to 50.4% from 65.8%, 15.4 points of improvement in the first
quarter of 2016 year as the tailwinds of better credit quality and scale drove excellent
profitability at Arch MI U.S.
Tellingly, our mortgage segment went from representing only seven point percent of net
earned premiums on a core basis in the first quarter last year to 24.6% for the first quarter
this year, nearly identical to the earned premium for our reinsurance segment in the first
quarter of 2017.
Loss reserve development remained favorable in each of our segments which, in the
aggregate, reduced our combined ratio by 8.5 points. There were no significant changes
in the property casualty operating environment from last quarter. Marc Grandisson will
elaborate on what we see in each of these markets in a few minutes.

Bloomberg Transcript

On an operating basis, we produced an annual return on equity of 10.3 % while on a net
income basis, we earned a return on equity of 12.6% for the first quarter of 2017. Net
investment income per share for the first quarter was $0.69 per share, up $0.13
sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to the assets that came over
with the acquisition of United Guaranty.
Our annualized pre-tax investment income yield was 2.13% for the first quarter of 2017,
just slightly above the level observed in the fourth quarter of 2016. As you know, we
manage our investment portfolio on a total return basis which, on a local currency basis,
was up 170 basis points for the quarter and 164 basis points, if we exclude the effects of
foreign exchange.
Our book value per common share at March 31, 2017, was $57.69 per share, a 4.5%
increase from the fourth quarter of 2016 and a 16.4% increase from the first quarter of last
year. Mark Lyons will give more details on the components of their change in book value
per share in a few minutes.
Before I turn the call over to Marc Grandisson, I would like to discuss our PMLs which
declined modestly from January 1. As of April 1, 2017, our largest 250 year PML for a single
event in the Northeast was down to $473 million or 6% of common shareholders' equity.
This is the lowest we ever had in our history. Our Gulf of Mexico PML was at $383 million
and Florida Tri-County PML decreased to $386 million.
I will now turn it over to Marc Grandisson to comment on our operating units and market
conditions. Marc, over to you.

Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Thank you, Dinos and good morning to you all. Before I review market conditions across
our segments, I am pleased, as Dinos alluded to earlier, to report that the integration of
UG and Arch MI is going very well with a focus on high customer service to maintain or
Page 3 of 30



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2017-04-26

improve our relationships. While the strength of the combined entity is already apparent,
we are working diligently to unify the U.S. MI operations and, most notably, we have
decided to base our U.S. mortgage insurance headquarters in North Carolina.

FINAL

We believe that there will be opportunities and additional opportunities to realize
efficiencies without jeopardizing our customer relationships and we will keep you
informed as those efforts materialize for the next several quarters.
At the end of our first quarter, as a combined global MI company, our expense ratio for
this segment declined to 29%. Over the next few years, we are targeting a mid-20s
expense ratio in the segment as the business matures. Our new insurance written, or NIW,
was $12.7 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 8% over the same quarter in 2016 on
an as-if combined basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

We estimate that Arch U.S. MI's market shares remained in the mid-20s for the first
quarter of 2017 consistent on a pro forma basis with the 26% market share indicated last
quarter. The current premium yield was essentially unchanged with the last quarter's level.
Over 75% of our NIW came through our risk based pricing platform. Rising interest rates in
the fourth quarter reduced the volume of refinance activity and accordingly led to an
improved level of persistency which came in at 77%. Purchase market accounted for 85%
of our volume this quarter. The overall quality of the risk written is still very strong and
stable, with average FICO scores of 743 in our monthly singles mix at 82% and 18%,
respectively, meeting our post acquisition objectives in the quarter.
Arch also continued to build on its position in the U.S. GSE risk sharing transaction with
approximately $2.2 billion of risk-in-force at the end of the first quarter 2017. Arch remains
a lead market for this type of risk transfer execution.
Finally, our Australian mortgage insurance relationship continues to generate a good flow
of business and contributed roughly $4 million of profit for the quarter. As this business is
all single payment upfront, its contribution to profits should grow with time as premiums
are earned over the life of the mortgages.
Moving onto the P&C insurance world which represents 50% of our earned premium, as
we have indicated on prior calls, market condition remains challenging. Rate decreases
have slowed somewhat, but are still broadly less than last trend. This is especially true for
larger access accounts which tend to be more commoditized.
The rate change differential between our segment is wide, reaching for 410 bps in the
U.S. for the first quarter. A positive 140 bps rate change for the lower volatility line and a
negative 270 bps for our cycle managed business. As a result of that market dichotomy,
all of our P&C segments continue to move towards smaller account and more specialized
areas of the market and are walking away from accounts when returns are not acceptable.
In our primary U.S. P&C insurance operations, we had margin erosion of 70 basis points for
all lines in the first quarter. To borrow an expression from Dinos, we have seen what's
cooking in the kitchen before and we don't like the taste of that meal.

FINAL

Turning to reinsurance which represents about 25 % of our earned premium this quarter,
it's a similar story and that we continue to focus on the few opportunities that we have
relative rates strength and more favorable returns while we are de-emphasizing the more
commoditized segments, as rate and loss trends continue to erode margin.
Reflecting on the current trends in a broader reinsurance market, I am reminded of the
old adage that I heard often from Paul Ingrey volume is vanity, profit is sanity. Allocating
capital judiciously is a cornerstone of our corporate mandate. As we sit here today,
mortgage represent one-third of our allocated capital, 25% of our net earned premium
and 70% of our underwriting gain at a mid-to-high teens ROE.
We're happy to have the flexibility to allocate capital across our three platforms to the
markets which are generating good returns and we believe that this flexibility allows Arch
to generate alpha with more stable returns for its shareholders.
And with that, I'll hand this over to Mark to cover the detailed financial results.

Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Marc, and good morning, everyone. Given that this is the first full quarter after
the UGC acquisition, I am going to provide more focus on the associated impact on the
call today. First though, I'll highlight just a few items about this quarter. But as a reminder,
the usual quarterly topics can be found in the earnings release and the associated
financial supplement.
Okay, now, I'll make some summary comments for the first quarter, all on a core basis as
Dinos referenced earlier. The term core corresponds to Arch's financial results excluding
Watford Re, whereas the term consolidated includes Watford Re. So claims recorded in
the first quarter of 2017 catastrophic events that have reinsurance recoverable and
reinstatement premiums were $12.3 million or 1.2 loss ratio points compared to 0.5% in
the first quarter of 2016 on the same basis, mostly emanating from within our reinsurance
segment. The activity was primarily driven by Australian Cyclone Debbie and various other
smaller events around the globe.
Again, we believe that this result continues to highlight our property cat underwriting
discipline as actual reported losses on cat events continue to correlate with the exposure
reductions that have been implemented over the last several years.
As for prior period, pure net loss reserve development, approximately $83 million of
favorable development was reported in the first quarter led by the reinsurance segment
with approximately $57 million favorable, the insurance segment of about $2 million
favorable and the mortgage segment providing nearly $24 million of favorable
development. Nearly all of the mortgage segment favorable development emanated
from the U.S. portfolio and a meaningful portion or $8.2 million, stemmed from favorable
development resulting from subrogation recoveries on mostly second-lien and other
portfolios that came over as part of the UGC acquisition and that are, in fact, runoff
operations. These subrogation recoveries have been reflected in UGC's historical results

FINAL

over time and could continue this year and in future years, depending upon the
associated claims management of the files. The reinsurance segment, net favorable
development was across most underwriting years for short and medium tailed lines and
predominantly from the 2003 through 2013 underwriting years for long-tailed lines.
The calendar quarter combined ratio on a core non-Watford basis was 78.8% and when
adjusting for cats in prior period development, the core accident quarter combined ratio
was 86.1% compared to 92.4% in the first quarter of 2016.
The reinsurance segment, accident quarter combined ratio excluding cats of 97.6%
compared to the first quarter of 2016's 94.2%, while the insurance segment's accident
quarter combined ratio excluding cats was 97.8% compared to 94.9% in the first quarter
of 2016. Both results reflect higher loss specs due to current difficult market conditions.
The reported insurance group accident quarter, excluding cat loss ratio, increased
approximately 150 basis points quarter-over-quarter. And after controlling for large
attritional losses and mix changes, increased approximately 70 bps, which Marc
Grandisson referred to earlier.

Bloomberg Transcript

Competitive conditions in the PC markets, however, were more than offset by the
continued improved profitability of the mortgage segment, amplified with their net
earned premium of being a larger proportion of the total.
The mortgage segment's accident quarter combined ratio improved 14.4 points, as Dinos
referenced, quarter-over-quarter and their net earned premium represented nearly 25%
of the total core net earned premium compared to only 7.4% in the corresponding quarter
of 2016.
Remember that in the mortgage segment, accident quarter has a different connotation
than in PC and it is more similar in concept to claims made businesses in PC space since
the notice of default defines the assignment to the appropriate quarter.
Similar to last quarter, there were some expense cost in the first quarter resulting from
the UGC acquisition. You may recall that since the acquisition occurred at yearend 2016,
only the balance sheet was impacted in the fourth quarter, not the income statement. This
quarter, we have a full income statement reflection of the combined portfolios.
As for the referenced expenses, the company incurred $15.6 million of such pre-tax
expenses related to the UGC transaction in the quarter as compared to $25.2 million
incurred tierly in the fourth quarter of 2016.
The sources of cost were different, however, as this quarter, the cost emanated from
UGC acquisition-specific bonuses, severance and outplacement costs and trailing UGC
transaction legal costs. More specifically, the UGC specific bonuses and transition
compensation costs totaled $6.8 million pre-tax and severance and outplacement costs

FINAL

totaled the $8.2 million, resulting from reduction in force actions taken on January 31 and
March 31, affecting approximately 205 employee positions and 60 contractors.
The actual salary compensation recognized in the first quarter associated with these
employees involved in the risk-in-force efforts was $4.1 million. Given that the January 31
reduction in force only had one month of salary expense reflected in the quarter and the
March 31 reduction in force had a full quarter of salary expense reflected, a $5.7 million
quarterly run rate savings of salary expense is anticipated.
We will comment in future quarters about any other actions taken and their financial
impact, but these figures reflect only the impact of reductions in force that have already
been implemented. Given the nature of these expenses, we have excluded them from
operating income as they are not indicative for our true underlying performance.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'd also like to remind everyone that we issued approximately 12.8 million common
equivalent shares to AIG as part of the UGC purchase price. They had an insignificant
impact last quarter on average common shares outstanding, given the 12/31 closing date,
but had a material impact this quarter as the diluted weighted average common shares
outstanding increased to approximately 139 million shares this quarter versus 125.4 million
in the fourth quarter of last year. I bring this up because I still see analyst reports and
conversations still utilizing pre-common share equivalent numbers. We're using that in all
our statistics and we recommend you do too.
As a respect to the effective tax rate with our changing portfolio and geographic mix, I
provided full year 2017 indications on the last call that the expected tax rate on pre-tax
operating income would likely be in the low to mid-teens range. In the first quarter of
2017, our tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 14.4% with 100 basis points additional
reductions of 13.4%, stemming from a change in GAAP accounting affecting stock
compensation.
I'd like to point out that we expanded our U.S. primary mortgage insurance disclosure in
the financial supplement to provide enhanced information by book year or underwriting
year for the PC analyst. For loss reserves, insurance in-force, risk in-force and delinquency
rates, as well as aggregate NIW splits between monthly and single premium policies, as
well as providing our PMIER efficiency ratios on a consolidated U.S. MI entity basis.
I also want to highlight the difference between the U.S. primary mortgage division's gross
versus net risk-in-force. At the end of the quarter, the gross risk-in-force is $60.6 billion,
whereas the net risk-in-force is 28% lower at $43.6 billion.
As we have consistently implemented in all our segments, our ongoing mortgage
strategy is to maximize profitability while simultaneously protecting the balance sheet.
The existing quota shares that are in place, along with the existing and ongoing excess of
loss and capital market protections provide this aggregate and tail risk balance sheet
protection we see.

FINAL

As for after-tax operating income EPS accretion realized in the first quarter of 2017 from
the UGC acquisition, we examined our results with it and without the impact of the UGC
acquisition, giving due consideration to associated debt financing interest cost, preferred
stock dividend charges and intangible amortization.
The realized beneficial accretion from the transaction was nearly 25% on a reported basis.
And just to remind everyone, we have previously provided long-term operating income
per share run rate accretion indications over a multiyear period of being in the 35% area.
It is important to reemphasize that this long-term reportable accretion is expected to
accelerate, as the 2017 and later book years become more impactful on a net basis in
future quarters and as the benefits from reductions in force and other actions, such as
duplicative system eliminations over time are also realized in future quarters.
On a GAAP basis, at March 31, our total debt to total capital ratio was 20.6% and total
debt plus preferred to total capital is 27.7%, which is down 100 basis points from yearend
2016. This leverage reduction was due to our growth in common equity as our debt and
preferred levels were unchanged from yearend.

Bloomberg Transcript

Consolidated operating cash flows were down $111 million relative to the first quarter of
2016. The first quarter operating cash flow was generally lower on a seasonal basis and
the timings of higher retrocessional and reinsurance premiums from our reinsurance and
mortgage groups, respectively, drove a majority of that change. We did not purchase any
shares during the first quarter of 2017 and don't anticipate repurchasing any during the
balance of 2017.
As a reminder, our remaining authorization is $446.5 million, which has been extended
through yearend 2019. Dinos mentioned our growth in book value per share of 4.5% from
last quarter. It's important to note that this stemmed from both strong underwriting and
strong investment performance.
And with these introductory comments, we're now pleased to take your questions.

FINAL

Hi. How are you doing?

Q - Geoffrey Murray Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

Good. Thank you. I was hoping I could get a little bit more color on the incurred loss
development in the MI side this quarter. First, can you give a better idea in terms of the
improving claim rates, are you seeing that from your late stage bucket or more of the mid
and early stage delinquencies?

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think on the U.S. side, you're going to see that – remember that's kind of a report quarter
view and we're not seeing that – well, we're not recognizing it as much in the more recent
report quarters as it would be for once a little more aged. But I think just part of what we
might want to discuss given the size of it is that – and I've mentioned that most of it is
coming from the U.S. business, about $1 million came from the reinsurance side, so it's
kind of insignificant.
But there was on subrogation, on a cash receipt basis, on the establishments that
normalized our accounting policies between the two consolidated entities now. So
subrogation reserves put up. These are normal course, but they were scattered between
first lien and second lien and other portfolios that were there and they've been there
historically, they're there now. The fact that they're most of it is in run-off doesn't mean
that they're going to dissipate. They'll fall off a lot more slowly over time. So hopefully that
answers your question.

Q - Geoffrey Murray Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

So your comment about the favorable roll rate is more on the subrogation EWOC
exposure, not necessarily the primary book?

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

No. Well, the primary book, yes you're still seeing some improvement, but they're not
coming from the 2016 report quarter. I believe it's 2015 and a little bit backwards.

Q - Geoffrey Murray Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

Okay. So the 12-plus, all right. And then on the current period provision, can you give us an
idea the incidence assumption for the new notices and how that compares to maybe the
pro forma result a year ago?

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Actually, I don't have that in front of me, so you're talking about the claim rate...

Okay, great. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Your
line is now open.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, and good morning. So the MI expense saving opportunities it looks like if you
look at legacy Arch as well UGC, the other operating expenses add up to about $60
million and this quarter is down to $40 million, is that the run rate going forward or there
are say other opportunities or the other way to ask it is that you're targeting at 25%
expense ratio over time now it's 29%, you think that improvements more coming from the
absolute dollar amount of reduction were more from the top line premium growth?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Let me give it a shot and I'll give it to Marc to get into the details. But we didn't make
projections even though internally we have certain things in mind because I want our
teams as they integrate to do it in a fashion that improves our long-term opportunities to
be as efficient and as effective without affecting customer service with our competitors.
Having said that, okay, a lot of it is going to come from redundancy in personnel that it will
get eliminated over time. Mark gave you a number, in the first quarter we have eliminated
approximately 270 positions, on April 1 there was an additional 97. We're just going to be
as part of our report card, we're going to share with you in the second quarter not
knowing what else is going to happen in the second quarter because I'm not putting
undue pressure on (29:19) to hit certain numbers.
Our instructions, Marc and I, is do the right thing with the idea that if we don't need certain
individuals see if we can reassignment into other jobs, look as we lose in attrition in other
parts of the organization. And that's one of the reasons we even move our global
services headquarters down there because it allows us to manage the workforce in a
much more efficient basis and we're not just focusing on United Guaranty. We're looking
at every operation and we do that as a matter of course independent if we made an
acquisition or not. That's a prudent way of managing.

FINAL

In addition to that, you've got to get into systems and back rooms and not just
headcounts, but where does that head count resides and is of course differential. For
example, a New York job is much more expensive than a North Carolina job and a job in
the Philippines is even less expensive than a job in North Carolina and we look at that as a
global organization. So there will be additional savings.
It's not that we don't know how to push the pencil and make calculations, but we don't like
to promise things to influence good judgment. We'll rather report after we take the
actions than trying to hit a particular number.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah, and I think what I would add in terms of the questions, the top line is not going to
change significantly just by virtue of being an MI portfolio. It's very sticky, it's very
straightforward, a lot of monthlies coming in, depending on our market share. But for the
remainder of the year, for foreseeable future, we don't see much change. So it's really to
answer your question more directly which Dinos did it that's going to be really as a result
of absolute dollar reduction as opposed to premium related ratio.

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I'll add Kai, as Marc alluded to, wouldn't be felt as much in 2017 which is probably the
model question you are asking. But on longer-term basis, as the impact of the AIG quota
share, 50% quota share on 2014, 2015, 2016 underwriting years starts to lessen and we're
writing 2017, 2018 towards 100% without the quota share coming in, that will start to flip
and you'll see an increasing growth on a net basis for your denominator.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Without change in the personnel

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Correct.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

And you know the quota share has a 30% fee, so at some point in time that, it will revert
to a benefit.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. That's very clear.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

And the 25% is not – we think we are going to be over time below that number, but at
some point in time, we say, hey, 25% is something that we're trying to achieve 25%
expense ratio, but it can even be better than that over time. All I want is efficient
operations with good customer service. And at the end of the day, we want to not have
an un-level playing field with our competition so we monitor that.
Page 11 of 30

How do they do things, are they are better than us? What things we need to do to
improve? And I don't want to have a structural disadvantage. And traditionally, over the
last 15 years we didn't allow that in our operations and we won't allow it in the MI space
either.

FINAL

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. And is there a restatement in terms of the legacy like Arch MI expenses.

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

I guess there's two things (33:11) I wouldn't say there was a reclass associated with the
intangible amortization where in the mortgage space and others we had it more above
the line, now we have below the line. So because with our goal to be very, very
transparent on the UGC tangible amortization. It only makes sense to make that a
corporate wide approach. So yes, so would have been a reclass and that's why some of
the prior year may look a tiny bit different than it was when you look at the numbers last
year, so it's a good catch.

Q - Kai Pan

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo.
Your line is now open.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. When you guys announced this deal with UGC in August, you guys had
said about 50% of earnings would come from P&C and mortgage. I know you have the
underwriting income which shifts to about 70% in mortgage. Would you say that the
Page 12 of 30

mortgage market has gotten better or the P&C market has gotten worse than the view
that you had I guess when you announced this deal and laid out those metrics to us in
August?

FINAL

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, you look at it in a very short time. In the short time, your question is – and your
conclusion is correct. I think the P&C, both insurance and reinsurance, has deteriorated
because we're not getting rate increases to keep up with trends. So, in essence, it's
eroding, so that means you're going to write a little less than what you wanted to and the
profitability might not be, a little less than what you want to.
Having said that, I think every indication on the MI space is that things are better.
Delinquencies, they're better, and in essence, the credit box has not deteriorated, is as
good as it was at that time. But you got to take our comments from the long-term
because in everything that we do, we have a long-term view and we make judgments as
to where we're going to play, how much capital and resources we're going to allocate on
the long-term view. And right now, I can tell you, green light is on MI, amber, not red, but
amber lights on the P&C, both insurance and reinsurance.

Bloomberg Transcript

Having said that, I can't predict the future. I don't know if the P&C cycle changes and at
what time it's going to change. But I can tell you, don't forget, our roots, the P&C and it
doesn't mean we're not going to do a lot on the P&C space, given the right market
opportunity. We're not reducing the group capability from an underwriting perspective.
As a matter of fact, I think it's fair to say we have a bit of overcapacity in underwriting
talent, which we're going to maintain. The course associated with that is insignificant when
you weigh it versus the opportunity when the market turns. Is it going to turn two years
from today, three years from today, I don't know. But I can tell you, when it does, we're
going to know it, we're going to take advantage of it and we will have the people, we're
not going to be chasing people to take advantage of it. Anything you want to add, guys?

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Just one quick thing. I think it's easy to get lost in the sauce. It's a good observation. That's
the underwriting gain or loss, but each of those businesses have a little different duration.
So, reinsurance group may have more property, cat, so the insurance group may have
longer tailed lines, at a higher proportion, they're bringing in more investible assets and
so forth. So when you look at underwritings, you brought interest income and it will be
skewed a little bit differently away from mortgage.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then Dinos, following up on your comments, you mentioned loss trends
on the property casualty side, do you think if we start to see a higher level inflation, which
it seems like you and some of your peers are pointing to, do you think the industry will
take price to combat higher inflationary levels?

FINAL

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

No, you're thinking very illogically and that's a mistake in our business. The emotions that
drive markets is fear and greed. And right now, I don't see greed out there, I see some
concern but I don't see fear. Yes, there is some concern. As a matter of fact, I think the
canary in the coal mine is being commercial auto liability, who has a short tail, and is
starting to percolate and bubble up in a lot of places. You see it on the writers of
commercial auto, you see it in penetrations on the umbrellas which is part of the mix when
you write excess liability umbrella. You're covering that portion of the risk, too. And you're
seeing a reaction in the reinsurance market. It's not easy to find auto carve-outs anymore
or the pricing is going up.
So, it's not an early indication that maybe GL might be a problem in the next year or two,
and then workers' comp maybe later on. It might create that environment that people,
they say, we've got to adjust pricing in all three lines going forward. I don't know.
We can't predict the future but I can tell you, there is stress in the system because it
requires more rate increases than we're getting. And we're not keeping up with the trend.
And it sounds to me like 1998, 1999 all over again that the frog is in the happy water, but
the temperature is going up.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I think in addition I would just add to what Dinos has said, the other dimension about fear
and greed is that underwriters of companies underwrite also with some kind of – with the
assumption of what the interest rates are going to be in the future. So, the inflation goes
up and interest rate goes up accordingly, if not more, it generate all kinds of different
behaviors.
I would argue with that even in this day and age, in the last two, three quarters, there is
probably an expectation of rate increasing in the future that might explain why some of
the pricing is still softening as we speak. So, there's a lot of stuff, there's a lot of things
moving in the marketplace. So, there's more than one just number that would drive
(40:51) everything.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, great. Do you guys have a forecast for mortgage industry NIW for 2017 and what
share that would be for Arch?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

We have expectations and then we do follow the MBA and the Freddie and Fannie and we
look at what they do, what they produce. So we would look at the same data that you're
looking at. In terms of NIW, we have, of course, projections we think we're going to be
accomplishing but we're not at liberty to share that. And frankly, we're going to be
reacting to whatever market situation present itself in the next year or so.

Page 14 of 30

FINAL

So, we don't spend much time, if you will, projecting what NIW is going to be in the
market. We have a good place, a good positioning with our clients and we try to do the
best. And as we said before, our market share over time, we expect might decrease in
the low to mid-20%s. So, that also could be something that happens by attrition. A lot of
things are moving.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

It's a pleasant surprise for us. I don't know if it's a surprise. It was basically – we didn't see
much overlap between Arch MI and United Guaranty. There was only one major customer
that both of us were significant participants and they reduced our combined share just
slightly in the first quarter. There was no other change from any other major customer.
And that's why I talk about the resilience of the customer base of United Guaranty. And
basically, we are trying to do the best job possible not only to maintain the service at a
very, very high quality, but also improve upon it and that's what I've been emphasizing to
our staff.
That's why I said let's not focus on integration of cost savings upfront at the expense of
customers. We're going to focus on excellent customer service. And over time, we're
going to get very efficient in how we provide that. And I think you can do both if you're a
well-managed company.

Hi. Good morning. Just first to follow up on the share buyback. I think you said you
wouldn't buy back any stock in 2017. So, just to clarify, if AIG did sell, you would not
participate?

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Well, there's optionality in there. It's a decision tree, basically. But it's as I stated, but we're
not going to be buy – overtly, other than those possibilities, we're not going to be going
out and buying back shares.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. Our theme there, Sarah is, we always want to have flexibility on the balance sheet.
Right now, our debt and hybrid is at about 27-point-something-percent, of which about
4.5% or so is short-term revolving facility. That doesn't give us a lot of capital credit with
the rating agencies. So, at some point in time, my first action with excess capital, maybe I
can reduce that down and then we'll revisit the share repurchase in 2018 and beyond.
Don't forget, I don't know when AIG is going to decide to sell, so I can't answer that
question. If they're selling in 2017, we probably could likely we will not participate, but if it's
2018, it's an open question.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Okay, great. Thank you. And then separately, I wanted to get your thoughts on some of
the practices of the insurance brokers. Chubb was critical at some of their practices,
particularly in London and so there could be regulatory or customer backlash and now
they're being investigated by the FCA. So, just trying to get your thoughts on some of the
practices and do you see any regulatory risk with your current distribution channel?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Listen, at the end of the day, distribution cost is part of the business, been always part of
the business. Some people view it as transactional. I think it's more than that. Some of it is
transactional, some of it is advice and counsel, et cetera, and it's all buried into some
number.
The ultimate arbiter of if that's fair or unfair or sustainable is the customers themselves.
They know that both our revenue and the broker's revenue comes from only one source,
it's out of premium they pay. So, if they don't like what's going on, they have ways to
change that. But at the end, that's a customer decision.
Now you asked the regulatory question. We believe, at the end of the day, that the
insurance and reinsurance business is highly competitive and we're strong believers in the
free market. So, at the end of the day, if the customer is satisfied and nobody is doing
anything that is illegal which the regulator has a say in it, let the market decide if it's fair
compensation or unfair compensation and the buyer of the product is the person who
counts the most.

Hi. Good morning, guys.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

FINAL

Good morning.

Q - Nicholas Mezick

{BIO 20223149 <GO>}

So last year, you discussed the way to think about mortgage, earnings volatility as the
micro or underwriting decision and the macro changes. Now you assigned two-thirds of
the volatility on the micro and one-third on the macro. Given the different composition of
the book today with the UGC acquisition, how would you expect a change in either of
those sensitivities?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Actually, what I said last year, it was 70%/30%, not 66% and two-thirds, and 33% and onethirds.

Q - Nicholas Mezick

{BIO 20223149 <GO>}

My apologies on that (47:46).

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

And I'm sticking to that 70%/30% because we did analyze a lot of back data through the
financial crisis as to what was causing defaults and we compare it with other
environments.
For example, what happened in Canada where all day no verification loans, et cetera.
They were not allowed and there was a minimum of 5% downpayment requirement and if
you go historically and you see the performance of the Canadian book of business, it was
much different even with the same economic conditions not only affecting the U.S., but
affecting Canada and what the outcome of that business.
So, the 70%/30% hasn't changed and what I'm saying – what we're seeing, I think, the
ability of MI companies to go back to the very loose underwriting standards that were
common during the financial crisis in 2006, 2007, 2008. In the future, they would be much
more difficult. First of all, managements, they saw companies go bust, so they're more
resilient on the risk management side of the business. And more importantly, I think the
technology is much better today in analyzing individual mortgages and attributes that
affect that.
And also, more importantly, the GSEs, both Fannie and Freddie, with the PMIER approach
and as regulators of the MI companies, they're a lot more resilient in their approach on
maintaining stability on the balance sheets of the companies that they provide them the
counterparty risk.

But right now, exactly what's going on, there's no change from last year, because really
what drives the losses and we've seen historically is the products that were offered in the
marketplace. And we've seen no change in the products offering. And to echo what Dinos
just said about the GSEs being really wary or at least very attentive to what's happening in
the marketplace, they had an increase in the sort of discounted LPMI business as of last
years, recognizing that, that might represent a bit more risk to the system. So there's
really a heightened level and still high level of scrutiny and attention paid to the product
that are delivered in the business. So no change from last year.

Q - Nicholas Mezick

All right. Just one follow-up. Last quarter, you referenced your door being broken down by

on the status of the door and in turn demand for the reinsurance of your portfolio, in
particular the MI book?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

It hasn't changed, but like I said, we're here to feed our shareholders first. And then if we
have extra, we can be charitable to others. This is a good business. Within our risk
management limitations, we will continue to have our shareholders in mind first and then
our reinsurance partners and other segment.

Good morning. Hi, Josh.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Hi, Josh.

Q - Joshua D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Hi there. Following up on the last question, I wonder why it does or does not make sense
to think about MI the same way we think about cat. Is there a PML that you have and
maybe you're not going to tell us what it is, but do you calculate something like that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yes, we do. You've got to think on the concept of what is (52:32) event, right? A severe
recession, housing prices collapsing, et cetera. And we build these models that we model
and then we calculate based on the book that we have what the macroeconomic effect of
those events. They don't happen like a hurricane that happens in one day and the next
day, it's going to be more gradual. But at the end of the day, if you're writing the business,
you got to be cognizant of that. But we model that and we have a tolerance and the
tolerance is no different that we don't want to commit on these, what I would call
catastrophic events more than a probability of us of losing 25% of our common equity
capital.
So that limitation is still there. It's a board (53:29) limitation. Myself and the rest of the
management team in our discussions with our board, they say we want to know what is
the maximum loss that you're willing to have on a stress scenario. And we want to
understand what that stress scenario is all about. And that's how we build our model
around it. Marc, do you want to elaborate...

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

The only thing I want to add, Josh, it's not exactly like a cat book of business because
you're going to have future (54:00) coming in so you have to factor in an S&P type of PML.
So this is what Dinos is alluding to. We have to factor that in because it's part and parcel of
what we're assuming as part of the policies. The policies, those that don't default
continue paying premium for the future and we've taken credit for that as well. So, just
want to make sure it's not one event, one-off event, like Dinos said, that happens
overnight. It's an over two- or three-year period development and we take an S&P type of
approach.

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

And Josh, I think one other thing. It's a good question, especially given the relative size of
its origin (54:34). But thinking wise, you got to learn from the past. I mean anything that
Page 19 of 30



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2017-04-26

erupts that can cut across underwriting years, we learned from asbestos and the GL, we
learned from environmental and the GL, we learned from D&O, anything that could signal
it, you can break it down, these lines have at least a component of cat. I think more so in
the mortgage space but we think about that in every line of business.

FINAL

Q - Joshua D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

So, let's just take a scenario. I look at the business right now as not only well underwritten
but also well priced. And even if pricing works, the clients still might be well underwritten
on the mortgage by mortgage level, therefore, avoiding the risk of "catastrophe". To
what extent...

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, you're not avoiding the risk totally, the risk of catastrophe. Because even well
underwritten business, if you have higher unemployment, you're going to have hardships,
your default rate is going to go up. If you're going to have house prices collapse, that
means the claims that you're going to have, they're going to cost you more.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, at the end of the day, those you can avoid. And I put that a round number of 30% on
the problem in the past crisis was macroeconomic events. Who is the affected, for
example, the Canadian book of business but it didn't cost companies, their profitability
suffer, but there were still profitable and they didn't go out of business.
What caused collapses in the U.S., it was all these crazy stuff like how do you underwrite
an old verification law (56:19). You don't know the information you're getting is correct.
How do you factor in these old days? Or 110% LTV stuff. And there was a lot of craziness
that went into the mortgage space at that time.

Q - Joshua D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

So, when the cat market gets irrational, Arch can say, look, someone else can underwrite
this business, there's a hundred other companies who know how to write property cat, let
them chase the market down.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Exactly right.

Q - Joshua D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

When you're only one of six or seven participants, what does that mean when the market
gets irrational?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

When the market gets irrational, that means you got to maintain your discipline. Our
hallmark as a company is that we have been disciplined underwriters. And as long as I
breathe, this team which I have 1000% confidence is, they're going to be disciplined

Page 20 of 30



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td

Date: 2017-04-26

underwriters. It's our DNA. For better or worse, it's our DNA. The Arch DNA is disciplined
underwriting. Be patient, disciplined and at the end of it.

FINAL

And thank God, we got a board who understands that. I never, never had a discussion with
my board that says, oh, your volume is suffering or – they never talk about volume. They
do talk about profit and margin and are you taking undue risk. That we talk all the time.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Josh, it's unfair to really compare it to a cat, because a cat in January 1, I don't know that
there's going to be a hurricane in September that hits Florida. But it's underwriting
mortgage and we have indeed, our company have the proper early warning systems in
terms of risk quality. We're going to have actually take actions way ahead of things
percolating up.
It's a decision as to where we put the red line or the yellow line as to when we start deemphasizing it. We do have access that information. And frankly, and Dinos has said this in
prior calls, if the people that were in (58:19) the business in 2006, 2007, 2008 had
heeded those calls and those points and those clear indication signals in the marketplace,
they wouldn't have put themselves in the position.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, it's not like you wake up one day and the risk quality was as good as it gets and
overnight, it everything goes down by 20% and the unemployment goes from 5% to 25%.
You have a lot of products, (58:43) you have time to react.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

PMI was recognizing segments of their business into what we will call the red line, all the
way back in 2004. And they did not take action. As a matter of fact, they increased their
participation in everything that they are monitoring systems were showing red. Meaning
all-day no ver loans, they became 28% of their book of business because a lot of the
customers, especially, countrywide, et cetera, it was threatening them. You don't write all
of that, you're not going to get the good.
Well, I said this before, you give me three glasses of Kool-Aid and one has cyanide in it,
I'm not drinking it. So, even though the other two they're very refreshing and I'm very
thirsty, I'm not drinking it. And basically, that's what the industry did. They were given three
glasses, one had cyanide in it, and they down all three of them.

Q - Joshua D. Shanker

I appreciate the goofy image.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

I don't want to be graphic, but I tell you, when you're running a company and you got your
shareholders capital and you've got 3,500 employees in your hands, you got to feel like I
feel. You got to be very responsible, not only for the capital, but also for the welfare of
the employees.

The bourbon will neutralize it, I'm sure.

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

But one other thing, if I could, Josh, Dinos and Marc have talked about this before, but the
history was that the MIs took all the risk on their balance sheet, 100% in, 100% retained.
That's clearly not part of our strategy. That's the strength of the PC side. We can't think
any other way than simultaneously managing balance sheet. And maybe, Dinos, I'll kick it
to you but the benefit of going to capital markets and reinsurance as a leading indicator
unto itself.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

You always have to have a loop to the market. So, by purchasing reinsurance and capital
markets products, you always have a compass as to how other people think about the
product, are you pricing it well or not. If you can't shed risk in an effective way that tells
you you're the patsy. So, you better start shutting the doors because you're not doing the
right thing.

Yes, the cession to the AIG quota share. Were there anything unusual in this quarter that
would have elevated it versus what it would look like going forward?

No.

Q - Brian Meredith

All that SOV, very good (01:02:29). Okay, so...

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Brian, he doesn't want to give you the amount. He has it in front of him.

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

About 20%, let me go up here.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yes, it's about 70% of the ceded premium. I was going to give to you of the net, but that's
easier.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Oh, so, about 70% of the ceded premium was AIG. Okay.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

I'm just trying to figure out looks going forward. So, that's kind of – generally think about it
just gradually trending downwards over the next...

A - Mark D. Lyons

No. I would think that, that would, over the next three to five quarters, could be trending
up and then trail down because of the nature of the monthlies and...

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

FINAL

Don't forget, the quota shares covers 2015...

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

2014.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

...2014, 2015 and 2016. So, the United Guaranty book goes all the way to 2007, 2008. We
still have mortgages all the way back from the 2007, 2008. They're still paying premium.
So, it's not as easy to calculate it, but a lot of the old stuff will be coming off more of the
newer stuff. There is not going to be a lot of – depends on the persistency of those years,
the 2014, 2015 and 2016. We think that calculation is going to probably increase it a little
bit and then it will come down later.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Got you. Okay, helpful. And then second question (01:04:04), I'm just curious, when you
talked about the expense savings, could we expect some in some of the other areas,
reinsurance, insurance, also just given your relocation of the services of business
operation?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, the relocation, it's not that – we're not going to just take a lot of people and
relocate. We have attrition, right? Attrition usually is around 10% in our operations
worldwide. So, basically, we lose roughly about 300 positions every year.
We decided that North Carolina is a better place for some of these back rooms that –
premium audit, some clearance system, some booking things, et cetera. So, gradually,
we'll be moving – we lose a job here, instead of replacing it in, I don't know, high cost
environment, we go into a lower cost environment.
And that process has been with us all along. We have operations in Nebraska. We have
operations overseas in other parts of the world. So that's ongoing. The reason I
mentioned it is because North Carolina, based on our statistics, it has about a 30% cost
advantage over other – from New York, New Jersey, California, let's say.
So, over time, and we're not trying to displace people, but as we lose people, we'll be
moving that. So gradually, you're going to see the benefit coming through. But we do that
on our day-to-day operations, as a matter of course, we do that all the time. That's what
our managers are getting paid to do, make sure that we're cost effective.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

FINAL

Got you. And then last question. I wonder if you can give us your perspective right now on
the political landscape with respect to mortgage insurance business and particularly
related to the FHA. And if you get some changes going on there, what do you think the
potential is for market share kind of shift back to the private MI and what do you think
UGC or Arch should get?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, it's very hard to predict, very hard to predict. Clearly, the FHA has more market
share that they need. So, you're not going to hear that only for me, for everyone, MI CEO
will say that. It should be in the private sector not on the taxpayer.
Having said that, I don't know what they're going to do. The share of VA, FHA in
combination is probably a little north of 55%. So, that's way too much, in my view, to be on
the public back.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think what I would add to this is there are a lot of things that we also have available to us
in terms of providing MI insurance, not only to primary, but there's clearly still an ongoing
focus on deleveraging the GSEs and the MI to the third-party to private capital. That is not
stopping. It's actually most likely going to be accelerating over the next year or two.
The one thing that we are thinking about collectively is we're agnostic as to, in general,
how we would allocate the capital in terms of primary MI or CRTs to the extent that it
shifts to that direction. But we're essentially more than willing to provide the risk on a
private basis, either which way the FHA decided to go.
But right now, we don't see any cause to be concerned in terms of the existence of the MI
industry as it is. And we believe that the CRTs that we've been participating on are going
to grow in size. And it's not going to be most likely instead of the MI primary, it's going to
be in addition to the MI market.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. Great. Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman of Balyasny. Your

What's for lunch? Let me...

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

FINAL

No.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Okay.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Okay, well, tell me.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

At the request of Marc Grandisson, it will be grilled halloumi cheese from Cyprus with
tomato, cucumber on pita bread and that's the sandwich for today and he's salivating
already. So, get to your question so he can go and eat.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Well, my first question was when you made this decision to move all these people in
North Carolina, did you make sure there was a good Greek restaurant in the
neighborhood for them?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

I have a few cousins who might be interested in going down to open a Greek diner down
there, but I'll leave it up to them.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Okay. I actually had a couple of questions on the P&C business, but just on MI quickly first
to maybe ask a little bit of a take-up on Josh's question and your response about the
crazy conditions in the U.S. 10 years ago. Australia, it sounds like it's kind of getting to that
point and I know you've obviously bought some reinsurance to help manage your
exposure there. But, how concerned are you about the Australian market right now and
the HPA just seems crazy and you hear all these anecdotes about things going on to get
loans to get houses and so forth.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, let me – you're always concerned of everything you do. But I'm not fearful of the
Australian business for two reasons. First and foremost, there seems to be a little frothy
housing prices in two major cities, right?
Having said that, the frothiness is on loans that they're larger than what we insure. These
are in the 0.75 million and up market. So, when you look at it from an exposure point of
view, the things that we insure, the more on the lower size of homes.

Page 26 of 30

FINAL

And the Australian market is also a full recourse market which is different than the U.S. So,
in essence, the individual is responsible for repaying the loan, beyond the ability of the
residual value of the house to make up for the loan over time. So, there is a different
characteristic to the market.
In addition to that, I think, the APRA which is their regulator, who regulates both insurance
and also the banks, they have some strict rules about what loans get approved. And the
stress test they put them to be able to qualify for the loan. It's a 200 basis point stress
test on every loan, on interest rates movement because a lot of the loans in Australia,
they're adjustable. So they don't have these 15 and 30-year fixed rate mortgages. So
Marc, you want to elaborate further on it, or...

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I would agree with that. I think the portfolio as a result as well, Ian, of the current, we're
also looking at the same presses, do we have an economist who spend a lot of time
reviewing and he confirms exactly what Dinos said, which is, there is a couple of areas,
spot of frothiness, but it's confined to the larger dwellings or larger condominiums and
also a lot of investors coming from outside which is...

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

They pay cash, they don't buy insurance.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Exactly. And even if they were to – what we tend to focus on are the lower risk and we
don't do the investors loan as much. So we curtailed and shifted the portfolio towards the
more single dwelling, owner-occupied house down under.
And to your point, we still, despite all this went on and bought a quota share and we got
partners there to help us in case we would be a bit too optimistic. We don't think we are,
but just to be prudent in terms of rightsizing the whole portfolio. So, we're cautiously
optimistic or comfortable.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

All right. Got it. That makes a lot of sense. On the P&C business, Marc, the insurance
segment, the reserve releases were pretty de minimis this quarter. Was that less sort of
gross releases, or is it just sort of the normal amount of releases and there were some
adverse in pockets offsetting it?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I think the latter. I think we are seeing, as I said in my comments and as Dinos and Mark
both alluded to, the market, we're seeing pick up in severity in the markets across lines of
business. Certainly, it started in the commercial auto. And you've heard that story more
than once.

Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

And the auto component in umbrellas as well.

FINAL

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Exactly. So, there's a lot more coming. We're of the mind that it's going to get a bit more,
a bit worse before it gets better again. So, we tend to take, as usual, a prudent approach
to reserving. So, we might take a bit more long to recognize what looks like good news,
because frankly, a lot of people around our clients, we've seen it. Some of them have, we
believe, recognized too early good news and are in a position to having to redirect or
recorrect that and we would like to avoid that at all cost.
So, there's a little bit of – some activity in severity, some activity and some losses coming
through but certainly holistically, corporately, more prudent view on the ultimate reserve
development.

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

And Ian that's a direct benefit from the multiplatform we have that the holding company
guys see. So you can see other ceding companies and fear on the insurance by the way.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Understood. And then sort of similar to that is the higher accident years in both the
insurance and the reinsurance. Other than, I guess, probably the elevated (01:14:43)
losses, is this sort of a reasonable run rate given where rate and mix is, unless the mix
changes pretty dramatically?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

It's the best guess for the current accident year. Listen, the first year (1:14:56) is a selfgrading exam and we try to do the best we can. But I can tell you, things are not as good
as they were a year ago. And I think the reason you got to recognize them on the current
accident year.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Ian, again, that what I just talked about the reserve development, what transpired over
the last quarter informs us going forward as to what we think the ultimate underlying
fundamentals of the business is. And as you heard, we're losing margin and it's being
eroded as we speak. So, it behooves us to do the right thing, which is to be, again, that
much more prudent on the current accident year. That's what you're seeing right now.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Page 28 of 30



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td

Got it. And then just finally on that. Dinos, I think you mentioned earlier, some may be
rhyming with parts of the late 1990s. And the one thing I guess, I noticed looking at
reserves across the industry, I'm assuming you guys have looked at these sort of trends.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

FINAL

Oh, yeah.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

It looks like there's – the initial IBNR has been coming down every year for the past three,
four, five years and it's now getting to a pretty low point. Do you agree with that trend?
Does that concern you that even the loss trend has been benign the last five years, it
seems to be now reflected in IBNR? I'm asking from an industry standpoint (01:16:11)

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Give me another month or two, we're going to finish our study. I do these macro study
with Don Watson about the industry reserve levels and all that, I look at cash flows,
underwriting cash flows, et cetera. Give me a little time and then we'll share that study
with you.
Maybe that might be my five minute in Investor Day because the guys want me to only
have five minutes with you guys. They want to put me with the chef, so I'll be grilling
halloumi. But at the end of the day, I think it's an interesting question. Yes, it feels to me,
from other indications – let me give you an example. I won't mention names because it's
embarrassing. But we lost an account, right? That it was a high deductible account that, in
essence, it was about $10 million in premium and we lost it to a competitor for $3 million,
to me, is the definition of insanity. Either you're totally naive, you don't know what you're
doing or you can beat me by going to $9 million. You don't have to go from $10 million to
$3 million to get the account. So, that means they're uninformed, don't understand what
they're doing and the brokers are taking advantage of them because I can tell you, they
knew that the expiring premium was probably $10 million.

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

And the other thing, Ian, on that, that will be in their renewal pricing monitor. Next year,
when they raise to $4 million, a 33% increase.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Of course. Exactly. It's funny how that works. All right. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.
