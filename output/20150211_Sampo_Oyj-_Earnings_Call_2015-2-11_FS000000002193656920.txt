MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this Conference Call on Sampo Group's 2014 Results.
I'm Jarmo Salonen, Head of Investor Relations at Sampo. And with me, at this call, I have
our group CEO and President, Kari Stadigh; our Head of P&C Insurance, Torbjörn
Magnusson; and Group CFO, Peter Johansson.
You can also follow this call on our website, sampo.com/results, and a recorded version of
the call will later be available at the same address. We will have the same proceedings, as
always. So I will hand now over to Kari for his comments on the Q4 and 2014.
Kari, please.

Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Thank you, Jarmo. Welcome to the conference call on my behalf as well. As you have all
seen already our numbers, I'll be brief and just start oﬀ with some best-ever comments as
always. Our share price reached a new all-time for this year, at €43.84, up 11.6% year-todate last Monday. Topdanmark performed well and reached earlier in this week DKK225,
up 12.5% year-to-date. So a good start for the year.

FINAL

Looking back at 2014, the best-ever comments are several. For the group, best-ever
operating proﬁt of €1.76 billion for the full year, up 6% from the previous year. In If P&C,
highest ever operating proﬁt for full year and lowest ever full year combined ratio at 87.7%
as well as for Q4, 87.1%. And the story continues with lowest ever expense and cost ratio.
On the more challenging side, we also could see, in If, a very low running yield at the end
of the year. With the situation concerning Norwegian interest rates still unclear, I think,
there is a clear possibility and a bias for further lowering of this running yield.
We have been very transparent in our communication for the last two years on this point.
So it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that the low running yield and the eﬀect of the
short duration can be seen in our investment income. Our ﬁxed income weight or
allocation is at the moment roughly 88%. So the short duration is a very big issue as such.
Nordea delivers on plan, and we as the main owners see the results of the long-term work
we have been participating in. Dividends up 44% and it translates to €533 million for
Sampo this spring. I'm still seeing room for further improvements in Nordea, exactly as
the company has guided the market.

Bloomberg Transcript

Many of you have heard me over the years say 120 plus 20 for Mandatum. 100 in this
context has been the margin we could, in theory, earn on the with-proﬁt assets, and 20
plus 20 has been the €1 million return from expense and risk result. Last year was the ﬁrst
year when this 20 and 20 was reached in the Finnish operations.
The expense ratio delivered €20.9 million and the risk ratio €21.9 million in Finland, a very
good result from the long-term work the management has been concentrating on. Also,
our focus area, unit-linked, delivered highest ever gross written premiums at €960 million.
The total premiums exceeded €1.1 billion, up 4% from the previous year.
Another important issue worth noting was the completion of the €1.3 billion portfolio
transfer from Suomi Mutual by the year-end. The fact that we include this portfolio in the
denominator when calculating the solvency lowers the solvency ratio clearly down to
22.9%. However, as this portfolio is a segregated portfolio, consuming almost no capital in
reality, the drop in the solvency does not inﬂuence the dividend capacity of Mandatum
Life. And you can therefore expect Mandatum Life to distribute its traditional €100 million
in dividends in the ﬁrst quarter of 2015.
Mandatum Life didn't suﬀer as much from the low interest rates as If, however, they had
risk concentration on Russian equities, either a small position of direct investments or then
the Finnish equities with an exposure to Russia. And therefore, the investment income on
equities in Mandatum was weak, aﬀecting the whole investment return.
All in all, 2014 was a good year for Sampo, which lays a solid foundation for 2015. And last
but not least, I think you all appreciate today's board decision to propose to the AGM a
record high dividend of €1.95. This is the sixth consecutive spring when we increase the
dividend. That's all for me today.

Thank you, Kari. Ladies and gentlemen, we are now open for your questions.

FINAL

Q&A
Operator
And we have our ﬁrst question from Mr. In-Yong Hwang from Goldman Sachs. Please go
ahead, sir.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Hello. Good afternoon. Two questions from me, both on P&C. So, the Norway combined
ratio this quarter was very strong. I think it was 74%. So, could you give us a bit more detail
on this and in particular whether there were any reserve releases in this?
And the second question is just on the outlook. You've maintained a 95% combined ratio
by a margin outlook for a number of years. And I was wondering if – how you kind of
perceive that margin to be compared to last year and whether – how you view the outlook
on the P&C business, generally, going forward. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
Norwegian combined ratio at the end of the year, we had a decision in the Norwegian
court about what's called the capitalization rate, which is really a discount rate for the
annuities that you buy in Norway. We had reserved more strongly than the outcome of
this decision, and we had some reserve releases from that and also some other sources.
The combined ratio is indeed very good in Norway, but not that good. The 95%
combined ratio, this is a tradition we have. That should be always and every time, every
year, we should have a combined ratio below 95%. It's been a longstanding tradition. And
I see no dramatic changes in the marketplace compared to a year ago.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Okay.

Operator
And we take our next question from Mr. Thomas Seidl from Bernstein. Please go ahead,
sir.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions, ﬁrst on If, price changes, you outlined
the pressure on the running yield, which of course is not a surprise. The question is now,
is the Nordic market still disciplined enough and allows you corresponding price

Page 3 of 11

increases to set oﬀ these lower investment income, or should we expect overall slightly
lower margins for If in this environment?

FINAL

And the second question, with a look at your economic capital ratio, if I'm not wrong, it's
down from 175% to 165%. I wonder, do you have any target on this economic capital ratio?
And how do you think about this capital buﬀer going forward?

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
On price changes in If, of course, I can never reveal exactly how we think, but let me just
remind you that, in the past ﬁve, seven years, the Nordic markets have proved to be more
rational than any insurance market in history I think.

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 20728335 <GO>}

On the economic capital numbers that's actually, if you look at both Mandatum, If, and
also Sampo Group, it's simply higher dividends that is driving down slightly the buﬀers on
economic capital. Speciﬁcally, we've used internal target, which is not really a very oﬃcial
target in a sense that we tend to maintain on a group level, above 120, excluding
diversiﬁcation. So, we are clearly above that. But to be more speciﬁc on the targets, we're
still waiting for the actual regulatory requirements to be in place.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thanks. Very clear.

Operator
We have the next question from Mr. Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank Markets. Please go
ahead, sir.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes, good afternoon. Three questions, if I may. Firstly, Kari was saying that the running
yield is a big question mark. But at least to my view, that was actually surprisingly high. Is
this just a function of the redemption proﬁle that you guys are seeing?
And then if, Torbjörn, you could go a bit more into detail about these prior-year gains and
losses, a minimal net amount, but fairly big gross amount so if you could get those
ﬁgures, that'd be great.
And then the third question is regarding the dividend. Even though it was high, the
payout ratio from the cash ﬂow point of view was actually the lowest since 2010. So, if you
would maintain the same payout, the dividend also would've been higher. Was this just a
function of a nice increase rather than a payout ratio, or how come you didn't pay 100%
like last year?

A - Torbjörn Magnusson

FINAL

Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2015-02-11

Shall I start with the prior year gains then since that's the easiest maybe? The cost for
reducing the discount rate in Finland, the biggest single item in Q4, was €86 million,
round about half of which was met with in reviewing very old reserves where a surplus
was found, also in Finland. Then during the year but not Q4, the discount rate in Sweden
has been – come down from 1. – I think – 18 to 0.58. That's a real interest rate, so a diﬀerent
type of calculation. That's round about €40 million in the reserve increase. And then as I
said, we got some releases in Norway to meet much of that in the decision about the
capitalization rate in Q4.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Matti, I don't really see that the running yield as such held up. I think that you have to take
into account that as if distributed dividends to the parent and that was yielding zero. That
supported the running yield in the fourth quarter. But, year-on-year, the running yield
came down by 0.5%.
And I still think that there is pressure on the running yield, especially if the Norwegian
interest rates are lowered. So, I think that it's unavoidable that this wouldn't aﬀect our
investment income this year, the issue with the running yield. So, our investment income is
under pressure.

Bloomberg Transcript

On dividend, I don't think we have ever communicated any payout ratio the way you
describe it, payout ratio from internal dividends to shareholders. I think that we have, on
the other hand, communicated that we love the fact that we can year after year increase
the dividends. And this we did this year as well.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great, thanks.

Operator
We have next question from Mr. Christian Hede from Nordea. Please go ahead sir.

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

Yes, good afternoon. This is Christian from Copenhagen. I would like to ask you a more
top down question, maybe a bit philosophical. Since I'm based in Copenhagen, I'm
noticing that we now have basically a perverse negative interest rates. We're talking about
people actually getting money for taking out mortgages. How do you see this aﬀecting
the whole banking sector and I guess also P&C if we continue to have these low interest
rates? Well, yeah, that's my question. Thank you.

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
P&C will, of course, have a technical eﬀect on discounting of reserves. But, so far, this
eﬀect is quite limited. And in terms of customer behavior, it has no big inﬂuence. Then its
philosophy – and then I turn to Kari I think.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. I think, concerning philosophy, we have to rely on the communication from your
employer, Nordea. And so far, there hasn't been any – that type of communication that the
eﬀect on the results of Nordea would be especially big. I think that the low interest rates
will have a bigger eﬀect on insurance company investment income, because there are
several insurers in Europe who have a very low equity weight.
And of course, those mark-to-market results going forward are going to be aﬀected by
this. I think it's – everybody must understand that this experiment is unsustainable long
term and we are now in unknown territory. So, your guess is as good as mine. Our
approach is that we have a very low duration. So, we are not then in a diﬃcult spot if and
when interest rates start to grow and/or increase. And we have taken the hit from this view
in 2014 when actually one of the best investments was to be long in govies. But, so far, I
don't think, on a group level, the banks will have anything dramatic to report on this.

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Could you also give me an update on the Finnish situation in general, so
the growth prospects for the P&C business and also the general kind of macroeconomic
trends over there? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Well, I think that, if we talk general macro, the quantitative easing in Europe was late. If
they had done this in a timely manner as they did in U.S., we would probably not have
seen these low negative interest rates because the quantitative easing would have had an
eﬀect on the economy earlier.
I think that the quantitative easing which is done now is the right choice, even if it's too
late. And it will have an eﬀect. It will also have negative eﬀect so that we are going to see
bubbles building up in certain asset classes. And of course, the ﬁrst one where we see the
bubble now is govies. It's not sustainable that this could continue the way it is now. It's
artiﬁcial.

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
When it comes to growth in P&C, I have to be a bit careful with what I say because
remember a number of years ago, 2008, I said that the economic climate would aﬀect
growth very negatively. And then we had a volume drop of 0.3%. And of course, that is
much, much more stable than the rest of the world. P&C Insurance products are either
mandatory or something that people buy in the Nordic region whether or not the
economic climate is beneﬁcial or not. So, yes, there – it will be more diﬃcult to grow, but
the eﬀects will not be dramatic or huge.

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

We have the next question from Mr. Blair Stewart from Bank of America. Please go ahead,
sir.

FINAL

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Two questions left from me. The ﬁrst is just, if
possible, an outlook for the internal dividends you expect this year. We know what we can
expect from Nordea. But, is there any reason to think any diﬀerently about what you might
receive from Mandatum and If? And particularly, on that point, should we be concerned
that the economic capital position at Mandatum is now below 100? Does that aﬀect its
ability to pay dividends?
Secondly, just going back to the ECB point, Kari, you've touched on this, but I just wonder
what your view is of this risk of contagion of yield compression across lots of asset classes
and particularly with regards to the risk that you need to keep tuning down your discount
rates across the businesses. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 20728335 <GO>}

On the internal dividends, actually, Blair, if you look at – we expect, like the market is
expecting, growing dividends from Nordea. And you can expect roughly the same
amount of dividends, of course, from If and Mandatum, assuming normal market
conditions. And even if our economic capital number or the economic capital
requirement for Mandatum is higher than the actual available solvency, how we reported
it, that's still an internal issue. So, looking at Solvency II, we have signiﬁcant buﬀers with
transition rules in Mandatum. So, there will be no restrictions on paying out dividends
from Mandatum.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

And I think we have clearly communicated that the level from Mandatum – I think I said it
actually in my opening remark that it's going to be €100 million in the ﬁrst quarter.
On speculating about the interest rates, I think that there are two issues. One is that the
euro model as such is not working too well. So, we have a 12% unemployment in the euro
countries. We have 23% youth unemployment in the euro countries. We have close to €5
trillion of sovereign debt, of which more than a quarter is trading with negative interest
rates at this moment. And of course, the quantitative easing is only fueling this.
But, on top of the quantitative easing, I think we have also an artiﬁcial regulatory demand
because the regulator puts, as we all know, zero equity weight on sovereign debt. And
that means that there is no real risk adjustment to the capital requirements of sovereign
debt. And, of course, these two facts together, they make the market really a very, very
artiﬁcial and subsidized market.
So, our conclusion at least will be that we shouldn't hold any sovereign debt with a
negative interest rate because, why would we do that? The only reason we would do that
is to – is if we assume that the negative interest rate will be even more negative in the

Page 7 of 11

Date: 2015-02-11

future. And I think that's pure speculation, which is not our job. So, therefore, we are
going to dispose of all govies when they are in the negative territory in a timely manner.

FINAL

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Kari, can I just ask you as a follow-up to that? What are you doing on asset allocation at
the moment for new money? And it's a general question as well as a speciﬁc one, does
the current environment push insurance companies and institutional investors up the risk
curve? Do insurers start buying more equities? And do you buy more real estate, or do
you move into structured credit, that type of thing? Is that the temptation at the moment
across the sector and at Sampo?

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Well, I think that the ﬁrst thing to do is to go – to be in ﬂoating rate notes because, as we
are sailing in unknown territory, it's good to have ﬂoating rates, then we will see how this
plays out. I also think that institutions in Europe are going to participate in bank issues and
substitute part of the sovereign debt with that.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then, slowly but gradually, they are now, of course, we have seen what is happening
in investment grade. And then, of course, when the appetite grows and the issues are
scarce, then we will probably see a similar development in high yields. If we take out from
the high yields the energy component, which is signiﬁcant, I think rest of the high-yielders
will see a compression of margins as well.
And ﬁnally, at the end of the tunnel, everybody will see equities. So there is more to be –
more positive development to be seen in equities. And then when the tunnel comes to an
end, of course, the question is who is the sucker at the end who is still with these assets
when the interest curve turns? And I wouldn't like to be that one. So, it's a balanced eﬀort
now.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah. Fascinating. Thank you.

Operator
And we take the next question from Mr. Daniel Do-Thoi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead
sir.

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon. Just three very quick questions, the ﬁrst one on the premium growth
that you show on P&C on slide 32, and just wondering whether the year-on-year growth
that you've shown, is that a good indicator of the current competitive situation and
whether you also currently see the most and least attractive marginal proﬁtability.
And then secondly, again on that slide, could you just give us the Swedish premium
growth, excluding industrial lines?
Page 8 of 11



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2015-02-11

And last question, just following up on the whole interest rate discussion, just wondering
under what circumstances you would consider fully duration matching and consequently
releasing some of that capital? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
Turning to page 32 then on premium growth, it's not a bad indicator, no, I agree, or yeah,
I agree with that, the way that you've phrased the question. And on the Swedish premium
growth, would be slightly higher actually without industrial lines, where we lost a little bit
of business there. So, Sweden has beneﬁted from the high car sales and some premium
actions as well as some good aﬃnity agreements that have turned out well this year.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

In hindsight – sorry, did you have another...?

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

I was just going to follow up on that on Sweden. You mentioned car sales and aﬃnity.
How much of that is from the agreement with Nordea, or is that still to come?

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
It's a not-insigniﬁcant part. I can't give you exactly what that number would be. But, it's –
as I said, there are three components, and Nordea is one of the aﬃnity agreements.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

With the development we have seen in interest rates, I think the – in hindsight, the full
matching of duration should have been done ﬁve years ago or something. I don't think,
with the earlier discussion we have had about what kind of abnormalities are building up
in the market, I don't think this or the near future is the time for a full-duration match. If
ever for – in our company, that comes in a more natural and stable market environment,
when also there is such a yield environment that it leaves something for the owners. At
this moment, it doesn't.

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay. Very clear. Thank you very much.

We have the next question from Paris Hadjiantonis from KBW, please go ahead sir.

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. This is Paris Hadjiantonis from KBW. I just have a couple of questions
this afternoon. The ﬁrst one on If, would you consider raising some debt capital at the
subsidiary? And if so, is such a decision related to what happens with the Norwegian
Perils Pool outcome under the Solvency II scenario?

Page 9 of 11



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2015-02-11

FINAL

And the second question is a more hypothetical one on Mandatum. Basically, we know
that your economic capital does not look great at the moment, but you do have the
transitional buﬀers. Under the scenario where the economic capital takes another hit from
declining yields in the coming quarters, would you consider changing the asset mix at all,
which attracts very high capital charges? Thank you very much.

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 20728335 <GO>}

Well, if we start with the economic capital from Mandatum, I think that the hit from the
market would have to be quite massive because actually taking into account the transition
rules we have roughly buﬀers, even if we now report in our own model that we have a
small deﬁcit on the capital requirement that takes into account full Solvency II and full
discounting. But, if I take the transition rules, we actually have buﬀers around €600
million, starting from the beginning of next year.
So, in that sense, we don't have any pressure to change the allocation on top of the €600
million that we have buﬀers. So, moving into Solvency II day one, we could increase
hybrids. So, actually, the true buﬀers are even bigger. The same goes with If that, let's see
what the – when Solvency II steps in, so we could use more hybrids on the If level also.
And – but, we have no ﬁnal decisions on that side.

A - Torbjörn Magnusson

Bloomberg Transcript

And furthermore, of course, the Solvency margin If is the strongest ever. So, even if in an
adverse outcome of the Norwegian Natural Perils discussion, that wouldn't force us
necessarily to do – to take up sub-debt with us.
