That's all from my side so far. And with that, I hand over to Dieter.

Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Okay. So. Good morning, all the callers from the States. Good afternoon for the European
callers. Let me start with the ﬁnancial highlights. So on page three of the presentation.
Q4 numbers, revenues up 12%. So we kept our double-digit internal growth rate. Group
operating proﬁt shown of EUR2.3 billion. We had a number of additional smaller one-oﬀs
we faced as headwinds in the Fourth Quarter. We booked an operating loss for Brazil of
EUR150 million, Russia $40 million. We had a new regulatory ﬁne in France for very old
cases from the time where we still did not own the Company. And we booked additional
premium deﬁciency reserves in Korea. But also we had a positive one-oﬀ in the corporate
segment. So all in all, it's about EUR200 million that I would consider as one-oﬀs in the
Q4.

Bloomberg Transcript

That leads -- that, then, leads to a 96.5 combined ratio in the Fourth Quarter, where our
Life and Health business continues to grow rather strongly, new business margin doing
well. And I will go into more detail of the asset management business, as usually, later in
the presentation.
When we go to page ﬁve and look at total results, EUR10.4 billion, just short of the
maximum outlook point of EUR10.5 billion. P&C slightly up, Life and Health had, again, a
great year. And Asset Management following the outlook. And the non-repetition of the
one-oﬀ performance fees down. And Corporate segment slightly up.
When we got to the overall shareholders' equity development on page 7, shareholders'
equity a record high, short of EUR61 billion, driven by retained earnings, increase in
unrealized gains, also for the beneﬁt of the shareholder. Max will tell you how the gross
unrealized gains developed in total. And our year-end number includes EUR1.6 billion, net
of taxes, additional pension liabilities for our own pensions, which -- where we reduced
the discount rate from 3.5% to 2%.
Conglomerate solvency, which is still only mattering the revenues, has stayed fairly ﬂat
over the year. The Solvency II capitalization stayed, also, almost ﬂat over the year. Actually,
when you include that we have now in the year-end '14 number a higher dividend
included than in the year before, which makes 2percentage points and slightly lower
leverage, actually, the number looks almost ﬂat over the year, although it was a year with
many volatilities built in.
Let me start, ﬁrst, with the external market movement. The 10-year point of the US swap
curve end of 2013 was 200 basis points. That swapped to 80 basis points a year later. So,
a drop of 60% in one year. Parallel, the volatility in the ﬁxed income doubled. So, actually
Page 2 of 39

Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2015-02-26

it was a year which really did stress the whole system calculation. And also, the riskbearing capability.

FINAL

But we managed this parallel with actually increasing our risk taking substantially. When
you will look at Max's ﬁgures, you will see that our investment portfolio is more than
EUR700 million up. So, a total exchange that is cognizant of our great growth eﬀorts in the
life business. So we are taking quite a lot of additional risk on board.
But there are also many model changes, as we are not disclosing to you a stable internal
economic model. We are, as we said in the previous quarter, moving gradually forward to
the Solvency II model, which we are going to ﬁle in the Second Quarter this year.
So we have already used the appropriate discount rate in the calculation, which makes at
year end the 80 basis points I mentioned, minus 10 basis points credit shift, plus 13 basis
points volatility adjuster. So some 83 basis points for the 10-year euro point.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we have seen not only the parallel shift I have mentioned, actually the yield curve over
the year ﬂattened. And in particular in Q4. And the doubling of the VOLA is also very
much a Q4 event. So when you just look at the number between end of September to
end of December, you can say ﬂattening yield curve about 7 points, parallel shift 8 points,
doubling VOLA 9 points.
And we changed in the Fourth Quarter and moved to US equivalents. I told you in the
past that we were agnostic to this, because the number was pretty much the same,
whether we used equivalents or internal models. However, at a 2% interest rate for the 10year Treasury in the US, there is a beneﬁt for you, as shareholders. And, hence, for us to
do it. And also it makes our numbers, I think, more comparable to the peers who have US
subsidiaries, because we were the only one staying away from it. In fact, we are also the
only one who has. So far, a charge for government bonds into the calculation, I think we
should, maybe, start limiting the diﬀerences, also, to our peers a little bit.
So let's move to the more exciting ﬁgures, that is actually the growth in the P&C sector.
Fourth quarter added a 10% growth, which is, I think, for many quarters the ﬁrst time that
we would have double-digit growth in P&C. And the growth is actually carried by quite a
number of entities, starting with the UK, which continues with great numbers. But also
AGCS had a very strong year-end performance.
In total, we grew in the year 3% ﬂat, that's a ﬂat number over the 12 months. That is our
mid-term strategic target to achieve this. But so far, we missed it always a little bit.
Actually, that number includes, even, that we are shrinking in Russia substantially, as we
explained that we have a negative premium development in Brazil. And also in the US.
When I take the three out, 4.5% is the growth rate for all our Anglo markets and other core
markets, which is a fantastic number.
It's all -- overall, with all the pluses and minuses, very much volume-driven. So therefore,
we could also add 2 million customers over the year. The price eﬀects across all markets
leveling out.

FINAL

When you move now to the operating proﬁt of the entity, over the whole year 94.3%
absolutely ﬂat underwriting margin. So we still see that underwriting added EUR80 million
to the proﬁt line additionally. That is equivalent to a net earned premium of 4.1%. And that
is the driver of our additional underwriting proﬁt.
While you could say, at a ﬁrst glance, you had a 2percentage point better capacity ratio.
So, where is the money? I think the cat ratio and better related events was maybe
1percentage point better. We had a lot of mid-size events over the year. But also in the
Fourth Quarter.
Still, our accident-year loss ratio worsened. And, actually, when you do just the attritional
accident-year loss ratio comparison, it is 1.2% oﬀ. We had over the year. But in particular in
Q4, some more large losses. So that makes the 0.3% and 0.9% for the other weatherrelated events I mentioned already.
So the one-oﬀ ratio is slightly lower than last year. The positive developments of the
majority of the countries unchanged to last year. But in 2014 we had to strengthen
reserves in Brazil, Russia. And the US. US was already at the half-year number. So,
therefore, when I look just at the countries with positive runoﬀ it is, more or less, at the
same level as the year before.

Bloomberg Transcript

Expense ratio pretty much ﬂat. We had additional one-oﬀ costs from the Unipol
transaction. And we had also additional expense loads from the write-down of premiums
in Brazil in Q4.
So moving to our operational proﬁts slide for the P&C business. And also the individual
combined ratios of the major OEs, well, obviously, Germany doubling operating proﬁt,
other markets holding up very well. And AGCS is not a big plus. And the negative
numbers I have already mentioned and I will explain in more detail on the next page,
where we show the portfolio overview.
I think, still, the majority of our units, two-thirds of the gross written premium below 95%.
And 27% in the category just above 95% with stronger growth. And 9% of the portfolio are
the ones above 100 where Fireman's Fund had 120%, Russia 140%, Brazil 125% for the
whole year.
I think you know the action items. Fireman's Fund has been -- the personal lines business
has been sold to ACE, where the transaction is expected to close April 1. The commercial
business if around $1.5 billion of premium going to be integrated with AGCS US. Actually,
the integration process started with the beginning of the year.
Russia we are downscaling the retail operation substantially. And I just will add one thing,
that means that the retail earned premium for 2015 will be substantially smaller than last
year. And the focus is on proﬁtable business. And, yes, also continuing the health
business in retail.

FINAL

Brazil is actually a combination of IT platform issues, which are creating -- did create some
thought around our underlying business issues emanating from business written in the
second half of 2013, where we did, after we understood the situation much clearer, a lot of
cleaning up in the Fourth Quarter, cleaning up in the sense that we have now booked our
best understanding of the situation. And also the turnaround steps are being initiated.
Page 17, on CMV's [ph] similar income, I know that Max will comment on it. I think the
highlight I would like to mention is that it stayed stable over the year, actually EUR17
million more than the year before, as a tremendous stable investment income.
Now let's move to the Life and Health sector. The growth story of the previous three
quarters continued at the full Fourth Quarter. So the driver of the growth is the German
life business, the US. And Italy. Germany, our market share in new business is, obviously,
around of the third of the market. In the US, the great sales success of the ﬁxed index
annuity business continues.
So actually, when you look at the US, ﬁxed business annuities are up by EUR5.1 billion,
where actually our VA [ph] premium is down by EUR650 million. So it's really all the ﬁxed
index annuity.

Bloomberg Transcript

And in Italy, the growth number is two-thirds unit-linked and one-third non-unit-linked.
In Asia-Paciﬁc, the growth is clearly supported by our HSBC distribution arrangement.
And in country terms, it's mainly Taiwan. But also our local sales activities in Korea have a
strong positive.
When we move, then, to the proﬁtability of the Life business, EUR3.3 billion operating
proﬁt at the upper end of our expected range for the year.
Please remember that we moved about EUR110 million operating proﬁt from the smaller
Asset Management units into the Life and Health segment with our pension companies in
Poland, Spain, et cetera. So that is a change in the allocation.
And what drives the additional proﬁt? Well that is actually clearly the higher investment
margin. And here we have, besides good underlying investment results, also one-oﬀs that
it's a recovery of emerging market currency against the euro that was a fairly sizable
negative in 2013. And now it is positive in '14. So the swing is double. And also, we have
gains on the interest rate protecting us against falling interest rates in Q4. So, that is also a
positive number. In total, I would say maybe in the Life there is some EUR100 million to
EUR150 million of these individual one-oﬀs.
The increase in expenses, all driven by additional expenses for acquisition of the new
business is obvious with the high volume increase that is oﬀset in the stronger
capitalization of debt.

FINAL

You wonder why our technical margin is down, when we say we want to have more asset
risk? Well that is the change in Germany where we are now only giving -- or allowed to
take 25% for the shareholder on technical result and 75% goes to the policy holder. That
reduction of EUR99 million has, in the German business, very much been oﬀset on the
investment margin side. That means when you add both numbers together that it is still a
total decline calculation what we paid our policy holder in proﬁt, the number is pretty
much zero.
So moving to the new business value, new business value up 45%, mainly driven by
volume growth but also new business margins, actually at 2.4%. The obvious question is,
well, in this interest rate environment, would you do the business again in 2015?
We have tried to calculate with current yields and then it would -- the new business
margin would be at 1.7% to 1.8%, if you take exactly the same mix. But you can be assured
that we work on our mix in 2015. So don't take it as a forecast for 2015.

Bloomberg Transcript

So how did the yields work. And, actually, what are the guarantees? I think that Max has in
his presentation the same slide. So, I would refrain from here on making further
comments. And let me directly move to the Asset Management business. So I'm now on
page 27 of the presentation.
At ﬁrst glance, third-party AUMs stayed very stable, just EUR12 billion from EUR1,329
billion to $1,313 billion. But behind the stable numbers are big movements. The outﬂows
at PIMCO of EUR236 billion, inﬂows at Allianz Global Investors of EUR10 billion. And this is
being -- the outﬂows, then, are being compensated by 11% foreign currency impact and a
market impact in the falling yield environment. And the rising equity markets of 4.2%.
The FX impact is actually in the numbers very much only visible on the balance sheet
numbers. I should have mentioned right in the beginning of my presentation. The
EUR10.4 billion of operating proﬁt include roughly EUR40 million net impact of all the FX
changes during the year '14 compared to '13 in operating proﬁt, whereas balance sheet
items are being calculated at the year-end spot rates, you see a much bigger impact of
the euro to dollar conversion.
And therefore, when we -- that is the basis for our earnings in 2015. So very important to
understand for the outlook. However, when we look at the dynamic of the 2013 results,
ﬁrst at the revenue of the Asset Management business on page 29, a PIMCO decline by
12.5%, Allianz Global Investors 8% up with great results that did not stop that we have
overall an 8.6% decline in revenues.
And actually the margin at Allianz Global Investors dropped for two reasons. We included
some advisory-based business, which added some AUM. But no fees. And then also the
mix in more institutional business also weakened the margin slightly.
At PIMCO, the margin drop of 1 basis point is very much explained by the outﬂows during
the year were more on the retail space than on the institutional space. And it all happened
in the US. Actually, euro and Asia are fairly stable with PIMCO customers.

FINAL

Let me now translate both information to the operating proﬁt development at Asset
Management. So it dropped 15% to EUR2.6 billion. The two drivers the outﬂows with the
margin compression I just explained. But also the one-oﬀ performance fees of the year
2013.
Actually, when we take out the one-oﬀ performance fees from 2013, the recurring
performance fees, also at PIMCO, were actually higher in absolute numbers than in 2013,
which I think is great news, because the quality of its asset manager and its perception
with the customers is driven by its investment performance. And investment performance
continues to stay high. And I think we're really free of any damages with the management
transition which created so much media attention. Therefore, the basis for 2015 is fully in
place.

Bloomberg Transcript

When we discuss the outlook, we will also talk about one-oﬀ performance fees at PIMCO
we expect at (inaudible) and 2015. But let me ﬁrst complete the P&L of the Asset
Management sector.
We have certainly a reduction in expenses based on the proﬁt sharing at PIMCO, the
70/30 formula. However, our expenses did not drop parallel with the reduced revenues
for several reasons. I think most of the operating expenses which have been transactional
are variable. But staﬀ, of course, numbers are not moving as fast as we have the seen
move in the First Quarter, plus, as we explained already in the Q3 results, we are actually - have implemented a special retention program, which was -- had the ﬁrst booking in the
Fourth Quarter. And we added a substantial marketing budget for the Fourth Quarter and
really raising the presence of PIMCO in many media. That did, then, lead to a cost to
income ratio of 61% for PIMCO in the Fourth Quarter.
So overall, I think in this (inaudible) transition year for our (inaudible) business, the total
result of EUR2.6 billion is holding very well. And is still in line with our expectations.
So when we then go to the Corporate segment, I think the big swing at the banking
segment but that was the restructuring costs in 2013 for Allianz Bank Deutschland, a retail
bank which we closed, almost EUR100 million restructuring costs, precisely EUR88 million.
So that was a negative one-oﬀ. And also we have, through our German regional bank
called OLB, we have a small shipping portfolio where we have in the last three years put
up loss-loan provisions for the shipping portfolio. There were no -- there was no need to
increase reserves in 2014. And we see, also, a better operating result.
And the Holding and Treasury segment has a number of one-oﬀs. There is, on one hand
higher admin costs. And also we had from the IT restructuring we had in 2013 a release of
a restructuring provision. But also we changed our Company pension in Germany, which
created EUR160 million positive impact in 2014.
I can now come to the total summary from operating proﬁt to net income. EUR10.4 billion,
3% up compared to the year before. So non-operating items with minus 1.55 billion look
unusually high. But there is a special tax treatment I will explain in a moment. Actually our

Page 7 of 39



Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2015-02-26

harvesting was lower than last year, almost EUR150 million lower is the ﬁgure on equity
and debt. So that means we are not churning in the P&C segment our future.

FINAL

Impairments are lower as we had almost non sizable impairments. What is shown under -as the income from ﬁnancial assets and liabilities is carried at fair value. That includes
some cash ﬂow hedges in France. But also the overlay hedge, which we do for our US life
business to protect our local statutory capital that could us EUR140 million.
And now, let me explain the tax rate. We are showing here a tax rate of 32%, the tax rate
paid by the shareholder. But as we did in a large court case in Germany that we can tax
deduct realized losses and impairments on investments from the years 2001 and '02, that
order is actually almost EUR1.05 billion as positive tax result.
This tax result we are sharing, to a large extent, with the life policy holders. This is this
EUR901 million. So it is, in the end, a direct booking from taxes back from the tax
authorities directly to the policy holders in the German life book.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are showing the number here as neutral in the pre; and post-tax lines. So, we have the
positive in the income tax. And then the negative in the reclass of tax beneﬁts from this
court case on the tax decision EUR1.05 billion. So, EUR150 million helped our corporate
taxes. Therefore, we are slightly down compared to the 34% of last year. But this is also
because we had less one-oﬀs.
Going forward, I think 32% is a good starting point, also, for the year 2015. But, of course,
we are always trying to work on that. But have also foreseen that some countries are
working against us with their policy to increase the tax burden for their corporations.
Overall, let me summarize. The revenue double-digit up, operating proﬁt 3.3% up,
shareholders' net income 4% up. I did not mention that this is very good news for the
dividend. But I think Michael will talk about it at the end.
And overall, we have a strong capital and balance sheet position where I think we have
brought available capital back towards the previous year.
And with this, I hand over to Max.

Maximilian Zimmerer

{BIO 2557503 <GO>}

Yes, hi. Good afternoon. Coming to B3, that's the investment portfolio.
As you can see, seems there are not many changes and we grow our assets by roughly
EUR80 billion. The main reason for that is, let's say, half of that is business growth and the
other half, a little bit more than that, is purely performance driven.

FINAL

This is the IFRS number. If I would compare that to the pure market view, the real estate
part would be a little bit higher that means it would be at a weighting of 4%. As you know,
real estate is booked under IFRS to book values. And it does not include the own assets.
The market value number, the 4%, would include those.
But this is the main diﬀerence. If you think of the quality of the investment portfolio, it has
really not changed. The duration numbers have changed. You see them on the right side.
The main reason for that is the lower interest rates. They had an impact on the asset side.
But also on the liability side, overall.
You can see there the slight mismatch. We are longer on the asset side on the P&C side.
And a little bit shorter on the Life side. But we are pretty long, also, I think in comparison
to the market. That saves us, if you think of the very low interest rates. But I come to that
later.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, the next page, B4, there I tried to come up with a summary of the investment
performance, starting with the current income. We achieved EUR21 billion of current
income. That is a little bit higher than last year. I am a little proud of, because the
reinvestment rates have been pretty low overall. The current yield right now is at 2.7%,
which came down from 3.9%. Then if you add to that the realized gains and losses,
impairments, trading result. And investment expenses, the overall total investment of our
investments is at EUR21.6 billion, a little bit higher than last year.
Then that's a more interesting ﬁgure if you think of total performance, that's a change in
unrealized gains and losses, it's a very large number. It's EUR46 billion. That brings us,
then, to the total performance of 11.8%.
But let's face it, most of that comes from lower interest rates. That's wonderful for the
performance, not so nice for the reinvestment yields in the end.
What was really interesting in this year is that ﬁxed income, at least if you were invested in
very long-term bonds, outperformed heavily stocks, what was a surprise to me, I can tell
you. Stocks did, also, very well. But not to the same extent as long-term bonds.
Now, what did we do last year on the investment side? The active changes you see on
page B5. We invested additionally in equities, public equity that EUR3.7 billion. The timing
was okay. But it would have been better if we had started only in the last quarter of last
year. If you take the January performance, I'm very happy that we did that.
Then on the private equity, real estate. And also alternative debt side, we, as you know,
have a strategy that we want to have more in that respect. And that brings me, also, to the
page B6. There it is shown the real asset-based ﬁnancing.
This is a chart that usually I very much. As you know, we had a mid-term goal of EUR80
billion for the next three years. We already achieved EUR74 billion. And our next threeyear target would be around EUR110 billion. That is not a ﬁxed target, only to say that it's
Page 9 of 39

FINAL

very -- very much dependent on market conditions. But also on the risk capital we would
need to ﬁnance that.
Overall, I like this sector very well, because it's diﬀerentiating us from competition. And
aﬀords to the possibility to gain some extra margin. This is truly the margin that goes to
the bank. And the second thing is usually you can add some diversiﬁcation if you
compare that to ﬁnancing banks, at least, to avoid cluster risks. And also, I think, the
transparency of the risks are better if you do it directly. But what is needed there, you
need really professional expert teams. I'm happy that we have them, not only at Allianz
Investment Management. But also at Allianz Global Investors. We have really professional
teams. And I think that we are a little bit ahead of the market.
Now coming to the new investment yields on page B7, overall they were much lower than
the year before, in comparison to the very low yields we have right now, they are pretty
strong, I think. On the P&C side, it's 2.4%, near the same as in the year 2013. On the life
side, because we are longer there, it's 2.7%. If you add to that the current yields on the
real assets, that's the 4% overall. You can see also maturity diﬀerences and Life, in
average, you can say four years longer if you think of the reinvestments as such.

Bloomberg Transcript

That brings me to page B8. That's a comparison between the total yield of our portfolio
and the minimum guarantees. The total yield you can relate to your assets. And it will
bring you to a yield of 4.7%. But you can also do -- 3.9%. But if you relate it to the technical
reserves, because we have more assets than technical reserves, the number is at 4.7%.
That means we have still a margin of 2.3% in comparison to the minimum guarantees of
2.4%. I think that's really a strong buﬀer. And what is also stated here that now the
reinvestment yield in Germany is only at 0.7%. If we would cut all the crediting rates at
once. And would say do we need at a reinvestment yield to ﬁnance the guarantees of
Germany, that would bring us to the 0.7%.
You can compare that with the 2.7% we had as a reinvestment yield, that means we have
strong buﬀers, also, in that respect.
Now, if you compare that to the new business, the reinvestment yield, I already said, 2.7%.
The average guarantee for new business is at 1.0%. That means, obviously, there still a
relatively high margin of 1.7%. I think what worked very well that we started the lower
guarantee products, especially in Germany, (inaudible). But also in Italy, using linked and
ﬁxed-index annuities in (inaudible) product. And if would take -- make a forecast for this
year, I think the guarantee for the new business will go further down, (inaudible) around
0.7% and 0.8%.
Now to remind the outlook overall, I think I forgot to describe what has happened on the
markets in 2014. And the most important for us was the announcement for us was the
announcement of the quantitative easing by the ECB that will start in 1st of March this year,
that brought the interest rates dramatically down to all-time lows.

Fortunately, Mrs. Yellen announced two days ago that we will see at least one or two or
three hikes in 2015. I think, at least, that should work as a kind of stop order for the
European rates. But you're seeing overall, I think, that real assets are much more
interesting than bonds, because, I think, we are in bubble mania on the bond side.

FINAL

That's the thing I would like to end with. Thank you.

Michael Diekmann

{BIO 1733646 <GO>}

Great. So. Good afternoon, everybody. I've been moved to Section C. That's probably
what happens when you are phasing out. I accept that.
Then, I was little surprised, frankly, about the harsh reaction of markets this morning.
(inaudible) down now, that seems to level out a little bit. And I'm very happy that we have
the opportunity to talk to you and sort of talk about all the technical questions around
solvency and sensitivity and so on.
Anyhow. So, if I make the assessment of what went well, what went wrong, the revenue
and proﬁt growth, I think, is very good, especially translating into real customer growth of
2 million. So as Dieter has said, it's volume-driven and not price-driven.

Bloomberg Transcript

Capital strength I would still defend as a very strong point of Allianz. Then, when we look
at the -- what I would outperformance in Germany of Allianz Life and Allianz Global
Investors, added about an improvement of EUR1 billion, I think that's very encouraging.
Now, diﬃcult -- the reinvestment environment. But I would also say from a competitive
point of view, it's an opportunity. So regulatory uncertainties remain. But I don't want to
go too deep into that, because otherwise we're going to lose ourselves in technical
details. And obviously, the political tensions that we see all around Europe are bad. Now,
for us, it's good that our direct exposure to Russia, Middle East. And Nigeria is pretty low.
PIMCO outﬂows higher end of our expectations. And then three underperforming units
oﬀer potential for next year. But, obviously, we're not happy about that.
Now, when we turn the next page, which we head by Business Highlights 2014, I would
like to point out a little bit of the operational underlying trends.
And here you can see under P&C non-motor retail very good progress in digital products.
I think that's going to be a competitive advantage, going forward. And the shift on the Life
side to asset-liability matched products in Life. I think we've made very good progress,
especially here in the market in Germany. Let's just see this year, 2014, as a sort of
opening up of this market, which I think, for a market leader is the appropriate action. And
I'm very happy that the market accepts this proposal so we can work on that stronger in
2015.

Now, turning to our portfolio measures on the next page, I'm going to talk about
acquisitions a little later. I think we were very timely in addressing the issues in Russia and
Ukraine. We did not wait. We did not wait as long as with Fireman's Fund. But Fireman's
Fund, I think the solution that we found to get to competitive levels in the corporate
business. And to ﬁnd a good home for our private business with ACE is a very good
achievement. Then, last but not least, the transition in PIMCO, I think is working very well,
despite the noise on the portfolio side.
Now, if I look at the next page, operating proﬁt, I was a little disappointed on the Q4 in
P&C, as well. But as Dieter has explained, I think it's the right actions that we took to make
sure that 2015 we're not getting any surprises here.
Now, the capital management and growth, we discussed for years and years the dividend
policy. Now we have a dividend policy I can (inaudible) information that my colleagues
have not given yet. And that's about the evaluation of unused budget for external growth.
We've spent a lot, EUR900 million of a budget of EUR1.2 billion in 2014. So we will add
around EUR300 million to the budget in 2015 that is, then, up evaluations.

Bloomberg Transcript

The next slide, EUR6.84 I've sensed a little bit of dissatisfaction with that, as people were
expecting something like 7. Now, if we compare the 6.84 to what you can achieve from the
market today at the low volatility of the result of Allianz, I think we should give this a little
bit of a positive sense. And let's not forget there's a ratchet here, which I think should
make the stock very attractive, going forward.
Now, when we look at the next slide and the acquisition side, we also have regular
debates about how disciplined is Allianz on the acquisition side. If we look at the activities
in 2014, I think they are totally in line with the discussions we had. The 725 agencies that
we've added in Italy, exactly in the right region, in a business that is scalable. And, by the
way, the 722 agencies have been fully integrated into the digital agency model now. I
think it's going to be a good contribution to the performance in Italy in the future.
I'm also very happy about the small. But not unimportant addition that we could achieve
in Australia, where we have a great management and this will add to diversiﬁcation,
because we were under-represented in the territory.
Now, on the next page, coming to underlying growth in P&C, Dieter has already said if
you exclude Fireman's Fund, Russia. And Brazil where we are shrinking the business, we
have an underlying growth of 4.5%. Very happy about the smallest number here, 2.6% in
Germany, because that really shows us that we have crossed the line now of negative
growth and adding premium to the existing customer base.
We will have a press conference next week with our German colleagues and they will
actually tell us about net growth in customers on the P&C side. And also much more
activity on the non-motor side, which I think is good, as well.

Dieter has mentioned AGCS or AWP. I think that's working very well. And that's an
important one, because that's the backbone of our digital strategy where we add a lot of
service components from Allianz worldwide partners.
Now the Life side, I've talked about the German shift. And we deﬁnitely have to accelerate
that. The lower traditional guarantees in the Italian and the move to the unit-linked cycles
our partner, UniCredit, works very well. And the ﬁxed-income annuities in the US, as you
can see here, are working very well, as well.
When Dieter and myself were in the US earlier this year, shareholders urged us to increase
that business because it's just the right environment and the right oﬀer in that
environment.
Now, coming to PIMCO on page 14, we not only believe in PIMCO as our subsidiary. But
we also believe in them as investing our assets. You can see on the right-hand side that
Allianz manages about 55% of our assets. And this is at arm's length. And we wouldn't do
that if the performance wouldn't be justifying that.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we have been outperforming third-party assets under management of 88%, which, I
think, helps us also on the competitiveness side, with our Life business.
Now, the market gives us the feedback on our digital strategy that we are well positioned.
And I would conﬁrm that, that we are making a lot of progress, as I've shown on the
second page on digital products, modular products, a lot of them are priced real time.
And the (inaudible) for direct quotes where, just to give you a number, since we've
introduced direct quote in Italy in 2012, we've made over 10 million quotes already. So
that's becoming more and more a standard that, by the way, we've introduced in many
other countries now, as well.
We've started early to address not only multi-channel. But multi-access. And we get a
good integration now of online and agent channels. Our advanced analytics, just to give
you one practical case where we apply that, that's for the detection of fraud cases. That's a
very interesting move, now especially when you look at organized motor fraud. And on
the automation side, obviously, we are making good process in process automation of
standard cases, which in (inaudible) is now up to 90%.
Data protection becomes a more issue. And we've started early with our data center
consolidation project, where we are in the middle of consolidating 140 data centers down
into 7, which, then, will help us much better to deal with the personal data protection.
Now, I'm turning to the page on our operating outlook, where this outlook of EUR10.4
billion, plus/minus EUR400 million, I think, is taking two things into consideration.
It's the good performance, solid performance, in 2014. And also cautious look at 2015,
without any up-selling. So, giving you an impression of our conﬁdence to manage the
volatility result even better than in the past. And now, when we look at the operating proﬁt

FINAL

outlook 2015 on the segment side, that's the next page, I would just like to give a little
add up on where do you think that we have a good indicators, underliers for proﬁt in
2015.
Now, ﬁrst, I would like to mention, again, the growth in 2014 of 10%. It was actually nearly
20% P&C volume-driven, close to 4% was good performance of our new modular retail
products. We do see a higher operating asset base. And together with investment
expertise that Max has talked about, that should help. And, also, we have higher reserve
levels on the P&C side.
Now, the one-oﬀ in P&C 2014 that's around EUR500 million, at least, at Russia, Fireman's
Fund. And Brazil. But also about EUR80 million of integration costs in Unipol business in
Italy. We do see a consistent great performance of PIMCO and Dieter has talked about
the performance fees, the success fees.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then we have a clear expectation for higher performance fees from closed funds in Q4
2015. We have the exchange (inaudible) the dollar that has not translated into additional
earnings on the PIMCO side. Then the long duration of our investments and the growing
asset base.
Then last but not least, we have replaced two board members with two very experienced
new board members. So the technical expertise and the market expertise on the board
has not weakened at all. I think it's even stronger than it was before. And then last but not
least, the transition to the new CEO is working very well. There are no frictions in the
team. And Oliver is just visiting all the places that he doesn't know yet and where he
might not have the time to visit them once he is in charge. But he is, obviously, a part of all
the decisions we are making that have an impact on the future.
On this note I would like to close, just on time. And open the Q&A, if Oliver doesn't want
to do that.

My ﬁrst question is on the solvency. Just to get a feel for how you judge it internally, the
ratio of 191% isn't great compared to what we've been used to. I know the moving parts
you said positive adjustments and then negative from low interest rates. But where do you
see it kind of settling around. And at what level should to feel, ooh, we need to worry a
bit, we can't ﬁnd the liftoﬀ?
The second is very speciﬁc. It's just can you give an update on German ZZR, albeit the
premium refund reserve calculation, et cetera. And also the unrealized gains in
Switzerland. Zurich gave a very good answer, which was to say that past 2018. So in 2019,
funding the ZZR would cost them operating losses. So that's a negative.
Then the last point, which was not really serious question, it's more well done, Mr.
Diekmann. And thank you very much. But also given that there's only EUR200 million to
be missing to be at consensus was, weren't you a bit tempted, just a little bit, to
(inaudible)?
Anyway, thank you very much.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Michael Diekmann

{BIO 1733646 <GO>}

Yes, I can start with the second question. No. I was not tempted, because for me it's very
important that we have a solid result here, not work on some record results. We had a
Supervisory Board meeting yesterday with audits and boﬃns. And that was my ﬁrst
question to the auditors, is there anything in the result that was mortgaging the future?
And the clear answer was no, just the opposite. And that's exactly the way how I would
like to exit.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Michael Diekmann

{BIO 1733646 <GO>}

You're welcome.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Michael, I think I would like to explain on all the movement of Solvency II. Well ﬁrst of all,
we cannot guarantee that our internal model as being approved as applied for. So that is
an uncertainty I think all companies in Europe have to live with until they get the green
light from the regulator and you can anticipate that the green lights will come somewhere
in December 2015. And that is for almost the players the same.
Secondly, as I've tried to indicate, we are really trying to do an active management of the
level. And that means that we think our -- as long as we are a sound level above the 160%.
And I think that is what you actually wanted to ask, you don't need to concerned about
the dividend announcement. And we will keep the level soundly above the 160 level, as
you would expect. And we will actively manage the number. But I think we have also built
in quite a lot of conservative things.

So you ask how the RfB and ZZR is developing and the ﬁnancing. I think when you would
calculate all the funds in our German Life subsidiary, you come to a substantial number in
percentage of the reserves as clearly above 25%. We have in -- on the asset side, as well
as on the liability side, in cushion. And I wouldn't see any ZZR ﬁnancing out of the
operating results, based on this starting point.
And even if we do the calculation longer than the 8-9 years, because I think Max said,
when we do reinvest our money at 0.7% in Germany, we can pay oﬀ all the guarantees.
That means, in the end, even with the ZZR going to 0.7% down would still be carrying
through as a fairly low number. Well you never know how many years the quantitative
easing in Europe is holding. But it's certainly not in the next couple of decades.

Our next question comes from Farooq Hanif of Citi.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thank you very much.
I just want to ask one more question on solvency. Can you tell us what your kind of
minimum RBC ratio assumption is? I think there's a bit of confusion in the footnote. I just
wanted to understand how yours compares to some of your peers.
Then secondly, on the life business, I'm intrigued by your forecast of roughly ﬂat proﬁts,
given the great achievements you're making in shifting mix, the fact that you're defending
your margins, I was just wondering kind of what the drivers are on that? Then, associated
with that, you mentioned the 2.7% reinvestment yield in Life. But you're making
considerable investments in real assets. So what do you think the income yield would be,
if you included those real assets on top of the 2.7%?
Thank you.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Okay, I'll take the easy question on the US RBC ratio. So we had in the disclosure we
called it 100% (inaudible). That is a classical insurance-style misleading information. So we
mean 200% of local statutory requirements. So the 200% is called the Company actual
level. That means that it's suﬃcient.

Page 16 of 39

FINAL

I can also turn it around in the other way. As you calculate now the Group solvency, at the
weighted average between the US number and the internal model number, our US model
goes into the calculation with 175%, because we run day to day, also due to our A.M. Best
rating the Company at 350% of statutory base requirements. So the 350 divided by 200%
capital actual level. So you have 175% ratio how it is, then, being weighted with the ratio of
the internal model countries. So it dilutes, slightly, the ratio.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

And the forecast on the --

A - Maximilian Zimmerer

{BIO 2557503 <GO>}

Yes. The forecast, only driven by Life. You can say that the current yield, all in all, will go
down, perhaps something between 0.1% and 0.2% every year, because that's the running
rate you have in there. The real assets are included.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Oh, no, I meant, sorry -- If I may return on that, I meant the 2.7% you're masking on ﬁxed
income -- maybe I misunderstood your answer -- but how much additional yield do you
make on top of the 2.7%?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Maximilian Zimmerer

{BIO 2557503 <GO>}

Yes. That is also discovered on PB6. If you go only for the real assets, all the return to
ﬁxed-income assets are included in the 2.7%. And if go now only for the equity part, that's
real estate, that's equities. And that's the renewable part in infrastructure, there the
running yield, current yield, is at 4%. Then you can say, in addition to that, also, price
increases. But that depends very much on the asset classes. That can be something
between 2% and 5%.
But what -- I can't tell you the inﬂuence on the reinvestment yield. What I've said right now
is the inﬂuence on the yield of the portfolio for the next year. And the overall impact of
lower interest rates and the lower reinvestment yields, including real assets, is about 0.1%
or 0.2% lower for next year, yes?

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

And do you think this is why you're forecasting ﬂat to slight proﬁts, or is there other --?

A - Maximilian Zimmerer

{BIO 2557503 <GO>}

Yes. Too. But because we have a growth overall in the business, itself.

Q - Farooq Hanif

(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Andy Broadﬁeld of Barclays. Please
go ahead.

Q - Andy Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

FINAL

Oh, hi there. A couple of questions, please.
Just on Italy P&C I fear you may have answered this in the past. But I'm just wondering, for
the organic number, organic growth if you like, or internal growth, is negative, given your
very strong performance there I would have that would be -- part of the strategy was to try
and see if you could actually grow that. I'm just wondering if you can explain why that was
negative, the P&C internal growth in Italy?
On your decision to include US equivalents when in the past I think you -- you described it
as being agnostic -- I thought you'd take it as a sort of slightly more purist view that you
would just have a consistent methodology across the Group. I'm just interested. You've
included it now. Is this now, it's in for good, or is this a sort of strategy to cherry pick, or
just whatever is convenient? I'm a little confused why you should do that now?

Bloomberg Transcript

And just a ﬁnal question, just on your slide B8, which references the 0.7% reinvestment
yield, I just want to understand what that really means. Does that mean if you were to
retain all the proﬁts you made between now and the running yield collapsing to below
the guarantee levels, you'd be able to take all those. And that would pay for the losses
afterwards, or does it mean that you would be breakeven by the end? I'm not quite sure
how to interpret quite what that statement is.

A - Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

That's right. It's okay.

A - Michael Diekmann

{BIO 1733646 <GO>}

So Andy, hi. Maybe I can start with the Italian side. If you look at the market, the price or
rate you're going to ﬁnd, is negative. We are better than the market here. And that's the
internal growth side. So that's minus 1.2%.
Now, if you add Unipol, then you arrive at a growth of 4.1%. That's the total growth, yes?
So we divide between organic and un-organic growth.

Q - Andy Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

I guess my expectation was that, given the very, very margins you were making, I know the
market is, in general, as well. But you were still somewhere ahead of the market, that'd
you be able to give more. And, therefore, grow more on the sort of -- on the non-Unipol
part of the business.

A - Michael Diekmann

{BIO 1733646 <GO>}

Page 18 of 39



Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2015-02-26

Well that's what we do. The risk growth is there. And the growth of the -- the organic
growth is much better than market. I think the market has declined by around
4percentage points.

Q - Andy Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay.

A - Michael Diekmann

{BIO 1733646 <GO>}

And the Italian was down 6%, 7% over at least the ﬁrst nine months. The 12 months I guess
I have not yet seen. So total market minus 4, motor minus 6, 7. So, minus 1 is still a small
increase in market share.

Q - Andy Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

Okay. So probably policies in force has grown. But premiums not? Okay?

A - Michael Diekmann

{BIO 1733646 <GO>}

Yes, sure. That is -- coming from a substantial outperform on the combined ratio, that is
what you expect.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We are keeping a positive -- a strong positive distance to the performance of the market.
But you cannot expect that it just does not relate to the market.
And your question on US equivalents, well, as I said, I think, on one hand, it is certainly
good for the overall status of management. I think it makes us, indeed, more comparable
to our peers. And also, I think we have ﬁgured out -- we have, already, probably the
largest number of legal entities in our internal model, which are going through approval
process. And the simpliﬁcation of it is, actually, not bad. And US Life business is, in
particular, for European regulators, quite an alien portfolio.
So the simpliﬁcation overall, I think, is probably helpful for us in all the negotiations and
all the explanation we have to do in the ﬁrst nine months. So that is probably what makes
it to be a reasonable decision, plus the fact at the current interest rate level, yes, it had a
positive eﬀect. But as we all believe that the US will be the ﬁrst country in the Western
world to recover interest rates. So mid-term, the impact on the solvency ratio is very
ﬂattish.

Q - Andy Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

So you say you persist with that now, that's the end. And that's going to stay?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yes. Well not ﬁling it -- well, I can't say for ever, because what is also true is that as soon as
the internal model is approved, we will actually ﬁle a new application, beginning of 2016
Page 19 of 39



Company Name: Allianz SE

for a number of changes we do in our internal Group organization and new software
packages, et cetera.
So this approval process is, anyway, a new industry, which has been created.

FINAL

Q - Andy Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

And will you manage the business based on US equivalents, or based on sort of
consistent --

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

It's the internal benchmark and pricing of the product which we stick to our internal
model, which is not completely consistent with the Solvency II model. We have done
some stricter economic assumption in it. And the Solvency II will (inaudible) stipulating.

Q - Andy Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Maximilian Zimmerer

{BIO 2557503 <GO>}

Now coming to the question to Life Germany, you know that the average guarantee right
now in Life Germany is around 3%. But it goes down every year by, let's say, 5 to 7 basis
points. What is shown here with the reinvestment yield of 0.7% is the pure risk scenario
that is not what I expect, only to say that. And that works into the assumption of a run-oﬀ.
And that means, also, we cut all the crediting rates to the customers. We pay only the
minimum dividend to the shareholders. And then, the buﬀers we have right now would
be suﬃcient, with the reinvestment of 0.7%, to pay all the guarantees.

Q - Andy Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

So eﬀectively, no earnings, on dividends?

A - Maximilian Zimmerer

{BIO 2557503 <GO>}

There are dividends. But these are minimum dividends, they are -- this is a requirement by
law, yes?

Q - Andy Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Maximilian Zimmerer

{BIO 2557503 <GO>}

And only to compare that number it has been at 1%. That means we have lowered the
minimum numbers, also, due to some measures we have taken. That's also the ZZR. But
also the extension of the duration. And the new products have also worked into that
duration.

FINAL

Our next question comes from William Hawkins of RKW [ph].

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Oh, thank you. I think I'm still at KBW.
Three quick questions. What's the outlook for your Life investment margin? You had a
good 80 basis points last year. You did talk about sort of -- I think you talked about gains
and the rest of it hedging beneﬁts. So should that ﬁgure be trending down, or do you
think it's a ﬁgure that you can sustain in a low-yield environment?
Secondly, I think this has been asked before. But I've forgotten the answer. Last year, how
were you achieving 2.5% to 2.7% yields on government bonds, when the vast majority of
your portfolio is in Europe? And can you just remind us what the new money investment
rate is? Because, again, I'd be amazed if it was much north of 2% on governments.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then ﬁnally, I think you referred to more performance fees in PIMCO in 4Q of '15. And I
thought, Dieter, previously you were saying that actually the performance fees would be
lumpier from 2016. So has something changed in the timing of PIMCO's performance
fees?
Thanks.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Okay. I'll start with the PIMCO performance fees. Yes. It was not really clear when the
maturity of the other two closed funds would happen. It depends when the investment
targets are reached. And then the sales start. And that is now being expected in the
months more at the end of this year. So probably starting somewhere in September,
October, November, December. And that would, then, bring in the performance fees into
this year, 2015. And there will be, also, some overhangs in 2016.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

May I just cut in there? Does that mean we're eﬀectively just accelerating what you'd
hoped from '16, or is it actually an aggregate bigger number?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

It is certainly an eﬀective number. But I did -- we did only mention it that you will not say
when you look at the average result of PIMCO in the ﬁrst three quarters and say, how do
you want to make your target range for the whole year? Q4 will have a substantially higher
operating proﬁt than Q1, 2. And 3. That is just by the fact of the performance fees. And in
Page 21 of 39



Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2015-02-26

'16 I think we will certainly still have some of the one-oﬀ performance fees. The total might
also be higher than what we talked about a year ago.

FINAL

So also, Life investment margin is still in the range of 75 basis points, plus or minus. With
the mark-to-market of some of the investments, it is not absolutely controllable to the last
basis point.

A - Maximilian Zimmerer

{BIO 2557503 <GO>}

Now to the question on the investment side, you're referring to page B7, I think. The
reinvestment yield for governments for the Life business, it was at 2.7% last year and, as
shown, the average maturity was 15 years. And that is mainly, let's say, between 70% and
80% developed markets. These are mainly euro markets. But also US. And then emerging
markets are around a little bit more than 20%. And the developed markets, the average
yield, reinvestment yield, was at 2.2% and the emerging market side is 4.5%.
To say that emerging markets it's two-thirds, usually, hedged against euro or US dollar.
And the rest you read in the local currency. And the average rating on the emerging
market was BBB and on the developed markets it's an A.

That's a very good question. I can't give you the number. I can only tell you that in the last
quarter, reinvestment yield, overall, went down from 2.7% to 2.3%. That's the only thing I
can say.
January, I think, is a little bit too early to call the number for the year.

Our next question comes from Andrew Ritchie of Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Oh, hi there. A couple of quick questions. First of all, just on the guidance, the mid-point
of the guidance, let's say, what's your -- what's the overall tailwind from FX that you're
building in there? I think it -- roughly, back of the envelope, it would be a couple of
hundred million euros. Maybe just clarify what is the overall FX beneﬁt in '15?
Secondly, on PIMCO, I guess I just wanted to understand a bit more about your
conﬁdence in the result and the outlook. And it sounds like a large part of that is the
Page 22 of 39



Company Name: Allianz SE

performance fees, because, Michael, you referred to outﬂows being higher than you
expected. So what gives you conﬁdence that we'll start to see some stability in those
outﬂows. And maybe bring us up to date on that?

FINAL

And I guess the other point on PIMCO is the margin continues to deteriorate. What's your
feeling in terms of the resilience of that margin from here?
That was it, thanks.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yes, I don't know whether I got you the right answer. But in this guidance you refer to
outlook upper end of --

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

No, no, I'm referring to the 2015 outlook. And what the tailwind from FX in the 2015
outlook? It must be quite substantial.

A - Maximilian Zimmerer

{BIO 2557503 <GO>}

Maybe I do the FX tailwind. We have used in the outlook calculation a euro/dollar
exchange rate of 1.20. So that means current -- a small, 1.13, 1.14. So we did not go this far.
We have taken, as you know us, a conservative stand on this point.

Bloomberg Transcript

So that's --

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

That's still an average 10% lower rate, or a 10% better rate than '14, I guess.

A - Maximilian Zimmerer

{BIO 2557503 <GO>}

That is 10% better than '14. There it was 1.33 was the average. So it's 13%. So that makes,
then, some EUR250 million, EUR300 million for all the US businesses together. So that
aﬀects the US Life business, which has, obviously, with the great new business an
improved proﬁtability next year. And the P&C business we write in the US. And also the
Asset Management.

A - Michael Diekmann

{BIO 1733646 <GO>}

And the conﬁdence on PIMCO, I think we are mentioning these performance fees
because it will give us some additional tailwind. But I'm actually building my conﬁdence
on diﬀerent things. First, I'm talking on a weekly basis to large clients of PIMCO. And to
large distributors like UBS, Morgan Stanley. And so on. So basically, the conﬁdence of our
investors is unbroken. I'm not only talking about German or European corporates, I'm
including Asians, Middle East. And US corporates, plus pension funds, as well.

FINAL

So the ﬁrst wave that we've seen of outﬂows was linked to retail investors in the US. I think
that is probably always the weakest spot, because you don't have a direct contact to these
clients.
Then you have, obviously, over the change of the year, the execution of trustee decisions
that might have been taken already in October and November. So if I look at the pattern
now, that we are following we think this wave one on the retail side, wave two institutional
investors and trustees is over. And I've talked to a couple of the PIMCO guys yesterday.
And asked them for -- give me some hints on where do we see inﬂows.
So we are collecting new money. And not only in the US. But also in Europe, Asia. And the
Middle East. So I think this sort of negative spill that you're getting into is something that
is basically linked to the Bill Gross departure and consequent decisions. And has nothing
to do with the current situation and performance.
So that makes me conﬁdent. I'm not declaring victory here. But it's really the feedback
that I'm getting from investors. And just to give you an idea how I do this. So I going to
call -- I would call the CEO of a large corporate client and tell him I want to talk to you in
three days about PIMCO and your investments. So please talk to your investment people
so that we don't have an uneducated discussion. But really an educated one. So I put a
high reliability on these feedbacks in the market.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So you're still anticipating net outﬂows through the ﬁrst half? Is that correct?

A - Michael Diekmann

{BIO 1733646 <GO>}

Yes, I wouldn't be surprised. But I expect them at a lower volumes, as we've seen in Q4.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

And the discussion on margins. I know there's a mix eﬀect.

A - Michael Diekmann

{BIO 1733646 <GO>}

Yes, sure.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Is there any pricing eﬀect, as well as mix eﬀect?

A - Michael Diekmann

{BIO 1733646 <GO>}

Well I would say, it's natural, if you lose retail clients, that basically come in at a higher
margin, that the margin is weakening a little bit. But if I look at the development, this is not
a substantial shift here, yes?

FINAL

It's mainly mix-driven. And going forward in '15, I think that it's more the point that we
have, still, in '15 the heightened level with the retention program. So certainly, in '15 we
will not have the cost/income ratio starting with a 5. The cost/income ratio will probably
start with a 6. But that is with the heightened expense. Spending's quite obvious. But that
is an investment in the -- all this re-change, restructuring program at PIMCO. And I think
what we have forgotten to discuss and mention is that actually the Total Return Fund
regained its 5-star rating.
So it was, I felt, a bit prematurely reduced to 4 stars. And now, after everybody recognized
that, also, the new team is actually understanding how the Total Return Fund works,
actually performance data's very good. In particular, last month was really adding a top
month.
So we are back on track with this fund. As this is always getting the highest media
attention, I think that it's also there that pivoting that development of PIMCO in the future.

A - Michael Diekmann

{BIO 1733646 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And yes, I would also like to add another one, because we've been asked this by the
media this morning, the same question. And I was referring back to Max and the asset
allocation of Allianz.
Now, as everybody's talking about equities these days, probably if you could, you would
be invested at a much higher rate into equities, some welcome back deja vu, 2002-2003.
Unfortunately, capital, solvency and so on, will not allow people to do what they would
like to do as private people these days. So there will always be a very high allocation to
bonds. And I think at some point in time, people will realize that if you have to manage a
bond portfolio, you better get the portfolio manager whose best at that. And I think there
is no doubt out there that the reputation of PIMCO was not only earned by Bill Gross. But
by the whole organization.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. And just to be clear, are you giving us the numbers for outﬂows in January and
February?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

In February it's substantially lighter than January. I think the -- we are not disclosing the
number. But the trend is clearly, absolutely ﬁne.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you. Good afternoon. I had two questions, please.
Michael, the ﬁrst question is just around technology and digital. And I was keen to kind of
get your thoughts on how we've progressed over the past sort of two or three years under
your stewardship, what you think Allianz has done well, particularly at the center, in terms
of using eﬃcient operating models. And implementing best practice throughout the
Group?
Then, kind of looking forward a bit more over the next few years, I mean, technology and
digital is creating a lot of challenges for companies like Allianz. And you're likely to come
into contact with greater competition from non-insurance companies. There's a number of
things going on, whether it's usage-based insurance, or whether it's connected cars or
connected homes.
So obviously, you're not disappearing into the sidelines. But I just wanted to kind of get
your kind of big picture thoughts about what the future actually looks like for a properly
digitally enabled company as Allianz should intend to be?

Bloomberg Transcript

Then secondly, just in terms of kind of the earnings growth potential, I mean, kind of
linked to the ﬁrst question. But at the moment, your guidance for next year is limited in
terms of earnings growth. But that's clearly understandable in the low bond yield
environment. But you have a number of one-oﬀs dragging on the numbers. The near-term
outlook probably doesn't look too strong, in terms of growth.
But there's going to be a time when you become operationally more eﬃcient. And that
should be as a lot of this technological change starts to grind through. Your competitive
positioning looks stronger. And particularly in places like France and Germany and the
UK.
So I guess once we get past this initial kind of headwind, in the next year or two of lower
rates and just the level of investment that's needed, what is the kind of medium-term
earnings growth potential of Allianz?
Thank you.

A - Michael Diekmann

{BIO 1733646 <GO>}

I think that's a very good question for Oliver. I don't want to put him on the spot here.
But if look at what we've done in Allianz so far, we've always started from the architectural
side. So architecture means business model ﬁrst. And then we go into applying that.
So business model in this sense was the target (inaudible) model that I think is really a
(inaudible) for a change than on the business model side. The ﬁrst thing that needed to
be addressed was to move to get away from a sales channels tiering to multi-access
Page 26 of 39



Company Name: Allianz SE

FINAL

tiering. Then we have rationalized product portfolios. Then we've rationalized the IT
platforms.
Then we founded AWP as a sort of central source for digital partnerships. And our service
components. And now, just to give you another ﬂavor, not only from the insurance side.
But from the Asset Management side, we've just put in place an aﬃnity platform for Asset
Management products that we can -- we have tested that. It was in (inaudible) and now we
can apply that to large corporate customers, as well.
So there's a whole bouquet of activities now. And then you have an innovation piece that
we never talk about. Some of our competitors do. And maybe get higher attention on
this. But the same sort of partnerships that our French friends are undergoing, obviously,
we do, as well. We do this a little bit more silent on the automotive side, on the
telecommunications side. We are talking to Internet companies, just as well. And we have
a little innovator -- innovation platform in AWP and here in Munich that provides us with
some interesting ideas but also as a partner for venture capitalist partners outside of
Europe.
So I think there's a whole range of things that, obviously. And that is more the focus from
Oliver and our COO, will, then, at some point in time, not only reach sales levels. But also
get into eﬃciency that right now all these gains are being reinvested developing further
capabilities.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think Oliver will be very happy to talk about this going forward, because it's, obviously,
one of the future questions for the industry and for Allianz.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everybody. I've got three questions, please.
Firstly, on capital, I wonder if you could comment as to whether you've made any other
methodology changes in the Fourth Quarter, in addition to the equivalents? And in
association with this, Dieter mentioned internal model approvals starting next quarter.
Could you comment on whether you be above 160 if you were using the standard model,
vis-a-vis the internal model? So this is the ﬁrst question.

FINAL

Second question, on the sort of nat cat experience, on the headline numbers you look like
you've got a big sort of headwind to the numbers in '14. You mentioned some of the
smaller losses that maybe wouldn't be classiﬁed at nat cat but were larger than normal. I
just wonder whether you could give a number as the beneﬁt you saw on your view in '14
from the nat cat?
Then just ﬁnally, on guarantees, on the slide, I think it was B8, you've got the minimum
guarantee for new business across the Life book of 100 basis points, I think. I just
wondered what your view was, given how quickly yields have declined, is there an
argument that that rate should be coming down faster than it is? Is there an argument, I
guess, even a zero % guarantee is very valuable in this environment?
Thank you.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Well sure, let me ﬁrst start with capital challenges in the model. There were a number of
changes included (inaudible) and, in total, actually being more or less neutral. We have
the equivalents I have spoken about, then the reduced -- the charge for the government
bonds for the (inaudible) risk from a full chart like a corporate bond to what the regulatory
calls the domestic light model.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the other hand, we increased the risk charges because we introduced pension risk for
our own pension liabilities. And there are some technical things on the treatment of the
third-party bonds. And things like that. But that is a lot more technical in nature.
As we are applying for an internal model, we are not talking about our standard model
number.
On the cat nat -- sorry, yes, Jon?

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

So I can just on the sovereign charge there. How does the sovereign charge work? You
said you mentioned the domestic Life model. I'm not familiar with that. How does -- is it a
smaller charge than the similarly rated corporate, I guess?
(multiple speakers)

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Domestic light is a variation where we are not taking the full charge of (inaudible) at the
Group level (inaudible) only on domestic bonds, government bonds issued in bond
currency, not the full treatment.
These bonds are then considered to be AAA. Otherwise, they are assigned their actual
rating if held outside the country of issue. So that was an agreement with the supervisory
college that actually in our Group model, Italian and Spanish bonds are being treated as
Page 28 of 39



Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2015-02-26

equal to corporate bonds with their credit spread risk. But in the local model, they are
being treated as risk-free for the stand-alone legal entity. So that is more on the subsidiary
level and not on the Group level.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. So, it's the cross-border bonds that are getting the charge. And (inaudible).

A - Maximilian Zimmerer

{BIO 2557503 <GO>}

It's the cross-border --

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Cross-border gets the charge, also, on the local model. But in the Group model, we treat
everything -- well, cross-border, which means from a German perspective, as a German
bond. Anyway, (inaudible) so, that is, then, not a change.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Does that mean you're basically carrying extra capital at Group but not in the
subsidiaries?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That is true.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Besides the cross-border. So if you have Italian bonds in France or Spanish bonds in Italy,
then you have also it as a local model.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

And I think the nat cat question, I think, compared to our standard cat structure in 2014, I
think we have around EUR250 million to EUR400 million consumed less. So a percentage
point, roughly.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Now the question to the guarantees.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

(inaudible).

FINAL

A - Maximilian Zimmerer

{BIO 2557503 <GO>}

Yes, I can do it. I said for this year we expect something between 0.7% and 0.8%. What is
the reason for that? In the bigger market, the German-speaking countries, the guarantee
leverage by law, the maximum leverage are at 1.25%. That means it would be signiﬁcantly
lower. That's a question, overall, of the business mix.
That means we try to oﬀer more products which are not standard. So that we can come up
with lower guarantees overall. But where we also work on is that we try to avoid this lockin guarantees for the crediting rates. We have launched a new product in that respect.
And what is also very important, I think even more important, is that we try to reduce the
duration of the guarantees. That is very important because otherwise we can't go for a
matching approach on the asset side.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Do you think in a position in Germany where your guarantees can be less competitive,
given the ﬁnancial strength (inaudible)? Or are you still oﬀering similar levels to your
competitors?

A - Maximilian Zimmerer

{BIO 2557503 <GO>}

The (inaudible), I think, is a very good example. We were the ﬁrst insurer who oﬀered that
kind of product. And it was possible for us because of our ﬁnancial strength. So it's
obvious. It was a very big success, right from the beginning, although we were heavily
criticized by the press, right from the start. But now I see not only customers are satisﬁed.
But also competitors try to copy us right now.

A - Michael Diekmann

{BIO 1733646 <GO>}

And that is half of all the sales to individuals.

A - Maximilian Zimmerer

{BIO 2557503 <GO>}

Right.

A - Michael Diekmann

{BIO 1733646 <GO>}

And that has a 0.7% guarantee, which is a de facto guarantee when you just give a
premium (inaudible) guarantee. So that is, even now, with the oﬃcial guarantee rate in
Germany of 1.25%, still 60 basis points lower. And last year it was more than a % lower
than the standard guarantee.

FINAL

Our next question comes from Thomas Seidl of Bernstein.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon. Three questions from my side, please.
First, on capital again. So on a true pro forma you're at 191%. You had quite enormous
volatility throughout the year. If you strip out the Life one-oﬀ, a 25% drop in the quarter.
And also, looking at the sensitivities, level spreads by the interest rate, what makes you
comfortable that you're not coming pretty close to the 160 threshold for the dividend?
The ﬁrst question.
Second question -- investment management, I think you mentioned, rightfully, that you're
constrained to ﬁxed income. Now with the additional hedging from QE and also
considering the various credit expertise you have throughout the Group, should we not
expect Allianz to take, here and there, more credit-risk to mitigate the impact?

Bloomberg Transcript

And thirdly, on PIMCO, Michael, I think you mentioned for the ﬁrst time you didn't staﬀ the
equity team at PIMCO properly. And, hence, it was not a big success. Now when I look at
the number, it's still showing zero for PIMCO. So should we expect, at some point the
equity team to deliver at PIMCO, or will it remain a ﬁxed-income shop?

A - Michael Diekmann

{BIO 1733646 <GO>}

Well the last question is easy to answer. It will remain a ﬁxed and mixed-income shop,
because the sheer volume of the equity funds, is some 3% of the total. And that will take
time to develop. And I'm -- I think it's good to have that team there. But, sorry, it cannot
change and should not change the focus on the ﬁxed-income side.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Still showing zero, right, I think?

A - Michael Diekmann

{BIO 1733646 <GO>}

Well we're talking about here -- I have my specialist here. What is the equity portion of --?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker

A - Maximilian Zimmerer

{BIO 2557503 <GO>}

FINAL

Look, I think active capital management is always the same procedure. You have your
current position. If you look at how well you could reduce, if required. So you have a list of
items which close or already in execution. And then you have a list of things you keep as
the next layer of contingencies, if necessary. And that is how you manage your numbers.
And that gives us the conﬁdence that we can do it.
You asked about the credit risk, how we handle that? May we have the question again?

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Sorry. Given the credit expertise you have throughout the group. And given the additional
headwinds of QE on the ﬁxed-income, which is the largest asset class, obviously, should
we not assume that you take more credit risk here and there to mitigate the headwinds?

A - Maximilian Zimmerer

{BIO 2557503 <GO>}

Yes. I wanted to start right now with the answer. We -- ﬁrst, you have to have a closer look
on the credit spreads. Also, the credit spreads have come down signiﬁcantly, usually that's
the case if interest rates go down. People are keen to achieve some return. And,
therefore, take usually more credit risk.

Bloomberg Transcript

If I think of the credit spread leverage right now, they are at a very low point. But, still, way
above the default rates. That means it is still attractive to do so. I think where we can earn
some extra money is especially on the alternative debt side. And that's the area we are in.
By that, I mean usually private placements, (inaudible) but also infrastructure debt.
Unfortunately, you have to do it transaction by transaction. That means to grow that part
of the portfolio takes some time.

Q - Thomas Seidl

Q - Frank Kopﬁnger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. I have two questions on your guidance.
The ﬁrst one is on, could you remind us, again, I think, Michael, you mentioned EUR500
million restructuring charges for 2014. Is this the ﬁgure we should look at 2014 and, on the
other side, do we have some sort of restructuring charges, also, reﬂected within your new
guidance. And, if so, how much?

Page 32 of 39



Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2015-02-26

FINAL

And on the second question, if -- on PIMCO, again, on the Q4 cost to income ratio, the
64%, I understand that part is driven by the management retention program, which
(inaudible) but also driven by mix eﬀects and marketing eﬀects. So what is your guidance,
overall, for the year, or what sort of cost to income ratio is reﬂected within your new
guidance?

A - Michael Diekmann

{BIO 1733646 <GO>}

So ﬁrst of all, I think this EUR500 million restructuring charge is a misunderstanding. The
EUR500 million is the loss of our three P&C units Russia, Brazil. And US, which we don't
want to repeat, because we restructure it. But it's slightly diﬀerent than a restructuring
charge.
So that is what we see on the P&C side as, really, the easiest and low-hanging fruit. And
the upside.
PIMCO I said that the cost/income ratio for 2015 starts with a 6.

A - Maximilian Zimmerer

{BIO 2557503 <GO>}

Now you add the zero.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Michael Diekmann

{BIO 1733646 <GO>}

And you add a zero, yes, that is, then, depending on how the whole year plays out. And
depending whether we need some additional investments, or whether we can, also, start
or go back to normal so that we will see as soon as it happens. And the more cost eﬃcient
we can be for the rest of the year. But let's now start the year with our overall guidance.
And, in the end, we have never the aim to achieve every KPI we are talking about. It is, in
the end, about the overall promise of the operating proﬁt of EUR10.4 billion and we don't
want to meet 65 KPIs parallel. That is, in the end, the side of the organization, probably
hard to do.

Q - Frank Kopﬁnger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

But on -- thank you, on the low-hanging fruit in P&C, what would you say, out of the
EUR500 million is a realistic low-hanging fruit?

A - Michael Diekmann

{BIO 1733646 <GO>}

Yes. Well that would be really disappointing when we have the same result again. And the
US we have already started the work of the restructuring and integration. And there is also
the partial disposal to ACE, closing in April. Then in Russia the portfolio is shrinking very
fast. So on those remaining policies you can't lose EUR180 million, I believe.
And Brazil I think we have started to work to translate and do a better business. The
management team is fairly new in place, six to nine months. And will be strengthened
further in the next weeks.

300%. And my question, I guess, is kind of why did you choose 100%. And are there other
areas of Solvency II where you're diﬀerent? I mean, you may be a lot more conservative in,
I don't know, how you treat the surplus capital within the US, or something like that. I'm
sure there are lots of areas for diﬀerence. And I'm sure you're very conservative in all sorts
of areas.
My second question is, for Michael. It's, again, on the US. And the question is, when I look
at the PV sensitivities of the US Life business, it does seem to be particularly sensitive to
the macro. I mean, if you look at the credit spreads, for example 100 bps movement is
worth 2.4 billion, which is just massive.
And you've doubled your US new business value in 2014. It's nearly as big as Germany.
And the question, Michael, is why do you want to write this business, which is kind of -- it
looks kind of high risk? But maybe that's wrong, maybe it's much lower risk. And we're
missing something.

Yes, I think, Nick, I'm confused about the question, because I thought I explained very well
that we are -- that our base is the 200% number and not the 100% number. And that is
what I also understand from some of the peers exactly the same what they are doing. And
that looks to me, reasonable.
And in the end, what I explained is we run the Company due to the A.M. Best requirement
at a local 350% level. Then is when you want to be an A-plus company under A.M. Best,
that is what they want to see.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

And that is exactly what we do. That means in the calculation, 350 divided by 200 is 175.
And the 175 goes, then, into this average calculation.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

So Dieter, sorry. Are you saying that the -- that you are 200% of the authorized level
control, the minimum. Because your peers are deﬁnitely saying they have a coverage at
the company action level. And so, of the company action are you -- you're 100%, aren't
you?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

That is the corporate action level. That is exactly the 200% number. And that's --

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Exactly. I mean, I'm not saying it's not a strong level. Absolutely, it is a strong -- it's 200%
or 175% or however you calculate it of the authorized control level, the ACL. But my
observation -- this is just an observation -- is the other companies, your peers, are
reporting 200% to 300%.
And so, there does seem to be a diﬀerence. But I think there may be lots of diﬀerences.
You may be counting capital surplusing a diﬀerent way. And things like that.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

As a ratio, they are reporting this. But, look I -- as far as I know, when you are in the A.M.
Best discussion, locally the 350 of the NAIC base requirement is actually what most
companies are doing. That is the standard number you ﬁnd for most large US companies.
And I'm also used to, since the last 20 years, I think it is pretty much the same everywhere.

How you translate it, then, into a ratio here into the calculation, I can't tell you what our
peers are doing. I only tell you that in our calculation, the ratio is 175.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. And maybe --

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Maybe you ask the question what ratio is actually added in this weighting average. And
then you get a good (inaudible).

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Okay. And just one ﬁnal point on that. Given that there are lots of companies that are
reporting diﬀerent deﬁnitions here, diﬀerent ratios, when do you think we're going to get
harmonization on equivalents.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

When it is written into the delegated acts and that is an April activity of the Brussels
parliament.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. So in April we can expect clariﬁcation.

A - Maximilian Zimmerer

{BIO 2557503 <GO>}

Maybe I can kick in with the FIA business. I think we are all a little bit traumatized from the
old VA experience. And you are right, we do have a sensitivity to market movements in
this business.
If I compare. And I'm on page A62, the KPIs for the new business margin in this business,
we have a 3.4%. Internal rate of return, we have a 12.3% so, at current levels, the business
is great.
So what do we do if sentiment changes? We want to remind you there's a very low
guarantee level, because basically what we do, we oﬀer protection of principal. So if you
sort of translate that, that's a 0.3% guarantee.
Then we have a lot of management levers where we can adjust this product on, I think it's
an annual level. But maybe even more frequently. We have a much better expense
eﬃciency in our Italian Life business now because of the scale. And we do have a dynamic
(inaudible) process in place that has served us well to manage volatilities.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Thank you. That's very clear.

One very quick follow-up. Michael, how big do you want the US to be? I mean, it's grown
a lot. What sort of growth do you envisage going forward?

FINAL

A - Michael Diekmann

{BIO 1733646 <GO>}

Well our current -- and, obviously, that can change over time, the current message for the
US business is, we don't want to inject capital. And we want to see some dividend growth.
And they have managed very well to stay in line with that.
We've got, for instance, this year EUR250 million dividend from Minneapolis.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

A - Michael Diekmann

{BIO 1733646 <GO>}

You're welcome.

Our next --

All right -- do we have more questions, I understand?

Operator
Yes. We do have a number of questions. Do you wish to proceed?

A - Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

Thanks, operator. We will take one more question, please. And then we will end the call.
Thank you.

Operator
Perfect. Our ﬁnal question comes from Paul De'ath of RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Paul De'ath
Yes, hi, everyone. Thanks for squeezing this all in. And a couple of very -- actually very
quick questions. And on the investment side of things. So, going back to that slide, B8.
And the Life Germany number, 0.7% yield required to cover the guarantees.
Presumably, that is backed up by the large RfB in Germany. And I wonder if you could
comment on the position for any of the other countries where you've got signiﬁcant

FINAL

guarantees. Is this (inaudible) that 0.7% number would be signiﬁcantly higher for those?
And that's question one.
The second question, quickly, is on the increased target for real investment. So you've
signiﬁcantly increased that mid-term target to EUR110 billion. And how have you -obviously, as part of the dividend change you now are no longer allocating additional
money to pay for that additional capital investment. And I'm just wondering kind of where
you see that additional capital coming from?
Thanks.

A - Maximilian Zimmerer

{BIO 2557503 <GO>}

And I start with the ﬁrst question. And I would remind you the -- at least (inaudible) the
business in Germany stands for, let's say, 40% of the overall business. And also usually
Germany has very long-term guarantees. And, also, the guarantee level in comparison to
most of the other companies is the highest. It's right now, 3%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Therefore, we made this calculation for Life Germany. In Europe, I think there is no other
country which has an average similar, guarantees, at least, not %, duration, or also the
number of 3% won't be reached by them.
Now, the RfB of this EUR25 billion RfB, that's alone EUR10 billion that is in the German RfB
but a lot of other countries do not have any RfB. Therefore, the overall system is diﬀerent.
For example, you have special reserves in France and Italy. But they are not comparable to
the system with a RfB.
We didn't do any calculation for other countries only to say that. But they are, also, not as
signiﬁcant as Germany is.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

For example, in France, our average guarantee is 0.7%.

A - Maximilian Zimmerer

{BIO 2557503 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

So a reinvestment yield of 0.7% would also be okay.

A - Maximilian Zimmerer

{BIO 2557503 <GO>}

True.

Q - Paul De'ath
Okay. Great.
