Presentation
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ageas conference call for the 2012 six months'
results. I am pleased to present CEO, Bart De Smet, and CFO, Christophe Boizard.
(operator instructions) Gentlemen, please begin.

Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, all for dialing into this call and for being
with us for the presentation of the half-year 2012 results of Ageas. As usual, I'm joined in
the room by my colleagues of the Executive Committee, Christophe Boizard and Kurt De
Schepper, and our investor relations team.
You will have seen that we released three press released today; the half-year results as
expected, but also the announcement of a share buyback plan and, lastly, a
communication on our entry into the corporate loan market. Christophe will, amongst

FINAL

others, talk you through the latter one. I will take you briefly through the main highlights of
the past half-year.
Ladies and gentlemen. we expect you have already had time to look into the headlines of
our results, and I hope that you will join my conclusion that we can be very pleased with
them. Our Insurance activities continued the strong performance of the First Quarter and,
in some cases, did even better. And this resulted in both inflows and net results
significantly up on last year. Both our Life and Non-Life activities performed better than
last year, when compared to 2011 results, adjusted for the Greek impairment charge of
EUR150 million.
Let's look at some of the key figures. The inflows in the first half amounted to EUR10.8
billion, up 20%. The highest growth was seen in Continental Europe with inflows up by
more than 40%, and mainly driven by changes in scope, specifically the inclusion of our
new partnership in Turkey, by Non-Life in general, and by the higher inflows from the
merged activity in Luxembourg.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'd like to use this occasion also to confirm that we have completed, together with our coshareholder Haci Omer Sabanci Holding, the program to acquire up to 10% of the
outstanding shares in AKSigorta and, that as a result, our stake has increased from the
original 31% to 36% in Turkey.
In Asia, the outstanding performance of the First Quarter has been repeated, bringing
total inflows for this segment to nearly EUR4 billion. Inflows in Belgium and the UK grew
nicely by 10% or more and, overall, the largest growth was seen in our non-consolidated
partnerships, which represent now EUR5.1 billion, almost half of total inflows and were up
by 65%.
We reported the net profit for our Insurance activities of EUR303 million, and this
compares to EUR111 million last year. Adjusted for the impairment charge of EUR150 million
related to the Greek sovereign exposure, the net result improved thus by 16%. And this
net result breaks down into EUR205 million in Life, EUR89 million in Non-Life, and EUR7.5
million in other.
The main improvement comes from our Non-Life activities, which reported a net profit of
EUR89 million, compared to EUR48 million last year, the latter including a net impairment
charge of EUR7 million. Results improved in all of our main Non-Life activities, such as
Belgium and the UK, also illustrated by the excellent combined ratio of 94.7% for the
Second Quarter, and 98.3% for the first six months, well below our operational target of
100%.
Our combined ratios across all segments are currently below 100% and, overall, prior year
reserve releases increased only slightly, and the cost ratio came down significantly.
The Life activities contributed EUR205 million, compared to EUR52 million last year, the
latter including an impairment charge of EUR143 million. This strong result in the market
environment which remains difficult was mainly driven by Asia. Solid growth in all our

businesses, and a positive non-recurring result of EUR50 million, following an exceptional
reserve release, explains the improvement of the Asian results.

FINAL

And then finally, the segment Other came down from EUR11.3 million last year to EUR7.5
million this year. The lower result is explained by an incentive payment we received last
year, but also the highly competitive environment linked to tough economic conditions.
At the Group level, we reported a net profit of EUR305 million with a net profit in the
General Account of EUR2 million, which includes the EUR400 million benefit related to the
agreement with ABN AMRO and the Dutch State on the outstanding legal proceedings.
Christophe will come back in more detail on the main components of the results of the
General Account.
And lastly, our balance sheet remains solid with a net cash position in General Account,
which also increased to EUR1.5 billion, and an increase in shareholders' equity to EUR3.69
per share. The former was, of course, positively impacted by the cash settlements with
not only ABN AMRO on the outstanding legacies in the Netherlands, but also with BNP
Paribas earlier this year on the issues related to the CASHES and the Tier 1 financial
instrument.

Bloomberg Transcript

The solvency levels remained strong as well, and improved to 211% for our Insurance
activities. As always, more detailed information on the respective performance of the
various segments is available separately, and as a complement to the main press release.
I will limit myself to a number of very high level comments in order to allow more time for
Q&A to answer any specific questions you might have.
Starting with Belgium, inflows were up 10% at EUR3.6 billion with increases both in Life and
in Non-Life. In Life, a strong Second Quarter in individual savings via the Bank Channel
drove the increase. The net profit improved significantly on last year to EUR144 million,
helped by a very good result in Non-Life of EUR33 million.
The Life result amounted to EUR111 million, compared to EUR7 million last year. Adjusting
last year's results for the impairment charges related to Greece, the net result declined
slightly, due to a higher effective tax rate and a lower yield on own funds. The combined
ratio in Non-Life amounted to 99.8% and remains driven by a very strong performance in
Motor.
In the United Kingdom, Non-Life gross written premiums were up to EUR1.1 billion over the
first half, driven by good growth in Motor in particular. The UK operations delivered an
outstanding performance, with a net result up to EUR43 million.
The key elements behind the results were continued improvement in Motor, and EUR9
million net realized capital gains, partly offset by higher weather claims in Household. The
combined ratio ended at 98.9%, with Motor having progressed 3% compared to last year.

FINAL

Income in Retail remained in line with last year, while the net result reduced to EUR7.5
million, taking into account the result of last year positively impacted by non-recurring
items, but also illustrating the tough economic conditions.
And this brings me to the Continental Europe segment where the inflows, as already
mentioned, increased by 40% to EUR2.1 billion. Inflows in Luxembourg from the new
merged entity rose to EUR1 billion, while Turkey contributed for EUR302 million of gross
written premiums, 16% up to last year.
The influence in Portugal and France declined, but let me stress here that that, especially
in Portugal, this is not only related to the general market environment, but also to a
deliberate strategy to shift our product mix to more profitable and capital efficient
products.
The net profit in Continental Europe amounted to EUR34 million, with an excellent
contribution of EUR9 million from the Non-Life activities, the latter also visible in the
combined ratio of 88.5%.

Bloomberg Transcript

The development of our Turkish partnership is evolving well illustrated, amongst others,
by an increasing underwriting in our partnership with Akbank, up by 32%. Adjusting for the
impairment charges related to Greece, the net result in Life in Continental Europe
remained constant at EUR25 million, with a good result in Portugal despite the difficult
market conditions.
And finally, Asia. As already indicated, the segment confirmed its excellent performance
from the First Quarter with inflows of nearly EUR4 billion, 23% up on last year, of which
part related to a positive currency impact.
Inflows in our Life businesses grew in all major countries. A continued focus on recurring
premiums, and persistency resulted in a growth in our regular premium book by 26% to
EUR2.6 billion out of the EUR3.6 billion inflows in Life.
Funds under management decreased 12%, compared to the end of last year, as a result
of continued growth in all Asian entities. And the total profit of the Life operations
increased to EUR70 million, but included a positive impact of EUR50 million from an
exceptional release of reserves, and despite a cost of EUR4 million related to an equity
hedge implemented at the end of last year to protect Ageas against a significant decline
in the Chinese equities market.
In Non-Life, the gross written premiums increased 23%, with growth both in Malaysia and
Thailand. Net profit declined to EUR5 million, and includes a charge of EUR2 million for
additional losses related to last year's floods in Thailand.
Ladies and gentlemen. I would like now to hand over to Christophe to say a few words
about the General Account and our investment portfolio.

Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Thank you, Bart. As already mentioned previously in the presentation, we reported a small
net profit of EUR2 million in the General Account for the first six months. You will
remember that for Q1 we had a loss of EUR239 million, so it means that for Q2 we had a
positive result of EUR241 million. If you add this EUR2 million to the Insurance result of
EUR303 million, you have the total Group net result of EUR305 million. The net impact of
all the legacy issues for the first six months amounted to EUR65 million. And now let me
talk about this separately.
First of all, and this should be no surprise for you as we already reported on this the first
half net result included an impact of EUR400 million on the settlement reached with ABN
AMRO and the Dutch State at the end of June with respect to all the outstanding legacies.
In addition, we have had a positive result of EUR75 million related to Royal Park
Investments, which brings the value of the equity stake in our account to EUR855 million.
On the negative side, we have the accounting charge of EUR132 million related to the
settlement with BNP Paribas and Fortis Bank on the RPN(I) and on the Tier 1 instruments.
This was already included in the First Quarter results. And we had the charge of EUR278
million related to the lower value of the call option on the BNP Paribas shares. As a result
of the latter, the value of the call option has declined to EUR117 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

The last remark I would like to make with respect to the legacy issues is that we have
slightly adjusted the floor value for the remaining RPN(I) liability from EUR163 million to
EUR174 million, creating an additional charge of EUR11 million in the Second Quarter.
The variance is driven by the evolution of the somewhat lower Ageas share price,
compared to the previous quarter. And this will, in the quarters to come, continue to
necessitate small adjustments, going forward.
When we disclose the floor, the main driver for the floor was the CASHES price at 47.5%,
but there was a second of the element, which was the Ageas share price. And this is the
reason why we had the -- and we will have this small adjustment in the future.
As Bart already mentioned, the net cash position in the General Account increased to
EUR1.5 billion at the end of June. The positive impact of the settlements with BNP Paribas
and ABN AMRO amounting to EUR1.1 billion, and this has been partly offset by the payout
dividend of EUR200 million. And if you take the starting position of EUR0.7 billion, you end
up with what is reported, EUR1.5 billion of cash at the end of the period.
Now let me end this short introduction on the results with a few comments on the
investment portfolio. The fair value of our investment portfolio increased significantly to
EUR63.5 billion, and was supported by higher unrealized gains on fixed income.
Unrealized gain on our fixed income book increased from EUR600 million at the end of
December to EUR2.3 billion at the end of June.

The most significant news with respect to the investment portfolio is the announcement
this morning that Ageas will further diversify its investment portfolio by allocating up to 5%
of the invested assets into corporate loans, which means roughly EUR3 billion in total.

FINAL

We see this asset class as an interesting alternative in the current low interest
environment. It has the benefit of allowing us to create greater portfolio diversification,
and offers an attractive risk return profile.
In this context, Ageas concluded the partnership with Natixis to invest the main part of the
foreseen EUR3 billion in infrastructure loan. For more details, I would refer you to the
separate press release issued this morning and, of course, I'm ready to take your
question on this topic during the Q&A session.
Ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to end my intervention here and hand over to Frank.

Frank Vandenborre

{BIO 15168443 <GO>}

Thank you, Christophe. Ladies and gentlemen. this concludes the short introduction, as we
would like to leave enough time for questions.

Bloomberg Transcript

As usual, may we ask to limit yourself to three questions and to go back in the row if you
would have more. Operator?

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Farooq Hanif, Morgan Stanley.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Just three questions. Firstly, clearly, one of the biggest drivers in your results has been the
Non-Life and strong improvement in combined ratio. You've been talking about
Workmen's Compensation, Household, Fire issues for a while affecting the combined
ratio, but it looks like these have improved a lot. Can you tell us that the worst is now
behind us and that these improvements are sustainable? That's question one.
Question number two is on the yield that you're making on your investment portfolio
versus the guarantees. Could you remind us again what the position is versus the onaverage yield that you're making versus guarantees on traditional business, but also what
actions you're able to take in the products to protect yourself against low yields?
And secondly -- sorry, lastly, on the corporate loan portfolio, what is the Solvency II
treatment, in your view, of this portfolio, given its long duration, but also, given its
collateral, and what kind of duration are you talking about?

Page 6 of 31



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2012-08-06

Also, connected to that, is Natixis essentially doing the underwriting of this? Thank you,
very much.

FINAL

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

The first question, Non-Life, indeed, what we see is that in all product lines, combined
ratios are improving, which is the result of actions taken in the past, be it increase of rates
or changes in underwriting.
There has been -- there is still, I would say, some prudency needed, primarily in the Fire
product line, where okay, if you look half year on half year, the impact of weather-related
results is somewhat comparable. But in the meantime, by the price increases we
introduced, this has, of course, been covered by these higher rates.
If you look to the -- because the question if it's not explicitly in your question, that certainly
will come later on, is that we have in prior year releases, as you can see, an impact of
4.8% compared to 4.2% last year in the first half of the year, so there's slight increase. But
if you look to Belgium and Continental Europe, it's really almost flat.

Bloomberg Transcript

The big change comes from the UK, where we had last year a strengthening of the prior
year results at 1.7%, and this year, we have a release of 1.5%. So there's not being
unnatural. We believe that we are on the right track. Of course, we are aware of the fact
that this result asks for confirmation.
If we look to maybe portfolios that are less in the focus, like Italy, Portugal, we see that we
have been reducing combined from around or above 100% to more the area of 85% to
90% and this is, on the one hand also, by pruning a portfolio. It's also by improving the
segmentation and the huge success in Portugal of Medisch[ph], which is standard in the
market.
So I would say a positive outlook, but still some further work to do in Fire.
And your second -- sorry.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Sorry. I was about to say just on that subject, clearly you're heading for beating your 100%
combined ratio target quite strongly. Do you think that's a good comment -- a fair
comment?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Every quarter, you have the seasonal effect, so overall, the Second Quarter tends to be
better than the first and the fourth. We stick today to this being under 100% combined
ratio structurally, which means that, if we want to be structurally under 100%, we need to
be -- quarter after quarter try to be lower than 100%. But we did not change, at this stage,
structurally our target.

Page 7 of 31



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2012-08-06

If you then go to question two, return versus guaranteed rate, of course, one of the more
important volumes of guarantees business is in Belgium where you can say that the
guaranteed rate is somewhere in the area of 2.9%; income based, above 4%. So you
could say we still had, in the first half of the year, an investment margin of 90 basis points.
If we look to Continental Europe, for instance, Portugal, it's similar.

FINAL

Kurt, so you have the question more on measures taken against threats for the future?

A - Kurt De Schepper

{BIO 6240700 <GO>}

Yes. I think one of the major problems we potentially could have, moving forward in time,
is that there would be a significant rate increase, compared to the current low interest
rate environment. That is being taken care of in our different products by putting
adequate protection mechanisms in.
As to the immediate action and the immediate situation to the return environment, AG
Insurance has just decided to decrease its yield as of August 1 and, of course, we will be
following up on that very, very closely, just as we do in other areas.

Bloomberg Transcript

The question you had on the corporate loan portfolio, it's a bit complex question because
you know that, under Solvency II, all rules have not yet been established completely. Just
as for corporate bonds, it depends on duration and rating that we will have.
We expect a duration of something like five to seven years, and a good approximation
would be to look at the treatment of real estate, which would be more or less
penalizing[ph] and the corporate bonds, the classical corporate bond portfolio in your
mind. I hope this answers your question on Solvency II and on the yield.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

On the duration, maybe you could be surprised by the five to seven years. The starting
contracts are longer, but you have some repayment, so all in all, the duration is around, as
Kurt said, five to seven years.

A - Kurt De Schepper

{BIO 6240700 <GO>}

Yes, and let's not forget that in our accounting, this will be treated as amortized costs.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Yes, and in terms of the underwriting and the underlying loans, are you depending pretty
much on Natixis for that, or what kind of control do you have over quality?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

So okay, let me answer this question. So for the underwriting, we rely on Natixis, which is a
well-known actor on this sector. So we will benefit from all the underwriting process of the
Bank.

Page 8 of 31



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2012-08-06

FINAL

On the top of this, we have put some additional filters and then, at last, we can refuse
one deal for good reason, but the straight answer is that we rely on the underwriting
process of the Bank. And the alignment of interest[ph] was one of the main issues we had
when negotiating this contract. And we are on a quarter share approach, so it means that
we share risk. So if we are very profitable, it means that the Bank is very profitable. If we
have losses, it means that the Bank has losses as well. So we have alignment of interest
and we rely on the partnership.
Beside this, we will hire a team to gain skills in this new asset class. But the partnership is a
good way to accelerate the acquisition of skills.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay, thank you very, very much.

Operator
Benoit Petrarque, Kepler.

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

I have actually two or three questions as well. The first one on Natixis, what kind of yield
are you looking for currently, please?

Bloomberg Transcript

And I was wondering why you have not done that with BNP, obviously, because this is a
partner you know extremely well.
And also, on Natixis, are you limiting yourself to infra[ph] or are you going to maybe go for
other sectors over time?
And then a question on Belgium. I found the Life result in Q2 quite weak. Is there any oneoffs in that?
And looking at the guaranteed rate over Q2, and you've just mentioned that you will
decrease it, but now looking at Belgium yield for the 10 year it's around 2.5%. So on the
new production, you have a very tiny spread versus Belgian bonds. And you just
mentioned your 300bps[ph]. But is that something that will come down? Or what are you
looking for there? Thanks.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

I will start with the question related to the partnership with Natixis. So first, why
infrastructure and is it limited to infrastructure? The answer is yes, as a start we will limit
the partnership to infrastructure.
And why did we make this choice? Because we considered that, as we are beginners, we
don't have much skills in corporate loans before. But it was the safer sub-asset class. Why

Page 9 of 31



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2012-08-06

is that? Because when you underwrite infrastructure of[ph] corporate loans, you always
have very tangible collaterals.

FINAL

And with the partnership, we will be part of the contract; we will be at the same level as
the Bank. So it means that we will have direct access to the collateral, pari passu, with the
Bank. So that's the reason why we start with infrastructure.
In the future, with more skills and being more familiar with this asset class, we can expand
to other sub-asset classes.
Regarding the yield now, with infrastructure the yield will be -- you know that
corporate[ph] loans are denominated with variable interest. So the starting point will be
roughly EURIBOR six months plus 300bps, so it means that it's a variable rate.
You know that insurers are not very keen on having variable rates, so part of this may be
swapped to fixed rate for higher all-in-all yield. But to be clear and transparent, we will
keep a portion of this with floating rates, because we think it's a good hedge for inflation
and potential future interest rate increases.

Bloomberg Transcript

And the last part of the question, as why we didn't choose[ph] BNP Paribas. You know we
did an RSP[ph]. And a lot of the banks answered to the RSP and the winner was Natixis.
But we don't want to elaborate more on this; the winner was Natixis.
But there was quite a long list of insurers being interested in teaming up with us with this
partnership.

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

Sorry, just to finish on this subject, what kind of fees are you going to pay to Natixis?
Because is 300bps I understand. But is there a flat fee on the notional or something which
will come as a minus on this nice spread?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Okay, so I won't give you all the details, because this is not the public. But on the top of
the remuneration, that I indicated, EURIBOR plus 300bps, part of the fees will be shared
with us. But I don't want to be more precise on this. But we will have access to part of all
the fees related to the implementation of each deal, like arrangement fee plus
commitment fees. We will have access to part of it.

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

Okay, thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

So then Belgian Life, Q2 weak why, was the question. First of all, maybe important this that
it's quite difficult sometimes to judge the Life result quarter on quarter. We try to manage
Page 10 of 31



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2012-08-06

it on a yearly basis. We already said in the past also, for instance, profit sharing is an
important element. And that's all finally decided at the end of the year.

FINAL

But in short, what you can say is that we had more capital gains in Q1, and mainly on
bonds. Also part a consequence of the restructuring of the portfolio with a further exit
from the peripherals. We have had a higher net impact of impairments.
And the consequence of the difference compared to last year in gains and losses is that
the tax treatment is quite different. So capital gains on loans are taxed; capital gains on
equities are not. So this is, if you look to the difference between technical results,
operating margin and net results, something you will see.
And besides that, we don't have other major incidentals in Q2. So it's mainly capital gains,
losses, and the tax impact.

Bloomberg Transcript

The last question was about the guaranteed rate. So the guaranteed rate is now down to
2%, which is, we are aware, is a bit sharp for new business. But on the other hand, we also
stay careful to keep the commercial franchise active, in order to avoid that one day you
really have to relaunch from zero the whole machinery.
But, of course, the current environment makes that we have to be extremely alert in the
pricing of the new products. And this is, for instance, in some of the areas that I have, for
example, given in my speech, the reason why in Portugal we almost reduce our activities
in savings to zero in order not to go into a capital-intensive business with a very low
margin.

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

All right, that's clear. Thank you, very much.

Operator
Albert Ploegh, ING.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Three questions from my side; first one to start with, the share buyback announcement.
Can you give a bit of thinking behind your decision to go for EUR200 million program this
time, especially in relation to the EUR400 million cash settlement with ABN AMRO? And
also, given that share price today is quite higher amount, therefore, compared to the last
share buyback announcements, so could I have a bit of feeling there?
The second question is on Tesco; I saw there was EUR800 million contribution. What are
your expectations there for the second half ? Is this somewhat actually at[ph] a high level,
or do you believe this is quite sustainable? Over the weekend, Tesco also announced a
move into mortgages. Is there any business opportunity for Ageas attached to that?

Page 11 of 31



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2012-08-06

Finally on AKSigorta in Turkey, I saw you increased the stake from 31% to 36%. Can you
maybe disclose what the financial impact of that has been, or if any? Many thanks.

FINAL

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. The share buyback, we know this is a topic of high interest for you all and for the
markets. What we did is we made an assessment of the situation, as we try to do every
time when we are in a change in the cash position. So with receiving the EUR400 million
from ABN AMRO for settlement, we came to a cash position of EUR1.5 billion.
We stay in our scheme where we say, okay, the cash we have, the priorities to use it is, in
the first place, to help grow the business. Secondly, to give it back to shareholders, and
three, to buy back debt. We are not, at the moment, where we see an enormous amount,
or number, or cases of files where we could, inorganically, extend the business at this
moment.

Bloomberg Transcript

There may be some opportunities in the market, but it's not that we are aiming for a very
big transactional operation. And so the cash position has been one of the highest since
the restart of the Company, if we take out, of course, the cash that we could not use, like
the one for the Q1.
We then said, okay, this settlement with ABN AMRO, somewhere is also a kind of partial
compensation for the MCS conversion that took place in December 2010, where we, at
that moment, had to issue some 107 million shares. So we said, okay, this as a good
opportunity to try to work away the dilution that we had at that moment. Then you can
say, okay, an amount of EUR200 million should be sufficient to compensate that.
Of course, at a share price of, let's say last Friday, the return to be achieved is not exactly
as high as the one we had a year ago, but nevertheless -- and there you can discuss, of
course, whether you relate to book value, or fair value, or intrinsic value, whatever you
want. We, in any case, believe that even at today's share price, or Friday's share price,
there is enough important discount to the intrinsic value of the Company, in order to
justify such an investment.
The second question you had was about Tesco. You mentioned the amount of EUR800
million, but I think at H1 we see EUR386 million compared to EUR359 million last year, so
there's been an increase. Don't forget that, in the first year, it was a kind of reunderwriting of clients of Tesco that were, in the previous years, insured[ph] at RBS. So
what we see is that there is an increase and that this -- in two product lines it's in Motor
and Household. In terms of result, last year it was break-even; this year we have EUR8
million net result, and our ambition, this year, clearly to reach an internal rate of return of
12%.
The announcement of Tesco to go in the mortgage market, let's say the more mortgages
they do, the more there should also be potential for Household, so this certainly could
benefit the Tesco underwriting. We must say after bit less than two years, our assessment
evaluation of the Tesco underwriting deal is a very positive one, in terms of top line,
bottom line, but also in terms of what has been achieved operationally. From scratch, to

set up a company, having more than 2 million contracts under management, is a nice
performance.
Finally Turkey, the take up to 36%, somewhere it's not a real material impact. And in line
with the earlier announcement we made to jointly buy up to 10% has reached 5%. I'm a bit
sorry, but we cannot say a lot more because AKSigorta still needs to report its result. As
you know, they are a listed company and we will try and -- there is an agreement to align,
as of next years, the quarterly closings in order to align them more with our quarterly

Two follow-up questions and one new question. With respect to the investment returns,
could you give some feeling what, in basis points, the investment return on average
moved compared to first half of last year?
Second follow-up on Benoit asking in respect of new business. To put it in different way,
are you still making 90 basis points on the new business? Also, the margins will remain flat
compared to the existing business?
Lastly on inflows in Belgium, which are up quite strongly in the Second Quarter in Life.
Could you give some feeling on the specific marketing, measures you have been taking,
and what's the expectations, going forward for, let's say, the next few months?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Maybe on the investment return, we told you that it was up[ph] 90 basis point this year.
Last year, it was much lower; I am reading on my schedule, but it was 49%. But you have
to keep in mind that, last year, we had the Greek impairment, and that hit the Life sector,
so it is better this year. But due to the fact that we have not the loss we experienced last
year, you will remember that we start the impairment in Q2 of 2011, even though the main
hit was booked in Q3.
Then on the new business, we cannot say that the margin is at 90%. Now this is on the
portfolio, that's obvious, but margin is much lower when you consider the Belgian rate at, I
don't know, 2.6%. At this very moment the new business, the margin is much lower
without giving you more detail, but that's the situation.

FINAL

And that's maybe also the link to the third question on the Q2. So each time we reduce
interest rate, and this has been done sometimes over the past quarters, to come from
such a moment in time from 3% to 2.75%, 2.50% and now to go to 2%. Each time you
announce a reduction of your rate, you have a pumping up of production, certainly in the
Bank Channel.
Also important to know that, in a number of products, we also included the new charge on
the funds under management, which is about 30 basis points, if I remember well. So it
means that part of your interest rate, or your margin loss, is compensated by an
increased charge on the funds under management products. But the expectations, going
forward, I would say that we certainly will not go for whatever top line volumes in the main
markets. In Portugal, as mentioned, it always been reduced where we primarily invest in
risk insurance in non-life and in unit link.
If you look at our Luxembourg venture, it's 70% unit link. Also in France, we have a relative
high proportion of unit link compared to the market. And in Belgium, okay, we
unfortunately do not have the expected unit link volumes, but we will be very cautious in
the area of the guaranteed business.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Coming back on the investment return, I'm talking not about the margin you're making
compared to last year because I understand the quarterly[ph] impairments are in there,
but more purely, let's say, the absolute investment yields you are making this year
compared to last year, could you give us some feeling of what's happening there?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

On the investment return, we are slightly below 4% all in all.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

And how was it last year?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

I think we have some 12 basis points less than last year.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Q - Robin Buckley

{BIO 3596512 <GO>}

Just a couple of questions, if I could, please? First of all, just in terms of the General
Account, I know you've announced the buyback today of EUR200 million; you've still got
EUR1.3 billion of net cash sitting in there. So I guess it's just a question of what you see as
the natural level of net cash that you would like to run with?
And you've highlighted previously that you have used, perhaps, a third of cash that you've
had to buy back debt, to buy back equity and to do M&A. Should we sort of being thinking
that this one-third, one-third, one-third approach as something that you will continue to
use into the future? That's the first question
Then my second question is just coming back to the Belgian Life result, as you've pointed
out there were quite a few impairments in the numbers last year and it changes in terms
of realized gains. So what I was wanting was just a breakdown of what the impairments
were in the first half of last year, the impact to the net result, and what the gains were last
year, and then comparable figures for this year? And that's it. Thank you, very much.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. On the buyback, so we will indeed end up with EUR1.3 billion. If you look, I think it's
on page 50 of the presentation that's been provided to you, you see a quarterly
evolution of the net cash position, and you could say that overall, since 2009, the average
has been around EUR900 million, so we are at EUR1.3 billion. Don't forget that we are still
in not normal period, so keeping some prudency level is certainly something we will not
exclude.
Don't forget also that we still have this remaining CASHES, so the floor's been adapted to
some EUR170 million. So in case that would happen, something in that area, we will need
the cash for that, but we remain, nevertheless, open to look at opportunities to expand
the business.
If you look then to slide 52, there you have an overview; it has been used in the past
years.
You can say that we have invested EUR740 million to invest in business, EUR740 million to
return to debt holders, that's the EMTN program that -- there's still some EUR200 million
outstanding, and that we have invested until today EUR850 -- or returned EUR850 million
to shareholders. And with the additional buyback announcement, this will be over EUR1
billion, EUR1.050 billion.
So you could say the one-third, one-third, one-third split is a bit changed in favor of the
return to shareholders.

On the capital gain and impairment, I can take that. So these are the precise figures; if you
take this year for the first six months of 2012, so the year to date, the amount of capital
gain is EUR95 million, impairment EUR65 million, and the net is EUR30 million. So the net
impact capital gain impairment on this is EUR30 million.
Then if you take last year, and that to compare with, we had a capital gain of EUR40
million, the impairment were at EUR174 million, out of which you had the EUR150 million on
Greece, but are reported in the press release. And all in all, you have the total -- the total
is the plus EUR40 million minus the EUR174 million.

Q - Robin Buckley

{BIO 3596512 <GO>}

Okay. I'm sorry was that within the Belgium business, was that for the total --?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

For the Belgium business, last year's net impact of gains and losses was EUR10 million in
the first half, and this year it's EUR9 million, so it's really flat.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

On Belgium, yes, completely flat. I was giving the figures for all the Insurance operations.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

For all the Insurance operations, it was EUR60 million[ph] net last year and EUR30
million[ph] this year, so the difference between last year and this year is EUR40 million[ph]
and net impact have better impact of capital gains and losses.

Q - Robin Buckley

{BIO 3596512 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. And just coming back to you on --

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Excluding Greece, sorry, excluding Greece, so if you take out Greece.

Q - Robin Buckley

{BIO 3596512 <GO>}

Okay. And just coming back to you on the first question, you mentioned the EUR900
million as being the average cash within the General Account, should we be sort of seeing
this as a run rate going forward, is that why you drew attention to it?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Let's say an average is an average, so it means that you hardly are[ph] on average on the
average. And we believe that we are still in a period that is a very turbulent one, where on
the one hand, there can come up a number of important challenges, but maybe also a
number of interesting opportunities.

Page 16 of 31



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V

FINAL

The challenges are, of course, much more on the side of what could happen with the
eurozone and the potential, you never know, impacting one of the operations where we
are. There could be a call for capital, or it could also be that we're somewhere wanting
one of the existing businesses grow more than average.
The opportunities are that, in this turbulent environment, there may be extreme
opportunities to invest in business at discounted prices that could create a return far
above the 11% that we targeted.

Q - Robin Buckley

{BIO 3596512 <GO>}

Okay, that's great.

Francois Boissin, Exane BNP Paribas.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Three questions, please. The first on the FRESH can you just remind us how you see the
FRESH. It's EUR1.25 billion nominal, is it basically included within the Insurance solvency; do
you feel that you need this capital; and have you, basically, envisaged to hedge against a
rising EURIBOR to try and protect the value of the FRESH within your balance sheet?
Second the question was on Royal Park Investment. I think in Q2 you booked EUR38 million
negative, can you give a bit more color on this?
And the third question was on Belgium; can you give us the market share that you get on
flows for Life products? I think you mentioned that the market share on the AUM, but
what's the market share on the flows? Would you consider reducing significantly your
business there like you did in Portugal?
And lastly, you mentioned that you are now starting to charge a fee on AUM on Life; is this
on the old products, or is this on new production and what kind of AUM are we talking
about here? Thank you.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

I can start with the FRESH; so on the FRESH as already mentioned by Bart, you know our
priority first, let's say, reshape or change a little bit the scope of the Group.

Page 17 of 31



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2012-08-06

FINAL

The second priority is to pay a nice dividend or to do buybacks. The third one is the
liability management, so it means that it is third on the list of our priority, the liability
management.
It is true that the FRESH trade at a low level, but for us it's cheap, it's a cheap instrument,
EURIBOR plus 130bp, with our very special situation, the financial market are closed[ph],
so we have to be very cautious about reducing our financing tools. So really there is
absolute no priority in doing any kind of operation on the FRESH, so I would say we keep
them as they are.
Regarding the hedge, you are perfectly right, it's a variable instrument, so we may
consider hedging the risk of increasing the interest rate. That will be studied in the future,
but we have no precise plan at this moment.
But for the FRESH --

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

And just a follow up on the FRESH in terms of solvency, how is this treated, is this part of
the 211% solvency ratio, or --?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The FRESH are not included in the solvency of Insurance.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

So it's within the Group solvency?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Okay, thank you, and on --

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Yes, on RPI you're right that the result after six months is lower than the one we disclosed
after three months, so you are right, there is a small loss of EUR38 million booked for Q2.
We had the mark to market valuation, but the portfolio is slightly lower than the one that
we had at the end of March. And then, to be a little bit more specific, there is some
Spanish instruments whose market value has come down a bit. So we have some Spanish
exposure in the RPI portfolio, and it's the reason why we have this adjustment, without any
real credit impact[ph], but mark to market adjustment only so far.

A - Bart De Smet

Page 18 of 31



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V

And then the third question, so in Belgium, the market share is stable in terms of assets
under management, so funds under management.

FINAL

It's decreasing slightly in new inflow, so it could indicate that maybe a number of other
players are a bit more aggressive in pricing. If you look in the guaranteed business, we
have a decrease where the market has an increase of a double digit, above 10%.
In Portugal, you can say exactly the same. There even market share in funds under
management is increasing, while market share in inflow is decrease. So it shows, on the
one hand, that we are certainly less aggressive than the average of the market in pricing
of new volumes.
But that we fortunately, and that's for the overall business, that's of course, matched
against investments from the past, that we have not that many cancellations, lapses. So
from that point of view the story[ph] is under control.
The fees on the assets under management I referred to, is of course, only for new
business, because the problem of the lower rates are mainly, at this stage, a problem for
the new business, and that's in the Broker Channel.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So basically, you're charging 30 basis points fees on new products, sold through the
Broker Channel, right?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Yes, we of course, cannot do it on the whole[ph] portfolio.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Sure, and has this become a market practice in Belgium, or are you the only one doing
this?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

We are, in any case, the first ones doing this, and we don't have a clear view on a lot of
other players doing the same.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Okay. And are clients willing to pay this fee, or have you had push back on this?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

One of the reasons why, also, our growth in this segment is behind the one the market,
but again that's about making choices in the conditions you want to offer in the market, at
this stage.

FINAL

William Elderkin, Soc Gen.

Q - William Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

I've got three questions. First of all, can you tell us what the return on investment is, in the
Second Quarter, for that EUR740 million of shareholders' cash you've invested in buying
businesses, over the last couple of years?
Secondly, we've had a lot of numbers in terms of the Belgian Life business. I think I might
have got it confused; can you just recap in terms of what the average guaranteed rate is,
on the in-force Belgian portfolio, and compare that with the average book yield on that
Belgian portfolio? And also, if you could tell us what the asset duration of that portfolio is?
And then secondly, in terms of the Belgian new business, what the guaranteed rate you're
offering is, and also what the investment rate you're achieving on new money coming in
the door. And also, where you're investing that new money.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then finally, you mentioned in the press release to do with the Natixis deal, that they'll
be taking a substantial proportion of any new loans. Can you just give a sense of what
substantial might mean?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

I'd like to reflect two minutes, if I'm permitted, on the first question, because it's not -- it's
a very broad one. I will take, first of all, the second one.
The guaranteed rate on the Belgian book is 2.92%[ph]. Duration is eight to 10 years, but
it's a combination of a number of investment products that are more eight years -- up to
eight years, and then the longer products to retirement, that can be much longer.
New rates, as already mentioned, for this business are, as of August 1, 2%. We still have,
of course, an offer at 0%, but 2% is the maximum we offer in individual life, which is in line
with markets.
And the investment yields that we count to achieve on this new money is, of course, a
combination of sovereign debt, but also corporate and new infrastructure loans and a bit
on equities, is about new money, 3.9%.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Maybe on the substantial part that you were referring to, you know that this is not a public
figure. We didn't disclose this figure in the press release. Substantial means that, I don't
Page 20 of 31



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2012-08-06

FINAL

know, it is above one-fourth or one-third, but you will permit me not to be more precise.
But substantial means that the alignment of interest is ensured in this deal, and that was
our main concern, to assure alignment of interest, which implies that the Bank still holds a
significant part of the deal. And maybe to give additional details on this, in case the Bank
buys protection or sell below, or do whatever action leading to a decrease of each share,
had the right to follow them[ph] and to reduce. And we will maintain the same exposure
as theirs, so once to ensure the alignment of interest.
That was clearly one of the big topic of the discussion, alignment of interest.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay then, maybe go back on the first question, and I cannot give you, by heart, the
numbers, because it is something that we assess on a yearly base. And also, when we
invest new business, we always target to achieve the 11% return, after a certain limited
number of years.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we look to -- an important part of the acquisitions have been in the UK. If you look to
Tesco, as mentioned, EUR8 million net profit in H1, and if we extrapolate that result, we
also look to what are still our budgets for the coming years, we believe that an IRR close
to the expectations of 12% is achievable.
If we then look to the second part of the acquisitions in the UK, which were more in the
retail area, Castle Cover and Kwik-Fit, the result is known, some EUR7.5 million lower than
last year. But last year, there was a one-off positive in it. And we have a tough
environment where we see that, Q2 economic recession, clients chase even more than
before, for the best price.
Some direct insurers that are a bit put in the window to be sold have been quite
aggressive, over the last quarters, so that impacts a bit, not the income, but more the
results.
Then we go to Italy, where Non-Life is doing very good; as mentioned, the combined ratio
in Continental Europe is at 88.5%, so it puts all the attention on reducing combined. And
then we come from above 100% there, so in Italy, as in Turkey, so these combineds go
down.
Within Turkey, nice inflow growth, but also we are only one year busy there. Where in Italy,
growth has not been until now, what we expected, but we are now at a moment where
we start distribution also, with other channels, and UBI Banca, namely BNL and other Italian
banks.
So we believe that, if we look back at all these investments, after each time, three years,
we will have an acceptable performance in these areas.

Q - William Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Could I just come back on that last one/ Is the contribution over the first half, from Italy
and Turkey, single digits, double digits? Can you put any number in terms of what you
think the impact is that you can see in the income statement?

FINAL

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

For Turkey, as already mentioned, we cannot disclose further details, because AKSigorta
has not announced its results yet. It will be mid August. So the only thing we can say there
is that, in terms of commercial evolution, it goes in the direction we expected.
And in terms of impact on the combined ratio, in a market that is maybe where
improvements are needed, we really go in the right direction.
The combination of Turkey and Italy is above EUR10 million, in net result in the first half, if
that is --

Q - William Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That's very helpful. But what I'm getting at is, if you achieve your 11% IRR on that EUR740
million, you're talking about EUR80 million a year of net profit. My impression is you're
currently running about half that run rate.
So if we just look at -- I'm just thinking in terms of earnings forecast, if we look at the
current run rate of profit, assuming you achieve what you're setting out to achieve, could
there be another EUR40 million in annual run rate profit, as those acquisitions hit target
levels of return?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

And correct, what I said the EUR10 million is what we expect, on an annual base, for
Turkey and Italy. These are two entities where we believe that the potential for growth
and profitable growth is important, and where we invested, taking account the future
potentials.
So like in Turkey, after one year making the final balance is a bit too early. And Italy, we, in
the first stage, tried to, and achieved I would say, to really correct[ph] profitability, and
now we are at the stage where we can think about growing the business.

Q - William Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Am I right in thinking that, assuming you achieve the targets on these acquisitions, there is
quite a material uplift to your run rate profitability, assuming you do what you set out to
do, from where we are at the moment?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. Our intention is everywhere to achieve this 11%, to have meaningful contributions.
Of course, you can discuss what meaningful is, but at this stage, the portfolio we have
Page 22 of 31



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V

chosen, where we believe there is potential for a contribution of multiple times EUR10
million in the coming years.

FINAL

Okay, thank you.

Operator
Matthias De Wit, Petercam.

Q - Matthias De Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Three questions from my part. First is on the inflows. Could you shed some light on the
organic growth rates you witnessed during the Second Quarter, excluding scope changes
and foreign exchange impact?
Then second, to come back on the low interest rate environment, you mentioned an eight
to 10-year average duration of the liability of the assets in Belgium. How does this
compare to the liability duration there? And do you, in other words, expect to see any
pressure on the in-force profitability in case of a prolonged low interest rate environment?

Bloomberg Transcript

And could you, finally, update us on the economic cap or position of the Group following
the recent drop in the rates we've seen? You once provided a Solvency II MCR; I
wondered how this ratio evolved in the meanwhile. Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay, I think we don't have exactly one figure at hand for your first question. What you can
see is that, in Non-Life, we have been growing organically in Belgium, in the UK, in
Portugal, in Malaysia, in Thailand, in Turkey, so in Italy slightly. So in all markets, we grew
organically. Of course, you could say, compared to last year, Turkey was not in, so that was
an acquisition.
The difference is primarily in the Life business, where, of course, the contribution of the
non-consolidated entities like Luxembourg, the four Asian joint ventures is important,
where it's clear that, as the press release also, and also my intervention at the beginning
mentioned, we have a decrease in Life in Portugal and in France. But that's for the reason
of not willing to compete with high-rated banking products. And in Belgium, we have
progress.
So you could say in Life, there is certainly a big part in the increase of inflow due to the
non-consolidated entities.
In Non-Life, I think it's a fair organic growth, which is a combination, on the one hand, of
still price increases, and the continuation of the program launched last year and the
beginning of this year.

Page 23 of 31



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2012-08-06

But besides that also, an increase of market share that we have in as well Belgium, as
Portugal, as UK. So you could say -- I'm looking to let's say the impact in the inflow of the
scope changes that are mainly Luxembourg and Turkey. And the foreign exchange impact,
you could say some EUR1.4 billion on the inflow.

FINAL

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Well, what we can say regarding the inflow is that we have some uncertainties about the
second half of the year, due to the fact that we could have seen acceleration in the first
six months, due to the decrease in guaranteed interest, leading the customers to speed
up their investment, and to get the minimum guaranteed rate. So maybe there will be a
slowdown in the second half of the year.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Perhaps on the duration, Kurt?

A - Kurt De Schepper

{BIO 6240700 <GO>}

On the duration, you have to remember that we've always said that we, particularly in
Belgium, we were looking for a good deal, and matching some duration of both assets
and liability portfolio are pretty hedged.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So there is few reinvestment risks.

A - Kurt De Schepper

{BIO 6240700 <GO>}

Okay. On the economic capital evolution, we have not disclosed any elements thereby, I
can give you the following guidance.
If you look at our embedded value calculations which we published at year end, you would
find in there that for a interest rate swap[ph] of 100 basis points downwards that the
value would come downwards something like 19%; that differs from entity to another.
Now if you look at the swap rates at the beginning of the year, the first two quarters were
down about 40 basis point. Since over the month of July, there's another 20 basis points
that came out of it.
So you could estimate that there is, indeed, a significant impact, let's say something like
10% of the economic capital, which was, as you remember, very satisfying. So we do not
expect any problems from that side.

Q - Matthias De Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Then to come back on the MCV[ph] sensitivity. If your book is well matched and the
guarantees are hedged, what is explaining the sensitivity to the lower yields then?

FINAL

It was the -- well, if you look at them, you'll see how the duration[ph] here are not
matched all entities at the same level. You remember that, in Asia, we've said that the
duration of the assets is lower than the duration of the liabilities. And, of course, even if
you're matched, you still have some reinvestment risk in your portfolios. And that was
what weighs on the valuation of the embedded value.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

The answer on the almost perfect matching was primarily Belgium and Portugal. And,
indeed in Asia, you have not the same durations of assets as you have from your liabilities.

Q - Matthias De Wit

Okay, very clear. Thank you.

The first questions is on the excess cash position again, two things there. First of all, you
pointed out that the macro environment is still uncertain, and that you don't know whether
you will be required to potentially inject some capital in one of your units, if something
goes wrong in peripheral Europe.
In that respect, can you talk about your commitment to the Portuguese joint venture that
you have? To what extent are you willing to inject extra[ph] capital if necessary?
Secondly, on the excess cash position, you didn't mention, as a risk, legal cases. How do
you see your excess capital position in relation to the legal cases that are currently going
on?
And final question is on the reserve releases seen in Non-Life, can you give the reserve
releases on a Q2 basis versus Q2 basis, please? Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

The first point, commitment in Portugal; like always, in our partnerships we have a
continuous dialog amongst partners. We have a commitment from both sides to help the
entity, Millenniumbcp-Ageas, with its solvency position if needed.
But just to remind you at this moment, the IFRS solvency in our Portuguese JV went up to
267% end of June. And on a local solvency base, the solvency ratio is 221%. So there is no
need at this moment to inject any capital.

Don't forget also that with the deliberate choice to strongly reduce the new business'
savings that this will, instead of increase the required capital, it will decrease the required
capital.

FINAL

So the main business we are doing is unit link, capital rights[ph] and Non-Life. So this is
something that is really reducing the potential intervention in Portugal.
I will maybe take the reserve releases in Q2 and then hand over to Kurt for the legal
cases.
Reserve releases in Q2, some comparative figures; on an Ageas level, it was 4.1%, where
it was 5% in 2011. Belgium is 7.8% compared to 7.3% in Q2, 2011. And UK, there was a
release of 1.3% in Q2 this year, while last year there was a strengthening of 0.3%. So the
delta is there, 1.6% compared to last year.

A - Kurt De Schepper

{BIO 6240700 <GO>}

As for the legal cases, you'll remember that we've said in the past that the available cash
indeed allowed us to look, with some additional comfort, to those legal cases.

Bloomberg Transcript

But basically, we have said, and keep on saying, that we think that we will not have to
indemnify, and that we are in discussions at the level of the current ongoing litigations for
those where there was a judgment that they have appealed that judgment. So there is no
specific need to put an amount there.

Q - Michael Van Wegen

{BIO 6435238 <GO>}

I assume that, in your thinking, even though you think you do not have to compensate, you
do not like to run the business as you don't keep any money specifically to the side for
that. So in your thinking, what kind of buffer do you feel you want to keep just in case
these legal cases do not come out the way you hope them to come out?

A - Kurt De Schepper

{BIO 6240700 <GO>}

As I said, we get some comfort, but we do not have quantified any buffer around that
amount.

Q - Michael Van Wegen

{BIO 6435238 <GO>}

Okay.

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

First of all, as you're returning to a normal capital management strategy, can you just
update us briefly on your thinking about interim dividends, which you obviously haven't
Page 26 of 31



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2012-08-06

restored today; just give us some thoughts on that?

FINAL

Secondly, on the numbers front, at the First Quarter you were talking about nominal[ph]
Insurance results of EUR120 million to EUR125 million. It seems that if we adjust for the
funnies in the first half, we're at about EUR280 million, so we're well ahead of that. Does
that tell us that the first half has been unusually good, or does it tell us that you might
want to increase the EUR120 million to EUR125 million?
And then finally, could you just give us a bit of an update on your strategic thinking about
the BNP call option and whether the fact that the market value or your fair value attributed
to that has fallen to a much lower level, whether that improves or, in some way, hurts the
strategic flexibility you have with that security? Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. The first point, so I think we took the decision in 2009 to announce the dividend
policy of 40% to 50% of the Insurance results, something that, for the first three years, I
think, we realized even on 2011 with an Insurance result that was negative. We decided to,
nevertheless, pay a dividend in line with the dividend policy.

Bloomberg Transcript

On top of that, we have twice had this buyback program. So I believe, at this moment,
although we can be very happy with the results middle of the year, we are confident that
we can continue on that road for the remainder of the year. We do not think about going
to interim dividends, because there is still a lot that can happen in the environment in the
course of this year.
Remember also that if there would be, and that's restating[ph] on the question that
Christophe will reply on the BNP options, that if one day there would be an outcome of
that instrument, we will recommit it and we are obliged to pay it immediately to the
shareholders. So there is no real decision taken, nor even option looked at to go for an
interim dividend.
The second question, the normalization of the results, maybe try to do it a bit the other
way around. We have now an Insurance result of EUR303 million. As mentioned earlier in
the call, you could say that the exception of the correction of the impairment of Greece
last year, that you could see some EUR50 million[ph] more net cap gains than last year.
And you have then a bit the exceptional element of reserve release in Asia, which was
due to an accounting change, which means that it's our opinion that somewhere -- a
normalized result of EUR280 million, so it's EUR303 million minus some EUR25 million, is a
fair level of H1.
We believe that we can continue on that road. We will, of course, do everything to keep
this combined ratio at the level it is and try to further reduce it, but that should be an
indication of what you could expect extrapolated on the yearly base for this year, of
course.

Christophe, the call option?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, on the call option, so you have seen on the press release that the value is rather
lower, now slightly above EUR100 million. It's one of the last legacy issues, but a matter of
concern.
We are studying all the different options. Basically, we have three possibilities; the first
one being to keep the call option until the end. I think that it's a dangerous stance
because we are so far from the exercise value, which is above EUR60, so it is not very
likely that at the exercise date, we will draw anything out of this.
We can sell it, but selling is not very easy; the number of potential clients is very limited.
Or, and last option, we can do some structuring to be able to distribute this kind of
SPV[ph] to the shareholders.
But one of the prerequisites to structure and to distribute is to find a market so that this
new vehicle be liquid, and that's another issue. So we are considering and working on the
two last options, and we will update you if we have anything substantial. But nothing to
report at this moment.

Q - Marcus Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Can I just ask, please, the former Fortis Banking Group, was that at all involved in
EURIBOR[ph] setting? And, if so, are you concerned about any potential litigation risk from
that?
And then secondly, just on thinking ahead again of capital management around the NITSH
securities, the proceeds have been on-lent to BNP Fortis Bank Belgium, what are your
expectations around repayment of those on-loans early next year, and what you would
look to do with those proceeds if they were repaid to you? Thank you.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

On the LIBOR, well, first, we are not very much exposed to the LIBOR. The only entity who
could consider such thing is RPI, because on RPI -- on both the asset side and on the
liability side, there is a lot of LIBOR everywhere, but at this moment, we are monitoring
the market and what the others do without being aggressive on this. We are listening to
the market, so nothing to report.

Q - Marcus Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Okay. Then, sorry, just to check, in terms of being a former owner of bank entities, which
may have been involved in EURIBOR setting, are you exposed there to potential litigation
risk against yourselves rather than actually you pursuing banks?

FINAL

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

We don't think so, but --

A - Kurt De Schepper

{BIO 6240700 <GO>}

Not that we are aware of.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Not that we are aware of, yes. So no concerns so far.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Second question, Christophe, on the NITSH being paid back[ph]?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Yes, on the NITSH, so you are right, but we are not far from the call date now, so as this
instrument has been on-lent, we are dependent to what the final holder will do. So if there
is no call, there is no question; there is nothing to do. If there is a call, we will consider as
whether we will call on our side, or we will find a way to reuse the proceeds in other part
of the Group.
Let's be aware of the fact that our financial flexibility is low, so for us, any instrument that
we are under liability is of great interest. So if we reimburse this, has been to be very well
considered.

Q - Marcus Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

It sounds as though, given the markets are so strained at the moment, for all insurers
really, that you'd be more leaning towards reusing the proceeds elsewhere in the Group.
Would that be fair?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

That's one of our options, to use[ph] the proceeds. But once again, in case there is a call,
at the end of the ring[ph].

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

And we learned not to anticipate on the fact that an instrument will be called or not, so we
investigate, of course, all possibilities. And I think we will have to wait more until the
beginning of next year is the (multiple speakers)

The call can be delayed in future years, so we are really on a waiting mode now.

FINAL

Operator
Gentlemen, there are no more questions. I will hand back to you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay, ladies and gentlemen. maybe some closing remarks. First of all, thank you for your
very good questions, as usual.
Let me summarize the main conclusions. First of all, as the whole of Ageas and with me,
the whole management team, we are very pleased with these results that prove that we
have been able, so far, to meet our promises and to realize a good performance in
market circumstances which remain difficult and uncertain.

Bloomberg Transcript

At the same time, substantial progress has been made in solving the outstanding
legacies, and this has definitely had an important impact on the perception of the
Company towards the outside world.
Secondly, the announcement of a share buyback program of up to EUR200 million proves
our determination to keep the focus on optimizing our capital levels with a view to
creating value for our shareholders. At the same time, we retain the flexibility to seize any
opportunities that may arise to strengthen or develop our Insurance operations.
And lastly, I would like to remind you that, as of tomorrow, you will see the result of the
simplification of our legal structure approved by our shareholders at the end of June.
The reverse stock split that was approved on the same day becomes effective as of
tomorrow and, as you know, this will divide the total number of outstanding shares by 10
and multiply the share price by 10.
Be aware that our stock ticker will change for a period of three days for practical reasons.
If you have any questions on this, please don't hesitate to call our IR team, and you can
also consult the extensive Q&A document which is available on a dedicated page on our
website.
These are, I believe, the most important messages I would like to convey to you today.
Thanks for your continued interest and support, and do not hesitate to contact our IR
team, should you have any outstanding questions.
