MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our Full Year Results. And as you know,
two announcements this morning. One about me giving the market and yourselves early
notice of the change at the end of the year and one about our financial results. And
because the change is not to the end of the year, I want to keep today very much as
business as usual. So we'll focus on the results and I'll hand over to Andy in a few minutes
to do that. Then I'll come back up and talk about the business generally and just fill you in
on some of the other developments in the business and give you my take on where we
are. And then, David and Ian and Andy will join me on stage to take Q&A as we normally
do these events.
I'm delighted to have some of our board here today, Sarah, Roger and Iain are here with
us today as our entire – pretty much our entire – I think there's one not here, he's on a
holiday – executive team. So we've got a pretty much a full house of the senior team here
today, but we're more than happy to continue the dialog after the presentations.
The agenda is up on the screen. Andy will do a résumé of the new business results that
we released on the 26th of January and then talk about the financial performance and
then I'll come back up.

So without further ado, please welcome your soon-to-be new Chief Executive Officer, but
currently the CFO because there's only room for one, Mr. Andrew Croft.

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Thank you, David, and morning, everyone. I'm not allowed to wear the yellow tie just yet,
but we'll get there. I'm going to start this morning with a recap of our January new
business announcement, followed by review of the EEV and cash results. You may be
relieved to know that I'm not going to spend any time on IFRS result, albeit there are a
number of slides at the back of your pack, should you want to look at them. I will then
cover solvency, and in particular I want to cover a change in presentation before finishing
on the dividend.
So let's look back at the January new business announcement. Total single investments at
£11.4 billion were up 23% over the year. And if we look at the analysis between the first
and the second half, you will note that growth accelerated over the year. This despite the
Brexit and Trump effects.

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, looking at just pensions business, you will see even higher growth and this
change in business mix has had an impact on the financial results as you will see later. Net
inflows was £6.8 billion, up 17%, and representing some 12% of opening funds under
management, which themselves ended the year at £75.3 billion, a new record and growth
of 28%.
We also provided an update on the size of the Partnership with the total number of
qualified advisers at the end of the year being 3,415, up 10%. This strong result has once
again exceeded our medium- to long-term target of 6% to 8% growth. And if we look
back over recent years, we will see the growth has consistently exceeded our target with
2016 being the fifth consecutive year of double-digit growth.
Now, whilst the investment in new advisers translates into an expense today, it is a major
lead indicator for future new business. Therefore, this 10% growth bodes well for 2017
and future years.
These new business, funds under management and adviser numbers are key drivers of
the financial performance. So let's look at the results starting with the familiar breakdown
of the EEV.
A few comments on the key highlights. New business contribution for the year was £520.2
million compared with £440.7 million. This is an increase of 18%, slightly lower than the
new business growth due to that change in business mix that I covered earlier. There was
a small positive experience variance of £1.4 million compared with the far more significant
prior year variance of £78.1 million, which you will recall reflected the value placed on
historic tax losses.
There was also a positive £18.6 million operating assumption change during the year
compared to a positive £44.1 million for 2015. The positive impact in both years principally
Page 2 of 22



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C
Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2017-02-28

relates to changes in pension retention assumptions, reflecting a continued positive
experience we are seeing. The 2016 assumption change relates specifically to drawdown
business.

FINAL

The addition of Rowan Dartington within the embedded value calculation has contributed
a positive £21 million, whilst distribution contributed a negative £25.9 million compared
with a negative £21.2 million for 2015.
Let's have a look at the breakdown of this distribution result. Firstly, both years were
negatively impacted by an elevated FSCS levy. We remain hopeful that the levy will return
to more normalized levels in coming years, particularly given the current FCA consultation
However, we are now expecting a third year of an elevated levy for the contribution year
2017/2018. And as you remember, this will be booked in full within the first half numbers.
Secondly, the profit impact from our investment into the Asian distribution was £13.2
million compared with £7 million. The depreciation of sterling has unfortunately negatively
impacted this number. The Asian business is developing well. And during 2016, we
doubled the number of advisers to over 100 and exceeded £130 million of new funds
under management.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, this is an investment for the future and the operations will continue to consume
capital for a number of years as we continue to grow the number of advisers. Once we
have achieved critical mass, the investment will start to positively contribute to the
embedded value.
Lastly, adjusting for both these items, the distribution activities made a small profit in both
years. The back office development cost £20.9 million in the year compared with £18.1
million. The change program has continued to progress well. In the final quarter of 2016,
we launched a new retirement account and are currently in the process of rolling this out
across the business. We then plan to migrate our existing book of pensions business later
this year before launching a new investment bond on Bluedoor and migrating the existing
bond business during 2018.
And, finally, other contributed a negative £47.8 million compared with £41.9 million. The
principal movements between the two years relates to the share option cost together
with associated National Insurance, our continuing investment in the Academy, Foundation
matching and miscellaneous other items. And taking all these points into account, the
operating profit for the year was £673.6 million compared with £660.2 million.
The rise in global stock market during the second half of the year and the currency impact
from sterling's depreciation on our overseas assets has provided for strong investment
return for our funds, which was translated into a positive investment variance of £537.2
million. This investment return together with the small economic assumption change
provided for a total pre-tax profit close to £1.2 billion compared to £636.7 million for 2015.
This is the first time in our history that embedded value profits have exceeded £1 billion.
So, another milestone and another record at the start of our 25th anniversary year.

FINAL

The EEV net asset value per share at the end of 2016 was a smidgeon over £9, an
increase of 22% over the year. This continues the recent trend of an increasing net asset
value per share with compound growth with 19% per annum. The NAV has now increased
by over 230% in the five years since the start of 2012. And unsurprisingly, this more or less
mirrors the growth we have seen in funds under management over the same period. So
quite simply, growth in funds under management equals growth in NAV equals growth in
shareholder value.
Now, I mentioned at the half year that we would consult on potentially dropping
embedded value. The general feedback from investors, however, was a desire to see us
continue to provide embedded value information. We will therefore do so, albeit we will
provide summarized information within the financial review rather than the full
supplementary accounts. It saves a bit of money.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving now onto the post-tax cash result, the retained net income from funds under
management at £508.9 million was up 16%, in line with the average funds under
management during the year. We continue to earn a blended fee of 77 basis points post
tax and are not seeing margin pressure. The reduction of fees from the funds in the
gestation period was £189.9 million, providing for the net income from funds of £319
million, up 15%.
The margin arising from new business was £49 million compared with £47.8 million for the
prior year. Importantly, this figure is dependent not only on business volume, but also
business mix. I highlighted earlier that we have experienced a larger proportion of
pensions business, and similar to the half year, this has reduced the contribution arising.
It's also worth remembering that this contributor to the overall result is dwarfed by the
annual management fees of over £500 million.
The combined operating expenditure in the year was £146.3 million compared with £130.9
million. The growth in expenditure was slightly ahead of expectations, principally reflecting
the higher costs associated with the growth in adviser recruitment that I touched on
earlier. This should in no way be seen as a disappointing outcome. In fact, the exact
opposite, as it is laying the foundations for future new business.
Frustratingly, the FSCS levy reduced the cash result in both years with a £13.7 million
impact in 2016. The interest income contributed £9.8 million in the current year and there
was a benefit of £12.6 million from utilization of capital losses. The latter remains a source
of income that will continue for the foreseeable future with a benefit still to accrue of £99
million with an expected utilization of some £8 million to £10 million per annum. The
negative £4.4 million miscellaneous contribution was at a similar level to the prior year. So
the total post-tax operating cash was £226 million, up 16%. This is the business as usual
cash result.
Now, as well as our ongoing investments in growing the Partnership and the business as a
whole, we have and will continue to invest in a number of strategic initiatives, the
Academy, our Asian operations, Rowan Dartington, and other areas. The combined
impact of these investments on the cash result during the period was £26.5 million

Page 4 of 22

FINAL

compared with £13.5 million. And after taking account of these investments, the
underlying cash result for the period was £199.5 million compared with £182.1 million.
Finally, there was a cost of the investment into the back office infrastructure and other
miscellaneous timing variances, providing for a total cash result of £175.4 million.
Turning now to the solvency position, and I would like to start with a presentational
change. We have reassessed the unit liability to match the encashment value of client
investments. This gives a better and more intuitive estimate of the liability going forward
and is consistent with the Solvency II principles. The change increases the Solvency II net
assets by £267 million, but with a corresponding reduction in future margins, the VIF. And,
therefore, in regulatory terms, there is no change to the Solvency II free assets.
Now, clearly, a presentational change such as this makes no difference to management's
view of the solvency. So we also offset this reduction in liability with an equal but opposite
increase in the Management Solvency Buffer. Again, there is no change in the
management free assets.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's just have a look at this presentational change by reviewing the before and after
position. Here is the position before we made the change, and here is the position after
the change. As you can see, there has been an increase in Solvency II net assets of £267
million, a corresponding reduction in the VIF and an increase in the Management Solvency
Buffer of the same amount, leaving all other figures unchanged.
Now, I'm afraid to say that this change will impact your modeling of the cash result, as
there was a change to the timing of cash emergence. Now, the good news is that, for
future new business, cash will emerge earlier. And had the change occurred at the start of
2016, then the operating, underlying and total cash would have been some £25 million
higher. There are also some changes to the IFRS result, albeit the impact is neutral. And
you can find a spreadsheet on our Investor Relations site to help you navigate these
changes.
And let's also consider how the above change will develop further in 2017. As the estimate
of the unit liability has reduced, we no longer need to hold matching equivalent assets.
Consequently, we are in the process of disinvesting excess assets from our funds above
that required to meet the encashment value of client investments. Once this process has
been completed, we'll be holding cash rather than equities and other assets, at which
time the group's risk profile will have reduced.
Consequently, there will be a future reduction in the solvency capital and risk margin
requirements, and at this time, the board will also reassess the level of Management
Solvency Buffer. Now without preempting the board's decision in this respect, I would
expect a small increase to three assets.
Finally, on solvency, let's return to the previous slide. The Solvency II free assets at the end
of 2016 were £952 million whilst the management free assets were £543 million. So in
both measures, the solvency position remains very strong.

I'm now going to finish with talking about the dividend. At the half year, we increased the
interim dividend by 15% and reiterated our intention to continue to grow the dividend in
line with the underlying performance of the business. As you have seen, the final six
months of the year were strong period of growth for the business, not only with the 23%
increase in gross inflows but also the continued strong adviser growth, albeit the latter
came with higher costs. Therefore, supported by the strong performance, we are
proposing to increase the final dividend by 20%, providing a full-year dividend of £0.33,
growth of 18%. This represents a full-year payout ratio to the operating cash of 77% and a
payout ratio of 87% of the underlying cash. Over the last 10 years, we have grown the
dividend even during 2008 and 2009 with compound growth of some 25% per annum.
Looking forward, we fully intend to continue our policy of increasing the dividend in line
with the underlying performance of the business. We also have the comfort of the £25.1
billion of funds within the gestation period, which will begin to contribute to the cash result
as each cohort reaches its seventh year.
So, that's me done. 2006 (sic) [2016] (18:54) was another year with strong operating
performance, with the key highlights summarized on the current slide. The key takeaways
for me are the continued strong solvency position, the 20% proposed increase in the final
dividend, and the £1.2 billion of EEV profit.
So, thank you for your attention and I now hand you back to David.

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Thank you, Andy. And now onto part two, this time last year, I started my presentation by
saying I'd like to reflect on our results by putting them into some sort of context. So I'd like
to do the same again this morning.
Andy started his presentation with the 10-year dividend story. So let me start with some of
the drivers of that story by looking at funds under management over the same period.
These first three charts, they're familiar to you, show the gross inflows over that 10-year
period; next, the net inflows over the same period; and finally, the growth in our funds
under management during those 10 years.
As I've said before, there's a reassuring predictability and consistency about this business
and its growth, and I think those three charts demonstrate that quite clearly. Last time, I
also drilled down beneath the yearly figures to share with you the quarterly pictures for
net inflows over the last 40 quarters, i.e. the last 10 years. Here's the chart I previously
showed you, updated for the four quarters of 2016. Net inflows for every single quarter in
the last 10 years and through some very volatile markets.
Now, if we drill down a little further and look specifically at 2016 by month and compare
our net inflow results to the five platforms that provided data to The Investment
Association for the year, we see a very interesting pattern emerge. And one that so very
clearly demonstrates the strength and effectiveness of the St. James's Place Partnership
and our business.
Page 6 of 22

FINAL

So here's the collective results of those five major platforms month-by-month. This is as
reported to The Investment Association. You'll see what happened in May through to July,
the Brexit effect. Almost £700 million of net outflows in June alone. And again, in October,
a significant drop in net flows. I call this the Trump effect as I'm sure investors were
anxious about the U.S. presidential election.
Now, let's have the SJP performance through the same 12 months. Far from outflows in
June, we saw £0.5 billion of net inflows as we saw in virtually every other month or two,
such as the effectiveness and resilience of our business.
So, what makes us so different? Well, in simple terms, it's our two major USPs, the St.
James's Place Partnership and our distinct approach to investment management,
managing clients' investments. I'll come back to the Partnership a little later. For now, let
me just say a few more words about our investment approach.
Firstly, as most of you will know by now, this is my favorite slide from our investor pack. We
have a very rich and diversified portfolio of active fund managers and asset classes. I truly
believe there isn't a better researched, more diverse, more complete and impressive
selection of funds and fund managers available in the UK retail market today.

Bloomberg Transcript

For those of you who attended our new company meetings a few weeks ago, you'll have
heard me say that our fund managers are sourced from the farthest field as Salt Lake City
to Sydney, from Copenhagen to Cape Town, from Hong Kong to Henley, illustrating the
diversity. So I won't repeat that today.
Of course, what matters though is how client portfolios, that's the client portfolios of
those fund managers contribute to perform (22:40). And one way I can illustrate that is by
comparison to the ARC Private Client Index. Here's how our model portfolios have
performed compared to that index over just one year. Pretty good outperformance in the
core funds. And for reference, these are all the companies that make up the ARC Index.
And finally, here's the comparison over a five-year period, which is pretty much the
minimum period we would expect clients to invest with us. I hope the charts speak for
themselves. And remember, these returns are all net of charges.
Whilst on the subject to charges, a lot has been written on this subject in recent weeks.
And so it's only right that I speak about it today. Firstly, as some of you will know, we use
Grant Thornton to review the market every six months to ensure we remain competitive
when it comes to total charges. In other words, the sum of advice costs, fund
management costs, platform costs, admin costs and the other associated charges.
Following their latest review, this chart shows in reduction in yield terms how we
compared to our competitors in 2016. We're the blue bar to the right of the chart. On the
Grant Thornton analysis – the Grant Thornton analysis clearly demonstrates that we are
highly competitive in that advisory market space.

Page 7 of 22

FINAL

Secondly, our scale and the predictability of our business, the flows and the high retention
of such that we can ensure our clients benefit from the most competitive rates in respect
of the tariffs charged by the managers who manage our client money.
The recent FCA study into the asset management industry questioned, amongst other
things, the competitiveness of the industry's pricing model and highlighted the fact that
the majority of active managers seem to charge between 75 basis points and 100 basis
points per annum and, in some cases, of course more. It quoted the average annual cost
of managed equity funds available to UK investors as 90 basis points. This is on the basis
of ongoing charges figure, the OCF.
For our range of managers and funds, the equivalent average cost paid by our clients is
43 basis points per annum, considerably less than the average in the market. That's
because we use the scale and consistency of our flows to obtain more competitive rates
and pass the benefits of these rates entirely through to our clients.

Bloomberg Transcript

On a more detailed level, this next chart illustrates on a fund-by-fund basis the rates we
achieved compared to the normal retail rate. Essentially, our scale enables us to deliver
institutional scale funds to our fund managers, but with all the characteristics of retail
funds. This benefits our clients directly as they effectively get wholesale rates in the retail
market.
Clearly, some of the larger platforms may negotiate a further small discount on the
figures quoted in the FCA report, but I doubt they will compete with SJP's pricing. And
that's simply down to the predictability of the flows and the retentiveness of our business
as demonstrated by what happened around that Brexit and Trump movement that I
mentioned a little earlier.
This is the strength of our relationship-based advice focus. Our partners will speak to their
clients at times like these to reinforce one of the fundamental messages in our approach
and that is what really matters is that they invest for the medium to long term and that it's
time in the market as opposed to timing the market that counts.
And to reinforce that point, here's a very timely chart published in the FT just a couple of
weeks ago. It illustrates that missing just the 10 best performing days in the last 20 years
would have cost an investor 170% of their returns. The strength of the relation-based
advice focus was also illustrated in a report from Vanguard a year or so ago that they
refreshed last year where it suggested the benefits of an adviser were seen at times of
market volatility and by helping avoid those behavioral traps as well as through improving
tax planning, improving not just net of charges returns, but net of tax and charges returns.
The conclusion was such advice could add as much as 3% a year in net returns to the
clients.
Finally, on the subject of charges, the other point that was raised recently is one of
transparency. That's a feature of the asset management study as well as some of the
press articles. We've always been clear that it's important that our clients understand the
charges and have them explained to them and confirmed in writing before they invest
Page 8 of 22

FINAL

with us. We own the vast majority of adviser businesses, having made a future of our
charges on the website for that very reason. Having said that, we've now recently
updated our website to reflect the charging structure for all of our wrappers. That's our
bonds, our unit trusts, ISAs and our new retirement account. And that website has been
live now for just over a week.
In the end though, the people that determine whether our charges are competitive or not
are our clients. Typically, they will look at them through their own lens, as I suspect you and
I would, and that's through the lens of value for money. That's why every year through our
annual plan survey, we ask them that very question, do you feel that the service you
received from St. James's Place represents value for money? This year's responses are
still being processed, but we've analyzed over 20,000 responses in February and saw a
pretty good sample. And they tell us that 99% of clients believe that our charges
represent reasonable, good or excellent value for money with 82% of them saying good
or excellent and that's up from 79% in last year's survey.

Bloomberg Transcript

And in the same survey, when asked given everything you know about St. James's Place,
would you recommend us to others? 97% have said yes to that question. For those of you
new to St. James's Place, I should just say that the survey I'm referring to is one that we
carry out each year alongside the wealth accounts that are sent to our clients in January
and early February. Every client, every single client gets a questionnaire on a replied, paid
envelope and is invited to complete if they want to. And whilst one or two of the
questions change each year, we keep some of the core ones consistent so as to monitor
trends.
And on this next slide, you'll see some of the key questions over the last three years. And
during that period, we've had fairly consistent and what I ranked as excellent scores.
Separate to our own survey, we also use an external firm to run a survey through a much
smaller sample of clients and compare those results with their industry results. They have
a control group. This chart shows those results, again a very recent survey. And whilst
different questions and slightly different scoring, the underlying message is clear. We
compare extremely well to the industry that our clients value what our partners do for
them. Encouraging stuff I think, an evidence of a company that's very engaged with its
clients.
Turning to our other USP, the St. James's Place Partnership, we couldn't be happier with
the way it has and is developing today. Long gone are the days of sole traders on a
product process (30:03). Today, we have 2,300 that we call partners, but are actually
small to medium enterprises, employing a further 1,100 advisers and some 5,000 support
staff to help provide their clients with a first rate service. 90% of them operate from their
own premises from as far north as Aberdeen and Inverness, to St. Ives, Penzance (30:26)
and all the other corners of the UK.
We and they continue to attract more advisers year-on-year and their overall productivity
is increasing in exactly the same way as we would expect. As Andy pointed out a little
earlier, we entered 2017 with just shy of 10% more advisers than we had at the beginning
of 2016, which bodes incredibly well for growth, not just this year but beyond.

Page 9 of 22

FINAL

Our Academy is also flourishing with over 70 graduating from the Academy in the last 12
months. This year, we have anticipated a further 200 people joining the Academy, and
some 80 to 100 of those people who are in the Academy currently – in the 210 that are
currently in the Academy, graduating to join the Partnership in the next 12 months.
What's also encouraging is the profile of the Academy intake as shown on the slide. Their
average age is sub-40, 80% (sic) [87%] (31:23) of them hold degrees, 22% of them are
women, and they have all chosen a career with St. James's Place.
Similar progress is being made in Asia where, as Andy said, we've seen the number of
adviser double in recent times to over 100 now. Still relatively small, but on track to add
material value to the group in the coming years.
And last but not least, our newly acquired discretionary fund management business,
Rowan Dartington. It also has ambitious growth plans. Whilst operating a very different
investment management approach, it's still fundamentally based on relationship-based
advice. And that aims to grow its funds and retain funds under management in the years
to come. In 2016 alone, it grew it's funds under management by 26%. And I know Graham
has very ambitious plans for this year to take that to over £2.4 billion by the end of 2017.
No pressure there, Graham.

Bloomberg Transcript

Recruiting new investment executives is critical here to him too. And encouragingly, we
saw that community grow by 20% in 2016, and we expect further growth of a similar
nature this year. So, very strong growth in capacity and productivity across the board, the
two key drivers of our business.
Let me end with just a few words about the marketplace. In our view, the demand for
advisers has never been greater than it is today. You'll be aware of the market data about
distribution, the scale of wealth in the UK. According to Datamonitor, 10 million people
have over £50,000 of investible wealth and a significant number much more than that.
A large proportion of this wealth is owned by people who neither have the time,
inclination, or confidence to manage it. And for many, life has become much more
complicated too, setting aside the complexity arising from the various personal tax
changes that have occurred in recent years. We've all seen or experienced the shift of
responsibility for retirement provision from government or corporates onto individuals.
And a sense of personal responsibility is clearly being realized now. We're all living longer,
and with continuing the low interest rates, you can see that annuities don't offer the value
for money that they once did, so leaving us with no collective sharing of the mortality risk
either.
The bank of mom and dad is [ph commonplace (33:50) today as is the increasing bank of
nanny and granddad, introducing into generational issues and further complicating family
finances. Whilst divorce rates have stabilized, with fewer people getting married and
couples cohabitating, financial and wealth planning is both more needed and more
complex.

FINAL

And the point I'm making is that in addition to tax and market complexities, we're also
seeing some very different life and relationship experiences further complicating people's
finances and increasing the need for and demand for advice. Pension freedom and
financial advice market review both highlighted this fact, whilst at the same time
acknowledging the increasing advice gap, i.e., too few advisers. Hence why we believe we
are better placed today than ever to take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead.
Yes, there are some threats too, but none that we don't believe we can manage. We
have a very experienced and growing adviser team, a very compelling investment
approach, a growing presence outside our core market, a very experienced management
team and, as I said in our annual company meeting for those of you who were there, a
very responsible business. A business that adds value to all of its stakeholders, to clients,

2016 was our 25th year, as Andy said, and what better way of marking that anniversary
than the figures we achieved during that year. Record gross and net inflows, strong
investment returns for our clients reflected in the £15 billion growth in our funds under
management, strong growth in our embedded value profits and operating post-tax cash
result, leading to a recommended final dividend of 20%.
We entered 2017, as I said earlier, with 10% more advisers and our thriving Academy,
which bodes really well for our future growth. As I said, I truly believe the group is in
excellent shape and incredibly well placed for the opportunities that lie ahead, and I hope
you all agree.
That brings me to the end of the formal presentation. Thank you for your time. I'd now like
to invite David, Ian and Andy back on the stage to take any questions you may have.

Q&A
A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

We have a roving mic or two. Who wants to go first?

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Thanks. It's Andy Sinclair from BofA Merrill Lynch. Three questions, if that's okay. Firstly, on
the £25 million of extra cash that you mentioned that would have been generated under
the universe of (36:48) changes in 2016. Firstly, can I take that that's fully enforced these
changes for the start of 2017? And, secondly, just would it be fair to say that as long as
sales and flows continue to grow, that figure could actually be even slightly higher going
forward?
Secondly was just on Asian growth, actually two questions in Asia. Firstly on Asian growth,
you've said you're now up to 100 advisers. Where do you expect that to go over the next
few years? And secondly, on Asian expenses and actually strategic development
Page 11 of 22

expenses, you've given guidance for 2017 for Asian expenses and strategic development
expenses. Just wondered if you could give anything for 2018. Will it continue or will that
drop slightly? Thanks.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

FINAL

I think you should take this.

A - Andrew Martin Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Okay. If I do the £25 million. First of all, it's not extra cash. It's timing, just to be clear. Yeah.
Okay. And yes, it will occur in 2017 and it will be connected to the volume of business. So if
the volume of the business is up, then it should be higher than £25 million. It won't be an
exact pound-per-pound drive thing, but there is a relationship there.
On the second one for Asia. I think really importantly, this is a start-up business and I'm
sort of reminded of where we were 25 years ago. You start to consume capital before
you actually start to generate capital. Growth doesn't come free, I guess. So we expect
the infrastructure to continue to expand in 2017 and 2018. We will then start to expect
embedded value profits to emerge, and the actual cash return will still take a number of
years after that.
David, I don't know you want to add anything particularly to the...

Bloomberg Transcript

A - David John Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

No. You're exactly right. And if you look at the pattern of recruitment we're seeing already
in the first two years or so, we're very confident that we're going to achieve our
recruitment (38:55) in Asia over the next three, four, five years as business grows.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Okay. Another one here. Can we just pass the mic along? Thank you. And we'll come to
you next, Andy.

Q - Ravi Tanna

{BIO 16926941 <GO>}

Right. Good morning. Thank you. It's Ravi Tanna from Goldman Sachs.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Hi, Ravi.

Q - Ravi Tanna

{BIO 16926941 <GO>}

I have a couple of questions, please, for you. The first is just on the group borrowings,
which have gone up by about £100 million and I noticed the kind of loans guaranteed by
third-parties to partners hasn't really changed. So I was just wondering what the those
proceeds are being used for? And the second one was more of a point of clarification.
Andy, you mentioned 6% to 8% growth. Is that the kind of new guidance around adviser
Page 12 of 22



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C
Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2017-02-28

growth going forward as opposed to partner growth being 5% to 7% in the past? Thank
you.

FINAL

A - Andrew Martin Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

I'll let Ian answer the adviser one. On the borrowings, so we pay the interim dividend out
of the earnings that have risen during the year, but in respect to the UK life company,
which is about 80%, we don't get those cash earnings out of the business until the start of
the following year. So we use the revolving credit facility or the expression I use as a
dividend bridge.
Ian to the adviser.

A - Ian Stewart Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

Yeah. On total adviser numbers, I think we can safely look at a range between 6% and 8%.
It has been well within the capability at the moment.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

I think that the shift is largely because we are seeing businesses expand themselves, so
partners are beginning to recruit their own advisers into their practices. So we just move
that and dial up a little bit and focus on the adviser numbers and because it seems more
relevant, it's what total capacity is all about really.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Andrew Martin Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

And, of course, we've done 10% (40:43) to the last five years.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

What he is saying there is he thinks he is giving Ian a soft target and so that's...

A - Ian Stewart Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

I much rather over-deliver.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Yeah. Now, now boys. Andy?

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Thanks so much. Andy Hughes from Macquarie. A couple of questions. First one on the
SCR benefit from the change that you're going to make with the asset allocation behind
the unit linked funds, sorry. Is that about sort of 20% to 30%, i.e., the equity stress on the
£267 million? So should we think about kind of £50 million, £60 million is the range for that
and is that kind of rough mass? Could you update on sort of Bluedoor and potential cost
savings that might arise, when we might expect those and what the impact on cash flows,
et cetera, on that?

Page 13 of 22



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C
Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2017-02-28

FINAL

And I guess a final question is also on cash flow. So if I understand the change correctly, it
benefits pensions and life insurance, not really unit trust. So does it even out the
differences you've seen between the two products, i.e., if you sell more and more
pensions, you get more and more of the benefit versus where you were historically. Thank
you.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Thanks, Andy. I think they're all yours.

A - Andrew Martin Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Yeah. It looks that way, doesn't it? The premise on the solvency capital requirement is
correct, although of course, they're not all going to be equities. Some is going to be fixed
interest securities. Some will be properties, that sort of thing.

Bloomberg Transcript

On your final question, you're correct. This change doesn't affect unit trust because unit
trust has explicit (42:19) those two questions.
On Bluedoor, I think you were asking me two questions, one is how is it going in the
spend and when do the savings come. Okay. So, as I was saying in my presentation, it's
going well. We've got one-third of our business being transacted on Bluedoor now. That
was the case earlier in 2016, so that's the unit trust. The pensions business, new business
is now going onto Bluedoor, and we will migrate that again this year. And then, later this
year, early next year, we'll launch the new investment bond on Bluedoor and then migrate
it. So just to sort of recap on that one. So, therefore, you can expect the cost of the
Bluedoor program to continue into 2017 and also some further cost in 2018. If the project
pushes back, then the cost will continue.
Yeah. So the savings only start to rise obviously once the migration has been done. So
we're beginning to see the benefits coming through from the unit trust business. We
haven't really seen any benefits yet from the pensions or the bonds clearly, but they will
come through once the business has been migrated. We have no doubt at all and all our
numbers show a significant saving over this 12-year contract term. Hopefully, I answered
the question.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

And just adding to the sort of benefits of Bluedoor. I hope it's self-evident, but this
improved the efficiency and what we deliver to our partners and our clients in terms of
processing times and in terms of accuracy. And what's really reassuring for me is Bluedoor
came under a lot of focus 12 months, 18 months ago. Today, we're getting some very
positive notes coming in from partners and some of the support teams that are saying
just how well that system is operating.
The retirement account is up and running for all of our locations as all of our unit trust and
ISA business. So all of the new business on those two-thirds of our business is going
through Bluedoor right now, and people are starting to say some very positive and

Page 14 of 22



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C
Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2017-02-28

encouraging things about it which for me is pretty good. The numbers will come through
in due course as Andy said.
Oliver? You have a very serious look on your face, so. That's better.

FINAL

Q - Oliver George Nigel Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Oliver Steel, Deutsche Bank. So three questions. The first is – so the extra £25 million of
not casual (44:53), whatever you want to call it, I mean if it isn't new cash, how does that
change your dividend payout guidance? Second question is on the Academy cost. Perhaps
you can just sort of extend your own projection out to 2018, 2019 as well as just 2017. And
then, the third question is on – does the guidance you've got for your establishment
expenses include the cost savings you're now expecting on the Bluedoor integration?

A - Andrew Martin Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

It sounds like it's coming my way again, and doesn't it really? On the £25 million, Oliver, it
isn't new money. It's just the timing of the cash emergence. So it's positive for the cash
result both operating and underlying cash result. And if they are growing quicker than they
would otherwise have grown, then that should be positive for the dividend.

Q - Oliver George Nigel Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Does that mean that the 75% payout guidance is lower?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Andrew Martin Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

No. No. So the underlying cash should be £25 million higher than you would have
modeled. And then we can use that £25 million to return to shareholders in line with our
dividend guidance.

Q - Oliver George Nigel Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

(46:16)

A - Andrew Martin Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Yeah. The Academy cost, unlike Asia, the Academy is almost reaching a stage of maturity.
Clearly, the number of graduates that go through the Academy will increase the cost. If
you remember, we started in London with three cohorts. We then moved to Birmingham
and Manchester and Edinburgh. And it's all to do with the number of cohorts going
forward. So I think you can expect the cost to continue to grow if we continue to put more
graduates through the program, but then you shouldn't see any sort of major step cost
coming through. Did I answer your question?

Q - Oliver George Nigel Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Another add-on (46:55), why is that an investment expenditure of (47:00)

A - Andrew Martin Crof t

Page 15 of 22



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C
Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2017-02-28

FINAL

Yeah. I think if you look at the items that we're showing as business as usual and then the
items showing as investment, I think if you look to each of the individual items, then today
there could be a reasonably strong argument to say the Academy where it should be
business as usual. Certainly Asia and RD (47:18) are still very much in investment. But when
we started, it was clearly an investment.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Yeah, I think, I mean, just backing up Andy's point, the regionalization program has – we
can't find premises, we can't (47:31) find people, we drop them in in the midlands and
northwest in Scotland. That's all relatively new. So there's a little bit of start-up in that, but
it will get to a point where it becomes pretty much business as usual as you would expect.

Q - Oliver George Nigel Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

And the guidance – final question on the guidance on establishment cost excludes any
savings from Bluedoor?

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

There's obviously a lot of interest in this cash shape difference event whether it's new
cash or accelerated cash. I'm just quite intrigued just how you manage to save it until the
end of 2017 and reporting in 2018. I just sort of find that a (48:11), but I'm joking. Next. So
we got one back here and then one in the front here.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Gordon Aitken from RBC. We've got other big life insurance companies now acquiring
advisers. Do you expect that to have any impact at all on your business, is it perhaps a
little more difficult to acquire future partners? And second question, you role budget next
week, what's your expectation for tax relief and if we do have a single rate of tax relief
introduced, will higher rate taxpayers, addition rate taxpayers, do you expect them to
(48:52)?

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

So, a single rate for pensions.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

(48:54). So I'll let David and Ian kind of pick up what the competition.

A - Ian Stewart Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

Yeah. I think there's some quite a big difference between the acquisition of a business
and a business joining SJP. We do acquire businesses, but within that process, it's very
important that they also kind of join what we're doing and who we are and the values and
Page 16 of 22



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C
Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2017-02-28

FINAL

there's a match. Otherwise, we don't acquire them. So we're not just kind of trying to buy
businesses for the sake of the kind of consolidation play. They are all disparate with
different cultures and different senses of direction.
So I think our position in the acquisition world is very different and that we talked to a lot
of businesses, but there has to be match that they're going to be allied and go in the
same direction of the business. We're not sensing any difficulties in talking to people.
Selection is a bigger issue for us, and we're very confident of our ability to continue
growing the number of advisers we need to grow. So we're not sensing any difficulties.

A - David John Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

On the pensions tax relief, I mean it has been talked about before. I think there are two
things to think about here. One is that, philosophically, it would be a decision that would
benefit more rather than the higher rate taxpayers only. So you could see it happening. So
flat rate tax, it will be a politically sensitive thing to do given philosophies out there,
though it wouldn't affect our business, that's the second point because most of our
business is about transfers and drawdown where pensions are already invested.

Bloomberg Transcript

And the higher rate taxpayers had their limitations imposed on them in terms of what they
can contribute any way. Most of our business sales is going to be existing funds or moved
into drawdown from existing funds where tax relief has (50:44) granted in the past. So it's
actually not a big SJP business impact. It's more of a sociopolitical impact across (50:49)
message to the country.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

I think what we've seen also with the pension tax relief changes thus far because, as
David said, it's got quite complicated, 150,000 (51:00). One of the reasons why some of
the businesses move because I don't think people will stop saving. This personal
responsibility thing, putting money away, is why we've seen our unit trust and ISA business
growing reasonably strongly.
And I think the other thing to bear in mind is that unless he changes it on March 8, the ISA
limit goes from £15,000 to £20,000 at the start of this new tax year. That's quite a
sizeable chunk and step-up for Mr. and Mrs. if you think about. There are not many people
that will have £40,000 worth of after-tax investable income. So I suspect where they
(51:42) on the pensions, whether it's life time or the taper or the relief that changes in the
budget, then we should see quite a marked uptake in ISA business.
So there's another just down here.

Q - Lance M. Burbidge

{BIO 3978332 <GO>}

Thanks. It's Lance Burbidge from Autonomous. Three quick questions. Firstly, Andy, you
mentioned in terms of the UK business or the core business, it was a bit a like Asia many
years ago. Can you remind us how many years that took to become cash positive?
Secondly, another question, I'm afraid, for Andy which is on the life insurance, the Solvency
II ratio post the dividend is up 120%. I wonder if we should be concerned in any way. And
Page 17 of 22



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C

then, finally, on charges, David, you talked about the coverage in the press. Has there
been any impact in terms of the business?

FINAL

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Let me deal with the last one first thing because it's the simplest one. No. Actually, quite a
lot of supportive comments as to that's not what clients perceive or feel, so no impact at
all.

A - Andrew Martin Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Sorry. On the solvency capital ratio, it's not something that is of concern. If you remember,
when I was presenting Solvency II last year, the ratio went down when markets went up,
and that's some of the dynamic we're seeing there. If you look at the management free
assets, then it's fine. On your first question, thank you for that. I guess I set myself up for
it, didn't I? A slightly different beast because, obviously, the respective size of the
markets. But it took a good 10 years to become cash generative for the UK business. And
again, the faster you grow, the longer that can be.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

It'll change next year, though.

A - Andrew Martin Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Make it 11.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Barrie, on the front here. And then we'll (53:48). We've got one there, okay.

Q - Barrie Cornes

{BIO 2389115 <GO>}

Hello. It's Barrie Cornes. I've got three questions. Sort of following on from that very last
one, I suppose. First of all David, I just wondered about the timing of your announcement
today. Just wondered what the background was if you could put a bit of color on that,
that'd be great.
Second question, really, if there's likely been any management changes in the top team
or the close to top team as a result of this? We are keen to hear your views on that. And
last of all, one for Andy, whether or not we can expect any changes in direction, strategy,
even down to the foundation as a result of you becoming CEO?

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

I can answer all three of them, actually. Not allowed. I know it gets a bit personal, Barrie,
doesn't it? In terms of timing, it's – I'm 63 years old, so 64 in April, 65 next year. 25, 26
years here. 11 years as CEO. We've done our 25th anniversary. I've done my 10 years. I'm
getting 65. It's sort of felt 18 months or so ago that it would be around that. So we spent
with Sarah, the board, the exec team thinking about this movement. In my head, there
was never going to be a sort of perfect time, but this feels like a good time. The business
Page 18 of 22

FINAL

is in a good place. I meant what I said about responsible business. I feel incredibly chuffed
that we are where we are. We have got a great team. We've been putting that in place
very sensibly over the last 18 months, two years. It's why they're all here today.
And it blends really well from some people that have got masses of wisdom and 20, 30,
40 years in the industry, to some people that have sort of relatively newcomers, 5 and 10
years. We've got a great blend (55:37) our executive team. And so it sort of feels on both
a personal level and on a business level that now is the right time. Nothing else to that. I'm
not quite sure how you find the right time, but it feels about right now. And we're giving
the market early notice, so this is not – these are not goodbye conversations because
there's another 10 months, and I will not let go of that baton until I have to. So there is one
CEO and that's it. Then Andy would take it on. Masses of confidence in this guy.
I said to one of the journalists this morning, if you were flying at the Red Arrows and you
were at the front, you'd want this guy on your wing because he is that solid, and he's
absolutely right to take the business on from here. He's got a couple of great people
alongside him and then this broader team. So now is a really good time to be making this
move. And I will play a little bit in Asia. And they've let me stay on, and that's really nice for
me too. So, that's where we are. And he ain't changing the strategy. But you'll see it for
yourselves, so.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Andrew Martin Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

I will answer that question myself. Look, I've been with the group for 24 years, it will be 25
by the time I take over. I've been involved in all the strategic decisions as CFO for the last
12 years. So I'm totally on side with the strategy and therefore I think you can read into
that. No change. I will take the baton and go for the sprint finish.

FINAL

Yeah. Ben Bathurst from SocGen. I've got there questions please around products. Firstly
on drawdown. I think, last year, you intimated that 67%, two-thirds of your funds that
matured made their way into drawdown products. I wondered if you could give an update
on what that number was like for 2016 and maybe perhaps give some indication as to
what proportion of your SIF (57:30) funds are now actually in drawdown?
Secondly, on DB/DC transfers, there's been quite a bit of talk about that area in the press,
especially in the last six months or so. I was just wondering, to what extent were the flows
in 2016 helped by DB/DC transfers? And then, when St. James's Place partners do that
business, I was just wondering what do you – how do you support them to make sure that
there isn't a kind of a misselling case around DB/DC further down the line, but I know
that's quite a controversial line of business?

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Yeah. Yeah. David, do you want to take because you can probably deal with all of those,
can't you?

A - David John Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I'll take the second – the last bit first and a very, very small amount of DB transfers. We've
always been very cautious about the DB/DC transfer market. The dynamics in the
marketplace are changing and we are looking again at whether we should adjust our
approach there. But our approach has been based on independent (58:28) reports and
analysis is based on probably licensing and training of partners and sign-off internally.
So the core principles don't change. The way in which we think about the market is open
that we are looking at now because of the big shift in the yields and big shift in transfer
values. And there is a more demand for people to be able to take their pension plan,
have the security of that, and also use it as intergenerational planning tool as well going
forward, so there's more flexibility. So, not a big impact at all in 2016, but certainly we're
looking at it differently going forward.
In terms of the drawdown marketplace, the two-thirds figure is broadly consistent with
where we've been for the last two years. It's edging up all the time. I'll partly rephrase
what David is saying in terms of annuity still not giving value for most people, actually,
because you can use your pension in different ways, so drawdown gives people the
opportunity to control pensions conversation (59:19) beyond the first generation in a much
more sensible way given the pensioners freedom was introduced last year or so. So,
that's a number we'd expect to see going up.

A - David Charles Bellamy

Andy is going to come back. I'll make this the last question (59:34) everybody has got any
other questions (59:36).

FINAL

Hi. Andy Hughes, Macquarie. A couple of questions. First one is on the £50 million
whatever we talked about before on the SCR because, obviously, you answered the
question about what happens to dividend from the new business cash flow. But I'm just
wondering what the plans would be for any benefit from the SCR and whether if you
move into an internal model with the SCR would be significantly lower than (59:55)
because I believe there's a higher level of correlation between the two key stresses for
you guys and the standard model, i.e. persistency in expenses.
And the final piece on the revised cash flow for new business. Presumably, what you're
saying is we go above the surrender charge in terms of the cash flow. So does that mean
you could reduce the surrender charge, it wouldn't make any difference to the actual cash
flows you get from (01:00:19). And would that be something you're considering or not?
Thanks.

A - Andrew Martin Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

I'll deal with the last one first. No, we're not going below the surrender value floor. So
we're not shorting, which I think is probably the expression. We will set our unit liability at
the encashment value of the client investment. It will not be below that encashment value.
In the Solvency I world, you were holding above the encashment value of client
investments for mortality, for regular income withdrawals, that sort of thing. So, what
we're doing is we're moving that a bit. I think that answers that question.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

But you could go below that, couldn't you?
