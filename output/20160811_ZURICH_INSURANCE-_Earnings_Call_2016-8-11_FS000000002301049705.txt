MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning or good afternoon. Welcome to the Zurich
Insurance Group Half Year Results 2016 Analyst Conference Call. I'm Sara, the Chorus Call
operator. I would like to remind you that all participants would be in listen-only mode and
the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be a Q&A session. The
conference must not be recorded for publication or broadcast.
At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over to Mr. Richard Burden, Head of Investor
Relations and Rating Agency Management. Please go ahead, sir.

Richard Burden

{BIO 1809244 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning and good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to Zurich
Insurance Group's second quarter results call. On the call are our CEO, Mario Greco, and

our Group CFO, George Quinn. Before we move to questions, we just wanted to highlight
a supplement disclosure that we provided this morning on our reserves.

FINAL

We kindly ask you to keep questions relating to this disclosure for tomorrow's additional
call, which is dedicated to the topic. Mario will now make a few comments and then we
will take your questions. As usual, please keep to two questions.
I'll now hand over to Mario.

Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Thank you, Richard, and hello to everybody from myself, and thank you for joining us.
Allow me to make a few comments on the results and on the state of the company today
before I open up to questions that George and I will address.
First of all, I'm very pleased to report these results. I think they're good results and they
show that there is traction. They show that we're walking the talk and we are delivering on
what was announced that we will do.

Bloomberg Transcript

In GI, the underlying accident year loss ratio in the expense ratio has both improved and
we stay committed to the 2-percentage point to 3-percentage point improvement in the
underlying combined ratio for the year.
In Global Life and Farmers, management services continued to demonstrate solid growth
and very stable earnings. Capital is resilient and the Zurich economic capital ratio is well
within our target range at an estimated 107% at the end of June.
Cash remittances, they are still coming above the targets and were still targeted to be
over $10 billion at the end of 2016. So this looks like as a good start of the year. We
acknowledge that there is more work to be done and we're ready to do this work in the
remaining part of the year and then in the next years. However, this start gives us a lot of
conﬁdence that the actions taken are the right one in that we can really ﬁx the business
and restore the proﬁtability back as we thought we would.
We expect, of course, a further improvement in the second half of year, and then we will
continue over the next years improving the business. Also, let me reconﬁrm to you that at
the end of this semester, I still see the group as fundamentally sound. I still see our
reserves position as strong one. I still see the capital as strong and the brand as a very
strong and eﬀective one.
These are all very important characteristics that we need to build upon and again, I'm not
forgetting all the things that we need to ﬁx. The loss ratio is to improve the cost, have to
further come down, but this is very solid organization with lots of skills, lot of
professionalism and this results show that I think in a tangible way.

FINAL

I'm – also let me quickly spend a word on transparency and communication. And I think
the transparency and the data that we provided for tomorrow of reserves give a lot of
transparency also on this issue. And you can (04:33) continuing to build a very open
dialogue and deliver all the necessary information in a very transparent way.
We are also working very hard to position Zurich for the future and to shape a very clear
and simple strategy for the next years. However, the organization is already changing and
is already getting simpliﬁed. We are progressing with the head oﬃce restructuring, and
we are extending that same stream of actions to the countries where we are piloting the
impact of a simpliﬁed current (05:12) organization into three European countries to draw
then conclusions for considering for all others.
We are looking forward to meeting all of you on 17th of November for the Investors Day,
where we will update you on the ﬁnancial targets and on our strategy. But in the
meantime, we remain committed to continue improving the business and to have a strong
second half of year and showing you that the improvements will continue.
Thank you very much for listening. And now, George and I will be happy to take your
questions.

Q&A

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The ﬁrst question is from Peter Eliot,
Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. I guess the ﬁrst question was, there's a lot of references to the
impact of large losses based on the presentation and commentary. You have given us
some numbers and comparatives there, but I guess you used to give us an aggregate
ﬁgure. And I am just wondering if you could quantify the overall impact the large losses
had in the quarter and how that compares to historic averages?
And then secondly, I am just wondering if you can help me understand at a very high level
the sort of the interaction – the timing of the actions you are implementing. I guess, you
attribute quite a lot of the improvement to actions you have taken. But I guess rate
increases take time to earn their way through, and although you said (07:09) rate
increase's overall 2%, I guess not a huge amount. And then on expense savings,
restructuring charges very much weighted towards the second half of the year. So I am
just wondering if you could say at a high level – help us sort of guide through the timing
of the improvements and say perhaps why we are seeing quite a lot this early? Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Let me start. So on the last topic, I am not going (07:34) isolating large losses from the
overall because the goal for the sem (07:40) is to focus on the entire loss ratio, and that's
Page 3 of 22



FINAL

Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2016-08-11

being the entire thing and whether it's attritional large losses. I mean to try and help
around I think what we have in the quarter versus what we expect which may answer a
question that a number of you may have. And if you look at the result we have for the
quarter, we have combined ratio of 99. We are I think about 98.3 for the half year. I think
the half year is a pretty good indication to where we think we are today on an underlying
basis, it's somewhere in that mid-98 range and that compares to the ambition that we
have to bring ourselves to about two points to three points as Mario mentioned from a
level that was around 100 points underlying for last year. If you look at the quarter, I mean
the main deviations would be that on the large loss side – and I think if you take this
number of face value, it would make more progress at this point than we expected.
I think in reality when we dig into it, this almost sound like some randomness in the large
loss performance. And we would assume that that's resulted (08:47) favor in Q2. So I
would assume a slightly higher level than we've seen, maybe a point higher than the
combined ratio than we reported today.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the expense side, we also have a number of one-oﬀs. I mean, we – you've seen we
have a very strong ﬁgure, 30.3% on the expense ratio. If you allow for the impact of some
of the one-oﬀs and the impact of RCIS, which causes a bit of a ﬂip between loss ratio and
expense ratio, I mean, we would see the expense ratio for the year, I mean, being
somewhere, I mean, close to a point higher. And so if you allow for all of that and you
allow for some continued earnings (09:34) attritions. Coming on to your second question
maintaining (09:34), I mean, you've seen us report positive rates in Q1, it's slightly less in
Q2. I mean, in general, what we see at the beginning of the year, we're earning I mean
roughly a half, but slightly more than half this year, remainder of next year and that pattern
will continue.
So there will be a bit of a lag, but I mean, we would certainly expect to see that come
through as – I mean, around half a point on the attrition as we go through the remainder
of the year. I mean, overall, we think we're well on track. And large losses notwithstanding
cat, notwithstanding to achieve that targeted combined ratio.
On the broader topic of timing, there's been actions (10:16) around restructuring, so
you've seen that – I mean, so far in the year we've incurred about $227 million of
restructuring costs. I mean, Mario announced several weeks ago a restructuring to
improve and simplify the organization and increase the focus that we have on the
customer. We're running through that process now. That would generate some more
costs and likely (10:40) mainly in Q3.
I expect the total cost for this year to come within the overall guidance that we've given
on restructuring, so within that $500 million guidance that I gave earlier in the year. As far
as the beneﬁts are concerned, I mean, there's no update I'll give you today on the
beneﬁts other than we still expect and anticipate we'll deliver that $300 million
improvement this year with an overall goal to deliver $1 billion by 2018. That will be a topic
that we'll update you on more when we get to the Investor Day.

FINAL

The next question is from Dhruv Gahlaut, HSBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. First question is in regard to the cash
remittance target of more than $10 billion. Could you give us an indication in terms of
where you are with the remittance since the start of the year? Secondly, also on a
underlying basis, on the GI book, could you say how price versus claim inﬂation is running
at this point, and what are you expecting for the next – in the second half, basically?

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So, on the cash remittance, so – I mean just to reiterate, I mean, we still – there's no
change in our view of what will happen this year. We still expect that we'll deliver more
than $10 billion compared to that target of $9 billion. That would imply a minimum of $2.4
billion. But we've also said that – I mean, assuming an unchanged dividend, we expect the
dividend to be cash covered this year.
I mean, the way the pattern works is that – I mean, the ﬂows are split I mean, roughly
evenly believe or not and the summer is a quiet period, towards the end of Q1 beginning
of Q2 the ﬁrst major ﬂow and then – and Q4 is the second one. So currently we exactly
want to try before (12:41) we expected to be. We don't see anything that would cause us
to change our view. So we are conﬁdent that we will achieve (12:48) guidance that we've
given you.

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

Right.

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

On rate versus loss (12:52) costs, I mean, we haven't seen anything that signals a change
in the loss (12:58) cost pattern from what you – what we talked about on the call here back
in Q1. So we're still seeing positive margin growth with the rates that we're achieving, but
it is relatively modest. So I mean, given the 1.5% headline rate increase we talked about,
we're talking about 50 bps of margin expansion or thereabout.

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

All right, perfect. Thank you.

FINAL

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Oh, hi, there. First question is for Mario. Mario, you quoted on the paper saying you feel
more conﬁdent about the second half. I mean, the under – non-life is improving albeit
more or less (13:48) the run rate you've targeted. What really is it making you more
conﬁdent about the second half and relative to what point? Is this because you now sort
of you understand more about the root cause of the problems were or you've done a bit
more work on understanding where the cost opportunities are? I'm just trying to
understand exactly what it is that's giving you so much more conﬁdence about the second
half?
And the second question for George, you talk about further attritional improvement
coming through in the second half. What are the impact of (14:18) RCIS on that because
obviously most of the premium earned in crop is in the second half, quite late in the
second half, at what sort of combined ratio RCIS is running at? And when you talk about
further attritional loss improvement, are you talking excluding that? I appreciate it's a high
– I mean, obviously you had high losses, low expenses, but maybe just clarify what the
impact of RCIS will be in the second half? Thanks.

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Andrew, I will start and then I will back it (14:49) to George. I think I was saying that we're
all more conﬁdent, not just me. When I joined the company January, February (15:03)
beginning of March, I found everybody is hesitant, scared because 2015 has been truly
really bad year and very disappointing, and the disappointment and the sadness for the
result was still there.
I think this result give a great boost or conﬁdence to the underwriters, to the sales people,
to the claims people, to everybody that they're doing – that they have been doing the
right things that they put the situation under control, they took the right measures, and so
we'll keep the natural conﬁdence in continuing this trusting that this is working, and this is
going to work also in the future.
But this was needed. And so it's not just me. I mean, it is the moral of the organization, it is
the conﬁdence of the underwriters who will be now negotiating with people and they
know that they have been calling right shots over the last months. And it is rebuilding a
little bit the pride and the conviction of the organization, which is very important. And still
I see Zurich as a super competent organization, but moral and conviction are very
important to make every day success.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Andrew, on the second point, on RCIS, I don't expect that to have a major impact on the
overall combined ratio run through the full year. I mean, the components will have some
impact on loss versus cost, but I mean given – I mean, some of the costs that we expect to
incur on integration in the second half and the fact that – I mean, I think you're right, the
Page 6 of 22

Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2016-08-11

premium is backend weighted. So I mean, we have about $127 million in this quarter, we
will be about $400 million by the last quarter, but overall I'm expecting a result from RCIS
that's not that far away from where I'm guiding for the group.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

FINAL

So, it will be more impactful next year, I guess then.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

We certainly (17:07) expect more from it next year, yes.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. All right. Thanks.

The next question is from Sami Taipalus, Berenberg Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just two things. First of all, on the global commercial
premiums, I think you put through 1% of rate and you saw (17:31) about 13% drop in
volume. It's a bit diﬃcult to gauge from where I'm sitting how much of that – exactly how
that came through. So I'm wondering if you have a feel of how much rate decline you'd
have to take to keep the volume ﬂat. So, that's ﬁrst question.
Second question is, you gave us a bit of an update at Q1 about the positive impact that
you're increasing reinsurance buying at hand. And I was wondering if you could give us a
further update on that and whether that's changed your mind at all about buying
reinsurance more broadly. I think in the past you've said that you bought reinsurance to
protect capital rather than earnings. But what have you changed up (18:20) more towards
buying reinsurance to earn – to help earnings rather than just to protect capital. Thank
you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So maybe on the ﬁrst question, I think that's probably the opposite way from the way that
we normally think about it, because I mean we're looking so for a return on income (18:36)
rather than think of – I mean what kind of return that we have to give up to maintain the
volume. I mean, I think – I mean, you raised a point earlier that – I mean, we continue to do
what we said we were going to do at start of the year and that's to focus on the underperforming parts of the portfolio and essentially do what you'd expect us to do, and that's
either push for the required reentries or give up that business. And that's something that,
in particular, Global Corporate has been completely focused on through Q1 and Q2 and
you see the largest impact there.
I mean, in return for that, I mean, we did have a signiﬁcant impact on rate. You see we've
updated the tiering chart today. We continue to push very hard on the underperforming
Page 7 of 22



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG

Date: 2016-08-11

FINAL

parts of the portfolio. That has impacts both on overall rate versus market. I mean, the
market overall is clearly slightly negative, but we're still achieving positive margin
improvement, but we are giving up business in the process. And that's something that I
expect will continue throughout the remainder of this year as we cycle through the entire
portfolio. I mean, it won't continue forever. But I mean, this adjustment is absolutely
needed so that we get (19:42) that level of proﬁtability that's required.
On the reinsurance topic, and I mean, there's not much more to say on that today from
what we said earlier in the year other than to reiterate that, I mean, you won't see us go
back where we were before and prioritize and keeping the (20:06-20:18). I mean, that's
really where it can play the most eﬀective role for us. I mean, so far this year, we haven't
had to rely on reinsurance. The improvement that you've seen in the results today have
come from what we've done on the underwriting side that is not driven by reinsurance,
but the direction we set around our risk appetite continues, and that will be reﬂected in
the reinsurance program that we've put in place for next years and the years to come.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

All right. Okay, great. Thank you.

The next question is from Nadine van der Meulen, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Nadine van der Meulen

{BIO 15200446 <GO>}

Good afternoon. Congratulations on the results this morning. And a question on the cost
savings on the Life side, the operational cost in Global Life are quite a bit better than I
expected at least. And how do you think about your existing cost savings target there and
how should we look at your approach on the longer term there?
And secondly on the dividend, you've commented in the past that you felt perhaps one
sort of ﬁxed number was better replaced by dividend policy. Can you elaborate on that?
Maybe give us an idea of what kind of policy you are thinking about. And then on the
reinsurance that George just spoke about, I was wondering whether you could give the
gross loss ratio just to gauge the impact of reinsurance program. Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So cost savings, particularly in Life, so – I mean, Life is not (21:50) Life has some relatively
rapidly growing businesses which I mean need cost support and to continue that growth.
So I mean on Life, I mean, the overall aim we've got the same discipline there that we've
had in the rest of the business, what we need to have in the rest of business. And I think
we see it, the – but the characteristic is diﬀerent from GI.
Life is still expanding. Life has attractive margins in most of its businesses. And we
continue to invest there where we can. I mean, where we've really seen the cost beneﬁt on
the Life side is, I mean, policy charges and so the impact that some of things that we've
announced this year have had on the cost eﬃciency to some (22:32) translate through to
Page 8 of 22



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG

Date: 2016-08-11

FINAL

the segments in the form of lower charges from the group. And that's a trend that I expect
to see continue through this year, and in fact as we complete the cost saving process –
program continue into next year.
The other thing that make Life slightly tricky to judge is the policyholder elements, of
course the – I mean, cost savings shared with the policyholder in many of the businesses
that we have, but overall Life is subject to the same discipline as the rest of us, but the
beneﬁt that you are seeing are probably coming mainly from lower charges from the
corporate sector (23:08).

Q - Nadine van der Meulen

{BIO 15200446 <GO>}

That's reﬂected in the acquisition cost as a percentage of GWP being lower, is that right?
That fell from 10% to 8% I believe.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I don't know, Nadine. So I'll get you back and look at the precise driver there. I have done
that in the past (23:25). On the dividend, I mean – I have nothing new to say on dividend
today. The topic we come back to again is part of the Investor Day, I have nothing...

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

(23:42) anyway.

A - George Quinn

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yeah, thank you. First question on the business mix in P&C between the four units. I guess,
Global Corporate was expected than we observe, continued loss in Europe, UK, Germany,
Switzerland, Italy you mentioned. You've started to divest international market and in
NAC, you are mainly growing captives (24:17). My ﬁrst question is, is sort of this, trends we
should expect continue in those three segments. And the second question, I mean, we
have seen quite dramatic fall in interest rates globally I'd say, yet you stand out as a
Page 9 of 22



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG

company showing higher running yields in the ﬁxed income portfolio when we look at
slide 22, so I wonder how that is possible?

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

You are right, it's not possible. So that when you look at the slide that you'd be careful
with the number and the thing is not annualized. So you have to annualize one to the
other. So I think if you're looking at the GI number (24:56) see 1.33% versus about 2%. Of
course, the correct comparison would be to annualize the 1.33% and you get about 2.66%
versus 2%.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

No, the – to the prior year, it's 1.22%, right, so you improved running yield by some 20
basis points.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The other thing to watch for is, I mean, as we bring cash back to the center, that can have
temporary impacts on how you compare year-over-year. So when you look at this year in
Q2, I mean we can see some distortions because of the cash ﬂow. So in fact the running
yield in GI has actually risen Q2 over Q1. And that's mainly because of some of the internal
routine of cash in the company rather than something that's taking place in the markets
that would be inexplicable. So it's really that, Thomas, we're seeing.
On the P&C business, I mean, I think what you really see – I mean, it's typically the same
answer to the – that I gave to the earlier question. The – I mean, across all the businesses
we are looking proﬁtability. We continue to prioritize that over volume. That process is
going to continue through the reminder of the year. And I think you can still expect to see
a GWP decline ex the RCIS business within that mid-single digit range. And that's going
to be the key driving force for business mix shift in P&C, nothing more than that.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

And in Europe in particular, I am interested like Switzerland is the ambition to regain some
of the lost market share there?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So, I mean, again the ambition for all markets is proﬁtability. I mean, we want to grow
proﬁtability all the time, but we are not going to grow at the expense of the ﬁrm's
required returns. I mean, there are markets that will oﬀer us opportunities to expand I
mean even this year, but in general given the starting point and given the current
prevailing market trends, we expect to shrink the overall volume in P&C.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

In Europe?

FINAL

So it's overall. I mean, again in some markets, in some lines of business. So if you look at,
for example, go back to Switzerland, so you see an improved performance in Switzerland.
We've given a piece of volume on one particular line of business, because we prioritize
proﬁtability in that line, and that we think had a positive outcome for us. I mean, marketby-market we'll respond as market conditions change, but we will give our market share if
that's what's required to deliver the right level of return.

The next question is from Paul De'Ath, RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Paul De'Ath

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Hi, there. And just a couple of kind of – some quick questions from me. Firstly, on
the prior year developments, and there's another kind of rate of (27:46) increase going
through there and oﬀsetting some of the positive developments. I think in Q1 that was
eﬀectively increasing the group reserves. Is that still the case and what's the sort of plan
going forward on that?
And then the second point was just on – you obviously changed your portfolio of
businesses around a bit. You've announced the number of sales. Are those already
included in the numbers (28:17) stripping out the businesses that you've sold or is that still
to come and therefore could provide a boost in the second half? Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Paul. So, on the ﬁrst point PYD, (28:29) the reserve increases in the Group Re
component, so you're seeing exactly what you saw again at Q1. We've taken advantage of
the fact that Group Re comes relatively late in the process, allows us to sit back and look
at all of the risks that the group faces and make an overall judgment of where we would
like to land, and that's exactly what we did.
I mean – I think we all realize that's not a very elegant way to do it. We're not intended to
continue that policy far into the future. I think you'll see that change. So that we'll avoid
this gross (29:03) large PYD where it's a net number that oﬀset at (29:07) the Group Re
equals something that's in line with the guidance. We'll try and make sure that's
integrated in future, but the picture you see is identical to Q1.
On the disposals, I mean we've made – so I mean, you'll realized what's happened, so
Morocco, South Africa, Taiwan, Middle East, there is a very small negative impact from a
goodwill and charge we take in, but it's not material in the result. Most of the impact is not
in yet, and that will come as we close the transaction.

So I think at this stage, the ones that are meaningful from a reported result perspective
will lately close in Q4. And we've got one where we'll take a relatively substantial gain,
one we'll have a (29:58) the intangible book, but we'll have a book value loss, I mean,
overall we expect to see a loss of around $60 million from the transaction so far, most
likely Q4.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes, thank you. Just on the Z-ECM estimate of 107%, there is a footnote that there is a
plus/minus 5 points of margin of error in this quick calculation probably. Would you say
that you're on the conservative side of that? Because I'm otherwise struggling a bit to see
how come after adding, say, 1 point for earning and 2 points for some debt, you're
actually below your 1Q level. So if you could just please comment on that or maybe even
help us more by commenting on the interest rates in place that you expect – do you have
a view on that (31:26)?
Second thing is just on this whole attritional thing, there seems to be an improvement also
in Brazil, or is it only LatAm, but maybe mostly Brazil, which is probably from speaking to
IR around (31:46) 5 points of delta y-o-y. Now we have seen some other players also talk
about an improvement in Brazil. Given where the economy is, et cetera, what do you think
is driving this improvement and are you more bullish about this turnaround story now
than you were last quarter? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Vinit. So on Z-ECM ﬁrst, given this is not a regular year-end. We gave a comment
around some of the increased risk we have around the estimate. We have given you the
best view of what the number is. It wasn't intended to be conservative. It's not intended to
be aggressive. It's intended to be what we expect it to be.

On the moves in sales, I think the – and if you look at what took place in the quarter, your
right, we have some additional capital which is really the reﬁnancing of something that
matured already last year. I think the part that's – it's obviously very diﬃcult to judge for
outsiders, it's actually very diﬃcult to calculate for insiders as well and that's some of the
market moves. Some of them are obvious around spread and equity market. Interest rates
are tougher. The disclosure we gave, we tried to improve it at this time to include some of
the non-ﬁnancial market on the interest rate piece, but it's a parallel shift. And of course,
most often the cuﬀ tends to have a bit of a twist somewhat in it.
And I guess that's what you've seen. I think you saw already in Q1. You see again in Q2 the
very long end, things are pretty ﬂat currently. Also, the Brexit timing, it couldn't be worse
from a ﬁnancial reporting perspective coming at the very end of quarter and, of course,
some of that will have bounced back already as we've entered Q3. But, in essence, what
you see in the Z-ECM move, the impact of ﬁnancial market interest rates and the mark-tomarket impact on equities and corporate partly oﬀset by the issuance of the hybrid.

Bloomberg Transcript

On Brazil, I think the – I hope before, we didn't leave you the impression that we didn't
actually expect to achieve the goals that we set out for Brazil. I think we had the
conﬁdence. I think we talked before about the changes in the team that have taken place,
the increased focus we have there.
I think, from a market perspective, it's quite tough given the economic conditions, but I
think we have the beneﬁt of – we were tackling some particular problems for Zurich, which
I think the team has focused on and addressed very well, so that's certainly helped on the
performance side, and we've also had the beneﬁt of the – we know the impact of a
transaction we did about 18 months ago on the mass consumer side. The volumes on that
deal are impacted by the economic conditions, but the deal is actually performing pretty
well for us. So, I think that combination has helped Brazil produce the performance that
you see now.

Is it large losses as well there, because maybe that's something that could be inﬂuencing?

Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Two questions for me, please. I just
wanted to return to the combined ratio outlook for the full year. Mario mentioned that the
2-point to 3-point improvement is still on track for this year. So, I think that's implying you
kind of do around 97% for the full year 2016. You've already mentioned that H1 is
normalizing at about 98.5% or so.
I wasn't really too clear what you meant around the degree of luck in large losses in the
ﬁrst half, maybe a point or so of good luck. I guess the implication is if you're going get to
97% for full year 2016, then H2 is going to have to be much better than the 98.4% you
published at H1. So could you just help me understand have I done my math right on that
and what is it that's kind of driving close to 95%, 96% in the second half of the year?
And then secondly, around the – just hoping for a little bit more insight into Z-ECM
normalized capital generation, what a kind of normalize run rate is for that. I think based
on your current kind of growth requirements, which – the portfolio is shrinking somewhat
as you re-underwrite and also the level of earnings is probably not quite where you would
like it.
So, if you hit your kind of required target on the combined ratio and once you move to a
kind of more normal level of growth for this company, which I'm sure you can elaborate
on it at the Investor Day, but what should I be thinking about the normalized level of ZECM capital generation and how do you see that in relation to the dividend, please?
Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. So, on the ﬁrst one, so apologies, it was because I gave two answers to the ﬁrst
question, I probably confused some people. So, I talked about the fact that the half year
is, I think, a good gate to what we believe the underlying to be. That would require us to
do better than that in the second half.
I think, for us – one point to bear in mind. We don't expect to oﬀset any natural
catastrophe scenario. So far in the year, we're quite close to – expected to – there's no
signiﬁcant negative impact, but we do expect to see improvement in the second half.
(37:39) if you focus on Q2, the headline number is 99%. We would knock oﬀ about 2.5
points for excess nat cat. We'd probably take about 0.5-point for attritional, it's quite hard
to judge, but given the rate of improvement we've seen that's what we'd expect to see
roughly and through.
On the expenses, we'd expect to see the expense ratio for the year come back up to
around somewhat slightly over 31%. And for the large loss piece, given we believe we
actually have a bit of asset randomness – I don't want to use the work luck, but obviously,
there's some volatility in large losses. I would add back a point for that. I think if you do all
of that for the full year, we'd expect to see the combined ratio aligned in the 97%, 98%
range.

FINAL

On the second topic on capital generation at Z-ECM, in many ways – I think if you look at it
in a very detailed way that becomes a phenomenally complex question to try an answer. I
think if you step back from it and you say, well, let's ignore all the noise that can come
from the mark-to-market element. If we focus a bit on the fact that interest rates are just
very, very low, so the discounting elements are also quite small given our bias to fee and
GI business that also tends to reduce the discounting element to a relatively low level.
You have some of the capital requirements to be driven by some growth, I guess, in the
short term and we're not going to have signiﬁcant growth rates. And I don't mean just
because of the portfolio actions underway, I mean just because of the general prevailing
market trends, so growth in our business will be quite modest. And if you look at the
diversiﬁed capital requirement, it's going to be very, very low for us.
So, for me, I think the best indicator is actually to look at the expected cash generation.
That's a good indication. If you look through all of the capital requirements that exist in
the group to give you a sense of what we expect the capital generation to be. The two in
the longer term are going to synonymous with each other. And we would see cash being
back to the level that we've guided to you before provided we achieve the turnaround
that you can see the beginnings of within GI currently, and that would imply somewhere
around that $3 billion mark.

The next question is from Nick Holmes, Société Générale. Please go ahead.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions. First one is, looking at NAC
and Global Corporate, you're still showing rate increases in a soft market, and I wanted to
ask, do you think this can be relatively easily maintained and, presumably, there are some
pricing pressures you're up against and can you tell us more about which are the lines –
which are the biggest challenge?
And then secondly, turning to the life business, I wondered if you could talk us through
concerns about the low interest rate environment. Your investment margin seems to be
holding up very well. But, I guess, my question speciﬁcally would be if interest rates don't
rise, then when do you see this investment margin starting to erode? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So, on the ﬁrst one, I think the only way that you can really achieve rate increase in the
current market conditions is either being very, very focused in a very small number of
businesses that are actually showing improving rates or by doing the basic things (41:33)
that we're doing on the portfolio currently.

If you look at NAC, NAC has, even ex the RCIA acquisition, headline growth, but the
reality is if we back out the captive impact from that, NAC has a decrease as well. Is that
risk selection that's driving rate. If you look across the businesses that we focus on North
America, given its NAC, what we would see there is that the softer end of the market
continues to be property and workers' comp, has also come oﬀ of a position 18 months
ago when we saw relatively healthy rate increase, and over the course of the last 18
months, it came to a level that's pretty ﬂat today. But it's really risk selection, portfolio
management that's driving the rate improvement. On the life...

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Sorry, George, just as a very quick follow up, other areas of worry for you in maintaining
this big improvement in risk management?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I wouldn't say that it's a worry, but I think what it really means is that the limit (42:46) you
can push this in a relatively soft market condition. So, while we're working on the portfolio
composition, you can expect to see it continue. But once we get to the end of that, we'll
be subject to the same vagaries of the market as everyone else.
So, I think that means that the improvement that we're pushing through the portfolio,
certainly on the loss cost side, they have natural limits given the market trend. I think on
expenses, we can deﬁnitely do more. But the loss cost side, obviously, has limits.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Okay.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On the life business topic, obviously, the interest rate moves are – it's not new, it's not
helpful for the life business in general. It's particularly problematic ﬁrst on markets in
Europe. I think you know already that the markets that are particularly impacted are
markets that we de-prioritized quite some time ago. So they are relatively a smaller part of
our portfolio.
So we're less exposed to the downside, although we're also less exposed to the upside.
For us, (43:54) rates really don't rise. For example, in Germany, it means the initial
pressure that we'll see from ZZR, we've talked before about the impact between 2017,
2018, 2020, 2021 and the need to fund ZZR. Just for Germany, that impact will continue
for much longer if interest rates don't eventually start to demonstrate some upward
momentum.
I think if interest rates do stay here, I think we all obviously assume – it can't be assume.
Insurance companies would have to act. The model is that we pass this through as part of
our business model. Maybe given the current competitive market conditions, it's diﬃcult
to do that, but at some point, we all have to do it. And if interest rates stay where they are,
I don't think that day is particularly far ahead of us.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thank you very much for that. Can I just quickly follow-up with a speciﬁc question
on the speed of the impact from low interest rate? If you say – you've described in the past
in Germany, pressure building sort of over ﬁve years. Can you be more speciﬁc as to the
eﬀect on the investment margin over the next two years if interest rates do not rise?
Would you actually expect much eﬀect on the new earnings or not really? Would it be
longer down the road?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

The short answer is, if we assume that the interest rates stay where they are and we really
do nothing in response, what it really means is that much further down the road, the
earnings don't recover as quickly as they would otherwise. I don't see that it accelerate
things, but equally I don't really believe that's the outcome we're going to have. I would
expect us to take action to start to pass through the impact of that in the products that we
have.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Right.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

If we don't do that, that issue is – because of the duration that we have in the portfolio, we
have many years before you have the problem. You don't have the recovery you'd expect
to see.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

So, for the next couple of years, you wouldn't expect to see much negative impact from
low rates?

A - George Quinn

And so my question is really to ﬁnd out or to try and see how much more there is in terms
of improvement. On the combined ratio, if I look at it from two points of view. So the ﬁrst

FINAL

question, you explained in great detail and answered to the last question and the one
before where the combined ratio could be. But I'm still not clear whether that means the
second half combined ratio, so somewhere between 97% and 98% or the full year
combined ratio between 97% and 98%?
And, of course, I'd like to hear the answer 97% to 98% for the full year, because that
implies that there's a big improvement coming in the second half if you did 98.5% in the
ﬁrst half and 97.5% for the full year, you need 96.5% in the second. And then kind of in
pretty much the same topic, you discussed a lot the impact of the pricing, but you didn't
identify separately, and I just wondered if that could come on top, the beneﬁt of all those
cancellations in your Tier 4 where you're canceling twice as many or twice as much as you
would in the other portfolios. So you're retaining 62%, although you're retaining 80%, so
you're canceling huge amounts, so hopefully, they are very bad or not very attractive
business? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So the combined ratio gain was for full year. So we expect to produce a combined ratio
within that 97%, 98% range full year. On the cancellation, a couple of comments on that
ﬁrst, so the – you've seen (48:18), we talked already I think on Q1 the proportion of the
business that was in Tier 4 in particular.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Could you remind us? I had forgotten that.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

(48:29) I think it was somewhere in the mid to high teens, percentage wise of the overall
portfolio. Tier 4, just because of the portfolio mix and the renewals that we have in Q2, is
actually quite a bit smaller. So it's maybe slightly more than half of the size of Tier 4 in Q1.
Then the cancellation element is fully factored into the rate change component, so I think
if you look at that and you're using the volumes to project forward the beneﬁt of that rate
ﬁtting through, I think to then separate that part of the portfolio (49:07) I think I'd probably
be double counting, Michael, if did. So, I look at the rate change as the base indicator to
the improvement you should expect to see.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

The 14%?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Well, I wouldn't pick out only that one piece. I look at the overall portfolio, so 1.5% overall.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

1.5%, okay. I just have one tine little bit. On solvency, so I was a little bit disappointed by
the 107%. I didn't think that you had so much in sensitivity to market, particularly because
Page 18 of 22



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2016-08-11

you're not so big in German life. Is there – at what stage should we – would you see a
potential risk that you're merely 100% lower than (49:48) your target range?

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I guess, the ﬁrst thing, maybe a couple of comments around how we measure things. I
think I regret the fact that we didn't double the index that we use because we can be
down about 214% solvency ratio against the target of 200% to 220%. Our sensitivities are
greater not because of a risk driver, but because of the methodology to supply.
So, we have no – unlike Solvency II, we don't have the beneﬁt of the ultimate forward rate,
we don't have the beneﬁt of matching adjustment, we don't have the beneﬁt of volatility
adjustment. So, in our numbers, you get a complete mark-to-market movement. That
means that as a company, we've tried to calibrate our range to allow for that and we
accept the fact you'll see more volatility in our ﬁgures.

Bloomberg Transcript

Given what's happened in this quarter, I'd expect to see a bounce back from a
combination of -some of retrace we've seen in the market since the end of the quarter
and, of course, we have been doing – it wasn't driven by this, but we have a reﬁnancing
program underway. And one of the things we've done is reﬁnance a piece of senior as
hybrid. And that of course will beneﬁt the capital strength of the group in the second half.
I think if you prepared to step back and look at the sensitivity from a real world
perspective, we could not be more sensitive to this issue than most of our European peers
given the mix. So it's purely a reported number issue. And of course, we won't – we're not
going to panic. I think we see a capital number that's resilient. We're roughly in the
middle of our range. The trend we expect for Q2 will be positive, but of course, we don't
know what will happen in terms of markets through the remainder of this quarter or next.
But, overall, from a capitalization perspective, we feel quite comfortable.

Hi. Thanks so much, guys. A couple of questions, both about cost, I'm afraid. So what
you've done in the U.K. is kind of bring the life and GI businesses close together under
common management. And I think this is kind of mainly the life guys who are running
that. And so the presses are jumping on it and kind of doing the (53:10) in the GI
business. I just want to think is that the kind of strategy you're going to rollout? Is it going
to be bringing the kind of life and GI businesses close to together and kind of how is that
going to work in terms of a life guy managing a GI business and vice versa?
And I guess, the question on cost savings was, so I know you talked about the life cost
savings being shared with the policy holders. But, obviously, you've achieved a life cost
savings and you put it through the renewal cost reduction in that year, you certainly get a
leverage beneﬁt on your earnings and a leverage beneﬁts also on capital, I guess. So, I
guess the question is, so can you break down the kind of $1 billion in 2018 or the $300
million beneﬁt is between life and non-life and give us an idea about how that impact ZECM. Do you get kind of big beneﬁt when you realize the cost saving through the life
business? Thank you.

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Andy, this is Mario. I kindly ask George to take care of the last question because I wouldn't
be able to address it. On the campus organization, yes, we're putting together life in GI in
the campus and we're testing now this simpler organization in three European countries,
but not yet in UK. UK is a diﬀerent market. In there, what we want to achieve is to have a
uniﬁed digital view on the UK market, avoiding having competing request from this joint
business unit. But I don't think that we will go into the direction in UK of merging GI and
life. I don't think this make sense given the market.
Now, this is mainly relevant to retail. In retail, I think it does make full sense to do this,
because when you confront an individual, the individual doesn't really distinguish
between products. They have needs and they don't like to have diﬀerent answers to their
needs depending on to which Zurich units the people bringing the answers belong to. So
there are lot of advantages in terms of customer management and customer facing in
unifying the retail management skills and people.

Now, you said how can life people run GI? So, ﬁrst of all, we're already have in
Switzerland, Germany, in Italy country CEOs who are already in charge of both
businesses, and I think they have proven competences irrespective of where they're
coming from before. What we're doing is not only working on the country CEO, but
unifying the country structures, which we're, even under on CEO, often still disjoint from
each other.
And ultimately, your question is if we will choose good or a proper country CEOs given
the skills we have available. I think, so far, I'm pretty much relaxed that we have
competences in place and we will closely monitor also for the future. Did I catch your
question?

A - George Quinn

And the other one on the life cost savings, so let me answer it to the extent that the cost
saving impacts life is a capitalization impact and given the duration of the business, that
can have a positive impact. The short answer is, I don't know the answer to your question
today. The main focus is actually on driving the cost of assessment, improving the
operating performance. And if you allow me, I'll give you more thoughts when we come
back for the Investor Day and we touch on costs again there. But you're absolutely right.

Hi. Thanks very much. Just a quick and boring one from my side on the tax rate, you have
clearly guided for what we should expect in the second half of the year. Just wondering if
the previous guidance of around 25% normalized tax rate is still valid for the years after
that so what's driving the diﬀerence also for the second half of the year and how we
should think about that? That's all. Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Niccolo. They are still valid. So the longer term expectation is still around that 25%
range. What's really driving what you see at the moment is, the principle thing is
restructuring. So we had restructuring last year, we have it again this year. It tends to fall
disproportionately in the centre and we get very limited tax relief on that cost. And that's
what tends to push the rate up.

Page 21 of 22

We have another factor in the ﬁrst half, which is around the cat losses or cat protection.
Our center of excellence for that is in Bermuda and that also means we get in a bad year
less tax relief then we would like. But the main driver is restructuring, but longer term,
25%.

I'll just remind you tomorrow, obviously, we have the supplementary call around the GI
reserve disclosures. There's also a webcast with that. So please follow that from the slides.
So, with that, we'd close the call. And thank you and look forward to speaking to you in
due course.
