Thanks, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us
today. Earlier this morning, we announced a ﬁrst quarter net operating income per share
of $1.37, well ahead of last year, as a repeat of challenging winter conditions was oﬀset by
lower catastrophe losses and the beneﬁts of our action plans.

Bloomberg Transcript

From an underwriting perspective, our combined ratio of 93.4% reﬂects the negative
impact of weather on our auto businesses but also the strong results in our two property
and liability lines. Our eﬀorts to grow our distribution activities also contributed to the
earnings growth in the quarter. In combination, these factors led to an operating ROE of
17.2%, well ahead of last year.
Turning to our two primary ﬁnancial objectives, 2014's signiﬁcant rebound in net
operating income per share put our trend back on track, with an average annual growth
rate of 13% since 2011, above our target of 10% per year growth over time. From an ROE
respective, we target to outperform the industry by at least 500 basis points every year.
We've done so by 730 basis points on average since 2011 and did so by 820 basis points
last year.
When I look at the results we generated in the ﬁrst quarter, I'm pleased overall, but
disappointed that we didn't make an underwriting proﬁt in our personal auto line of
business. We do not view this result as the beginning of a troubling trend, but rather the
impact of a severe winter, particularly in Quebec and Atlantic Canada.
Our Home Improvement Plan was fully rolled out in 2014 and contributed to the very
strong 80.7% combined ratio for personal property in Q1 2015. Our commercial P&C
action plan also contributed positively to results and helped lead to a 90.9% combined
ratio during the quarter.
In auto, the Ontario government's rate and cost reduction mandate has resulted in an
average rate reduction of approximately 7.1% for the industry as of the end of the quarter.
Government cost reduction measures to date include tightening of the minor injury
guidelines, licensing of healthcare clinics to reduce fraud, and Bill 15, which was passed
late last year and is becoming eﬀective as regulations are deﬁned.
The savings from Bill 15 include a reduction in prejudgment interest to levels closer to
current interest rates, a streamlining of the dispute resolution system, and protection for
consumers against untrustworthy towing and storage providers. In recognition of Ontario

FINAL

Bill 15, we elected to take additional rate reductions, bringing our cumulative rate
decrease to 9.6% since August 2014 – 2013, excuse me.
Two weeks ago, the Ontario government released the budget outlining additional actions
to reduce costs. These include updating the catastrophic impairment deﬁnition and
reducing the standard duration of medical and rehabilitation beneﬁts to be more in line
with that of other provinces. The budget also outlined some ways to translate cost savings
to lower rates for consumers. As expected, these changes will go a long way to improve
aﬀordability of the product, though the precise impact will become more apparent, as
regulations are deﬁned in the coming months.
We feel comfortable with the changes taking place in Ontario auto and will continue to
pursue growth in that market. Overall, for IFC, underlying growth of approximately 3% in
Q1 maintained the similar pace to the prior quarter, as mid-single digit growth in
commercial lines and personal property oﬀset slower growth in personal auto.

Bloomberg Transcript

The industry continues to move in property lines, as market conditions have ﬁrmed and
our relative position has improved. Units were up 1% in personal property during the
quarter despite the headwind from our full product changes and rate action. When it
comes to our outlook for the industry, we expect continued hard market conditions in
personal property to drive upper single-digit growth in that line of business, helping to
oﬀset our expectation of slightly negative growth in personal auto.
Commercial P&C has ﬁrmed in the past year. Rate increases at renewal in this segment
were again close to 5% in the ﬁrst quarter. We think that the low interest rate environment
and minimal proﬁts at the industry level give us comfort in projecting a mid-single digit
level of growth for the commercial lines industry in 2015. Overall, we expect low-single
digit industry growth across all lines.
As for IFC, our growth ambitions have not changed. Our ﬁnancial position remains strong
with approximately $600 million of excess capital, after ﬁnancing our acquisition of CDI
solely with excess capital. Our objective is to leverage our underwriting performance by
reinvesting our capital to expand our position here in Canada. Our multi-channel
distribution strategy is gaining momentum, and the industry outlook is conducive to
organic growth despite rate decreases in Ontario auto.
I mentioned the more focused branding approach on our last call. One of our major
objectives is to see Intact Insurance and belairdirect, our two core brands, become
household names for Canadians. We'll focus in the coming months and years our eﬀorts
on showcasing these brands with signiﬁcant investment in marketing.
We've also been very clear that our direct and distribution operations are key areas of
focus for growth in the near-term. Our acquisition of Canadian Direct broadens our directto-consumer platform from coast to coast and facilitates our goal of doubling our direct
capabilities in the coming year. All this while providing immediate earnings accretion and
surpassing our target of a 15% internal rate of return. I welcome the CDI team to Intact and
look forward to shaping a strong platform in Western Canada together.

FINAL

In conclusion, we're energized by our prospects for 2015 and beyond, and believe that
the disciplined approach we take towards operating our business will continue to serve us
well. I believe that we're well positioned to excel in the current environment, aided by a
strong capital position, which enables us to execute upon a fortunate piece for proﬁtable
growth. As we look forward, we're conﬁdent in our ability to grow our platform and
become one of the most respected companies in Canada.
With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Louis Marcotte.

Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles. Good morning, everyone. I'll focus my remarks on three topics this
morning; our operating results, our lines of business, and our balance sheet. First on
operating results, from a top-line point of view, our underlying direct premiums written
grew by 3% for a second quarter in a row, on the back of continued hard market
conditions and personal property, ﬁrmer conditions in commercial lines, and low-single
digit growth in auto.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our combined ratio improved 3.7 points to 93.4% in the quarter, as beneﬁts from our
actions to improve proﬁtability helped oﬀset the impact of a long and cold winter,
particularly in Eastern Canada. As weather-related losses tended not to reach the
catastrophe threshold this quarter, our underlying current year loss ratio increased two
points to 73.1% while catastrophe losses were lower by 3.7 points.
As usual, favorable prior-year development in Q1 is higher than other quarters of the year
and helped mitigate the weather eﬀect on our results. Net investment income of $105
million in the quarter was unchanged from a year ago, as the beneﬁt of higher average
investments was oﬀset by lower yields. This is in line with our expectations and is a
reasonable run rate for the rest of the year.
Net distribution income in the quarter increased by $9 million from last year to $20 million
due to growth of our distribution operations as well as higher proﬁtability. We remain on
track to hit our run rate of $100 million in distribution income in 2015 and are happy to
report that BrokerLink has now hit the $1 billion mark in terms of annual direct premiums
written. Finally, our expense ratio of 30.2% was 0.4% higher than last year, which had
beneﬁted from a lower level of variable compensation.
Moving to our lines of business, personal auto premiums increased 1% in the quarter on a
1% increase in units, as growth in other markets oﬀset the impact of rate reductions in
Ontario. The combined ratio in the ﬁrst quarter was 100.3% in a winter marked by record
cold temperatures, which led to a higher underlying current year loss ratio.
This was partly oﬀset by an increase in favorable prior-year claims development, due
partly to our increasing comfort with the eﬀectiveness of auto reforms. Personal property
premiums grew by 5% on an underlying basis, while units grew by 1%, reﬂective of
continued hard market conditions. All planned actions under our Home Improvement

FINAL

Plan will have completed one renewal cycle in May of this year and we estimate that the
ultimate beneﬁts were roughly 90% earned in Q1 2015.
We reported a combined ratio of 80.7% in the quarter, 11 points better than last year,
helped by an absence of catastrophe losses and by actions under our Home
Improvement Plan. On the commercial side, auto premiums were up 8% year-over-year,
as we continued to beneﬁt from strong growth in trucking ﬂeets. As with personal auto,
commercial auto was also heavily impacted by challenging winter conditions, which drove
the combined ratio 7 points higher to 96.4%.
The commercial P&C business saw decent top-line growth of 3%, beneﬁting from higher
rates. Units declined slightly in the quarter due to timing of contracts, though retention
levels and new business activity observed in the quarter continued to support our view
that the commercial lines market is ﬁrming. The combined ratio improved by 15 points to
90.9%, helped by rate increases, low catastrophe losses and high favorable prior-year
development. As such, we are continuing our commercial P&C action plan with the goal
of running this business in the low 90%s on a sustainable basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

Finally, a few comments on our balance sheet. Our investment portfolio is of high quality
and well diversiﬁed. At quarter-end, investments amounted to $13.4 billion, 9% higher
than a year ago. Our portfolio generated net investment gains of $101 million in the
quarter, as higher bond prices more than oﬀset $30 million of impairments on equity
investments. The energy sector, which represents approximately 7% of our total portfolio,
represented half of the impairments.
The federal budget released in April included items which could aﬀect the tax treatment
of certain dividends. Although the rules are not yet ﬁnal, they could increase our annual
tax bill by approximately $12 million to $15 million, starting in November of this year.
However, we believe we can oﬀset most of these lost earnings through mix, strategy or
other portfolio changes, while maintaining our prudent risk management approach.
We ended the quarter in a strong ﬁnancial position, with an estimated MCT of 213% and
excess capital of $763 million. Pro forma our CDI acquisition, which closed on May 1, we
remain in a strong position with excess capital of $600 million. Our book value per share
at quarter-end was 12% higher than a year ago and we delivered an operating ROE of
17.2% over the last 12 months.
The planning process for the CDI integration is already well underway and we continue to
expect the acquisition to be 2% accretive to NOIPS in the near-term. This acquisition
expands our direct-to-consumer presence from coast to coast and is expected to deliver
$10 million in annual synergies once this run rate is reached in mid-2017.
In conclusion, we are happy with the strength of our operations through this challenging
winter and are looking forward to the prospect of adding CDI with its track record of solid
underwriting results into our platform. We remain in a strong ﬁnancial position to pursue
further strategic investments, which, coupled with our talented group of employees and

our robust operating platforms, should allow us to continue to outperform the industry's
ROE by at least 500 basis points every year.
With that, I would turn the call to Dennis.

{BIO 15155973 <GO>}

Thanks, Louis. Jonathan, we are now ready to take questions.

Q&A
Operator
Your ﬁrst question comes from Geoﬀ Kwan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. First question I had was just on the Ontario auto. Obviously, I can
appreciate it may not be easy to kind of quantify the impact of what came out from the
budget, but directionally the way that you think about it and what might happen is – how
much more, if any, do you think might still need to come on the cost reduction side if the
15% premium hit is going to get achieved?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I'll ask Patrick to give you his perspective on this.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

So, on the 15% to start with, it's not necessarily a target any more that is presented in our
discussions. The recent budget of Ontario contains good reforms that will reduce costs. It
will have to go through regulations in more detail for us to be able to exactly estimate the
cost savings, but it's probably a few points. Based on the high-level information we have,
it could be something like four points probably. It could vary with ﬁnal regulations.
In terms of timing for rate decrease, the next steps are we expect in the next few days to
get a more detailed description of what those reforms will look like and then it will take a
few months to go through a detailed regulation. After that, the industry in collaboration
with government will have to estimate precisely how much it's worth and we'll probably
then go through the ﬁling process to reﬂect that into our rates. But we don't expect that
those rates could be eﬀective before the ﬁrst part of 2016.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think, Geoﬀ, if you look at the budget, it is setting a very clear direction for the
regulations to come out. And they're really focused on what I think are important items.
Having a stronger cat deﬁnition and we've talked to investors about that in the past year, it
looks like it's materializing now. I think to include attendant care with medical
rehabilitation, both at the catastrophic level and in the base product are also I think pretty
Page 6 of 20

FINAL

eﬀective measures. And then to reduce the timeline on the med rehab front from 10 years
to ﬁve years, these are all steps that move the product somewhat closer to other
jurisdictions. It remains, let's be very clear, a richer product than in any other jurisdiction in
the country. But I think the government is really focused on the right things here to bring
back aﬀordability of the product in the system.
It will take some time, as Patrick is saying, but there is meat in this budget, and we'll
cooperate with the government to get the best regulation possible to achieve their
objective. Timing, early 2016 in this case, we think, but we'll see as things evolve this
summer.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay. And then, staying on the Ontario auto front, the change – the slight tweak in the
wording on your outlook on Ontario or – sorry – personal auto, slight negative growth for
the industry level versus low-single digit, I think, was the wording from last quarter. Was
that just related maybe to what happened with the Ontario budget and the likelihood of
further cost reductions and further kind of the revenue?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. I think, Geoﬀ, we've been talking about ﬂat low-single digit in part because of the
Ontario reductions that were in the system. We've seen the second half of 2014 industry
results come out a few weeks ago, where basically there is mild negative growth after one
year of almost – maybe not one year, a little less than a year of Ontario auto rate decrease.
We're now seeing a budget with meaningful cost reduction, and I think we're taking a
cautious stance here to say, in aggregate, I think you can expect at best a ﬂat automobile
industry growth, likely low-single digit negative growth for that line of business, driven by
Ontario automobile.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay. And last question I had was just on the M&A landscape, maybe an update on
anything domestic, international? And given the strong valuation multiple you guys are
trading at, does that change, if at all, your appetite in terms of doing acquisitions?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Our review of the environment has not changed. On the contrary, I think that what we've
been talking about for a number of years keeps materializing. And there is no external
forces that would lead us to think that this perspective that 15 points to 20 points of
market share will change hands has changed. As you know, we used to say 25 points to
30 points. There is more than 15 points that have changed hands. We think there is much
less than the forces at play. You should see that happen in the near mid and right up to a
60-month horizon. Our view has not changed there.
And regardless of our valuations, I mean, we look at deals for what they are and they have
to make sense regardless of the ﬁnancing. So I would say, no, this doesn't really change
Page 7 of 20



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

our perspective. These deals have to be ﬁnancial home runs, they have to be strategic,
and that's where it stops.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. And then, sorry, on the international side?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well, the international side, as you know, is positioning for the longer term. We've done a
small transaction in Brazil last year. I think one can expect to see some activity in the
coming 12 months. It is positioning for the longer term. Our focus is really to expand our
platform here, integrate CDI and continue to bolster our distribution because the growth
opportunity and the capital deployment opportunities are, I think, very attractive right
where we're leading. So that's where the focus is.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thank you.

Operator
Your next question comes from John Aiken with Barclays. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - John C. Aiken

{BIO 21267604 <GO>}

Good morning. I would like to explore the prior-year claims recoveries that you had this
quarter. Now, I know that there is a seasonality in the ﬁrst quarter. You mentioned in the
MD&A conﬁdence in terms of the Ontario auto cost reductions. As well though, it does
look like you've had some signiﬁcant recoveries as well on the personal property and on
commercial P&C lines. When does this ﬂow through in terms of ongoing claims in terms
of the Ontario auto? When will we see this actually go through into the lower claims ratios
if you actually are conﬁdent in the lower cost associated with auto? And can we
extrapolate that out as well in terms of the property lines?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So – you're absolutely right, John, that the ﬁrst quarter is always stronger in terms of prior
year development. It's normal because it's the quarter that's the closest to the prior year.
So if you look at the activity in Q1, half of the activity comes from 2014. If you go back in
time, you see that last year, for instance, our prior year development in Q1 is 7.6%. And if
you go back two years, it's about 6%. There's volatility. I think what the unusually strong
prior-year development this quarter is, there's probably a two points, three points beyond
what one should expect in Q1. And I think there's a number of areas where we're seeing
maybe items that are not recurrent in nature. First, we've seen more favorable
development on short-tail type claims for a number of reasons, but ranging from weatherdriven right up to the positioning that our actuaries took at the end of last year on shortterm claims.

Page 8 of 20



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

Date: 2015-05-06

FINAL

We're seeing, indeed, a drop in uncertainty as a result of reforms from coast to coast,
Ontario being the most important obviously, coupled with court decisions that have been
rendered recently, which adds to our comfort. So you probably have a point there more
than what one would expect. And ﬁnally in commercial lines, indeed, you probably have
another point above what otherwise would have been a normal favorable development in
the quarter, a bit of volatility and a bit related to large losses.

Q - John C. Aiken

{BIO 21267604 <GO>}

So – and Charles, if – in 2014, there was some embedded conservatism in the claims
development that if it's related to the Ontario auto reforms, at some point going forward,
are the actuaries going to reduce the claims cost associated with that? Or are we going to
see recurring, call it, 1 percentage point higher recoveries from prior years on an ongoing
basis?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

If you look at the underlying current year loss ratio in automobile insurance in aggregate,
and I don't want to start focusing on provinces per se, I mean, for the past four years or
ﬁve years, they've been in the low 70%s, 70% to 73%. And indeed there's been favorable
development, probably higher than what one should expect. The reforms are one
element of that. The AXA transaction are also one element of that. And so I don't want to
guide folks towards a lower current accident year loss ratio or a more favorable
development. I think we're taking a cautious stance at running the business. Sometimes it
goes above our historical pattern of 3% to 4%, which has been the case in the past few
years. But I wouldn't want people to be too excited past 4-ish% going forward.

Q - John C. Aiken

Your next question comes from Shubha Khan with National Bank Financial. Please go
ahead.

Q - Shubha Khan

{BIO 16255963 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning. So, just a follow-up to Geoﬀ's question on Ontario auto there.
Should I – should we think of the government's initial previous target of hitting rate
reductions – 15% rate reduction by August 2015 is no longer a ﬁrm deadline so that that's
pushed out to 2016 and it's been made contingent upon further clarity on what the
budget proposals might look like in regulation?

FINAL

Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

Date: 2015-05-06

I think the government's objective has not changed and I think they've created a lot of
momentum. I mean, if you look at our own situations, rates have dropped by more than –
are dropping by more than 9% into these reform on the back of a number of initiatives
that the government has ruled out. So there's a lot of momentum in the system. And I
think the point we're making is, we're seeing the budget now. Other meaningful reforms
that have the potential of limiting inﬂation in the system and bringing, as Patrick said, I
don't know, 3 points, 4 points, 5 points, we'll see what the regs will be in a few months
from now. I think momentum is in the system and there's lots to show for.
Now, when it will be eﬀective, I think it's indeed later in 2015, early in 2016. It's just
practicality. But I think they've done what they had to do to come up with meaningful
reforms. This is a pretty complex product that the government has to deal with and I think
they've gone as fast as they could in the current context. Don't forget that they've had to
go through an election last spring, which basically obviously slowed down, and I'm not
sure it was their decision to go through an election process. So I think stakeholders
understand that. They are going as fast as they can, and I think they are focused on the
right things. And they are headed in the right direction deﬁnitely towards their objective.

Q - Shubha Khan

{BIO 16255963 <GO>}

Okay. And just a follow-up to that. When I look at your -- the rate of reductions that IFC
has delivered so far, so 9.6%, does any of that relate to your telematics rollout or is that
immaterial so far?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yes, there is about 2 points of that 9-plus% that is linked to the launch of our UBI initiatives
or telematics. We've already reﬂected part of the penetration that we expect with that
product and the average discount is about 10% for clients, and yes, it's part of the total
9%.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, absolutely.

Q - Shubha Khan

{BIO 16255963 <GO>}

Okay. So that – and that would reﬂect the higher than industry rate of reduction that you
delivered so far, right?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. And I think the other thing is that when Bill 15 came out, which is in the process of
being ﬁnalized, we looked at that, decided to take a leadership position and reﬂect, I
think, the good work that the government has done on Bill 15 before the others.

Q - Shubha Khan

{BIO 16255963 <GO>}

Okay. Final question on commercial P&C, you're looking for another 4 points in combined
ratio improvement under your action plan. Will those 4 points mainly come from product

Page 10 of 20



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

changes or are you contemplating rate increases as well? I mean, it looks like unit growth
has suﬀered because of the action plan. So I'm just wondering whether you'll be looking
to deemphasize pricing actions right now.

FINAL

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Well, I would say that there is no plan to deemphasize the pricing action that we have,
and what we're seeing is there's about 4 points to be earned, because as the price
increase are going, they're not eﬀective immediately on the loss ratio. They need to be
earned over a 12-month period. So, basically, what we're seeing is that with all the action
we've done so far and what we're continuing to do, we're looking at still 4 points to be
earned in the next 12 months coming from our current action plan although the impact on
the unit and the growth is immediate on the top line.
Although I would have one comment on the unit growth on commercial lines, because
commercial lines, we have average premium that can range from $500 to a few million
dollar. So we track the growth mostly on the premium situation. And in fact, in our current
ﬁrst quarter result, the reduction in unit, more than half of it is related to a very small
program that we canceled where we had a lot of certiﬁcates at very, very low premiums.
So the impact on the premium is much less than the impact on the unit.

Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Paul Holden with CIBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Thank you. Just a couple questions for you. First one with respect to Ontario auto, just
wondering how your loss experience is trending there, and in particular, what the
experience was in Q1, given that the overall result was up, but you attributed to poor
weather in Quebec and the Atlantic provinces. So, just wondering how Ontario is trending
if you're actually seeing the margin stability you expected.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I'll let Patrick comment on that.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yeah. So our Q1 auto results are really driven, so the – if I start with the – mainly the
underlying loss ratio, is really driven by the weather that we experienced in the Eastern
part of the country. Overall, if you look at it by region, starting from Atlantic, the
underlying loss ratio deteriorated by a signiﬁcant margin in Atlantic, by also an important
one in Quebec. Ontario, just a slight deterioration really compared to last year and it's ﬂat
in the Alberta. So, Ontario was slightly impacted by the weather, but not as much as

Quebec and Atlantic. And when you look overall in all those places, it's really physical
damage or small collisions. It's not driven by any BI or AB trend.

FINAL

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. And then in terms of your rate decrease, 9.6% versus the industry at 7.1%, would you
expect that gap to narrow going forward or do you think that gap will be persistent? And
then if it is going to be persistent, how should we look at that?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

We expect that gap to narrow. Of course, every player makes their own decision. It's
super-competitive. In Ontario, there's 25 active players. Very few industries that I think are
competitive like that. People are waiting to see the color of Bill 15. I think then we'll get
more color on regs and I think it's a question of month, as far as I'm concerned, where
people will reﬂect that into their rate positions.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. And just one ﬁnal question is, with respect to progress on growing specialty lines,
cyber risk, long-haul trucking, et cetera., maybe you can provide some commentary on
those growth initiatives.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Paul, I'll ask Alain Lessard to comment on that, just to clarify that cyber risk part as an
initiative for the main products and then will comment on specialty lines as well.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 21962461 <GO>}

Well, Paul, I can maybe start with cyber risk. We just launched our oﬀer on cyber risk,
basically April 1. So it's just after the end of the ﬁrst quarter. So far, we are very pleased
with the response either from broker and from clients. Like I said, our product is the ﬁrst
venture into that product. It's adapted to the type of clients we have. We're not looking at
international clients. We're looking at basically simple risk commercial lines. So our oﬀer is
targeted to that. But so far, we are pleased with the response. We'll be in a better position
to comment on numbers and growth probably in a quarter or two quarter to see what's
the take-up rate.
On the trucking side and the specialty lines, I would say we're – the trucking is basically
when we look at the growth in commercial auto, which is in the range of about 7.8% in the
quarter, half of the growth is coming from the commercial auto – half of the growth in
commercial auto is coming from trucking. And we're pleased, because what we're seeing
right now, some of that growth is associated with account that we lost a few years ago at
much lower premium. And it's probably – although the commercial auto is still very
competitive, the trucking piece in the commercial auto is a sector, which we're now
seeing a little bit ﬁrming up. And some of those accounts are coming back to us at the
same kind of pricing we had when we lost them to lower price. So we're quite happy for
the response. And in fact, I think we're now being in a position to leverage the acquisition
we did with Jevco, an acquisition on the trucking side. Okay?
Page 12 of 20

On the specialty line, this is a more long-term objective. To grow that, it's a much more
complex market, lots of lines and everything. Our focus right now is basically making sure
we're growing the trucking. And we're looking at seeing how we can improve our
presence on the Ontario side.

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. So there is good growth in specialty lines, upper single-digit, low-double digit
depending on the segment you're looking at. This is – we could be bigger in specialty
lines. I ﬁnd our progress is slow on that front, and more eﬀorts will be put on that front I
think in the coming months and 2016, but good performance overall and good organic
growth. Just not enough.

Q - Paul Holden

Your next question comes from Mario Mendonca with TD Securities. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mario C. Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Good morning. I think, Charles, you may have addressed this – I'm sorry, you may have
addressed this in the previous question. But speciﬁcally on page 13 of the MD&A, you
refer to the Ontario Superior Court decision related to prejudgment interest. And my – the
ﬁrst part of the question is, I would assume that went through reserve development in
personal auto. And if so, could you just describe that dynamic, how that actually aﬀects
the company, and if you could quantify it as well?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Absolutely. I'll ask Mathieu to give you the operational perspective and what that means
in practice.

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

Is that – in Bill 15, there was a reduction of the prejudgment interest from 5% to 1.3%. The
question is in the implementation, does that apply to open cases or to interest earned on
open cases as of January 1.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

On new cases.

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

On new cases. Recently we had a court decision on April 15 that stated that this would
apply to all open cases. So this is more, I'd say, a generous position for us compared to
what was in the expected. So it is reﬂected in our Q1 results, a small portion of it. There is

Page 13 of 20



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

uncertainty. This will be appealed or will probably be appealed. And so that's why there's
a margin of conservatism on how much we reﬂected in Q1.

Q - Mario C. Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

FINAL

Could you tell us how much that aﬀected Q1 and if there – maybe a sense for what's
remaining?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. When I talk about the reduction in uncertainty and conﬁdence in reform, I
mentioned there probably was a point there. Part of that point, a little more than $15
million is related to this decision.

Q - Mario C. Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Okay. But presumably there is more than $15 million remaining if you became fully
conﬁdent?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, indeed, Mario, because this was a court decision post-quarter, which we felt needed
to be partly reﬂected in the quarter results, and it's early. There is uncertainty. There is
various thresholds that this will need to go through, and as such, yes, indeed. The -

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mario C. Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

The $15 million pre-tax is the right number to think about?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Mario C. Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Okay. And then, if you could provide some context around the $22 million gain on
investments in associate – it's a number I haven't paid too much attention to, but it sort of
– it moved higher this quarter. So, some context there would be helpful.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

So, Mario, as we are growing our broker network and increasing our equity stakes in
them, we basically have step acquisitions if you want. And when we increase the
ownership, that ﬁgures a gain from the historical cost to the current value, and those are
the gains that you are seeing through non-operating earnings.

Q - Mario C. Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

The $22 million is a fairly meaningful number in a given quarter. Should we just assume
it's going to be lumpy and every once in a while, we'll see a gain like this?

Okay.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

It's been active. As you know, we've been very active last year. So you're seeing a couple
of transactions close in Q1, which triggers these gains. But I would say it's lumpy going
forward.

Your next question comes from Doug Young with Desjardins Capital. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Hi. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but one thing I want to go back
to was just the impact of weather in this quarter. If I look at your current year accident year
combined ratio deterioration year-over-year, it looked like it was around 2.5 points, and
maybe, Louis, I think maybe you mentioned it, that weather had a 2 point impact in the
quarter. Is that right? So, essentially, if we were to exclude weather, the current accident
year combined ratio would be relatively ﬂat. Am I thinking about that correctly?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

I guess my two points was the overall underlying loss deterioration, and we think most of
it is weather.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. It's the right way to think about it, Doug. And in fact, if you look at where the current
accident year deterioration is taking place, it's essentially in personal and commercial
lines automobile, which from our perspective is largely weather-driven.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Okay. And then just coming back to the prior-year reserve development question, I guess
presumably once you get some comfort with the new reforms and the budget, there
would be an additional release of reserves that would come through. I would presume
that you're holding some conservatism around that as well. I guess, is that correct? And
can you kind of talk about – if you could quantify and talk about what that could mean. But
what I'm trying to go with it is, essentially, are we talking about positive reserve

Page 15 of 20

developments for Intact over the next few years, staying in the 7% to 9% range versus
maybe the 3% to 5% that you mentioned is more the historical average?

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Couple of points, Doug. If you look at the past four years, it's been on an annual basis
closer to 4%, 5%, which is above the range we've guided towards historically. When you
say 7% to 9%, I would say this is a Q1 observation, and therefore, very important to
understand the seasonality that exist there. I think that the fact that we've been above our
3% to 4% range in the past four years or ﬁve years, AXA came on board with a stronger
ﬁnancial position than we had assumed when we bought that business. That contributed
to the excess of 3%, 4%, or the excess of 4% here, and clearly reforms were another factor.
I wouldn't plan for 5% necessarily going forward. I think 3% to 4% with a stronger bias on
4% is probably closer to what one should think about longer term. We're in a transition
period. We had about 10 diﬀerent types of reforms that have taken place in the past 18
months. So, clearly a transition. As you know, on bodily injury in particular in Ontario,
these are long-tail type claims. And you've got still – even though the reforms were at the
end of 2010, you have still a few years worth of transition. We think that what we observe
in the environment is coming along our expectations, sometimes better. We need to keep
an eye on inﬂation at the same time and integrate the impact of the reforms that have
been ruled out in the past 18 months, plus what's coming in the budget. There's a lot of
vectors crossing each other here, hence our caution.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Okay. And just lastly, the new MCT guideline, you mentioned in the release that it's 2
point positive impact quarterly through 2015. So presumably 2 points was in Q1, 2 points
for – six points is still yet to come. And – but I think this has been phased in through 2015,
2016 and 2017. Is this more front-end loaded or is there additional beneﬁts that come in
2016 and 2017?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

You're absolutely right. It is phased in over three years. We're very cautious over the
prediction after 2015 because the rules change, tend to change more frequently. So I
think it's baked in for 2015 at nearly 2 points a quarter, and then there's more to come in
the next two years. But we're cautious with other changes that could occur that would
oﬀset the rest of the phase-in.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Is this speciﬁc or is this just being conservative, or are there speciﬁc issues of changes that
you see that would – like if everything stayed the same, what would be the beneﬁt in 2016,
2017, and what would cause that not to -?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

This thing is a straight-line amortization at 2 points a quarter. Basically it's 21 points
roughly over the entire gain and amortizing over three years. Again, we're just being a bit
Page 16 of 20



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

prudent into the impact of future changes that might come, and we're not sort of
counting on the increases in the next two years.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. I think there will still be changes in the MCT, likely in the coming two years, three
years, and I think we need to face ourselves.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

There's nothing in particular, you're just being over – you're being conservative?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. Not overly. Just conservative.

Just conservative. I didn't want to put overly in there. Just, just – okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Tom MacKinnon with BMO Capital. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yeah. The question has been asked and answered, but maybe you just elaborate a little
bit about the tax impact on the treatment of the dividends. What's – in particular, what that
relate to and how you might be able to mitigate that?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Sure. So, ﬁrstly, important to note that it's uncertain we don't know the ﬁnal outcome.
They might be changed. What it really relates to is some of the dividends basically on the
alpha strategies were tax-free for us, and given the changes that are coming up, they
would become taxable. And that's where we calculate. We estimate the impact at $12
million to $15 million a year of lost earnings because these dividends would become
certainly taxable, and this starts at the end of this year if there are no changes. And -

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

We're market neutral and dropped alpha-type strategies.

FINAL

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Yeah. So it's actually the alphas that are mostly impacted. And then in terms of changing
it, it's fairly new. So our team is looking at what kind of actions they can take. But I think it's
important to reiterate that what action we take to oﬀset will be done in a measured way
within our current risk management approach. So we're not going to be chasing yield
here. It's just a matter of ﬁnding something. This was a very eﬀective strategy and now
trying to ﬁnd something as eﬀective as what we're trying to do but within the same sort of
risk management approach.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

How should we look at this going forward? Should we assume $12 million to $15 million
annual increase in your tax bill or to what extent we should assume some of this is
mitigated?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. I think that – so this is a recent decision. We're working with the investment guys
(49:37). We'll relocate the capital that will be freed up as a result of this change. So I don't
think one should assume that the tax bill goes up by $12 million and $15 million. That's not
what we assume anyways, and we'll try to bridge the gap working within our existing risk
(49:56).

Q - Tom MacKinnon

And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to the
presenters.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well, maybe I understand that Brian Meredith from UBS had a tough time logging in. And
one of his questions, which I thought was very pertinent, was related to frequency and
whether there was more kilometers driven as has been observed in the U.S., here in
Canada. So I'll let Patrick comment on your observations on frequency in the quarter and
maybe talk about what UBI will allow us to do going forward with that sort of information.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yeah. So, when results in automobile are aﬀected by weather, we're talking about
frequency of smaller claims. So we've seen this frequency go up slightly in Q1. Regarding
UBI or our telematics situation, we have now reached above 90,000 clients enrolled. That
– together, all those clients have driven something like 350 million kilometers that we can
Page 18 of 20

analyze in our database. And so that's where we are for UBI. And I'm not sure, Charles, the
link that you were telling between two.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

Well, the exercise we haven't been able to do, Brian, because UBI is the recent rule-out, is
to compare what the pool was driving last year versus what the pool is driving this year.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

The upside is, well, you relied on indirect statistical information in the past, now we have
the data to have an actual direct comparison in driving. And I must admit we were not
necessarily focused on that in aggregate. But I think your question is a good one, and
we'll try to tackle that in the coming weeks just to get a better grasp on this. I think it's a
very good point. Thank you. Dennis, sorry about that.
