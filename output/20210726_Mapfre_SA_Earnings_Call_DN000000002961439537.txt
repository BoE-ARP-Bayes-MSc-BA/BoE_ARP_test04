Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to MAPFRE's Results Presentation for the First
Half of 2021. This is Felipe Navarro, Head of Investor Relations, Capital Markets and
Treasurer.

Bloomberg Transcript

As usual Fernando Mata, our CFO will walk us through the main figures and highlights of
the quarter. We also have the pleasure of having here with us Jose Manuel Inchausti, CEO
of Iberia who will give us an overview on the main highlights and outlook for the Spanish
business.
As a reminder, additional information can be found on our website, including the MD&A as
well as the usual spreadsheets. As requested by many of you, we have included further
quarterly standalone figures in our financial supplement.
At the end of the presentation, we will open the Q&A session. You can submit your
questions using the ask a question link on the bottom of your screen. We will try to answer
all the questions as time allows. The IR team will be available to answer any pending
questions after the call.
Before we start the presentation, I would like to give you an update regarding the
pandemic situation for our markets. On the positive side, European markets including
Spain continued to improve, thanks to the constant increase in vaccination rates. The new
variants have had a strong impact, especially in the UK and the Iberian Peninsula. Although
the increase in cases has not led to the increase in the death rates.
In Latin America, the situation is still quite complicated. Although most countries seem to
have passed the peak, however, there is still a high level of stress in the hospital systems
in some countries including Colombia and Guatemala. We are also carefully monitoring
the pandemic and social political situation in Peru and taking adequate mitigating
measures.

FINAL

As vaccination rates accelerate, we continue to implement gradual return to the office,
always keeping in mind the highest health standards. Currently around 94% of the
employees in Spain are working on the pandemic situation, which is still complicated,
sorry, on the premises with rotations and 54% of employees in the United States are back
in the office.
In Brazil, the pandemic situation is still complicated and 99% of the workers are currently
working remotely. We will continue adapting to the changes in conditions in every country.
Now let me turn the call over to our CFO, Fernando. The floor is yours.

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Felipe, and thank you everyone for being here with us today. Before I go into
the details, let me start by saying that, we are very satisfied with our second quarter
results. We showed that we are on track to meet the guidance announced at our AGM
underpinned by improving trends and successful restructuring measures.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have successfully adapted our operations to the new market context with COVID.
Regarding P&L impacts direct claims at insurance units, mainly in the Life Protection and
Health in Latin America should be offset by lower auto frequency across regions although
there maybe some volatility from one quarter to another.
The pandemic situation in Latin America remains challenging especially impacting MAPFRE
in our largest operations like in Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Colombia and the Dominican Republic
with April being the peak. On the other hand, the outlook seems more positive for
markets more advanced in the vaccination process.
Topline performance is strong and premiums have reached a turning point, returning to
growth in the second quarter, which is outstanding, considering the impact of the
pandemic and the drag from currency movements. While vaccination rates are advancing
quickly in mature countries. There is some lag in emerging countries leading to an
asymmetrical economic recovery.
In any case, we should see further consolidation of recovery trends and we should expect
more premium growth in the second half of the year. In Iberia, we continued to
outperform the market in key non-life segments with a return to growth in life while
maintaining strong underlying technical margins.
Reinsurance and global risks are also consolidating positive trends on the back of tariff
increases with limited impact from large events. In the United States, underwriting results
are strong, especially in the Northeast, thanks to the streamlining process over the last
few years and Brazil is also well positioned to bear the fruits of the restructuring process.
Finally, I would like to highlight our strong capital position with the Solvency II ratio over
200% at the end of March and our equity base has been stable in 2021 at around EUR8.5

billion. Furthermore Standard & Poor's recently affirmed our financial strength rating at A+.

FINAL

Now, I will take you through the main figures of the first half of the year. Before we discuss
the topline, I should mention that we renewed the large multi-year PEMEX policy in Mexico
for $563 million, equivalent to EUR469 million. Currency movements were still a drag
compared to last year although to a lesser extent than in the first quarter.
In Euros premiums are up over 6%. At constant exchange rates premiums are up over 11%,
7% excluding in this large policy. Non-life premiums continued to consolidate the strong
trends and life premiums are up nearly 10% with good performance in local currency in
Spain and Brazil.

Bloomberg Transcript

The Group combined ratio of 95% is in line with our guidance with a similar result at
insurance units. There was a provision for early retirement in Iberia booked in the second
quarter and excluding this the combined ratio will have been around 94% and the
expense ratio would have improved proportionately. Jose Manuel will comment on this in
more detail later in the presentation. MAPFRE's net result is EUR364 million, up over 34%
and in line with our guidance for 2021. The ROE excluding goodwill write-downs is close to
9% and assets under management are up over 1% with the investment portfolio slightly
down compensated by the strong growth in pension and mutual funds nearly 9% in total.
On this slide, I will take you through the breakdown of the adjusted attributable result. As
many of you have requested, we have included quarterly standalone figures as well. As a
reminder, in line with previous quarters and due to the offsetting nature of the different
COVID impacts at insurance operations, we have not considered this in the adjusted
result, as the final effect should be roughly neutral.
Although there could be some volatility from one quarter to the next. Regarding other
NatCat claims, it has been a quiet quarter with nothing relevant to report. As a reminder
last year there was a 61 million net impact from the earthquake in Puerto Rico.
And regarding COVID claims at MAPFRE RE there was a EUR14 million impact, mainly
related to claims occurring in 2021. There have been two large impacts in Iberia during the
quarter. There was a EUR56 million negative impact from an early retirement provision
and a EUR22 million gain from the release of an earn-out provision.
Financial gains and losses are relatively stable on the year. Finally, other impacts include a
net gain of EUR25.2 million due to the market valuation of a building transfer to a new joint
investment vehicle with Swiss Life. There were also realized gains from several asset sales
including Rastreator, Preminen and Industrial RE for a little under EUR17 million.
In 2020 other items included a provision for restructuring. Excluding these impact, the
adjusted net result was EUR352 million, down around 9.8% mainly as a result of lower
financial income and absence of EUR11 million profit contribution from Bankia in the second
quarter.

FINAL

The adjusted result is up over EUR19 million compared to the first quarter due to
seasonality. On this slide, we show the main trends this quarter. The drivers are
continuous improvements in technical management as well as still lower mobility levels
affecting mainly motor.
I would like to highlight the positive performance in Iberia which Jose Manuel will discuss in
more detail later. In Brazil, currency headwinds are still relevant with average Real
exchange rates down 14%, but much less than in the first quarter. Premiums are up over
15% in local currency with strong growth in Agro and improving motor issuance.
The attributable result of EUR36 million is down, mainly due to COVID related life
protection claims and currency movements. The combined ratio remains strong at 86%
down nearly three points with improvements in General P&C. The economic outlook has
slightly improved with SELIC rates up and the currency improving, but with high volatility.
Premiums in LATAM South grew 4% in euros offsetting currency effects. In addition,
premiums in LATAM North are up over 50%, this is driven by the large multi-year policy in
Mexico as well as a strong trends in most segments. Excluding this policy, premiums in the
region would have been slightly down due to currency depreciation. Local currency growth
was also remarkable in Colombia up 33% and Peru up over 14%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Combined ratio in both regions remained at good levels with a slight deterioration in
LATAM North, but still under 94% due to COVID related claims. Performance in North
America has been affected by currency depreciation with average dollar exchange rates
down around 7%.
The combined ratio has improved year-on-year at 97% mainly due to the earthquake in
Puerto Rico last year. The region shows remarkable stability with recurring profits after
restructuring, with the combined ratio in the US Northeast at 96.5%.
In the US, new business is still being hurt by a lack of economic activity, but both the
economy and mobility are starting to recover and this trend should accelerate in the
second half of the year. In Eurasia, premiums are up, sorry, are down due to the nonrenewal of the dealership channel in Italy as well as the depreciation of the Turkish lira.
All countries have contributed positively to results except Italy where expenses as we
mentioned as of March still need to be adapted to the new business model. At MAPFRE
RE, premiums are also up supported by positive pricing trends. The combined ratio was
below 95% with excellent performance both in reinsurance and global risks. It was a quiet
quarter for large losses. In the assistance business, results are up over EUR11 million as last
year was strongly affected by travel cancellation claims. Volumes are down 27% and we
continue with our streamlining process.
Regarding results, we're close to the breakeven point and it's remarkable, finally that we
have reported a small profit in the second quarter. On this slide, I would like to comment
on the life business at insurance units. In Iberia, premium performance has been
outstanding.

FINAL

Thanks to successful sales campaigns and rollover of product maturities. I will leave the
numbers for Jose Manuel's presentation. In Brazil, premiums have been affected by
currency depreciation. There has been a return to local currency growth up 4% in the
bancassurance channel with improved trends in the second quarter and sales campaigns.
In other markets, premiums are up in Malta offsetting a small decline in Mexico. The life
attributable result is down by EUR22 million mainly due to a strong impact from COVID
related claims in Latam, where the life protection attributable result is down by EUR50
million.
Average cases and number of the death figures are beginning to come down, and we
seem to have passed the peak, particularly April was the hardest month. It was mitigated
by improving results in Iberia that Jose Manuel will comment on now. Jose Manuel, the
floor is yours.

Jose Manuel Inchausti Perez

{BIO 19141743 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Fernando. Good morning to everyone. I start saying that premiums
are up 6.9% year-on-year, thanks to a strong performance both in life and non-life. I would
like to highlight the growth in health at 10% and in commercial lines where premiums are
up nearly 9%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Motor is growing 2.7%. It is worth mentioning the strong performance in both Verti and
Santander businesses. Life premiums are up nearly 13% with strong trends in retail lines
both in life protection up 6% and in savings up 34%.
The net result is EUR206 million down 7% on the year explained by an increase in claims
experience in motor, health and homeowners due to a pickup in economic activity. It also
reflects a provision for our voluntary early retirement scheme for EUR75 million, which was
compensated with other positive one-offs with an overall neutral impact.
The combined ratio is 96.3%, 2.4 points higher than June 2020, reflecting the impact of
the voluntary early retirement scheme. The ratio would be half with three points, sorry,
three points lower excluding this an increase in motor claims due to higher vehicle use
during the quarter. The ratio in general property & casualty has improved six points with
lower average claim cost in the burial segment compared to 2020.
This was partially offset by homeowners and condominiums where claims continue at high
levels due to an increase in frequency from people spending more time at home as a
result of the COVID crisis, affecting water, glass and handyman covers. The data for the
Spanish market as of June 2021 was recently published and is proof of MAPFRE's
outstanding performance.
MAPFRE is growing two percentage points above the total market, outperforming in most
key business lines. Life and health are worth highlighting, which are growing six points
more than the market. Also business lines are growing five points more than the market.

MAPFRE places clients at the center of our strategy, designing products covering new
needs with excellent service quality and digital capabilities, giving clients the power to act
whenever and wherever they want.

FINAL

Our differential value proposition has been designed for our main clients, based on these
pillars, in order to foster long-term loyalty. These strategies have helped build the best
insurance loyalty program in Spain with more than three million members.
MAPFRE is also designing tools to improve retention from the moment the policy is sold
and increasing year after year the net promoter score from our clients, which is now the
best in the market higher than 38. Iberia now has more than 7.1 million clients who are
even more loyal with record low churn rates.
MAPFRE recognizes the importance of families. So we have become the reference insurer
for Spanish households with more than 400,000 families allowing us to offer
personalized products and value propositions.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our strategy is focused on growing the number of policies and MAPFRE is now giving
health insurance coverage to more than one million people and with over 6.1 million
vehicles insured. One of our main targets is to continue fostering and accelerating our
digital transformation in Spain. To reach this goal, we have created a Client Digital
Experience Area and a Digital Transformation Office to foster digitalization and leverage
synergies within the group. The most relevant KPIs for the digital business reflect the
success of this strategy.
The online transaction ratio has improved continuously over the last two years, five points
and nine points for MAPFRE and Verti, respectively. New policies captured through digital
channels have grown 21% as of June.
Verti continuous outperforming the market with policies up over 11% reaching a total of
338,000 policies. And lastly, after lockdown there was higher demand for health services
offered by Savia, which are complementary to our insurance products.
Going to the next slide, our priorities for 2021 are gaining market share across key line of
businesses defending our portfolio and cost containment. Trends are improving both on
non-life and life. Frequency trends will depend on mobility and economic recovery.
However we are already very close to normalized level.
New vehicle sales will remain at low levels due to the economic situation and a lack of
government subsidies, but with an improving outlook. And as long as rates remain low,
the life savings environment will continue to be challenging. The non-life combined ratio is
expected to be around 95% with motor between 91% and 93% for 2021.
We will continue managing the low interest rate environment and continue to implement
our alternative investment plan. Lastly, Iberia continues to boast extremely strong solvency
levels while providing a recurring high level of dividends to the group.

FINAL

MAPFRE Iberia has carried out a careful analysis to adapt our operating model to changes
in our clients, channels and the market context. This new model is the result of advances
in digitalization and automation across the company as well as the need to centralize
several operations.
Taking advantage of new technology, this will allow us to work with more efficient
structures and centralized management that can be accessed from everywhere in Spain.
These developments have also helped streamline processes and require new strategic
employee profiles.
The end of the agreement with Bankia has also accelerated this process. In order to
implement these necessary changes, we have set aside a EUR75 million provision for the
voluntary early retirement for employees from different business areas in 2021.
MAPFRE is not only focused on digital transformation, but we are also carrying out an
important operational transformation plan geared to increasing operating efficiency with
more than 12 million transaction optimized with a total cost saving for more than EUR7
million this year-to-date. The main pillars of this plan are digitalization, process
automation, using technologies like robotics and artificial intelligence and the change in
the operating model that I already mentioned.

Bloomberg Transcript

Improving technical management is also a priority for MAPFRE Iberia. The main initiatives
include market pricing, which is focused on adapting the final price to each customer. This
is currently being used in Auto homeowners and multirisk and advances have been made
in other segments.
Progress has been made in the use of artificial intelligence with digital verification for our
clients and distributors. In the case of motor, this allows for automatic underwriting and
loss adjustment and allowing for a policy to be taken out even with a smartphone.
During the pandemic this helped streamline the loss adjustment process for homeowners
and condominium claims. Another important challenge has been the use of data for
decision making and the possibility of creating new products and services using advanced
analytics. The main actions have been optimization of sales activity and process
automation.
In Iberia, we are also expanding our product offering, adapting it to our clients' changing
needs with a focus on electric and personal mobility service vehicles as well as the
development of on-off motor products. In life savings, we are focused on unit linked
products and successfully boosting the asset management business.
On the next slide, I would like to comment on the current status of our main
bancassurance agreements. The company is making positive advances in the Bankia exit
process. The independent appraiser was appointed at the beginning of July and we
expect a transaction to be completed by year-end, but the final timeline will depend on
the pertinent, regulatory and administrative approvals.

FINAL

We have also implemented our portfolio retention plans in our MAPFRE network.
Regarding our agreement with Santander, it has been a great success with high growth
potential, while leveraging several opportunities for further collaboration, for example,
Portugal, Cyberinsurance and Assurbanking.
MAPFRE continues to meet important milestones reaching over 100,000 policies as of
June and over EUR24 million in premiums in Spain. In conclusion, in Iberia, we continue
outperforming the market with strong underlying technical margins. Our leading position,
a strong competitive advantage and leaner business model will help us come out even
stronger as the economy gradually normalizes and we will continue to leverage
opportunities for growth and improve profitability.
Thank you for your time and I will now hand the call back over to Fernando.

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Jose Manuel. A pretty comprehensive presentation and a quite clear
explanation. Thank you again. Now I will move on to the balance sheet and capital. This
slide includes a full disclosure of the breakdown and variation of the investment portfolio
and total assets under management.

Bloomberg Transcript

Spanish sovereign debt continues to be our largest exposure with a little over EUR12
billion and Italian debt with EUR2.7 billion is the second largest. Both sovereigns are mainly
allocated to immunize portfolios.
The fall in the investment portfolio is due to higher yields with the Spanish sovereign up
over 35 basis points year-to-date and pension and mutual funds have had a strong
performance both due to market movements as well as positive net contributions of
EUR70 million in pension funds and EUR212 million in investment funds at the end of June.
On the top left are of the details of our Euro area actively managed fixed income
portfolios. The market value of this portfolio is a little under EUR13 billion. The accounting
yield is around 1.6% in non-life and 3.5% in life. The fall in yields is consistent with the
reduction in duration. As a reminder, non-life includes burial expense business, which is a
long tail business. Excluding this portfolio non-life duration would be down closer to four
years.
On the bottom left, you can see the details of the fixed-income portfolios in other
markets with portfolio yields significantly up in Brazil, now at 6.5%, and relative stability in
North America. Realized gains and losses in these portfolios were around EUR14 million
down EUR14.5 million compared to the previous year.
At the end of June -- and this is very relevant, very important, there were EUR161 million of
unrealized gains in equity and investment funds in our actively managed portfolio in Iberia
and MAPFRE RE. So it's a big cushion for MAPFRE for the second half of the year. Right
now we prefer to accumulate unrealized gains in order to compensate the fall in value of

FINAL

fixed income portfolios. Shareholders equity stood at EUR8.5 billion up EUR217 million on
the quarter.
The main driver for this increase was the net profit for the quarter with stability in
conversion differences and unrealized capital gains in the available for sale portfolio. The
most relevant changes during the year are a decrease in net unrealized gains on the
available for sale portfolio with a EUR281 million negative impact due to rising rates, with
only a EUR10 million deterioration on the quarter. And conversion differences had a
positive net impact of EUR120 million during the period, improving around EUR40 million
on the quarter, mainly due to the appreciation of the US dollar and the Brazilian real.
The breakdown of currency conversion differences and currency movements are shown in
the table on the right, along with the current sensitivity analysis. On the chart on the left,
you can see the breakdown of the capital structure, which amounted to EUR13 billion of
which over three quarters is equity. Leverage is stable in the quarter at slightly under 24%.
After closing the transaction with Bankia, we could reevaluate our financial needs, but for
the time being, we are quite comfortable with the current debt levels. On the right you
can see the Solvency II figures for March 2021, which were released last month.

Bloomberg Transcript

The ratio sits at over 200% at the midpoint of our range. The improvement during the
year is due to a lower mathematical provision due to higher risk free rates in Turkey and
Latin America especially in Colombia and Panama.
Before moving on to the Q&A session, I would like to make a few closing remarks. First of
all as Jose Manuel has already explained quite in-depth, in Iberia, we continuously well
positioned for profitable growth. Underwriting results are robust in the United States
especially in the Northeast and we are also beginning to see the fruits of a successful
restructuring process.
In Latin America, the pandemic and economic outlook remains I will say challenging and
we have adapted our business model to the new environment and we are monitoring the
situation closely. MAPFRE RE continues to consolidate normalized profitability trends,
thanks to tariff increases, prudent underwriting and the absence of significant cat loss so
far. And for Bankia as Jose Manuel already mentioned, right now we're focused on
completing the exit process. Regarding capital allocation, we are moving ahead with
restructuring and transformation with significant advances during this quarter. We sold
Rastreator and Preminen price comparison business as well as Industrial RE.
At MAPFRE ASISTENCIA we have exited 13 countries since 2016 and have recently
classified several insurance and assistance operations in Europe and Asia as held for sale.
This includes the InsureandGo operations in Australia and the UK, which are both in final
stages.
We will continue to simplify the assistance business to improve profitability with a focus on
countries where MAPFRE has insurance business. Regarding business expansion, we have
a preliminary agreement to buy the minority stakes in Peru Life, which will be a 32% stake.

This is an excellent growth opportunity with an operation that has proven successful for
more than 30 years contributing to premium growth, profit and dividends.

FINAL

In conclusion, it has been another positive quarter showing growth in premiums and
results in a more positive scenario, but not without COVID-related uncertainties. We are
on the right path to meet our 2021 commitments and return to a sustainable dividend
path.
Thank you. I will now hand the call over to Felipe to begin the Q&A session.

Questions And Answers
A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Fernando. Thank you very much, Jose Manuel. We have a number of
questions coming now from the different analysts asking letting I mean the first ones are
related with the COVID situation. Paco Riquel from Alantra asks for the net impact of -- the
net attributable profit for the COVID losses in the life protection business for both Q1 and
Q2. Fernando?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Paco. Good interesting question. I don't have the proper disclosure of both
effects. I will tell you in terms of the gross value of the claims -- approximately it's onethird during the first quarter and two-thirds in the second quarter. And the total in Latin
America was like 50 million for both quarters, but unfortunately we can't disclose I mean
bear in mind that the -- a significant impact has been allocated to Banco do Brasil and they
haven't published their results yet. So we should be very prudent in this respect, but let's
say that the one-third was the first quarter and two-thirds was for the second quarter,
roughly talking.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay, thank you very much, Fernando. Next question is related with the losses that we
recognized in the second quarter of 2021 related with the COVID. And this is coming from
Ivan Bokhmat at Barclays and Paz Ojeda from Banco de Sabadell is asking a similar
question. Is that given the scale of the pandemic, how do you see that playing on the
second half 2021?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well, I will discuss on the first half of the year because what is going to happen in the
second half of the year is still unknown, but let's say that out of this two-thirds impact in
the second quarter that I already commented, the peak was April, the month of April with
a gross value for incurred losses of close to EUR65 million. But let's say that the curve is
flattening and with lower impact in claims in May, and also the outstanding amount coming
down in July, sorry, in June. So I wouldn't like to extrapolate this flattening of the curve I
mean we know that there is a lot of uncertainty regarding the COVID in Latam, but the
outlook remains challenging, but as I mentioned I mean we are quite positive. And let's

say that we had to be optimistic I mean the pace of vaccination is moving ahead,
particularly in the largest countries, Mexico, Brazil, Peru and Colombia. And also our
operation is very well adapted I mean to this tough context and even working from home I
mean we are able to provide and to deliver the best quality for our clients and also just to
try to mitigate the potential impact in our accounts.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Thank you. Thank you very much, Fernando. We have now some questions related with
this early retirement scheme. This is coming from Andrew Sinclair from Bank of America
Merrill Lynch. And he is asking for the Iberia early retirement scheme you have completed,
what will be the longer term impact on the expense ratio? Should we expect a reduction?
A similar question is coming from Paco Riquel from Alantra. Can you give us an indication
of the expense of the expected payback in years of EUR75 million restructuring program
in Spain?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well, Jose Manuel will take this question, yes.

A - Jose Manuel Inchausti Perez

{BIO 19141743 <GO>}

Yes, of course, Paco. It will be depending on the profile that we are speaking at. We could
calculate between three and five years they're returning.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. There were similar questions related with this
question coming from Alex Evans that was very similar and there's another extension of
the question coming from Ivan Bokhmat from Barclays. He is asking he wants to know
what is the rationale on the voluntary retirement scheme in the non-life? What impact
should we have in the ongoing combined ratio next year?

A - Jose Manuel Inchausti Perez

{BIO 19141743 <GO>}

Okay. I have talked a little about the rationale. On one side we are streamlining our
processes. I think that technology allows a different distribution of the work load which
cannot be the same than years ago. And last I think centralized operations give us more
flexibility, and more efficiency as a company. And the impact on the expense ratio
nowadays are three points and in the future we expect of course a lesser, minor, expense
ratio, but we are calculating it in the next strategic planning.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

See that's very important and we already mentioned -- for Iberia business, this expense is
impacting dramatically our combined ratio and as Jose Manuel said the net impact on the
combined ratio is three percentage points reduction, sorry, increase. So, if you adjust the
current combined ratio, eliminating this impact from the redundancy scheme it would be a
little bit higher than 93%. It's an outstanding combined ratio in the current circumstances
for Iberia.

operation?

A - Jose Manuel Inchausti Perez

Thank you. It will be more or less 250 people and everybody these people will leave the

{BIO 19141743 <GO>}

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah, that's very important. I mean the number, the final number we will know in the future
I mean because the probably I mean the pace of the employees that they are become
eligible I mean is growing, I mean has been very well accepted I mean we are quite
generous for our employees. And with the numbers what we are seeing currently in July,
probably we will hit this number of 250 employees that Jose Manuel has mentioned. We
are happy I mean, let me tell you that it's not the first -- it wasn't a redundancy scheme,
but for the last five years has been early retirement plans, not that size. I mean this is very
important, what is relevant that is affecting a big group of employees, but MAPFRE, as
other large entities I mean we are trying to give, I mean and also to reduce our payroll
particularly for those employees that have devoted more of his professional time -lifetime I mean to MAPFRE. So let's say it's nothing new, but the size let's say that it is very
important. So in this transparency commitment that MAPFRE has I mean we decided just
to make it public and that's basically my view.

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Thank you. Thank you very much. We go back to the COVID and now Paco Riquel from
Alantra is asking about the impact of the losses in MAPFRE RE in the second quarter and
what is left for the second half. I mean I think that the question was almost answered. Yes,
he is interested as well with what could be the potential losses for the extraordinary
floods in Germany and Belgium in July as MAPFRE RE and MAPFRE Germany. And Ashik
Musaddi from JPMorgan is asking a similar question of the outlook of reinsurance business
given the recent floods in Europe?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well, as I mentioned, Paco and thank you Ashik for the question. I mean, it's extremely
difficult to extrapolate any conclusion for the second half of the year. But let's say that the
curve is flattening and also it's flattening as well for MAPFRE RE because there is some
accepted business from Latam that has been in the MAPFRE RE accounts. Let's say that
most of the impact was in April and the amount, net of taxes, is EUR16 million that was
affecting MAPFRE RE was basically due to 2021 occurrence year. So let's say that the -- it
was reported an amount last year approximately 60 million. This half of the year is 16 as a
net impact in the result. Let's say that the second half should be a smaller amount for sure
but it is difficult to foresee. Regarding Germany losses, you're right, it was the
extraordinary floods in Germany and in Belgium and just last week we saw on TV as well

again flooding in Belgium. We are in a very early stage and we have not received any
written or oral communication from the ceding entities. But for an top-down analysis for
MAPFRE RE let's say that it would be probably a mid-size NatCat event for Europe.

Okay, thank you. Thank you very much, Fernando. Coming back to Spain. Alex Evans asking
about motor. Please could you talk about the Spanish motor market as vehicle growth,
premium growth looks strong, but you are now missing your 91%-93% combined ratio
target with the 93.1% in first half and 97.8% in Q2? How do you think about the provision
between the different MAPFRE Spanish business lines. Mario Ropero from Bestinver would
like to update you -- an update sorry on how you see the motor insurance price
competition for the rest of the year. Paz Ojeda from Banco de Sabadell as well, he is
asking about the combined ratio, this 93% underlying in Iberia and what can we expect on
the second half 2021?

A - Jose Manuel Inchausti Perez

{BIO 19141743 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Regarding the first question. Our combined ratio of the first half of the year is
influenced by three points as well as the general combined ratio. So it's the underlying
combined ratio is three point less. It's very difficult to estimate a combined ratio for the
second half of the year. The first half of the year will be fulfilled if we eliminate the early
retirement program and for the second what we have seen is a very big increase on
competence between companies in the market. Companies are decreasing prices,
reducing prices and are investing more in marketing. So it is not easy to estimate how far
will go this process, but it will be perfectly, we could see that at the end of the year.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Okay, if I may add something I mean we are pretty happy with the current or the
underlying combined ratio for automobile in Spain. I mean it's like] 93%, if we apply
proportionally this three percentage point reduction, it will be in the lower 90s. So I mean
this is a fantastic combined ratio. And the same for the non-life combined ratio of Iberia, it
will be in the lower 93. So they're very good and in the proper line in order to meet the
guidance for both MAPFRE Group and also for MAPFRE ESPANA. Regarding the allocation
of the 75. Jose Manuel, you got the numbers?

A - Jose Manuel Inchausti Perez

{BIO 19141743 <GO>}

Yeah, it's 65 million in MAPFRE ESPANA and 10 million goes to MAPFRE VIDA.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah, and the question from Mario Ropero, the motor insurance price is -- Mario it's as
usual. I mean there is nothing new in this country. Extremely competitive. Perhaps Jose
Manuel can give us more color, but nothing has changed in Spain I mean everybody wants
to get the largest piece of the cake and the piece of the pie and MAPFRE is defending
our position and with the help of MAPFRE Santander, which is very good in new business
and we are extremely competitive too.

Yes, especially in the direct business in the digital business, we have seen an increase in
competency because we have a special sensitivity when we are competing with other
companies in comparison webs. And it is very difficult to be one of the top three prices
best prices for our digital company, which is Verti. Nevertheless I would like to say that
Verti is increasing its premiums by 7%. So much more than the market and other digital
companies.

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah, thank you, Andrew. We haven't changed our statement regarding future allocation
of the consideration to be collected from Caixa. I mean we will decide on this particular
transaction when we finish and we get the money I mean from Caixa. So meanwhile I
mean we are analyzing different opportunities, but so far we haven't reached any
conclusion. We'll try to allocate more capital to our strategic distribution channel
particularly bancassurance in Spain, where there is a lack of power. I already mentioned I
mean there has been two relevant transactions that we lost because of the restructuring
of financial institution in Spain. And also on the digital business. And regarding our
geographical footprint again Spain is key and also the United States. And in that case as
we mentioned and perhaps on the states that we operating close to AAA the motor club
and also Brazil. We mentioned some in a couple of meetings as well that Mexico could be
-- could join the list of strategic countries as well. But so far I mean we haven't reached as I
mentioned any conclusion regarding the future allocation of the consideration from
Bankia.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

How fast do you plan to substitute your joint venture with Bankia if you're planning to do
so?

Yeah I know Mario, that there are people gossiping particularly in Spain with entities. I'm
not going to name any potential future development from MAPFRE. They're in the papers

I would like to add that part of the loss of a part of the Bankia loss will be covered with
other distribution channels. We have implemented homeowners especially a homeowners
increase program in other -- in different channels. And I also want to highlight that the
cooperation with Banco Santander is increasing. We have some products in our pipeline.
We will be launching an important business line product by the end of the year and we
have other products to be launched in the 2022.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah, that's very good. I mean we usually discuss on M&A growth, but then we forget the
organic growth, which is very important, particularly on the digital side, as Jose Manuel
mentioned. We put in some of the money and having I know I mean the Bankia money in
the future on the digital business and particularly homeowners. Homeowners will be the
line of business, the most hurt because of the Bankia exit because it was key I mean for
homeowners new business.

Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Excellent answer. Mario Ropero from
Bestinver. He is interested in the Solvency ratio. We increased the solvency ratio in the
second in the first quarter and he is asking about our expectations by the end of the year.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well, let's say that we are quite, Mario, thank you, we are quite comfortable with the
current position, and it's just the midpoint of the range. And we probably will see further
improvements if there is an, let's say, upwards movement of the free risk curve,
particularly in some Latin American countries, because the higher the movement is, the
lower mathematical provision you have to book. So basically, it's an external factor
affecting our Solvency II ratio, but it's fine I mean we can -- we should keep this 200%
Solvency II ratio as a reference. This means that we will have some additional capital in
order to grow -- organic and inorganic our business. So that is a good situation.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay. Paco Riquel from Alantra has similar question related with the unwinding of Bankia
JV that has reduced the Solvency impact from six percentage points to four percentage
points. I think that you already explained why and there was another one, related with the
capital requirements that are lower in proportion to the rest of the Group and how it's
going to be impacting this?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes, Paco as you can see I mean the Bankia weight on our SCR is lower because there is a
reduction of both premiums and also assets compared to other units and regions. They're
growing I mean significantly. So in the end, I mean, it will be a lower impact from the exit
of Bankia. That's basically our understanding on this question.

Okay, Alexander Evans from Credit Suisse. He is asking what internal dividends has the
group received year-to-date?
I can tell you, Alexander, that we have received what was already projected and that
these dividends are being booked on our accounts as they were distributed and we are
quite happy with the dividend upstreaming that we have received up to now. So we don't
see any kind of risks for the rest of the months and for the rest of the year, should be
continuing going in the same direction.
There is another question related with coming from Ivan Bokhmat from Barclays. Can you
help us to understand the underlying profitability of the Spanish life business after
excluding the contribution of Bankia MAPFRE VIDA. What is the run rate and how does it
compare with your expectations?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well, I'll give you the number and then Jose Manuel can -- probably can give us more
color. I guess the amount is EUR11 million as I disclosed. It's the let's say is the profit that
was booked in the let's say in 2020 and we missed this quarter and but what we're
seeing is a decrease in the business in Bankia MAPFRE VIDA probably because the current
situation and also the lower level of assets. Is that right, Jose Manuel?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jose Manuel Inchausti Perez

{BIO 19141743 <GO>}

Taking out any extraordinary results from life insurance, our life insurance results is
growing at rate of 3% Bankia MAPFRE VIDA is not performing so well as the last year this
year. So taking out Bankia MAPFRE VIDA our evolution will be much better even then the
evolution I have said. And on the other side, I would like to highlight risk protection life
combined ratio is 75%, which is a very good combined ratio. So we expect a good
profitability from the life business.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Excellent answer. Jose Manuel, thank you very much. Sorry. Related, there is another
question coming from Bank of America. You have talked about returning to sustainable
dividend path, but not yet the level. Does this include a re-basing from the loss of Bankia
JV or you think that you can get back to the historic EUR14.5 cents per share is a recurring
question that we were receiving on how the dividend part is going to be in the future?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah, thank you for the question. I mean the profit contribution of the Bankia JV is not that
significant in order to force us to change our dividend policy. As I mentioned it's more or
less between 10 and 11 million per quarter. So I'm pretty sure that we kind of said this
decrease with other operations. And so let's say that they you should understand when I
mentioned that we want to come back to the sustainable dividend path, it's for many,
many years, it was, the dividend amount was EUR14.5 cents. And as the President, our
Chairman said and also I mentioned as well in some meetings in the past, is that we
Page 16 of 23



Company N ame: M apfre SA

would like to come back to this dividend position of EUR14.5 cents as soon as possible. So
-- and it won't depend I mean this return to this dividend path on the Bankia consideration.
This is a completely different business. I mean we should come back to EUR14.5 cents by
recurring profits, that's pretty clear from my side, yes.

FINAL

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

Thank you very much, Fernando. We come back to MAPFRE RE, which is I think that the
main the biggest change on the account is this year. Mario Ropero from Bestinver is
asking let us know your views on the combined ratio for MAPFRE RE going forward. How is
going to perform what could we expect from MAPFRE RE combined ratio?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well let's say that so far has been a quiet quarter and also quiet half of the year in terms
of big NatCat events. We have already reported two NatCat events. The one was the
Snowstorm Uri in the Southern states of the US and the other was Filomena in the Central
Spain and both they were, let's say, lower than mid-size NatCat events. And the other
impact was as I already mentioned the COVID 2021 occurrence claims and it was the
impact was EUR16 million net. Regarding the second half of the year, we know that the
Germany heavy rains and flood will impact our combined ratio. We're not sure so far how
big it will be this impact; probably a mid-size event. And but let's say that in the long run
as we already mentioned, combined ratio from MAPFRE RE should be a little bit lower
than MAPFRE Group. And so in this range between 94-95 in a normal standard year
should be the underlying combined ratio for MAPFRE RE. On the global risk line of
business let's say that we are quite happy. I mean it was a significant profit for the first half
of the year, in absence of any man-made losses, significant losses. And let's keep our
fingers crossed. I mean the retention has been reduced to practically 15% of premiums.
So let's say that we had lower exposure on global risks. So let's say that the profitability
level should remain quite unchanged for the second half of the year.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay. I don't know you just mentioned Filomena as a big claim and --

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

But it wasn't big -- I mean it wasn't that big.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

No, I mean, but how do we serve this on a number of claims?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

I mean that's correct. In terms of retention and it was let's say lower than mid-side event,
the cost was approximately EUR20 million for the Group, most of the Group. Most of the
cost was split between MAPFRE ESPANA, it was like a EUR10 million before taxes and the
remaining was for MAPFRE RE. Let's say that Filomena is now the second largest NatCat
event in -- ever in Spain after Klaus. It was a Hurricane one, that entered Galicia in the
North Spain, and exited Spain in Girona, I mean in the Mediterranean Coast. And but

FINAL

Filomena in terms of claims adjusters and the additional resources that were allocated to
this storm has been huge, with over 53,000 claims open most of them they already
adjusted and paid. And in terms of the gross amount was 80 million. Perhaps Jose Manuel
can give us more color, but it has been a claim with a lot of work done in order to give the
better quality to our policyholders. Is that right, Jose Manuel?

A - Jose Manuel Inchausti Perez

{BIO 19141743 <GO>}

Yes, that right. It has been in terms of gross losses the most important event that we have
had in Spain and in terms of claims declared the second one after Klaus. And it has been a
big a huge effort in terms of logistic providers etcetera of course to attend as best as
possible the number of customers that will be that was affected by the storm. We are
very happy with the results and fortunately we could increase our NPS Net Promoter Score
figures during these months. So we are very extremely happy with the way in which we
have attended our customers.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Jose Manuel. We have another question related with MAPFRE RE
impact on the COVID losses that we booked on this event. Based on the 2021 events
what percentage of the portfolio that would have responded to COVID losses in early
2020 still offers coverage after 2021 renewals. How has been changing the wording of
these contracts?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well, let's say, that what we changed, and we mentioned in the past, I mean we are not
working in this particular line of business. I mean, we don't give, I mean business
interruption, other than those that are linked to property damage. And the only thing we
made is that we put in the conditions I mean a clearer wording in order to set a red line to
those covers that they are provided by the policy and those that are not provided. So but
we haven't changed our policy regarding this coverage that they are not in the risk
appetite of MAPFRE RE.

Can you say more on the InsureandGo disposals. Are UK and Australia the worst
performing assistance segments?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah, we disclosed that we are at the final stage of to get the two operations sold. And
the one in the UK, we are currently at the end of the information process. I mean we filed
with the FCA and also even we disclosed as well the name of the potential buyer. So let's
say that there is just some formalities from the regulatory perspective, but I mean the
amount the buyer and everything is in a proper way in order to complete this transaction
anytime soon. Regarding Australia, currently we have up a binding offer from a quite
serious potential buyer. So, let's say that we are working on the final details in order to
have it. First, we need to get approvals, as well from the supervisors, but let's say that
everything is in the proper way and we believe that we can finish this transaction as well

by year-end. Other, in the end and we've mentioned that is like seven assistance
operations across the globe that are currently categorized in the balance sheet as held
for sale. And most of them they are non-strategic countries and some of them they are
generating profit and others there are losses, particularly InsureandGo. And I guess it's
the right decision probably at the right time as well and because that's the moment that
the market reacted for these proposals. And hopefully we will finish this transaction by
year-end. This is a very good news for MAPFRE and also for our shareholders.

own opportunity, what it was going to happen in the medium term?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well, it's neither risk, nor opportunity. It's a reality in MAPFRE. And then the first, let's say
ESG statement approving MAPFRE was back in the 1950s many, many years ago. And
when everybody was even thinking of just a business. And at that point the former
executives of the MAPFRE mutualidad published a statement regarding corporate finance
and corporate business. So let's say that it is a reality, it is very well rooted. It is part of our
DNA. It's not an opportunity. I mean, it's a necessity. We have to give back and give a part
of our business, part of a profit and part of the quality of all the things that we've done to
the society. So, it's something very well rooted in MAPFRE.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. I mean there is no evidence or any potential risk that could jeopardize
the current 700 million guidance that we published. We are pretty happy, but not only for
the performance of this first and second quarter I mean since June 30 2020 we're
reporting quite stable and consistent quarters I mean, we said that MAPFRE has adapted
very well to this scenario, we're not happy with the situation this planet is living, but
fortunately MAPFRE recurring in terms of business profit and also premium growth I mean

and can there be more to come? And on severity is inflation pick up impacting repair
costs.

A - Jose Manuel Inchausti Perez

{BIO 19141743 <GO>}

Okay. Regarding frequency, it's still lower than 2019 levels, but frequency evolving quickly
to the same level, especially from May as far the restrictions in mobility are lifted by the
government. And regarding average cost, we haven't seen that significant increase. It is
mainly because we are taking a bigger part of our claims redirected to our preferential
repair shops. So we haven't seen any tension coming from inflation on this average cost.

Thank you very much, Jose Manuel. Those are very good news. Paco Riquel from Alantra

business of Peru expected net profit contribution for 2021-2022 and impact on solvency
ratio?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you Paco. We shouldn't expect a significant impact on the Solvency II ratio. As you
know that the for the eligible capital, I mean we consider for Solvency II purposes I mean
also minority interests, so let's say that the level of capital that we hold in MAPFRE Peru
life is quite similar to the minimum. So let's say that the full amount of minority interests is
fully booked for the Solvency II ratio. So let's say that we shouldn't expect any impact on
our Solvency II ratio. Regarding the information, I mean at the subsequent events caption
of the financial report there is a full disclosure of numbers and figures from MAPFRE Peru
Vida. It has been a quite profitable entity for almost 35 years. I mean just I'll give you just
one number. When we bought this operations back in 1986 we bought the 62% current
stake by EUR16 million. So considering the current value that we apply, I mean for the
transaction the increasing value has been a huge. And also another thing, I mean we
review the number of dividends paid by this subsidiary and for the last five years the
average was a 10 million of dividend. So let's say that the flow of dividend is pretty good.

A - Felipe Navarro Lopez de Chicheri

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

That makes totally sense. I mean Carlos Peixoto from CAIXABANK BPI was asking similar
questions about Peru, turning that the 20 times implied price earnings for 2020 was seen
demanding and could you elaborate on the rationale expecting on the return on
investment, payback and it's impacts on the Solvency? Those are similar and I think that
you already answer those question, I don't if you want to elaborate something more?

Yeah, one thing I forgot. I mean for IFRS accounting purpose, I mean the way we are going
to treat this transaction is quite similar to the one in Brazil back two years ago. So the
excess of our equity that we paid for this transaction will be fully deducted from reserves.
So it won't be any goodwill or VOBA in our balance sheet out of this transaction. I mean,
we paid an extra amount above net equity, but they will be deducted from reserves. So
that it will be neutral for Solvency II and also for IFRS net equity.

A - Jose Manuel Inchausti Perez

{BIO 19141743 <GO>}

Well, it was a one-off definitely, Carlos, and perhaps as Jose Manuel can give us more
color. Let's say that we have a some earn-out provision and other commissions to pay to
our partners for business plan fulfillment. And what we've made, I'm not going to disclose
any name as you may imagine, and but what we have done is just to adjust the current
liabilities to the current circumstances. And due to the COVID, or whatever other
circumstances, but let's say that some of our partners they're not going to meet the
business plan. So we have adjusted the earn-outs and other contingent liabilities in that
way.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. We are booking on IBNR reserves in the region in particularly in
LatAm region, and across the countries, based on the number of days delay between our
current day and reported day. Let's say that the range varies between 22 days and 1.5
months. So let's say that it's quite logical, I mean this range assuming that some of the
business are coming from financial institutions and there is usually a lag between the day
that the claim is being reported to the financial institution and the subsequent reporting to
the insurance operations. So let's say that we are booking, and as a conclusion, we are
booking an IBNR in order to cover future reported losses based on triangles and also the
loss estimate for this particular line of business.

Thank you again for your presence. As I mentioned, it has been another robust quarter,
quite stable. This is the good thing of MAPFRE, let's say that for three quarters in a row,
we are reporting and we're delivering what we promised at the end of June 30 2020 that
we will adapt our operations to the current circumstances. So we are quite happy. And
let's say the second half of the year, which is quite promising. But not COVID related free
of uncertainties. So, thank you very much for your presence and above all, we wish you
the best for this summer holidays and above all please remain safe and, Felipe, the words
for you.

No, Iberia for sure will report similar performance in the second part of the year. Yeah, I
mean they're quite recurrent business and this region is the most relevant unit and region
in terms of business and profit contribution.
