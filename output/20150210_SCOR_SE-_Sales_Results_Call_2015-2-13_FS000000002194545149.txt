MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Unverified Participant
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the SCOR Global P&C Renewal Call,
where we are pleased to present the outcome of our January 2015 renewals. I'm joined
on this call by Victor Peignet, CEO of SCOR Global P&C; and Benjamin Gentsch, Deputy
CEO of SCOR Global P&C, and leader of our specialty lines.
So, presentation today focuses on our global property and casualty business and their
January 2015 renewals. I would like to remind you that our full year 2014 account will be
published on the March 5, and we'd be pleased to answer any question on full year
results during that event.
Before we start with the presentation, please consider our disclaimer on page two. It's
very important to mention that all figures in this presentation are unaudited and on
underwriting year basis, unless otherwise specified.
With this, I would like to give the floor to Victor Peignet, CEO of SCOR Global P&C.

FINAL

Good morning. As an introduction and as a conclusion, by the way, I would say that we're
all satisfied with the outcome of the January renewals given the pressure there is
currently on reinsurers, on brokers, and also on insurers whilst to a lesser extent.
I'm not going to go through the presentation slide by slide. It follows the format that you
are all used to by now. And also, you will find in there a very detailed information marketby-market and line of business by line of business in terms of both evolutions of prices
and evolutions of volumes as we anticipate them. Benjamin and I will rather provide you
with the clarifications and the additional information you may need during the Q&A
session that is just following my speech.
In summary, the fact is that at the January 1, 2015 renewals, we managed to maintain the
overall expected technical profitability quasi stable compared to January 2014, while we
delivered a gross written premium growth of 2.4% at constant exchange rates. This was
achieved, thanks to the deployment of action plans in terms of underwriting and portfolio
management that was well-prepared and that did well anticipate what the situation was
going to be in each market of segment and individually with most of the clients.

Bloomberg Transcript

It was achieved also thanks to the discipline of the entire organization. It's continuously
improving set of tools to steer its business in real time and its capabilities to deal with
these clients and their brokers, capitalizing on the new story of consistency and continuity.
As the markets continue to soften, disciplines, tools, and franchise are becoming even
more key differentiating factors.
In the increasingly competitive market environment we are in, we believe that the key
performance indicators of these renewals for us do demonstrate the strengths of our
position and our ability to manage the portfolio. The pricing decrease is contained at
minus 0.7% across the entire renewed portfolio, which has benefited from primary
insurance price increases being mainly composed of proportional reinsurance for 74% of
it.
The deterioration in the gross underwriting ratio is limited to just 0.2 percentage points.
This shows that the teams have successfully achieved the targets that they were given
and that they have managed to slowdown the deterioration in expected profitability
versus last year despite the market downward trends.
Moreover, we did manage to successfully resist the broader loosening of the terms and
condition, and particularly of certain contract clauses. This was achieved thanks to a
technical and consistent underwriting approach that has notably enabled us to contain the
extension of our clauses, and to maintain even event aggregation conditions within
acceptable limits for non-proportional contracts.
The outward retrocession Terms & Conditions are further improved versus last year and
provide us with broader and more efficient protections. The improved retrocession
conditions combined with the marginal deterioration of the expected profitability of the

FINAL

2015 vintage versus 2014 at the January 1 enable us to confirm that our net combined
ratio assumption of 94% stands for the second year of optimal dynamics.
The 2.4% premium growth recorded for the January 2015 renewals can be broken down
into a 0.9% growth on the P&C Treaty, of which, well, minus 4% in EMEA which is mainly
due to active portfolio management actions in this area to maintain the profitability of the
underwritten business, plus 10% in Asia-Pac where we managed to strengthen our
position in most market, not only China, but also South Korea and Malaysia for instance,
and plus 4% in Americas, notably thanks to the U.S. client-focus initiative bearing fruit.
This 0.9% growth in P&C Treaty is complemented by a 6.5% growth in Specialty Lines. This
growth in Specialty Lines is spread across most lines of business except engineering,
where there was a fierce competition on the international markets and where we
sometimes have to reduce our share to preserve our profitability. Thanks to good
renewals with global insurers with favorable signings, the U.S. Cat book managed to grow
by 3%.

Bloomberg Transcript

As we do not see reasons for the current competitive market environment to improve in
the short term, we are prepared and ready to continue to optimize our growth within the
constraints of the group only two targets which are its solvency and its profitability.
For 2015, we, thus, expect to achieve a gross premium income of around €5.3 billion
based on the exchange rates as at December 31, 2014. We will find the sources of
profitable growth in the Optimal Dynamics business initiatives along with an approach that
remain centered on the needs of our clients across all their business lines and markets
worldwide.
We will notably continue developing in four directions; first, to grow selectively as part of
the U.S. client focused initiative; second, to expand our activity in the Lloyd's market,
thanks to the further development of the Channel 2015 syndicate; third, to strengthen our
presence in the most promising emerging markets. We did record a growth of 10% on
P&C treaties in Asia in January 1, and this is thanks to a strong local presence in this
market and to a long-term client relationship based on more than 40 years of stability and
continuity, also based on heightened cooperations with insurers by transferring knowhow
and products in order for them to further develop in their markets with us. And four, to
develop and expand our business with large industrial groups by our SCOR business
solution, notably with the captives of these groups.
Having briefly summarized this – the outcome of this renewal, I now propose that we
move on to the Q&A session, reminding you that our next communication will be the fullyear results on the March 5. Thank you.

FINAL

Ladies and gentlemen, we will move on to the question-and-answer session. We will now
take our first question from Will Hardcastle. Please go ahead.

Q - William F. Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Good morning, guys. Could you give us an idea of whether – was there any particular area
where you felt it was particularly competitive and you just chose to walk away from the
business and you squeezed out, if there was one? And the second one is you mentioned
the impact of the low interest rates. Could you give us an idea of where the new money
yield is and the level of decline that has happened quarter-on-quarter? Thanks.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

On your first question, there's no general trends, so you would have to look at market-bymarket. We have mentioned in the presentation certain areas, certainly motor and nonproportional in France and in UK. If you look to the portfolio management slide on – in the
presentation that represents what has been done in EMEA for instance, well, you will see
that certain markets have been subject to extensive portfolio management like the
Northern European markets, for instance, where we lost 16% of our premium.
So I think the situation is very diverse, and I think that only companies having systems that
can allow them to have a real-time appreciation of what is the profitability of a given line
of business in a market or a given client worldwide, well, basically aggregating all the
contracts that the company can sign with the client.
Only those companies having those systems and the teams that you get to run those
systems, I think the ones are really navigating with the eyes open and that is our case.
That's exactly what we have been constructing over the past, well, five years to seven
years now. So but I think you find that really in the presentation walking through the
different sides and, in particular, this EMEA, you see that the situation on – is very different
from one area to another.

Q - William F. Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Okay. Great.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

And your second question, I don't – I didn't really understand what you meant.

Q - William F. Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Sorry. What's the – obviously, you've talked about in the presentation the impact of the –
on the return on allocated capital driven by the low interest rates environment and I was
just really wondering what your reinvestment yields are at present.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

No, actually that doesn't really apply because we price at risk-free rate. But the risk-free
rate as considered will be reduced which has an impact on the return on capital.

Q - William F. Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

FINAL

Sure. And are you able to give us what that reinvestment rate is at the present?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

No, no. I'm not talking of reinvestment rate. I'm talking of risk-free rate. What – when we
price a piece of business, the interest rate we use is the interest rate of government
bonds of the country where the contract is really operating over the duration of that
particular contract. We, of course, cap that in areas and countries where interest rate are
too high but if you look at countries like France interest rate, now well nearly at zero.

Q - William F. Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Yeah. Sure. I absolutely appreciate that, Victor. Maybe it was just – it was more of a
question, I guess, on the investment side.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, if I take Eurozone for contract with 10-year duration, you would have an interest rate
risk free of about 1%.

Q - William F. Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Sure. Okay. Thanks.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

If you would take U.S., it would be for 10 years 2.6%, but those are risk free rates, not
reinvestment rates at all.

A - Benjamin Gentsch

{BIO 5633839 <GO>}

Yes, Will, and to come back to reinvestment rate, you will have the answer during the full
year call on January 5 – or March.

Q - William F. Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Okay. Okay.

FINAL

Yes, good morning. Two questions from my side. The first is on commission. 70% of your
business is proportional. Could you comment on changes you observe when it comes to
commission and whether you expect the 23% guidance under the Optimal Dynamics to
be maintained? And then the second one on M&A, given what you're seeing in the
marketplace, with the consolidation going on, how necessary is additional scale for you
and how is your appetite for large scale deals at this point in time?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

I think, the evolution on commission is twofold. I think what we have observed is, first, is
shift from sliding scale to fixed commission that has been across most of the lines of
business. And secondly, I mean, the increasing commission, the principle we apply, well, of
course, we are in a competitive environment, but principle we apply with our clients is that
if working together with them, they manage to reduce their loss ratios. Well, then, in that
case, there is a kind of a sharing of the benefit between us and them and that correspond
to an increase of the commission level.
So, I think the evolution of the commission level that we see is a feature of, first, the
competition, secondly also, the mix of business with our development in Lloyd's and in
insurance as Lloyd's is, is for us, insurance. So, we are trending, and this is what we have
observed over the past three quarters' results. We are trending towards 24% commission
– between 23% and 24%, and moving towards 24%.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And on M&A?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Regarding the scale, I think today, well, we have all the excess to business we need or we
want, so I think there is absolutely no restriction whatsoever. The response from clients is
positive to the way we approach business and with the way we've been dealing with
them. So, I would think that, as we are today, we have the capabilities to operate, and
basically, to address, well, most of the deals that are available in the market.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Thank you very much.

We'll now take our next question from William Hawkins from KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 17918548 <GO>}

Hello. First of all, Victor, one of SCOR's strategies has been to grow by taking a greater
leadership role of the treaties you're involved in. Could you try and give us a quantitative
indication of how that's developed this renewal season? So maybe, for example, the
percentage of treaties that you've led on this year relative to last year, or any other way
of thinking about that?
Page 6 of 20

FINAL

And then, secondly, could you again just come back to the ROE comment, the 1
percentage point? And just elaborate and clarify what you were exactly telling us there,
because I'm not sure that what you're telling us is kind of comparable with the Optimal
Dynamics ROE targets, certainly at the very least with regards to timing. So, do you think
you took down the ROE in this slide, could you just translate that into how we're seeing
that in the Optimal Dynamics program? Thank you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, I think on the leadership, we are roughly leading one-third of the premium volume
we underwrite, this is increasing marginally. So we were around 32%, we are around 34%.
So I think it's pretty – slightly increasing but overall quite stable in percentage of the
premium. And your second question was?

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 17918548 <GO>}

Well, I'm just interested in, if you could expand slightly on what you've said about the ROE
because you've talked about the expected return on allocated capital being 1 percentage
point lower. But I'm not sure that's exactly the same basis as you define the ROE target
under Optimal Dynamics. So I just wonder if you could confirm that and maybe provide a
bridge between what you're saying in this presentation and the actual Optimal Dynamics
target.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Yeah. Actually, we operate – the governance of the company is to allocate capital to the
two divisions, P&C and Life. And basically, well, we start, of course, with the 1,000-basispoint above risk-free rate. Then according to well, the capital allocation that is driven by
the internal model, we define target return on allocated capital for the two divisions and
based on those targets apply to the capital that is being used by each of the two while
you can rebuild the overall profitability of the group and return on equity of the group. So
what we are saying here is that basically at the January 1 this year, the return on allocated
capital to the division has diminished by 1% basically.
We used to underwrite at a target return on allocated capital that was a bit higher than
what the group was asking us to produce and I would say that with this 1% decrease, we
are now underwriting well basically just at the target rate we need to operate for the
group to produce what it needs to produce. So we don't – we have lost the buffer we had
before.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 17918548 <GO>}

That's very clear. Thank you.

Thank you. We will now take our next question from Thomas Jacquet from Exane. Please

{BIO 4110153 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi. Good morning, guys. Two questions on my side, the first one is on the Credit & Surety
line, I think that your peers commented on a sharper decline because they lost a lot of
business on the big accounts due to higher retention. You had a very good growth. Maybe
can you elaborate a bit on where you've been growing?
And the second is – question is when I look at the traffic slides, it looks like the weakening
cycle is more like a disappearance of the pockets of extra profitability rather than a sharp
deterioration across the board? Is it going to continue, or do you fear that most of the
lines priced adequately will become non-attractive at all in the next renewals? Thank you.
Hello? Hello?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Yeah, yeah. I was just trying to find the traffic lights. I have found them now. Well, regarding
Credit & Surety, I mean, it's no different from U.S. Cat. I mean, we are not all equal in front
of the signings by the client. So, I think, there is no magic here. I think, we had excellent
signings from clients, and, I mean, our growth with global insurers, as our growth with the
prime credit and surety companies is coming from the fact that, yes. I mean, we have had
favorable signings.

Q - Thomas Jacquet

{BIO 4110153 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

On the traffic light, well, I think basically, we are in a softening market, and if you look at
the treaty P&C traffic lights, while very attractive, is gradually disappearing, and you've got
the concentration in the attractive and adequate. I mean, that's quite normal. I don't see
myself the market trend changing dramatically in the rest of the year, this year.
So, I think, yes, you will have further concentration, probably. The only encouraging signs is
probably that the over-placement on certain contracts as it reduced considerably if you
compare the over-placement this year to the over-placement last year. Well, the overplaced is certainly much reduced this year compared to last year. It means that there is
more pick and choose operated by the reinsurers in the market which I think is an
encouraging sign, but adjust the sign, it doesn't stop the downward trend from the
moment, it can slow it down a bit, so I see the situation continuing and I see us continuing
to very, very seriously manage the portfolio.
And again, I insist on the fact that while once you've got that culture in the operation, once
you've got the tools to do it, well, I think you can manage and I think we can manage by
delivering that sort of renewal. We are proving that even in this market by managing the
portfolio intensively, you continue to protect your expected profitability and that's – well,
that's not the most exciting job for the underwriters but that job they are excellent at. And
as long as the market continues to be in that current situation, they are all mobilized to
continue to operate this way.

Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Marcus Rivaldi from Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead.

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. Two questions from me. First of all, on again coming at
Optimal Dynamics, the growth plans that you've embedded within that and that you
confirmed at the last Investor Day, do you still think it's reasonable to be targeting a $6.2
billion book for 2016 on the global P&C business? And then secondly, just looking at what
you're talking about versus price action, versus the impact on your gross underwriting
ratio.
You're saying this year 0.7% price declines, but only 0.2% decrease in or worsening in the
underwriting ratio, whereas last year you have lower price decline at 8.2% but a much
higher impact on the gross underwriting ratio, I think 0.9%. I'm just trying to tell you that it
seems as though last year maybe, in a better market, you were less able to offset
decreases (23:51) structuring around the underwriting ratio. But if you could just explain
that, that will be great. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, what I can say about the assumptions of growth is the one we have now for this year.
I mean, we anticipate this year to close at €5.3 billion, I mean, 2015, €5.3 billion. This is
based on interest rate at December 31, 2014. If the euro-dollar exchange rate moves,
then the projection will have to be readjusted. But as we are today, with that set of
exchange rates, well, we anticipate in 2015 at about €5.3 billion. So, there, of course, I
mean, the assumption of the €6.2 billion in 2016, well, becomes questionable.

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

That's the situation and these assumptions are really adjusted as the market evolves. And
for the moment, we do not have positive evolution in the market. And again, profitability is
for us the main driver, and if we have to sacrifice growth to maintain the profit, we will do.

FINAL

Regarding the last year compared to this year, I think, the situation is – well, should be
interpreted this way. Last year, we had this target of combined ratio which is the driver for
us. We knew we had a bit of leeway and, well, as everything is a matter of compromise.
There was a compromise between how much we had to deliver and how much we would
take as risk and contracts.
Well, when we moved on during this year, and you saw the first, second and the third
quarter, we were looking at our combined ratio. We still want to maintain it at 94%, and
we see that the leeway we have is reducing.
When we went into Monte Carlo, and after Monte Carlo, we gave strict instruction to the
underwriters that what was allowed last year, what was possible last year was not possible
this year, and we have strengthened the guidelines, and we've told them that, well,
basically, this year, we would not be able to tolerate the deterioration that we were able
to tolerate last year and we did tolerate. And this is the reason why in the market that is
probably a bit more difficult than last year. Well, the teams reacted and managed the
renewals in such a way that yes, I mean, the deterioration is lower than last year.

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I mean, just coming back to that, could you give us maybe some color around what was
different this year actually at the cold phase (26:45) in terms of structuring of transactions
that would allow you to have – be in ultimate – a relatively better position this year in a
tougher market than last year?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, it's just a question of the business mix that you renew, what you renew, what you
don't renew and what you eliminate. And it is portfolio management is that. You will
negotiate with clients, the business mix between the different contracts, and at the end of
the day, well, you are talking of a weighted average of what you renew. So, if you renew
more of the good business, if you eliminate more of the business that is
underperforming, well, then you have a weighted average that is slightly improving. That
is what we are doing.
And this year, we did not hesitate. Last year, we maintained certain relationships. I can
take a practical example. Last year, we were in discussion with a very large client and very
tough renewals. But at the end of the day, we thought we could afford to give it a try for
one more year, and we maintained the relationships at profitability that we were,
ourselves, were not expecting to be great, but we did a try. We thought we could afford.
Well, this year, the same situation with the same client repeated. We walked away. It
means that we've been stricter this year in applying the rules as compared to last year
because we think we – overall, the portfolio doesn't give us as much leeway as it was
giving us last year.

Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous.
Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hello. Hi there. Two questions. Victor, could you just clarify again on the proportional
business? What you're saying is that any changes in commission you feel are offset either
because they're sliding scale, therefore loss-dependent, or you're not feeling that they
actually would dilute the economic price change that you're showing for proportional
business, which is essentially flat. I guess it's hard for us to relate pressure – upwards
pressure on commissions to an indication that the economics of proportional business are
essentially flat. Maybe just clarify what you mean there.

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, on retro, I think the implication of what you're saying is whatever growth
deterioration you feel is offset by better retro terms, again, as it was last year. Is that what
you're saying and maybe just a bit more flavor if there's any significant changes to your
retro program? Thanks.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, let's start with the retro program. The retro program, the changes are by
restructuring the aggregate coverage, increasing the number of aggregate coverage and
having the aggregate coverage structured in such a way that the response to what I
would call a non-peak natural catastrophe, whether they are tornadoes, hail, floods, well
anything, but wind and quake basically, the response of these aggregate is being
improved, so the potential efficiency of the retrocession is higher this year than it used to
be last year at the price which is overall in reduction.
So it's much more working with the business models and structuring the retro in a more
efficient way. It means that at the cost which is a bit lower, we combine a larger efficiency
and at the end of the day, the net cost which is how much it cost you, minus the
recoveries, the net costs should be lower this year than it was last year.
And regarding the commission, well, the profitability of the business is assessed on
combined ratio or underwriting ratio, which is loss ratio plus commission ratio. What I was
saying is that in a number of cases, if you work with the client and the client improved
business mix by managing its own portfolio, well, basically, the loss ratio will reduce. If the
loss ratio reduces, well, there is a trade-off between the reinsurer and the insurer on the
commission level. And you then increase the commission, which means that basically, part

Page 11 of 20

of the loss ratio reduction is not transferred to the reinsurer, which is normal, in a way,
asset trading and is kept by the ceding company.
But it means that you can have – I'm not saying all the increase of commission are
operating this way, but you can have increases of commission that at the end of the day
make your business more profitable than it was previously, if the loss ratio of the ceding
company is improving, well, significantly, which happens with portfolio management. It's
not always the case, but it can happen.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. And presumably the...

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Especially in emerging markets, where portfolio management and all the work we are
doing with our clients to improve the underwriting can pay off in a much bigger way than it
does in markets that are already very developed and quite saturated.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. And presumably, the seven point Cat loads shouldn't change for this underwriting
year, not calendar year, the underwriting year you just renewed with the change in retro.
It's simply a cost benefit. The overall net retention is similar.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Victor Peignet

I think the cost ratio of the natural catastrophe is reflecting this net cost I was talking
about. So I would say we don't want to change the seven points, but we are more
comfortable than last year with the seven points.

Thank you. We will now take our next question from Thomas Fossard from HSBC. Please

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Hey. Yes. Good morning, Victor. I've got two or three questions. The first one is on the
target of €5.3 billion premium for the full year 2015. Can you remind us what would be the
USD premium exposed component of this €5.3 billion roughly speaking?
Second question would be on terms and conditions. I understand reading your press
release that you've already did as much as you could on the loosening on terms and
conditions. But at the end of the day, in reality, what really have you accepted in terms of
extension of hour clauses and aggregation? Also, you may have resisted from a policy

point of view, how your exposure has increased potentially as far as extension hours are
concerned?

FINAL

And the last question will be on the Aviation business in specialty lines. Seems to be that
you're reporting a nice growth, 12% growth where we see the trends have been a bit
really mixed and rather disappointing compared to initial expectations. So, a bit more
granularity will be helpful. Thank you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Morning, Thomas. On the dollar – I would say dollar-pound, the dollar is about one-third,
the pound, 10% to 15%. So, overall, if you mix dollar and pound, you are having about half
of the total, as a rule of thumb, then you've got some currencies more or less connected,
but that is the situation.
Regarding Aviation, maybe Benjamin, you want to take this one?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Benjamin Gentsch

{BIO 5633839 <GO>}

Yes, please. On Aviation, as you know, Thomas, most of the Aviation portfolio that has
been renewed consists of the two large participations that we have in LRA and Global
Aerospace. LRA specifically is changing that portfolio with our strong impact, our strong
guidance that we are giving them. Aviation business is, of course, in the media, mostly
talked about in respect of airlines. But the airlines business makes up a relatively small
part of the overall portfolio of LRA and Global Aerospace. In the non-airlines rates,
especially general aviation, products liability, airport liability, we see the rates holding
much better than airline rates, and therefore, we are, overall, quite satisfied with the
business.
It's, of course, on the airlines rates, disappointing because the short increased trend that
we saw towards the end of the third quarter, beginning of the fourth quarter last year has
come to a stop. So, airline definitely is disappointing, but the rest of the business we see
still as adequately priced. And what you see here is the growth of 12% by and large
reflects the business plan that those two underwriting agencies do have, LRA and Global
Aerospace.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, regarding the terms and condition, well, can give you a few figures that illustrate.
This year, for instance, we have a system within SCOR by which the accounts are being
referred, if they do not comply with the underwriting guidelines. This year, the number of
referrals has increased by 50%. So, about 25% of the total premium was submitted for
referral.
So it means that, yes, there was certainly more negotiation. And if we look at the way the
referrals were treated. Last year, for instance, about 80% of the referrals were accepted
as they were presented. This year, this percentage went down to about 60%. So it means
that on 40% of the referrals, while basically the underwriting management team together

Page 13 of 20



Company N ame: SCOR SE

FINAL

with the underwriters, well, renegotiated the conditions that were submitted in order to
bring them into something that was acceptable.
So I think this underwriting management activity is proving that yes that it was much more
controlled and much more subjects of discussion. Regarding the hour clause, well, I think
all around the hour clause is house clause and loss occurrence definition, aggregation of
events will be extremely strict on the aggregation of events. There must be a
commonality of causation and two events that are totally uncorrelated, well, cannot be
aggregated, otherwise we cannot price.
So we've been very strict on that. We have nothing against aggregating tsunami and
quake, tsunami following quake. We can aggregate flood following wind. We can even go
a bit further than that and consider strikes, riots, civil commotion as following a particular
natural catastrophe. But beyond that, well, there are limits well beyond which we would
not go. And we did walk away from a few contracts, but not many actually, where I mean
we could not negotiate around those aggregation clause.

Bloomberg Transcript

The extension of the hour clause is much more a question of pricing and data available. I
think this was dealt with on a case-by-case basis, trying to negotiate within the price the
impact of an extension of our clause. Not without difficulties in certain cases due to lack of
information, but every time subject to a negotiation. So we have done whatever we could
to alleviate the impact on the profitability due to those concessions. So we want to
continue to on two or three others so that I will preempt your next question.
Multi-year capacity has not been really a feature of those renewals. And if you look to our
portfolio today, if I look at how much of our P&L maximum loss exposure is on multi-year,
you are below 15% in the peak variance. So it is not – it has not been a major feature of
renewal and it is not a major feature of our portfolio today.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Okay. And just to come back to the previous question on the seven points of combined
ratio for Nat Cat. Obviously the fact that there is a slight deterioration in the terms and
condition regarding the extension of hour clauses is not creating any specific threat to, I
would say, or risk to the seven points of Cat budget basically.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

No. I don't think so and I'm more appreciative of the way we restructured our aggregate
coverage. So I think the restructuration of our aggregate coverage is having a more
positive impact than the slightly negative that may be associated with the hour clause.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

We will now take our next question from Kamran Hossain from RBC. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Two questions. First one, just on the 94% combined ratio assumption
for this year. On that assumption, does it assume that the expense ratio comes down to
6.5%, down from the kind of slightly above that that you reported at the Q3 results? And
the second question, just on the retrocession program, can you just give us a flavor of
where the new capacity is coming from – or whether actually it's just coming from your
existing sources? Thanks.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Okay. On the combined ratio, you may recall that over the previous quarter of this year,
we commented on the fact that there was seasonality and that the cost ratio would be
landing in the 6.5% sort of area. So, well, bear with us until a month from now and you
judge by the fact. But the structure of the combined ratio, as we have presented it, that
backs the 94% is, in my opinion, is very solid.
The second, on the retrocession, well, I would say that for us, we do not – we have not
really changed our providers of capacity. I mean, we are having panels that have been
very stable, especially on the traditional side, but even on the alternative capacities and
the collateralized reinsurance. We've not – well, we didn't need really new entrants in the
program. So, we have very few changes in the panels.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Just to come back on the retrocession, how long do you think that retrocession pricing
can continue to decline? Because obviously it seems to be – well, not follow – it's neither
following or leading the reinsurance side, but how long do you think that will continue?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, I have no crystal balls, so I don't know. What I can tell you is we ourselves are
extremely careful. And it is not just a question of price. It's a question of long term. I mean
our retrocession is used to, well, protect our capital. It also provide us the peak capacities
that we use to supply capacity to our clients. So, for us, longevity is extremely important.
So, we are not, by all means, looking for price reductions. We are looking for better
structures, better understanding between ourselves and our retrocessionaires, and above
all, longevity of the partnership. So, I think if you are not shopping around, I would think
probably that I don't see a lot more reduction. If you are shopping around, well, there is
an abundant new capacity available, so this is less predictable.

We will now take our next question from In-Yong Hwang from Goldman Sachs. Please go
ahead.

FINAL

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Good morning. This is In-Yong from Goldman Sachs. So, two questions for me. So, you
had quite a lot of benefit from increasing primary rates in the proportional side, and your
non-proportional pricing was down 3.5%. And I was just wondering how the pricing would
have developed if the primary rates haven't benefited so much and just what the latest
trend you're seeing on the primary rate side and whether those increases you see at UBS
(45:30) sustainable?
And second question then, it would be great to get an update on what you're seeing on
your global clients initiative. You gave some business lines that still benefit from it, like
Property Cat in Asia and U.S. Cat, but just – it would be good to get a top-down view of
what you see on a group-wide basis. Thank you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, on the client-focused initiatives, we are addressing three types of clients, basically
the global insurers on which we communicated in about two years ago now. Well, on
global insurers, the position is that we are continuing to grow and we grow because we
spread our wings into their programs and they are allowing us to do so, in particular when
– if and when they restructure it.
So, I think the global insurer is continuing very positively. It – well, what does it mean? it
means certainly more Cat business, but more specialty lines as well.
The second type of client is basically the focus clients in the U.S., most of them being E&S
companies. Here as well, I think we were primarily property and a few specialty with them.
Again, we are broadening the offer and the response is quite positive.
The handicap for us is on the long tail line of business at the moment with the interest
rate, the risk-free rate we are using in the U.S. Well, we have difficulties to be competitive
price-wise and it has a bit slown down the development of the initiative on the long tail.
But overall, I think it is also positive and it is reflected by the time that our premium in the
U.S. increases. And the third type of clients where we have initiatives are emerging market
clients for whom, as I said, we are engaged into know-how transfer and adaptation of
products that are not new to us, but are new to them in their markets.
I think overall, all our clients are appreciating the fact that we are trying to help them to
put new products in the market and to grow their business. And I think that's one of the
role of the reinsurer. That's always been, but it's more, even more going forward to be
kind of supportive to the development of insurance and to the marketing of new products
in end markets.

Thank you. We will now take our next question from Frank Kopfinger. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. I have two questions. My first question is on your canceled
business, the $146 million that you show within the treaty business. Could you dig a little
bit into the drivers behind this, so which lines were most affected or be it the geographies
or also type of business?
And the second question is on your U.S. Cat business, which you grow by 3%. And this
implies that you even more than compensated the weaker prices in this segment. Also
could you elaborate a little bit on what were the drivers there and also whether you're still
satisfied with the price level there?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, the $146 million cancellation on slide number 13, I think that was the subject of your
first question. Well, I think this is primarily European, Middle East and Africa, but, say,
Europe and Middle East type of business that we have had to reduce in order to protect
the profitability. We certainly had problems with motor non-proportional in France and in
UK.
We had also some issues with other contracts in Scandinavia, in Netherlands and in the
Arabic Gulf area. So, a mix of market, but concentrated geographically in Europe and
Middle East. What was your second point?

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

On the growth in US Cat business because it obviously implies that you've more than
concentrated to (50:26).

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, I think on the U.S. business, again, we re-underwrite the portfolio. I think there has
been a good intake of large, large clients, I mean, whether they are large national insurers
or global insurers, at the detriment of regional business where we had to arbitrate in front
of very, very competitive terms and conditions, not only price, but also terms and
conditions referring to Tom Fossard question on hour clause and aggregation. So, I think
the portfolio has shifted towards larger clients, and again, I mean, benefiting from
favorable signing due to the fact that we look at those clients globally and across all their
geographies and all their lines of business.
I think one thing coming back to the questions that I didn't answer from one of your
colleagues, I think what is very encouraging to me in the proportional area is that basically,
if I look between loss ratio and commission, I think that the loss ratio and it is shown in our
portfolio where the attritional loss ratio continues to go down, the loss ratio are going
down. I think the quality of the business that we have in the book is improving and of

Page 17 of 20



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2015-02-10

FINAL

course we pay more commission. But I much prefer a situation like this where I can drive
down my attritional ratio which means that the quality of the business is good, is
improving, and then I pay a bit more commission. If the market terms tomorrow, well the
negotiation is on the commission which is a B2B negotiation between me and the client,
but the business of the client itself is good business.
I think this is a very positive position to have a business where your attritional loss ratio
goes down and if you have to pay a bit more commission because of competition, well, at
the end of the day, well, this is a bit secondary to me. I mean, of course, it needs to
remain within your profitability or requirements. But I think the split between the two, as I
see it moving in our portfolio, I do like it and I think that it shows that the teams are doing
the right job with the clients.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

Operator
Thank you. We'll now take a follow-up question from Thomas Fossard from HSBC. Please
go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Just wanted to come back on the commission side. Earlier in your comments, Victor, you
mentioned that the shift was from sliding scale to fixed scale. Is that a positive trend for
you or I mean would you prefer to stay on sliding scale as obviously this is providing more
stability on the overall profitability of the treaty?
And the second question will be regarding Germany in Treaty P&C, maybe I'm wrong, but
last year, I believe, but maybe this was two years ago, you reported very strong growth,
very good progress in gaining market share on the German market. This year, it's more
flattish or a minus 2%. What obviously seems to be that the German market has been
okay on the cat side, I mean, motor, on motor proportional. So, could you give us a bit
more about potential additional competition you've been facing on the German market
this year around? Thank you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, in Germany, I think that while we have added pretty stable sort of renewal, question
mark is more on the industrial risk at the moment and the profitability of the industrial
business, on the treaties of the German market.
So, I would not say that there is anything particular to notice in Germany and I think that it
has been quite stable. I think we are talking of the market where relationships have been
established and we used to have increases of something like 8%, but we go down to
about 4% and now stable. I think it's very much in continuity.

FINAL

What was the question? The sliding scale. Well, the sliding scale is a feature of uncertainty,
basically. So, once you have, well, a certain situation in a market or in a line of business
where either post-losses, post-crisis or because you are having a certain element of
uncertainly on where the loss ratio is going to be, well, you introduce sliding scale. There
is nothing good or bad, or we cannot say that sliding scale is better than fixed. Well, it all
depends how you size the sliding scale anyway.
So, I think both solutions are totally acceptable. Of course, I mean, if a client is delivering
steady profits and has positive trends in the portfolio, for them there is a logic in trying to
remove the sliding scale and working towards fixed commission. And that's what we
observed in a number of areas.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Okay. And just a final point on that. Is this a noticeable trend you've seen both on the
property and casualty proportional?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, I think it is certain – it is more seen on certain specialty lines than really – I don't think
that was a feature of casualty ever, anyway. While certainly in property and Credit &
Surety, was certainly an area where sliding scales had been introduced after the crisis and
are being removed.
