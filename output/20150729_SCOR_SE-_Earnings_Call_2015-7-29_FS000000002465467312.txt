MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the SCOR Group 2015 First-Half
Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. There will be an
opportunity to ask questions after the presentation.
At this time, I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Bertrand Bougon, Head of
Investor Relations and Rating Agencies. Please go ahead, sir.

Bertrand Bougon

{BIO 18934799 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining the SCOR Group H1 2015 results call.
As usual, please consider our disclaimer on Page 2, which indicates that the presented
financial results have been subjected to the completion of a limited review by SCOR
independent auditors.

CEO and Chairman of the SCOR Group, who is joined on this call by the entire COMEX
team.

Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thank you, Bertrand, and good morning, everyone. I'm extremely pleased this morning
with this quarter as it combines a strong set of results, quality results with positive
announcements, which confirms the relevance of our business model. On the financial
front, SCOR shows a strong dynamism, with a 19.6% increase in the gross written
premium, plus 5.3% at constant exchange rate in the first half of 2015 and an increase in
the core earnings by 28% year-on-year to €327 million.
Both strategy targets of our strategic plan, Optimal Dynamics, have been met and even
exceeded. The annualized return on equity stands at 11.1%, above the target of 1,000
basis points above the risk-free rate, while the solvency ratio calculated by the group
internal model stands at 224%, marginally above the optimal range of 185% to 220%.

Bloomberg Transcript

These excellent results would not be sustainable in the long run without a perfect
combination of an intensive and consistent business approach, driven by agility,
innovation, franchise and diversification.
First, agility, it's a key success factor for SCOR. Thanks to the commitment and expertise
of our teams, SCOR has been able to adapt rapidly in order to seize market opportunities
notably in terms of portfolio management, as Victor will explain later in his presentation.
As an additional example, to optimize our financial structure, we have been able to
successfully issue €250 million subordinated debt at a highly attractive pricing.
Second, our innovation; innovation is part of SCOR's DNA with of course the bringing
together of top scientists including the Economic Nobel Prize winner Mr. Tirole during the
SCOR Foundation Seminar on Climate Risks last June. Also the 20,000 page filing of a
group internal model to the French regulator, the ACPR, in May, in preparation for
Solvency II.
Third, the franchise; over time SCOR successfully expanded and deepened its franchise,
thereby enabling the group to be a strong and recognized tier I player in the industry. The
quality of our franchise is highlighted by Fitch in its upgrade of the Group to AA minus.
This upgrade recognizes our Tier I status and reflects not just the development of our
franchise, but also our capacity to generate a more stable level of profitability.
It also highlights our strong capital position. And in addition, we are currently expanding
our franchise globally with the future opening of two offices, one in India and another one
in Kenya, to capture the growth of these emerging economies. This will increase the
number of SCOR's offices around the world to 41.
Last but not least, diversification; this is key in a softening and volatile market where value
creation depends directly on our ability to optimize risks in terms of assets and liabilities,

life and non-life, biometrics and health, property and casualty and so on.

FINAL

At SCOR, we made the choice to diversify a long time ago. It's one of our strategy
cornerstones, which we leverage everyday to a broad offer of cover in terms of both
business clients and geographies, the IT portfolio management, holistic information
systems and a decision process, which enables us to ensure optimal capital allocation.
I will not explain further today, but we will explore some of these topics and subjects
during our upcoming Investor Day. As you know, it will take place on September 9th in
Paris.
Let me now hand over to Mark Kociancic, the Group CFO, who will give you more details
on the financial performance. Mark, the floor is yours.

Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Thank you, Danny. Moving on to Slide 4, I will walk you through the key financial highlights
for the first half results of 2015. SCOR wrote more than €6.4 billion of gross written
premiums in the first half of 2015, which represents a 19.6% increase at current exchange
rates and a 5.3% increase at constant exchange rates compared to last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

This top line growth is driven by the contribution of both business engines, SCOR Global
P&C with a 19.1% growth at current exchange rates and SCOR Global Life with a 20.1%
growth at current exchange rates.
SCOR recorded high quality results for the first six months of 2015 with a net income of
€327 million, representing an increase of 27.7% year-on-year, while generating 11.1% return
on equity, exceeding the group target set at 1,000 basis points above the risk-free rate.
The P&C net combined ratio for the first half of the year stood at 90.9% in an
environment of low natural catastrophes and an unusually high number of major industrial
losses, while the Life technical margin reached 7.2%.
Finally, SCOR Global Investments delivered a solid return on invested assets at 3.4%,
driven by the active management policy, which has enabled the group to record capital
gains of €129 million in the first half of the year.
Moving on to Page six, the shareholders' equity increased by 5.2% since the beginning of
the year to reach €6 billion. The shareholders' equity was boosted by the strong net
income recorded in the first half as well as the strong foreign exchange impact, which
increased the currency translation adjustment to €280 million for the first six months of
2015, and it was also impacted by the dividend paid in Q2 for €260 million.
In June, we were able to successfully place a €250 million dated subordinated debt
issued with a coupon set at 3.25%. We called two of our existing debts due in 2029 and
2020, respectively, for €10 million in June and €93 million in July.

FINAL

The book value per share stands at €32.29 per share and the financial leverage ratio
stands at 24.1%, below the 25% ceiling. If we include the July redemption of the €93
million debt, our leverage ratio would have been 23.2% as at June 30.
On Page seven, the operational cash flow stands at €130 million for the first half of 2015
and was impacted by foreign exchange rate movements notably on currency hedge
settlements as well as volatility and seasonality in technical cash flows. On a normalized
basis, the net cash flows from operations would be approximately €200 million per
quarter. The increase in net cash flow from financing activities is principally reflecting the
dividend payment and the debt issuance in Q2.
Total liquidity increased to €1.7 billion at June 30th, in-line with the temporary pause of the
rebalancing of the investment portfolio. Approximately €5.8 billion of liquidity, including
cash and short-term investments, is expected to be generated within the next 24 months
from the maturity of fixed income securities and interest coupons.
Now, I'll turn it over to Victor for the P&C results.

Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Good morning. I'm pleased to say that we are reaching mid-year in a favorable situation
despite the trends that are prevailing in the reinsurance markets. The situation is
favorable because of the very strong underwriting performance recorded to-date for
2015. Our competitive situation is also favorable thanks to two prospects. The first
prospect is future technical profits because of the quality and the diversity of the business
that has been booked throughout the first half of this year. The second prospect is new
business development with existing clients, including a promising pipeline of large deals
linked to capital management in a context of changing regulatory environments
Let's talk about the underwriting performance first. This performance is measured first by
the combined ratio that stands at less than 91% on a year-to-date basis, and second, by
the steady growth of gross written premiums. This growth comes out at nearly plus 6% at
constant exchange rates, which is right in-line with our expectations for 2015 as we
previously communicated.
This growth is also very well spread out in terms of geography, helping to further improve
the already high level of diversification of the P&C portfolios. Regarding the year-to-date
net combined ratio, whilst it does reflect the continued low level of natural catastrophe
related loss activity, it contains a higher than normal weight of large industrial losses since
the beginning of this year.
The second quarter in particular has been affected by an unusually high number of large
industrial losses coming from a variety of sectors, with offshore energy being the
dominant one. You will have noticed that the now reserved amount of €55 million before
tax for the large offshore loss that occurred on April 1 – which was commented on when
we released our first quarter result – is in-line with the preliminary indications that were
given at the time.
Page 4 of 21

FINAL

While this unusually high content of large industrial losses impacts the normalized net
combined ratio at mid-year, it does not indicate the development of any particular pattern
and therefore it does not jeopardize our prospect of achieving by year-end close to the
assumed 94% normalized combined ratio for the full-year provided the manmade loss
activity gets back to normal – to its normal average during the remaining two quarters.
Moving on to the prospect of future technical profits; as we reported from the January
and April renewals, as we are now reporting today for the June-July renewals, we have
been able to contain the overall weighted average price reduction at each renewal and
on a year-to-date basis the reduction is limited to about minus 1%.
At the same time, we have seen an increasing number of opportunities to further
strengthen our position with existing clients. And we have been able to seize these
opportunities and terms and conditions that comply with our requirements in terms of
expected profitability, contract structures and contract wordings.
This influx of new opportunities is due to a combination of two factors. Firstly, our clients
and their brokers appreciate our technical and commercial approach to relationships at a
time when a number of them continue to reconsider their reinsurance purchases and to
restructure their programs.

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, we are seeing the effects of the timely launch of several business initiatives,
including the global insurer initiatives, the client focused initiatives in the U.S. and the
transfer of products and know-how in partnerships with clients from emerging markets,
particularly in the Asia-Pacific region for the time being.
At the June-July renewals, these new opportunities are the main contributors to a growth
of nearly plus 14% in gross written premiums despite the cancellation of premiums
amounting to 8% of the total renewable volume.
In addition to this flow of business, we are also seeing an increasing number of potential
large deals, each corresponding to a particular situation that has developed for a given
client, but all related one way or another to capital management.
In this respect, the launch of our alternative solution initiatives 18 months ago has proved
to be timely and helps to position us at a strategic level with our clients. The team has
been particularly active since the beginning of the year, has gained in reputation and
recording a number of significant wins.
Two such deals were booked at the June-July renewals and bring the total growth in
gross written premiums up to nearly plus 24% in the total volume of premiums up for
renewal. It's worth mentioning that these two deals are not one-off deals and are here to
stay with us for at least several years.
This concludes my presentation of the mid-year results for the division. And I will now give
the floor to Paolo for the Life side. Thank you.

Paolo de Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Thank you, Victor. Moving on to Page 11 of the presentation, SCOR Global Life continues to
deliver healthy growth and a strong technical performance in the first half of 2015. Our
gross written premiums reached €3.6 billion, which represents a growth of 20.1% at
current exchange rates or 4.9% at constant exchange rate. I'm pleased to say that this
growth is well balanced, both from a business perspective and from a geographical
perspective.
First, SCOR Global Life has been able to grow in each of these three business areas:
Protection, which is core to our offering; Financial Solution and Longevity. In Longevity, we
expect to meet the gross written premium assumptions for 2016 as set out in Optimal
Dynamics already 2015 as deal flow continues to be strong.
Second, SCOR Global Life has been able to successfully execute its strategy of expanding
its market footprint, particularly in Asia-Pacific where premiums are up 26% at constant
exchange rate compared to last year.
As a result, we have been able to deliver a robust technical margin this semester at 7.2%,
ahead of the 7% expected in Optimal Dynamics thanks to the profitability of new
business, which continues to meet the group ROE target, and thanks to the claim and
persistency experience of the in-force book, which is in line with our expectations.

Bloomberg Transcript

I will now hand over to François de Varenne, CEO of SCOR Global Investments, who will
update you on our group investment strategy.

François de Varenne
Thank you, Paolo. Moving on to Slide 12, SCOR's total investment portfolio reaches €26.1
billion at the end of June 2015, with an invested asset portfolio of €17.3 billion, compared
to €18.1 billion at the end of March 2015 and €16.2 billion at the end of December 2014.
These changes in our invested assets are mainly explained by FX movements during the
period and to a lesser extent by mark-to-market changes driven by interest rate volatility.
The global environment remain very challenging. Uncertainties related to central banks
exit strategies, notably regarding future rate hikes by The Fed and the Bank of England
coupled with strong geopolitical tensions around Greece and a slowdown in emerging
countries, in particular in China, have generated increased volatility and risk aversion
across all markets.
In this context, SCOR Global Investments has momentarily paused its rebalancing strategy
of shifting the portfolio towards the strategic asset allocation set out in Optimal Dynamics.
Liquidity has tactically been increased by 4 points to reach 9% of invested assets. At the
same time, the duration of the fixed income portfolio remains stable at 4.1 year. The
quality of the fixed income portfolio has been maintained with a stable average rating of
AA minus.

FINAL

Moreover, SCOR Global Investments has maintained a very strict policy of avoiding any
sovereign exposure to Eurozone peripheral countries, which could have been seen as
conservative during the previous quarters, but which has been particularly relevant given
the recent Greek turmoil.
At the end of June, expected cash flows on the fixed income portfolio over the next 24
months stand at €5.8 billion, including cash and short-term investments, facilitating
dynamic management of the reinvestment policy in case of a potential interest rate
increase.
In spite of the adverse economic environment and the prolonged low yield context in all
major currencies, SCOR Global Investments manages to deliver a strong and recurring
return on invested assets, which stands at 3.4% for both the second quarter of 2015 and
for the first half of the year. In comparison, the performance during the first half of 2014
stood at 2.9%.
During the first half of 2015 invested assets generated a financial contribution of €297
million, of which €128 million of realized gains. Those realized gains come mainly from the
fixed income and equity portfolios, which validates the dynamic management of the
investment portfolio pursued by SCOR Global Investment and the diversification across a
wide spectrum of asset classes.

Bloomberg Transcript

SCOR Global Investments remains confident despite an exceptionally low yield
environment in its ability to deliver for the full year 2015 a return on invested assets at the
top of the 2.7%, 2.9% range that was mentioned at the beginning of the year.
And now I will hand over to Bertrand Bougon for the conclusion of the presentation.

Good morning, thank you very much and well done for – fantastic results, very lovely. Just
due to (20:45) solvency 224% is the figure on the slide. Does that include the benefit of
the €250 million bond issue and the rise in risk-free since the start of the year and what
could be the impact out of that?
And then the second question is relating to the consolidation in the industry and your
strong growth. So is the strong growth you're seeing partly because all the clients are kind
of scared of having all their reinsurance with just one large group with a big chain credit
risk or – and if not, would you be tempted to do a deal yourself ? Thank you.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thank you, Michael. Mark, the first question?

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Sorry. For the solvency ratio, the 224% was our estimate based on the 2014 yearend
figures. It does not include the June issuance of the €250 million. That would be
approximately a little over 6 basis points of positive benefit. And the current rise that
we've seen in interest rates this year is not reflected in that figure thus far.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Got it. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Victor, on the effect of consolidation?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, there's always probably in the minds of the client the fact of not concentrating or
over-concentrating their recoverables with any particular re-insurer. But I don't think that's
the main driver for the growth. In my opinion, the main driver for the growth – and the
growth is already concentrated in the U.S. at the moment as you can see in the reports of
the renewal, for instance, and in Asia-Pacific. I mean the growth is just a resultant of the
business initiatives that we have taken.
I think the global insurer is certainly one where we spread across all the alliance and all
geographies. I think the U.S. focus is working very well. As you can see, we are reporting
new clients coming in. Those new clients are all U.S. clients. We are talking about 15 new
clients in the U.S. Our total book of clients at the moment on the treaty side in the U.S. is
about 300. So – well, it's picking up and I think the traction is there. So, no, I think there are
a number of restructuring of programs and every time there is a restructuring, cards are
back on the table and there is a redistribution and we are benefiting from it.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. We can now take our next question from Thomas Jacquet from Exane. Please
go ahead, sir.

Q - Thomas Jacquet

{BIO 4110153 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. My first question is regarding your shareholder base. Did you receive
any declaration from your largest shareholder and maybe you could say what would be
the management's reaction to an offer on your share – on your company?
And my second question is relating also to the arrival of a new generation of investors in
the reinsurance space. We've seen some deals from Chinese companies with a very
different view on the asset allocation. Do you think it's only a short-term trend and plus
the arrival of a new capital or is it something that could change the equilibrium of pricing
because of a different cost of capital for these guys?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thank you, Thomas. The rule certainly we follow is not to comment shareholders'
decisions or shareholder strategy. And so all questions related to Sompo has to be
addressed to Sompo. Sompo has informed the market that they have now bought Martin
Ebner's shares, which is around 7.9%, and so that's what they have registered. But to our
knowledge, they didn't cross the 10% threshold because it should have been something
sent to the AMF and we haven't seen this declaration, it didn't take place yet.
And so Sompo has made the declaration that they would like to reach 15% in the future of
a shareholder. So I will stop there because those are public announcements by Sompo
and we have a rule, we don't comment on shareholder's attitude, we don't comment on
shareholders' prospects and we don't comment on shareholders' strategies. Let's be
clear on that side.
To my knowledge – but I did read the press this morning. There's no bid on SCOR, at
least not at the time I'm talking to you. But I promise you, Thomas, I would immediately
call you if this is the case.
On the attitude of Chinese investors, it's true that we see Chinese investors in the
insurance and reinsurance area. Well, I mean, we've seen two Chinese investors
interested by expanding and investing in insurance and reinsurance. And I ask Mark
Kociancic to comment because he is head of strategies at SCOR.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Yes. It's not just limited I think to Chinese investors, but it's more of a global trend that
we've seen all kinds of different forms of capital pursuing both life and non-life

operations. I think it's certainly here to stay. There's clearly been all kinds of arbitrage
that's been demonstrated for the past few years and there's a continued appetite in this
environment to pursue assets in the insurance space. It's a very lucrative area from their
perspective and I think you will see that.
The other side of it I think is – your comment on the lower cost of capital from some of
these regions, that's something that we've seen demonstrated in a few of the
transactions that we've been following the last couple of years, and that's part of this
arbitrage process as well. So in my opinion here to stay and will continue.

Thank you. We can now take our next question from Kamran Hossain from RBC. Please go
ahead.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Good morning. It's Kamran Hossain from RBC. I've got three questions. First is just on
the mid-year renewals. Could you let us know how much of the business that you raised at
the mid-year renewals – obviously, you had very strong growth – how much of that you led
this year versus last year?
And the second question, obviously the economic solvency is going in the right direction.
It sounds like it's going to be north of 230% once you make all the adjustments. Can you
just comment on what the impact of very strong premium growth on a reported basis
does for the S&P capital model? Just interested in kind of how those two models square
off against each other. Thanks.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thanks, Kamran. Maybe again on the renewals, Victor, if you could give some more flavor
or color.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, I think on the renewal, we have been leading about one-third of the business of the
premium we underwrite. I think this is not materially moving. We are still about there. The
only remark is that because of this influx of deals that are negotiating much more on the
one-on-one basis than on the syndicated basis, well, this part of the premium can be
considered in a way as a premium we lead in a sense that we stand by our terms and we
negotiate our own terms. So I think if you add that up, yes, probably our leaded premium
volume is going to be at the end of the year increasing from what it used to be last year
and the year before.

Thank you, Victor. Mark?

FINAL

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

On your second question related to the S&P capital impact of strong growth, several
points to make here, actually. I think the impact is somewhat more modest than you might
think or muted, largely because a significant chunk of the growth that we're having is FX
related. So when we reported a figure – premium growth of approximately 20% for the
year, constant exchange rates were a little over 5%. So there is a good chunk that is
related to FX.
Why is that important? Well, we also have a significant amount of shareholders' equity
denominated in foreign currency and it's usually matched to the underlying growth of the
premium. So that helps to support the growth as well. And traditionally, if you look back on
a historical basis, we've had significant capital generation internally to support our growth
overall from our business plan. So I expect to have a rather modest impact from the
growth. It shouldn't be that material to the S&P ratio because we are self-sustaining with
not only our strategy, but the earnings growth that comes along with it.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Perfect. So this year is the year for the upgrade then? I'll let them answer that.

Thank you. We can now take our next question from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca.
Please go ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. Vinit here from Mediobanca. Just one thing. Victor, you – sorry, two
questions. Victor, one, you mentioned the promising pipeline of solvency relief deals and
we recently heard from another reinsurer that at least in China there are fewer of those.
Could you just comment on what could be driving the clients to go for solvency relief
when the equity value is also rising for them, probably?
And the second thing is on this industrial loss normalization that we expect. I know you
commented that there's no pattern, but is there any chance that some of these higher
Page 11 of 21



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2015-07-29

incidents are coming from some recent treaties in the last few years where there were
some terms or conditions or – I'm just wondering why you expect a normalization? Maybe
there is just no pattern that said, but just a comment would be useful. Thank you.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

FINAL

Victor?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Yes. I didn't talk specifically on solvency relief. I was talking about capital management,
which in my opinion is different. I mean, you can manage your capital and look at your own
cost of capital, compare it to diversified reinsurer cost of capital and you might find ways
to make certain contracts with the reinsurers, which improves your overall return. So it's
much more capital management than solvency relief.
Regarding China and your comment, I think we will see at the end of the year – well, there
are two things in China happening at the moment. There is C-ROSS, of course, which is
the new regulation that reduces capital requirement in certain lines of business.

Bloomberg Transcript

There is also an ongoing liberalization of the motor business in China. So the two
tendencies or the two trends are a bit contradictory as far as basically equity shares on
motor in particular are concerned. So I think it's probably too early to say anything about
what's going to be the sessions on motor in China at the end of the year.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

Thank you.

A - Victor Peignet

What was your second question?

Q - Vinit Malhotra

The second question was on...

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Large loss pattern.

A - Victor Peignet

Well, I think the large loss pattern – well, there is no commonality between the losses.
They are coming from different sectors. I mean, we have offshore energy losses, but we
have also satellite losses, we have general industry losses, food processing, in particular.
I think nothing in those losses indicates that there could be any form of, say, for instance,
economic downturn, causations or things like that. So because there is no commonality –
well, it's just coincidence that they all occurred in a very, well, compact period of time. So

I'm quite convinced myself that it's a kind of a peak and there is no reason why it should
not come back in the next quarters to a more normal sort of occurrence numbers.

Sure. And nothing in the treaties of – you know, in recent years there may have been

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

No, the losses themselves are all straightforward losses. The amount that is of the
indemnities have got nothing to do with problems in the contract. They are genuine
losses and the covers are genuine covers. Well, I mean, it's just a question that they are
large. Some of them may be complex technically and they may take a bit of time to adjust.
But there is no controversial elements on the contract wordings, for instance, at all.

Q - Xin Mei Wang

{BIO 16662657 <GO>}

Hi, this is Xinmei Wang from Morgan Stanley. I have two questions, please. So first is on
the P&C commissions ratio, which I think increased about 40 basis points from 1Q. I mean,
I assume it's coming from some mix effects as we saw last quarter. But I was wondering if
that's a number we should expect to return to on a full-year basis, as I think you've
preciously said it should be around 23%, 23.5%. So could you give us an update on that
number please?
And my second question is on the specialty market. So I saw you – there's a €37 million
new aviation deal. We've had some commentary of the specialty players that rates are
declining in that market, perhaps moderate rate of decline, but still declining. So I was
wondering what your outlook is was for that market and if you think there are more
opportunities there.
And then more generally on specialty lines, do you see rate declines in the market or are
you comfortable with what you're seeing at the moment? Thank you.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thanks a lot. Maybe we start with the commission.

FINAL

For the commission ratio, the answer is going to be the same as the last quarter because
I think I got the same question in the last quarter. What we are seeing is a shift between
the attritional loss ratio and the commission ratio – SCOR's response to an increased
weight of proportional business in our portfolio. Nothing wrong with it. I mean, that has
been the trend for the last 18 months or so.
I believe that there is a bit of seasonality there. So on a prospective basis, I believe we
should land for the full-year on 24.5% of commission. What is important to look at is what
we call the technical ratio, which is attritional plus commission. And if you look at this one,
well, the trend continues to be a bit downward as it has been for the past few years.
Benjamin, maybe you want to comment on the specialties and the aviation in particular.

A - Benjamin Gentsch

{BIO 5633839 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, just to comment on the aviation (36:54) cost that we had that is displayed (36:55)
here. It is, as mentioned, driven by one large contract that we have subscribed newly with
an existing client. This comes from the strategy of basically redesigning the aviation
portfolio such that we rely on a few important relations with clients where we want to
have strong participation with the leading players in this market and not with just followers
or small players in the aviation market. So it's really this strategy of having four
cornerstones in the aviation market with large participations there.
Specialty overall, as you can see also on this Slide 9, has not grown in the other lines of
business tremendously. It is a very stable renewal. And this is a reflection of how we see
the market. It is not moving very strongly, definitely not moving in terms of price increases.
It is behaving like the overall P&C market. So we think still – and you could see this in the
traffic lights that we have displayed in the Monte Carlo presentation, you could see that
many of those specialties are just considered to be priced adequately.
So we think there would be some potential for price increases, but currently don't see
them. So it's a stable market, still some opportunities, but not enough yet to grow
strongly. So the real growth was coming from this one strong – one large deal that we did.
And as Victor has mentioned in his introductory remarks, this is a deal that we have done
for a couple of years. So it's not a one-off.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

FINAL

Hello. Thank you very much. Back to Vinit's question on manmade losses, could you give
us an indication of what you think has been the normal manmade loss impact on your
combined ratio over the past few years, so what's been the average? And then what was
the total impact in the second quarter? You kindly mentioned I think the Pemex figure, but
it sounds like there's lots of other stuff going on as well. So what would you say was the
manmade impact in the second quarter?
And then secondly, your investment revenue, so the income line before capital gains, I
think there has been quarterly volatility now in the first and second quarter from marking
to market some inflation linked bonds. Could you tell us what the second quarter impact
was and remind me what the first quarter impact was and ideally also say how much of
those numbers was in the P&C division, specifically? Thank you.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Let's go back to the manmade losses and Victor.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think the average is between 5% and 6% part of the combined ratio, I believe. As far as
this particular quarter, I think we are – well, we are higher. I don't think we have our market
share of those losses. If you take Pemex, for instance, I think we are below our average
market share on the offshore market on that loss, probably a bit the same on some
others.
I would say that this quarter stands at about 2% combined ratio higher than what we have
been the kind of a normal. So if you look at that, I mean, our 57.5% on a year-to-date
basis, you look at it – well, you take 2% more, so it means that our attritional for this
quarter year-to-date is about 55.5% very close to the 56% that we were trending to.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

That's very clear, thank you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

So I think what it means to me is two things because we have consciously limited our
shares to portfolio shares and we are avoiding to create peaks in our portfolios. We are
probably in a relatively good position to absorb those losses. And when we have an
unusually high number of those – well, we are not on all of them, again, due to probably
the – not probably, certainly, the selectivity of the underwriting. So even in that situation
you see that our portfolio is capable to absorb and withstand those – well, not shocks, but
semi shocks.

Q - William Hawkins

Thank you.

François?

FINAL

A - François de Varenne
So, on the impact of inflation, so you're right. So in Q1 the income yield on the portfolio
was 1.8% and I mentioned during the call – the presentation of the Q1 results the one-off –
negative one-off impact on the inflation linked portfolio of 23 basis points.
In Q2 we have two effects. So the first one is the dividends on the equity portfolio. This is
a seasonal effect that we observe each year and the effect here is roughly 20 basis
points. And we have the opposite effect on the inflation in portfolio observed in Q1 and
here this is a positive effect of 17 basis points.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Sorry, François. Could you put that into euros, please?

A - François de Varenne
In euros?

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes.

A - François de Varenne
Roughly the inflation linked portfolio we have an exposure of €750 million today.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

So I can just take 17 basis points on that?

A - François de Varenne
Yes.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

And how much is the non-life?

A - François de Varenne
Through IFRS rule where we have to capitalize the new inflation level until the redemption
of the bond each quarter. So when we have revision of expectation on inflation, we have
to book this impact under IFRS.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

And how much of that is non-life, the vast majority, yes?

Thank you. We can now take our next question from In-Yong Hwang from Goldman Sachs.
Please go ahead.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Hi, I'm In-Yong Hwang, Goldman here. Two questions; one on July renewals and it looks
like bulk of the new business that you got there came from your global insurers initiatives.
And just on that, do you still continue to see the same level of opportunities there or is
there any sense that all the low-hanging fruits have been picked in that initiative, and you
need to turn your focus more to, for example, the U.S.?

Bloomberg Transcript

And secondly, in the July pricing trends, it looks like in the U.S., we could be potentially
seeing the floor to a lot of the pricing declines that we've been – since the last two
rounds. Could you talk a bit more about what you're seeing in Europe and Asia, the price
declines there seem to be continuing? Is that more because of the new capital that we've
been talking about earlier in the call or is that kind of (44:20) the U.S. capital is trying to
find new geographies to find better pricing? Thank you.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Victor?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, I don't think we are at the end of the global insurers initiatives. I think we still have
room to progress in there – I mean, with a certain number of them. So certainly not. In
addition, the same approach is now being extended to regional insurers that are
expanding in their own regions and what has been successful with the global insurers we
believe is going to be successful with regional. So our list of global, which is about 14-15 of
them, we are heading to that now, regional insurers to whom we are offering the same
sort of organization, specific organization.
Regarding the pricing trends, well, I don't think the pricing trend downwards is due to
alternative capital. I mean, that applies for cat business certainly and to a more limited
extent, because I think that on U.S. cat, for instance, some of it has been retrenching
recently. No, I think it's just over capacity in markets, activity of brokers, pressure on
budgets on the client side, economic downturn that puts all the chain under pressure.
That combined with the fact that for the moment at least the results are very good. Well,
that creates a very heated market where you have to operate with a lot of discipline and
that's what we are doing.

Thank you. We can now take our next question from Thomas Fossard from HSBC. Please
go ahead.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Good morning. Just two question, one for Victor, one for François. The question for Victor
is, now that the – probably almost the entire P&C book has been renewed, could you tell
us if there has been any significant changes between the type of business you have
written or the structure of the portfolio between proportional and non-proportional versus
last year? That will be the first question.
Second question would be for François. Obviously, you've got this active capital
investment management and gains extraction. But I just wanted to get your feel on what
was the sensitivity of your fixed income portfolio, because looking at the unrealized gains
on the fixed income book, you've got €120 million unrealized gains, which seems to be
rather low especially if we are now expecting the U.K. and the U.S. interest rates to move
up, which potentially could lead to be in negative territories pretty quickly. So I was
wondering how you feel currently about this. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

As I said, there is a bit of an increase of the weight of proportional in the book by a few
percentage points. That's – fundamentally the structure of the portfolio, the composition
of the portfolio is not materially changed, but there is a trend to book more proportional –
which corresponds basically to the fact that we operate as a Tier I global reinsurer. And
there are opportunities on proportional that only those ones are being offered at the
moment. We will – on the IR Day, we will come with the same presentation as last year, a
bit more focused even on segmentation of clients and portfolio. So you will have a very,
very precise view of how we have evolved during the year. But structurally no massive
changes.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

And also to increase the propositional part of a portfolio is rather opportune because the
rates for primary insurance fare better than the rates for reinsurance. So that explains
partially the performance of SCOR as compared to some of the peers that do practice
mostly non-proportional business. François?

A - François de Varenne
Thomas, on your question, I think we made the demonstration not only since the
beginning of this year, but over the last few years on our ability and capacity to deliver
recurring contribution coming from realized gain on the portfolio. And I think we
demonstrated that this strategy is not linked to the fact that we want to milk the fixed
Page 18 of 21

FINAL

income portfolio, but that's linked to the active strategy we've got. So to manage the
fixed income portfolio, but also to take the performance on non-yielding asset classes,
where, again the gains are the only solution under IFRS to recognize the performance.
So that's the first point. I think we made the demonstration this year in particular since the
beginning of this year that the contribution on the realized gain is really coming from nonyielding asset classes, in particular equities, but also we had some gain on the real estate
portfolio this year and last year and we still expect in the future to generate realized gain
from those asset classes.
You're right, if interest rates are going to increase especially in the U.S. and in the U.K. that
will be a negative news, unrealized gain on the fixed income portfolio denominated with
those currencies will decrease. But I remind you that we have a short positioning in terms
of duration. So the impact compared to peer will be extremely limited – and that's a
positive news.

Bloomberg Transcript

I remind you also that since we have a shorter duration on the asset side compared to the
liability side, it means that if interest rates are going to increase, we are going to increase
the economic capital in the economic balance sheet. So the opposite effect that one
observed under IFRS. And of course given the short positioning and the huge amount of
liquidity we've got on the portfolio over the next 24 months, the positive news is that our
reinvestment rate is going to increase and is going to increase more rapidly again
compared to our peers.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Okay. Maybe one question for Paolo, if I may, on the 7.2% technical margin. Obviously,
you're pointing to mortality in-line with expectation. So I know it's tiny things, but is there
anything to read in the 20 bps better margin reported in Q2? Thank you.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thank you, Thomas, to ask that question to Paolo, who is falling asleep. So, Paolo, wake
up, your question.

A - Paolo de Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

No, there is no key driver on it. Overall experience, as I said, during my brief presentation
both on persistency and claims experience has been neutral to slightly positive in the first
half. We are picking up very good business from a profitability perspective and we spend
a lot of time optimizing the performance of the in-force. So I think you're probably going
to see that there to stay for the – close to the rest of the year.

Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I have two questions for François. My first question
is on your rebalancing strategy, which is now on hold. Could you elaborate a little bit
what's your strategy there going forward and what would be the driver to rewind it again?
Or the flip side of the question is certainly should we expect that your liquidity position is
going to rise again as obviously the economic environment remains uncertain?
And the second question is, coming back to William's question on the sensitivity or the
impact from this inflation linked securities. I wasn't clear with the 17 basis points and the 23
basis points impact, whether the basis is whether you're referring to the return on
investment here or whether it's really the 17 basis points on the €750 million that you were
mentioning?

A - François de Varenne

Bloomberg Transcript

On the rebalancing strategy, as I explained during my talk, it's a tactical move and a
decision that we took at the beginning of the second quarter of this year just to cope with
the current uncertainties, namely in the Eurozone, it was impossible to predict the
outcome of the Greek situation. In the U.S. and in the U.K. we see again a growing
uncertainty linked to the timing of the first interest rate hike by central banks and then the
pace of implementation of their exit strategies. And in emerging countries, that's linked to
the Chinese situation.
So it's really a tactical move. We increased liquidity from 5% to 9%. Don't expect a major
increase in the future. You know that at SCOR we have a culture to protect the value of
the portfolio as soon as we see uncertainty growing. Having said this, what we expect in
the future is positive news. Since 48% of the portfolio is denominated in USD, 10% of the
portfolio is denominated in GBP, what we expect in the future on the portfolio are positive
news linked to the fact that those two central banks are probably going to increase
interest rate after the summer or by the end of this year, so which means we will reinvest
at higher rates in the near future.
I come back on the inflation book. So the impact mentioned is the impact on the total
yield, not the impact on the portfolio. Again, it was a negative one-off in Q1. It's a positive
one-off in Q2. Overall, in H1, it's almost neutral. So that's just linked to the IFRS rules. But
on the first six months, let's say that the impact is really marginal.
