{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Good afternoon everybody. The Group results for the third quarter are NOK176 million
and NOK185 million year-to-date. We see continued strong growth in our core business
and the top line is growing by 8.5% adjusted for non -- discontinued business and
currency developments. There is a positive development in operational costs, which are
down in the third quarter compared to the second and ﬁrst quarter. However, the results
are negatively impacted by ﬁnancial results following increased credit spreads, negative
equity markets and a generally very low interest rate environment in Norway and Sweden
and indeed Swedish short-term interest rates are negative.
However, the core business grows well with 17% growth in written premium in the
insurance business, 27% growth in the unit-linked business and premiums. I would also
like to emphasize that the longevity strengthening program continues and we have done
another 200 million this quarter, even if this has been a challenging quarter and twothirds of the overall longevity strengthening has been completed now, less than two years
into a seven-year plan of doing so. The estimated Solvency II ratio is at 146% and I will give
more details around that in a moment.

Bloomberg Transcript

If you ﬂip over to slide number three, this just to remind you that we have a two-fold
strategy, where we are managing the back book with an objective to enter into a Solvency
II world, and operate in Solvency II world with the solvency ratio in excess of 130%. At the
same time, we're also growing a front book with savings for retirement and insurance
business without guarantees, and this is indeed important to have as a background when
we ﬂip over to the following page, page four. The Solvency II ratio is 146 with transitional
rules and 104 without transitional rules in the quarter.
The fall from 154 to 146 with transitional rules is due to falling equity markets which gives
two eﬀects. One eﬀect is that as part of our dynamic hedging program, we sell equities in
a falling market and also therefore in value relative to other things. So the equities as part
of the total goes down. The second factor is that the stress under Solvency II is reduced
when stock markets fall and they have been reduced by -- from 42% to 36% according to
the methodology in this quarter. So that is the reason why the -- with transitional rule
number goes down.
This development in the number without transitional rules from 114 to 104 includes our
own improvements of approximately 2 percentage points on top of the 3 percentage
points we did in the second quarter. Also it includes a revision of expected development
in the paid-up policies with the investment choice, paid-up policies and deﬁned beneﬁts
in the deﬁned beneﬁt book, where we expect somewhat less conversion than previously,
which gives us more paid-up policies that we had in the previous estimate. At the same
time, we've done improvements in the risk management and dynamic investment policy,
which is the explanation about the total number.
When we look at the estimated sensitivities, we've done a slight change in the way we
present this compared to what we did last year. And this is because when interest rates
fall, as you can see in the second column on the right hand side, interest rates minus 50
basis points, typically the number without transitional rules will go down. However, the
Page 2 of 13



Company Name: Storebrand ASA

Date: 2015-10-28

FINAL

transitional rules will increase in value and therefore the top number of 146 does not
necessarily change at all with the fall in interest rates. So this is important part to keep in
the back of your heads when you look at sensitivities going forward. And this may -- will
make it easier maybe to understand the sensitivities done, it has been previously.
I would also like to add that we do have a pipeline of additional measures including how
we model tax as a cushion if you want a buﬀer in terms of income volatility. And also
segmentation and risk management, there are additional measures that we are in the
process of implementing. This makes us conﬁdent that we will be able to deliver another
5 percentage points by all measures by the end of the year according to the previously
communicated plan that we will be able to do at least 10 percentage points by all
measures.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we ﬂip over to the following page, page ﬁve, this is to show graphically how the
development in income is changing and how we indeed, we are growing it the front book
and you can see this on the left hand side where we have the revenues or the income
from the third quarter 2014. We have a signiﬁcant increase in revenue from the savings
business. There is a small income increase in guaranteed pensions, but then in the public
sector, which is in -- which we are getting auto as well as corporate banking which are
both to be closed within a very short period of time. We obviously loss the revenues at the
same time.
So we're actually able to maintain a reasonable growth in the top line despite the fact that
we have signiﬁcant parts of our business which is -- which we are exiting from. And this is
also illustrated on the right hand side, where we see that the revenue from the savings
business grows quite predictably and linearly, while the development in guaranteed
pensions has very signiﬁcant shift in the beginning of 2014 as a consequence of the fact
that we were started to the longevity reserves strengthening program at this time, but also
as a part of the strategic shift away from guaranteed pensions.
Flipping over to page six, our CEO presented a new organization this summer, and the
new organization has the objective of increasing proﬁtability and improving customer
centricity. We have also introduced in our Capital Markets Day about a year ago, a costincome target. And you may have seen in press in Norway talking about layoﬀs within the
distribution area in Norway earlier this year -- earlier this quarter, earlier in October, where
it was announced as staﬀ reductions of about 65 full time employees within this year.
That's approximately 15% of the staﬀ in this area.
We are going through the whole Group in order to strengthen proﬁtability, reduce costs,
and improve eﬃciencies. Some of the cost reductions will be a reallocation of resources
to other areas, but overall the cost level needs to come down and we will continue to do
so. However, this is not part of a cost reduction program as such, but more a part of
ongoing business this year, next year and forever.
We also announced this morning that we are in ﬁnal negotiations with a potential partners
on the partial ownership of Storebrand Baltic, our operations, back oﬃce operations in
Vilnius in Lithuania, where we currently have 370 employees. The ambition of with these

Page 3 of 13



Company Name: Storebrand ASA

FINAL

negotiations and the strategic partnership that we are looking at is to leverage innovation
capacity and create more customer-friendly solutions. At the same time automate manual
processes to reduce operational cost and to move from a world where we have a lot of
ﬁxed cost to more variable cost base.
We're quite conﬁdent that this will give -- achieve those objectives. However, we're not
going to give you any number at this stage, as we are still in ﬁnal negotiations with the
partners, but will revert to the market with more details on this in due course and well
before Christmas.
On page seven, we see the continued strong growth in the front book with 26% increase
in unit linked reserves, 12% increase in asset management reserves, the strong growth in
premiums and the insurance as I've already commented upon. And also we see in the last
couple of quarters, an improvement in retail loans and indeed, we had an increase in
mortgages of about 5% over the last six months. So we're now taking market shares in this
markets.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then I would like to ﬂip over to page 18. So ﬂipping towards the end of the presentation.
On page 18, we show that we have strengthened longevity reserves or we will continue to
strengthening our longevity reserves by an additional 200 million this quarter, and now
done two-thirds of what is needed. The Group has had a charge of 96 million in this
quarter as a direct contribution in order to achieve that reserve strengthening.
Moving over to page 19, we see the development or the expected development of cost to
shareholders of the remaining of longevity reserve strengthening. The public sector has
now been fully reserved and it's in runoﬀ, at the same time, we have a lot of individual
contracts which has achieved full reservation as well as reservations done strong through
the conversions to paid-up policies with investment choice. When we now look at the
estimated reserve strengthening needs going forward and the estimated cost to
shareholders. We see that this will decrease from 90 million a quarter to an average of 65
million a quarter.
That is somewhat front-loaded with more charges in '15 and '16 and then falling to about
50 million per quarter in 2017 onwards. As a total, this will decrease the charge to
shareholders of about NOK0.5 billion compared to previous estimates. And ﬁnally on
page 20, we continued to show you estimated return on the paid-up policy book which is
the most challenging book that we on the balance sheet. As a consequence of the
signiﬁcant hold to maturity bond portfolio or bonds at amortized cost portfolio and with
the good running yield as well as a low investment risk in the rest of the portfolio, we do
expect to continue to achieve a return of about 4% or in excess of 4% for the whole period
after 2020.
And I would like to remind you that after 2020, we will ﬁnalize the longevity reserve
strengthening and the average guarantee goes down to approximately 3% from then
onwards. And we will therefore be able to also meet that guarantees by reinvestments
currently being done at -- well above 3%, 3.5% was one of the last investments we had. So

Page 4 of 13

FINAL

we're still making reinvestments in this portfolio at levels which are worried about
guaranteed.
And I think, I would like to conclude the presentation by just saying that there are, we
have weak results in SPP or in Swedish operation due to lack of proﬁt split with a low
ﬁnancial return in those portfolios in the quarter. We also had a weak results on the
Company portfolio, as consequence of many of them being invested in a large part of the
Company portfolios being invested in credit bonds and credit bonds have spread out
during the quarter, which means that we have a mark-to-market loss, these are not
realized losses. And in reality, the fact that the mark-to-market at a higher rate gives us a
higher running on these portfolios going forward. That's on the weak side.
On the positive side, we see continued strong growth in savings and insurance. We see a
satisfactory development in solvency despite a challenging quarter in the ﬁnancial
markets. We see lower operational cost and we see a lower charge to shareholders on -or estimated charge to shareholders going forward when we look at the longevity result
strengthening plans.
And that concludes my presentation. And operator, you may now open up for questions.

Questions And Answers

Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The ﬁrst question comes from Matti Ahokas from the
Danske Bank. Please go ahead, your line is now open.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes, good afternoon. It's Matti Ahokas from Danske. Two questions if I may. Firstly on the
other comprehensive income, there is a fairly sizable amount 592 million translation
diﬀerences in your ﬁgures, I guess this is due to the stronger Swedish Krone versus the
NOK. But what was the positive impact if any of the exchange rates on the solvency
margin as such. And the second question is you mentioned previously that the regulator
actually looks at the progression of the longevity reserves when they asses your capital
requirement and obviously, it seems like you are actually ahead of plan here. Does it also
mean that there would be a positive bias in terms of solvency and a potential dividend
payouts for 2015 as well.

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Well, if I start with the second question on the regulator, obviously looking at all the
diﬀerent things related to our solvency and liquidity and so on. And I'm not sure where
that we've said that they have a particular look at the longevity reserve strengthening. But
we are under reserved for longevity today and obviously the regulator wants it to be fully
reserved. So -- but we're ahead of the plan that has been put in place and we are
planning to conclude the rest of the reserve strengthening in a shareholder-friendly way
as soon as possible, and this is what we have presented in terms of cost to shareholders.
Page 5 of 13



Company Name: Storebrand ASA

And you are quite correct that the other comprehensive income is strengthened by the
strengthening of the Swedish Krone compared to the Norwegian Krone. But in terms of
the solvency eﬀect of that, I am not quite sure, but Jan Erik maybe able to answer your
question.

FINAL

A - Jan Erik Saugestad

{BIO 3103298 <GO>}

The FX eﬀect is actually quite small, because you have the strengthening of the own
(inaudible) that you've been at the Group level, you have more (inaudible)from FCR and
SPP should take up to the Group level. On the other hand, you have (inaudible) that
covers the other way around. So I think eﬀect on the eﬀects on the Group solvency
number is quietly limited.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great. If also may, if I have a follow-up. You mentioned that you've lowered your
conversion forecast regarding the paid-up policies to paid-up policies with investment
choice. What's the reason for this and what kind of changes are we talking about here?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Well, we have now talked to most of the customers that have a good value proposition
from a customer point of view in respect to making conversion from a paid-up policy to a
paid-up policy with investment choice, and about 4.5 billion of customers or funds owned
by those customers have been transferred. We don't see necessarily that -- it doesn't
make sense for everyone to convert and many people where it does make sense to
convert, have decided not to for diﬀerent reasons. So therefore, we do not expect to be
able to maintain the same level of conversions going forward.
However, we do see at the other hand, that many companies -- or not many, but many
small companies continue to look at closing the deﬁned beneﬁt plans, most of the large
one's have done so already. But when companies are closing the deﬁned beneﬁt plans, it
makes sense to give advice to customers or the employees that they do have this
opportunity to change to paid-up policy with investment choice. So partly it's a question
of who it makes sense for and the demand from the customer side. And partly it's a
consequence of a shift in our own distribution force, where we are putting more emphasis
on other parts of the product distribution within banking and insurance.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

So this is basically the 30% that you mentioned previously as a potential would be
probably lower than 30% now.

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Well, we have said all along, that we expect to do 5 billion by the end of this year, and
that's what we continue to say. At the same time, we have said that it does make sense for
up to about 30 billion of our customers, but we've never said that 30 billion of our
customers will actually make that choice.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Now the 30% was the potential of this?

FINAL

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Yes, and the potential is still there, but as I said, when people make a choice not to
convert, there is chance that they -- likely that they will revert year two compared to year
one is probably a smaller and not bigger.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great, thanks a lot.

The next question comes from Ashik Musaddi from JP Morgan. Please go ahead, your line
is now open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Hi, thank you. Just couple of questions. One, as you mentioned that you have some
potential for Solvency II improvement, understand and model, maybe get some color
about what are you talking about. You mentioned some taxing that you can beneﬁt, so
that's one thing. Secondly, can you give us some update on how much of your Solvency II
standard model includes the beneﬁt from the UFR. The reason why I'm asking this is,
because there is a news from EIOPA that they may look to review the UFR. So can you
give us some color how much percentage point come from the beneﬁt of UFR.
And thirdly, you also mentioned about the cost that there is more potential cost saving
you can do, but can we talk about like, in more speciﬁc numbers what sort of a million
Norwegian Krone you're talking about here on top of your current guidance. Thank you.

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Okay, I will answer the ﬁrst -- end up this last question ﬁrst, and then I will hand the word
over to Jan Erik, who will respond on the solvency. We have --as I said not introduced a
new cost program and we do not want to talk to the market about the particular target at
this stage. We have talked about what we have done, and we have cut cost signiﬁcantly
during the last couple of years and we are telling the market about all the diﬀerent
measures that we are doing continue to cut cost. However, we live in the dynamic world
and therefore we do not -- we would not like to present a number as such, but we would
like to be able to show you every quarter that we continued to do cost -- things on the
cost side in order to become more eﬃcient and more competitive.
At the same time, I mentioned that we are now entering into strategic partnership with a
large BPO and ITO partner and we are in the negotiations of doing so as of right now, and
the consequences of that operation will be reported when we can publish the ﬁnal
agreement. And that should happen in this quarter.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay, thank you.

FINAL

A - Jan Erik Saugestad

{BIO 3103298 <GO>}

When it comes to Solvency -- on the Solvency II improvements. As said that we have list of
diﬀerent initiatives after working with tax and the loss absorbing or reabsorbing eﬀects
from tax is modeled on, which should potentially have a good impact on the Solvency II
number. Today we are actually taking into account loss absorbing capacity of the tax. The
other thing that CEO mentioned today was that they are of course inviting our investment
set of strategy. And in Sweden, we are doing a more granular diversiﬁcation or a split of
the investments portfolio into single contracts on the guaranteed portfolios which also
gives factual. It's also potential here in (inaudible)actually modeling the TPPI strategy that
we are currently using in Norway. So there is a number of diﬀerent initiatives.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

And what sort of magnitude should we expect in terms of beneﬁt? It's like 10, 20
percentage point or like 30, 40 percentage point, and are we talking about the standard
model only or the total number?

A - Jan Erik Saugestad

{BIO 3103298 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We are talking about, CEO said in the presentation, we feel that we are conﬁdent that
guidance on 10 percentage points underlying improvement for the year. We have said,
we have done so (inaudible) and we feel conﬁdent that we will reach the last 5
percentage points in Q4.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

So -- sorry if I get it right -- so just to summarize if I get it right. So the measures you are
talking about is already included in your 10 percentage point guidance, or is it over and
above that. That's I'm a bit confused with that.

A - Jan Erik Saugestad

{BIO 3103298 <GO>}

Okay, I think it's used in 7 percentage points.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

It is already included in the 10 percentage points?

A - Jan Erik Saugestad

{BIO 3103298 <GO>}

But if I able also to ask that if you have the more work to do in 2016, and yes the answer to
that is yes. So let us ﬁrst reach the 7 percentage points and that we will continue to work
after they have reached that much (inaudible). When it comes to (inaudible) I think I have
answered that question on previous call as well. The reason why we used up is, because
there is no liquid market after 10 years. So it's kind of diﬃcult to answer what the Solvency
position would be and what kind of market to use.

Page 8 of 13



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2015-10-28

Of course we have done (inaudible) taking the ultimate forward rate down. And I can say
that it's actually a smaller eﬀect than what I think people like to think, if you go from let's
say 4.2% to 3.2%.

FINAL

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

So from 4.2 to if you go to 3.2. It's a smaller eﬀect, so kind of in low single-digit. Is it fair to
assume that?

A - Jan Erik Saugestad

{BIO 3103298 <GO>}

It's at least the single digits.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Single digits?

A - Jan Erik Saugestad

{BIO 3103298 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay, that's very clear. Thank you.

The next question comes from Blair Stewart from Bank of America. Please go ahead, your
line is now open.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yea, thank you. Good afternoon, I think I only have one last actually, your guidance on the
longevity costs provisioning. I'm assuming that if you do -- if and when you do get
transfers have to paid-up and to paid-up with the investment choice in the coming years
even if they're smaller than originally thought that would increase the longevity
provisioning cost? I just wonder, just want to clarify that please.

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

That's correct.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay, and is it fair to say that you still -- even though you've downgrade that your
expectations that you still expect to see a smaller run rate of conversions going forward
and is it possible to put any sort of number on that?

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Page 9 of 13



FINAL

Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2015-10-28

We have chosen not to put a number on that, but I guess we still have an ambition of
doing some and we will make sure that the employees when they exit the deﬁned beneﬁt
plan or they close the deﬁned beneﬁt plan are made aware of the possibility to the short
to switch to paid-up policy with investment choice. I know also that some customers are
looking for the market to fall back and maybe do a paid-up policy with investment choice
when they ﬁnd the market to be cheaper than it is today. So there is some ﬂexibility
compared to when you do the switch. So that is something that some customers are
talking about.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. And then perhaps if I can just ask one more, the Baltic's business initiative is the
primary objective there to remove essentially a ﬁxed cost from your business and turn into
a variable cost so you then be more ﬂexible as the business changes shape in future, is
that the primary goal here?

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Now the primary goal is to be able to create more customer centric and good solution, be
at faster time to market and to concentrate our management resources and other
resources on better customer solutions. We also have a clear objective to improve
eﬃciency and reduce costs. Let me give you one example. When DNB wanted to create a
mobile pay solution in the Norwegian market. They looked at this and they had like a two
year plan to do so.
Then they have a strategic cooperation with TATA group, which has already developed
this for Barclays of the UK, and they managed to create a Norwegian solution in ﬁve
months, that solution now have 700,000 or 800,000 users after only three months after it
was entered into the Norwegian. So this is an example of how the international innovation
and force of some of these large BPO and ITO players can improve our customer
orientation and commercial solutions in the Norwegian market.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay, very interesting. And do you think that's something that will have an upfront cost for
you or how should we think about it in terms of numbers?

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

You should not think about it as front cost, this strategic cooperation and a partial
ownership in our Baltic operation. And by selling something you usually do not have to
put up cash.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay, very good. Thank you.

The next question comes from Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please go ahead, your line is now
open.

FINAL

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon. Jony Urwin from UBS. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two
questions on regulation, if I may. Firstly, can you just give us any color on current
consumer protection initiatives coming out of the Swedish and the Norwegian regulators,
if any? And secondly, please could you update us on your view of the two bits of
legislation potentially coming out of the Norwegian regulator. So around the treatment of
technical provisions, so that the results of transitional application can't fall below current
minimum levels. And also, the treatment of the tax rules on the technical provisions, which
I believe has been postponed until next year. Just any additional color on that would be
much appreciated. Thank you.

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Well, when it tax rules in eﬀort to do the tax accounts that today used same as they use for
the --when you do the customer accounts and then there's been an initiative to look at
into whether you should use the Solvency way of calculating the liabilities into tax
accounts that was push back and there is -- the Government said that they will investigate
opportunities to look at this in a broader perspective over the next year.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we -- this is very early stage and we don't really have any guidance on how this will turn
out. When it comes to -- I guess that was the question on the tax rules?

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Yes, and also the Norwegian regulator's interpretation of transitional. So I remember in
August there was some national legislation that might limit the maximum beneﬁt of
transitional.

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

That's correct, and that has been taken into account in the numbers. So the way we are
doing the numbers in Solvency has been -- we've done at this way, all the way we have
done it correctly. So there is no changes to the number due to this ﬂoor on the
calculation. And on your ﬁnal question on consumer protection, I don't expect that there
are any new things coming up in the Norwegian market right now. Consumer protection
has been, is an important part of the regular legislation already. However, we have MiFID
II which is coming all over Europe in the next year or the year there after, and the impact
there is likely to be larger in Sweden than in Norway.
And we don't see that there are going to be very signiﬁcant eﬀects for our Group at this
stage, but we continue to follow the legislation regulatory developments.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Why is that likely to be more impactful in Sweden?

It has to do with how the broker market works and the amount of kick backs you can give
in the Swedish markets which are already removed from the Norwegian market.

now open.

A - Paris Hadjiantonis

Yes, good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I have two today. The
ﬁrst one on the use of the risk equalization fund for longevity reserving. I understand there
were some changes in the quarter. Can you please explain those? And then the second
one is basically on something that we saw a couple of weeks ago about potential capital
charges on municipalities' debt. Is there any aﬀect that, for Storebrand particularly, and do
you own any municipality debt? Thank you very much.

Okay. If we start with the risk equalization fund, and then I would like to go back to the
page that we showed you on page 19. It is so that the risk equalization fund is a fund that
according to the regulations or clariﬁcation from the regulator, we have to use as part of
the longevity reserve strengthening and we have used 378 million in this quarter and we
will do another 122 million in the fourth quarter for a total of 500 million for the year as a
whole. Then we have 276 million left to be used next year.
The risk utilization funds can be used to strengthen reserves for its most needed and
therefore we use it across the board for diﬀerent contracts, and it reduces the amount of
shareholders equity that we have to use for the same contracts. And therefore it, I guess
positive to the extent that you don't have to use real equity when we use to risk utilization
fund. But it's -- we have to use a part of both.

When it comes to the question on the municipalities. All across Europe, I think
municipalities is treated little bit diﬀerently in the Solvency calculations and by the
Government. In Norway it's that there is a 20% risk weight from -- on municipalities, so
they cannot really go bankrupt there, there is special law considering the wind-up or -- to
administer the economies of municipalities in cases whether that they have troubles. So,
and there is no change to that, I think in all the Nordic countries, they have treated
diﬀerently municipalities.
When it comes to -- there is also an issue of rating, because solvency require oﬃcial
ratings for municipalities. In Norway, there are few municipalities have a rating, only the

biggest one. But that said, I think in Storebrand, we have relatively small amount of
investments in the municipalities. So we are not very much aﬀected by this, kind of more
stringent regulation around municipalities in Norway.
