Bloomberg Transcript

Tom, thank you very much. We're going to kick off the conference with a fireside chat with
Pete Vogt, the CFO of AXIS. I also we want to welcome Matt Rohrmann, who head the IR
practice. So as recently as yesterday, there were stories of M&A constantly affecting this
trend in the industry. AXIS' most recent big deal was the acquisition of Novae. From the
outside, it seems like things are progressing well with the integration. I was hoping you
can give us some insight in terms of how things look on the inside.

Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Sure, thank you. First, I'd like to thank you, Meyer, for inviting us here today. Looking
forward to being here for the conference for the next two days.
Novae is doing well. We closed that on October 2 of last year. So we're 3-plus quarters
into an integration now. As we said in the Second Quarter, we've now realized about $40
million of that run rate savings target of $60 million that we're targeting on the integration.
So bringing the 2 back offices together is actually going quite well. As we sit here today,
one of our big milestones is we're submitting our plan to Lloyd's for 2019. And that 2019
plan will have all the premiums running through our Syndicate 1686. So we'll actually be
able to have Syndicate 2007, which is the old time Novae syndicate. This area can actually
go into run off for the three years that we count. So that will be a big milestone for us. The
first big milestone was actually getting everything under one managing agency. And
Lloyd's has been fantastic to work with. We were able actually to get that accomplished
going into 2018. So we closed on the second. But by the end of '18 -- or by the end of '17,
Lloyd's worked with us to get someone who'll manage the agency. So we're feeling very
really, really, really quite good about that. We have already announced as we go into '19,
we will be actually moving into The Scalpel. That is right across the street from Lloyd's.
And that will be a big event for us because we'll be able to get everybody into one place.
Today, we're currently in 3 different locations in London. And I think if we can get
everybody into one place, we'll really be able to get the teams harmonized. In the
meantime, we actually have done a lot of moving. And we've got all the underwriting
Page 1 of 14

teams that underwrite the same risk together. So we've moved people from our
Fenchurch office to their Lombard office and vice versa to get all the underwriting teams
together. So going quite well.

FINAL

Questions And Answers
Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Yes, excellent. One of the elements. And you mentioned this a little bit, are the expense
savings, both those associated with Novae itself and sort of general expense optimization
initiatives. Can we translate that into a targeted expense ratio? Or can you give us some
thoughts about how to think about that in the context of a ratio?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Right. We've talked about that. We're looking at, in total, $100 million off of our 2017 run
rate by the time we get to 2020 rough run rate. And $60 million of that is going to come
from Novae and another $40 million through other initiatives that we've now launched in
the company. That $40 million, by the way, because I get this question all the time, is the
net of other reinvestment, not gross. So that is a net number based upon we expect to
still be investing in data and analytics and other, in short, tech-type things that we need to
get going in our business. What I would say is I -- when we look at it, I have guided to say,
let's bring our expense ratio down to the low 14s. When you look at it now, you get out to
2020, we should be able to get into the high 13s. And so we're looking at that aspect of
our return and trying to really crunch that expense ratio down. Working, though, further,
that's going to be up to other things that we can determine to run more efficiently as an
organization.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Right. But this gets up to 2020?

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

This gets us to only 2020, yes.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. On the subject of M&A, before Novae was acquired, you actually bought a company
called AVIABEL.

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

I suspect it was overlooked because Novae was a larger acquisition. Can you talk a little
bit about what AVIABEL brought to AXIS?

FINAL

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes. The other reason it may have been overlooked is it was really quite small. AVIABEL
was a Belgian company located in Brussels. Very small, only $50 million of gross written
premium but all in the aviation sector. It was attractive to us, one, because it was small and
very digestible. It also gave us a presence on the continent. So that was actually quite
good. But also, it actually allowed us to take our aviation book and diversify. So our
aviation book grew up in London, very much an airline-focused aviation book. It has some
aviation (inaudible) in the portfolio there. And AVIABEL has a pretty much a general
aviation book. So we put the 2 books together. It gave us a much larger aviation portfolio.
But a more diversified aviation portfolio. So that actually went really quite well. And it was
very interesting because it was really a one-product-line-type acquisition.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Yes, fantastic. Of course, we do want to encourage as much as participation from the
around the room as possible. So if you've got a question, just let me know. Otherwise, I
will keep soldiering on. I have one more M&A question and then we'll get to other topics.
How should we think about AXIS and M&A in coming years? It seems like Novae is mostly
digested. There's certainly heightened elements of M&A out there whether they're actual
announced deals, deals that are speculated, deals that are rejected. What should we think
about -- how should we think about AXIS in that context?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes. When we look at AXIS, we want to make sure that we're relevant in the -- in our
chosen market, in the markets that we want to play. And we look at the insurance side.
And there's 3 markets that we really want to make sure we're relevant, the most relevant
with our distribution partners. And that's in the U.S. in the property casualty E&S space,
that's in the global professional line space. And then that's in London. And one of the
things we had when we looked at that is we're already top 10 in E&S in the U.S. We're a
top 10 pro lines. But we were nowhere near top 10 when it came to our presence in
London. And the purchase of Novae takes us now to a #8 syndicate and, even with the
syndicate plus the paper that we have there for our branch, really makes us a presence in
London. So we feel that in those areas, we're already top 10. We don't need an
acquisition to continue to go where we want to go and evolve our strategies. If Lloyd's
shows up, that would be fantastic. And we'll always looks at what comes across. But we
don't need an acquisition there. So we're not out looking for something. We are always
looking for talent. We're looking for new products and new niches. But we're not
necessarily needing an acquisition in those spaces. Then on the reinsurance side, we're
about #14 reinsurer. So when you exclude, I'll call it, the top 5 big ones, I'd put us, I'd call it,
in that range of second tier top 10, that second tier of reinsurers. And again there, we're
looking at -- we do not need an acquisition to go where we want to go. I think that we can
grow in the lines we want to grow in, maybe add some talent here and there. But an
acquisition is not required. So that's why I would say globally on our -- top-down. The other
is, while we are doing well with the Novae acquisition, there still is a lot of work to do. I
think getting through 2019 and making sure everything's vetted down correctly, especially
in the back office, would be prudent for us before we even think about doing something
anyway.

FINAL

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, fantastic. Let's all get to current operations now. And I think another top-of-mind
topic among a lot of investors is loss cost inflation and loss trend. There's sort of a
disagreement among different executives over the course of Second Quarter earnings in
terms whether they're seeing signs of even normalizing loss trend versus below historical
averages. And Albert himself, Albert Benchimol, CEO of AXIS, had talked about seeing
sometimes real inflation. Can you give us a little bit more detail of what you're seeing on
that front?

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. I suppose on the liability side, we model and we take not only our own information
but a lot of industry information. We start thinking about loss cost, especially on the liability
side. The hard part there is to think about social inflation and what's going on there. And
we got out model that kind of track what we think that is. But we also look at what's
happening in the industry. We also acknowledge and realize that over the last, I think, call
it, 7, 10 years, inflation, probably if you look over 50 years, has been lower in that period.
So you really need to take a long-term view to what you think inflation could be on a goforward basis when you're thinking about pricing as well as reserving.
The other thing that Albert very much -- and talking to our underwriters, we have a great
underwriter who leads our U.S. E&S AXIS casualty area. And he'll tell you that one of the
things that's very interesting in that AXIS world is things are considered AXIS when it's got
$1 million attachment point. And when you talk to Mike, who's been in the business for 25
years, he had a $1 million attachment point back in 1990. So he's like, "It should be going
up." And so one of our other worries is just when you think about where you want to play
in AXIS. That $1 million attachment point three years ago really got hit. Now maybe it
should be a $2 million attachment point because that $1 million is starting to become a
working layer in some places. And again. So we're looking at, as we look at casualty,
where do we want to play? Where do we want to be on the AXIS layers so that we can
actually make the best returns? And I think that's some of the issues that we look at. So
it's not only what we think the inflation is, it's what has that inflation done to how you
structure your product and where you want to play on our program.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. And so there -- it sounds like there is an underlying shift in terms of attachment
points. Is that real or theoretical at this point?

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

The hard part is, the market doesn't want to move, right. So you have to deal with, one,
where you want to play; and two, how do you might be able to write enough business but
handle that. And so our guys will look at -- they'll write a $1 million attachment point if they
like the risk and they really like it, or they may write it and actually do a (FAC) between $1
million and $2 million and actually lay it off to a FAC market because we'll just say, you
know what's that? We just think that's too low of a limit for us. So what it's done is we had
to evolve the underwriting process to be a little bit more complex than maybe it was back
30 years ago, which is a good thing.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Right. It provides, a, the opportunity for stabilization and distinctive performance. So you
mentioned what the market will or will not allow. And obviously, that's a perennial hot
topic.

FINAL

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Where is the market now in terms of pricing? Our superficial assumption, is it a -- it varies
by line of business based on profitability? But I hope you can give us a little bit more
detail. And also, to the extent you can talk about terms and conditions in the other
aspects of underwriting, have (you seen it) go up?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes. So through Second Quarter, we continued to see pricing positive, we'll talk about the
insurance side first. But obviously a slowdown from what we've seen. Coming right out of
the Third Quarter of '17, we saw a good increase in pricing on our property lines,
especially in the E&S and global property. And we saw that continue through the First
Quarter. That slowed down in the Second Quarter. Again, that isn't -- we were hoping to
actually see that continue. But we've still got double-digit rate increases on our property
lines in the U.S. E&S as well as our global property in the Second Quarter. It's just not as
good as we've seen in the First Quarter. So there's positive momentum there. But it
seems to be waning. It was positive at the beginning. It's still slow. We're still trying to push
rate in our property lines. We do think that property lines had gotten rate decreases in the
last number of years and that it was time to actually get some more rates. So we continue
to try to push rate in the property area and, again, on the insurance side. On our pro line
side, we had been having rate decreases the last number of years. And that turned into
positive rate, slight positive. We're talking very low single digits but positive nonetheless.
And so that was a good indication. And we continued to see that in the Second Quarter.
So that was, I'll call it, just a straight flat increase that's happening through the year. But
that was good for the pro lines area where we've seen negatives over the last number of
years. And so we're feeling pretty good about what we saw there.
As we go into next year, who knows what we'll see. I still think we need to get more rate
on the property side. I think we need more rate in London. I think you've seen sort of what
Lloyd's just said to all its syndicates, that there's a fair amount of pricing pressure now that
needs to come across in London to get be to adequate returns for everybody who is
writing specialty there. And so we will continue to push rate there.
On the reinsurance side, we came out. We thought January 1 was disappointing. But
everybody had very high expectations. We had hoped that we would continue to see just
the momentum go there in a building. And so we got some rate increases on January 1.
But then we got to the middle of the year. As we talked about, June 1 and July 1 renewals,
we didn't see the pricing that we hoped for. And in the legacy AXIS book, we were
actually down on our cat premium year-over-year because we weren't seeing the pricing
Page 5 of 14



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2018-09-05

that we wanted to see there. Coming up to January 1, we'll see what happen again this
year in terms of pricing.

FINAL

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Right, yes. And I guess there's 2 ways or 2 aspects to that. There's the contribution to
pricing from whatever loss trends we have this year. And the negative contribution to
pricing from the continued inflow of third-party capital.

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes. So I mean, that's the best part, what you see on the reinsurance side now. I mean, I
think third-party capital is here to stay. I think at AXIS, we recognize that. We have a thirdparty capital area where we look to partner with third-party capital and use our
underwriting and our expertise in underwriting and our expertise in distribution to help
provide risk to third-party capital that they deem acceptable to them. We do like that
model. We think it leverages our capabilities on the underwriting and distribution side to
actually be able to put that third-party capital to work. To keep all the interests aligned,
there's 2 things we do: We tend to do all those deals on a quarter share basis so that
whatever we're underwriting and coming up on a price with, our third-party capital
partners know that we're keeping a piece of that risk, too. So our interests are all aligned.
The second thing it gives us then is some solid fee income because the third-party capital
partners we have will give us a fee to actually do the underwriting and do the processing
and be that front door in the market for them. So when we look at it holistically for AXIS, it
actually works really quite well. But I do think that as an industry, we have to acknowledge
that, that third-party capital is here to stay. And we have to figure out how we use that
effectively and how we bring the value that we bring to the market and get paid for that
value. And that value for us is being those expert underwriters. Third-party capital's
capital, it still needs an underwriter in the middle to help set that price, help set those
terms and conditions as well as handle all the claims on the back end. So that underwriting
expertise and that claim expertise, if we can put it to bear in the market and be agnostic
to capital, whether it's our balance sheet or our insurance guys use reinsurance to actually
help them get into a market or we use third-party capital. We need to be using the best
capital to provide the best product to our clients.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. So let me take that concept and go one step further. A lot of the Bermuda-based
insurance/reinsurance models initially since, I guess, post 9/11 predicated on property
casualty.

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}
Page 6 of 14



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2018-09-05

Yes.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

FINAL

That expected contributions to income is, I think, permanently -- based on the way you've
described third-party capital, is permanently lower than it had been in the past.

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

So how should we think about the future of reinsurance as a contributor to really building
value?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

I think when you look at building value, one, you got to look at the ROEs you're going to
get. So what's the returns you're going to get. And if you can actually get a good return
for your shareholders because you are writing some risk. But you're also getting some
fees for actually helping that third-party capital partners apply that risk, I think that is a way
that you can look at it and get an appropriate ROE for your shareholders. So it's a
combination of doing the 2. And that's why if you just ignore third-party capital, I think it
would be hard because you're just going to be playing in a diminishing pool. But if you
actually work the system and say, okay, what's our value in the value chain. And then how
do we work with our distribution partners and our third-party capital partners that actually
have the funnel that brings in the business and then apply that business to the right
capital, you can be get appropriate return for your shareholders. The other side is you
look at it holistically. What we've done at AXIS over the last number of years is we have
actually evolved out of just being that original cat reinsurer in Bermuda. We have a very
large insurance operation, which is very diversified, that has close to almost $4 billion in
premiums. So we're not wholly dependent upon just, I'll call it, reinsurance cat anymore.
And even on the reinsurance side, we've grown our books. And in motor, we're quite big.
And we've gotten into the mortgage business, which we're growing. And the agriculture
business. So I think part of it is that's your starting point. But now you have to evolve your
business. In 2011, at this point now 16 years ago, I think at AXIS we've evolved our
business. And we're continuing to evolve it to get positive streams of income from various
sources.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Perfect. That's helpful. And again, if people have questions, just signal in some sort of way.
I don't want to overlook anything.
I want to talk a little bit about Lloyd's. On the one hand, we do seem to be seeing some
signs of top-down (importance). Maybe that's the wrong word. It's a little harsh. So
basically top-down insistence on adequate returns. On the other hand, things have gotten
pretty tight in Lloyd's. So perhaps you can argue that, that oversight was inadequate.

Page 7 of 14

What do you see happening? And how does the oversight -- how does the (franchise)
board actually impact operations?

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes. It'll be interesting to see. When I heard what Lloyd's was doing and they came out
publicly with what they say they were doing, it was very interesting to us because over the
last number of years, what they were saying and telling people to do is what we've been
doing on our businesses. So we've been ranking our businesses and saying, okay, where
do we have a fundamental competitive advantage? And where are we profitable? And
how do we grow those lines of business? In the bottom quartile, you've got businesses
where maybe you don't have a competitive advantage and you're not profitable. The
question is, how do you remediate those businesses or fundamentally get out of them?
And if we look at AXIS over the last number of years, we've got now some pretty big
businesses. We exited Australia, where we're trying to grow the D&O business there on a
retail basis. But when we looked at it, we said, we really don't have a competitive
advantage. And it's not making money for us. So that doesn't make it -- that's not a good
use of capital to sit there. And since then, we've also done that with the U.S. retail
property casualty business. We've also done that with some of our Lloyd's businesses
when we think about Onshore Energy that we got out of just most recently. And RMP
Property in the U.S. So that idea of actually taking a hard look at your portfolio -- I believe
Lloyd's came out with what they call the whale chart. They kind of went up, then they
came back down again where they said, let's take all the lines of business that are making
money and you can go all the way up. And you say, okay, that's your -- your apex is the
most amount of money we could have made as Lloyd's in total. Then here's all these
businesses that are losing money and starts bringing it down. And you'll get the back end
of that hump. There's a lot of businesses there. You've got to ask yourself, why is a
syndicate in it? Are you just there as capacity. So therefore, you're not bringing any value?
So therefore, if you're losing money in it, why are you doing it? So I think Lloyd's coming
down. They were doing and told the market to do what we at AXIS have been doing for
years. So it wasn't new to us. What will be interesting will be see -- as you mentioned,
Meyer, how does a regulator now enforce that? Now Lloyd's is different because you have
to get your plans approved through the SBF process. So we'll see, as syndicates go
through that this fall, exactly how harsh Lloyd's is. They're coming back and holding
people to their plans and adjusting their plans based upon what they've seen profitability
be. But I do think embracing that and getting people to understand where do you actually
have an advantage or not. And if you don't, why are you in a business? And I think we've
seen a lot of syndicates even this year exit lines of businesses where they were small,
probably not making money. You don't know. But they've exited lines. And if they've
exited, they've probably made the same conclusion that we probably aren't making
money in it. And we don't see reasons to stay in that particular line of business.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. So is it fair to say that you're expecting a more positive marketplace in Lloyd's, let's
say, in 2019 versus '18? Is it too early to say that?

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Page 8 of 14

FINAL

I think it's too early to say that. I'd say as we're looking at our plans, we're definitely
looking at focusing more on those lines of business where we have an advantage, where
we believe that having a leadership in a line of business, you can drive better rate and you
can drive better terms and conditions. So as we look at our plans, that's where our guys
are focusing on, where we can actually influence changes for the positive.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, fantastic. An AXIS-specific question that I want to focus on because I thought it was
an interesting perspective is the stated desire to reduce your reliance on the top 3
brokers. I was hoping you'd talk about that. What's -- first of all, what's -- what drove that
decision making process? And how is it progressing in terms of actual implementation?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes, I think this is a deep question. We'll think about it on, again, an insurance versus
reinsurance side. On the reinsurance side, you've really got the top 3 brokers. And we
work very closely with them. I think the differentiating factor in the reinsurance world is not
only working well with your top 3 brokers. But can you deliver to your clients better? So in
the reinsurance side, I think we focused more on working with our brokers as well as
getting closer and understanding our clients' needs better. And so that touch point of the
clients and understanding them, which the brokers are 100% supportive of. But
understanding your reinsurance clients. Then on the insurance side, we were very much
through the big 3 brokers. I think when we look at now, especially in the U.S., when you
think wholesale distribution, it's not the top 3 brokers. So now we've diversified quite a lot
now. And we're looking at really good relationships with a lot of the wholesalers there.
And so you've got top 3 or 4 wholesalers we have great relationships with. And that does
allow us to diversify our distribution a bit. Then Lloyd's, obviously, in London, everything
goes through the brokers that are there. So we actually feel good about being able to
diversify. A lot of it had to do with where our value proposition was. And I think on the P&C
side, when we think of retail going through the brokers, we didn't have what I would call a
competitive advantage against the Travelers and the CNAs and the -- on the retail side.
But on the wholesale side, the way we can respond quickly, the way we can handle difficult
risks and where we have expert underwriting, that works really well with our wholesalers
and our partners in Amwins and Bb&T and whatnot. Very, very solid relationships with
them. So that allows us to see bigger breadth of market, really what we do well to the
distributor, where on the retail side, that expert underwriting, if they're standard risks, you
initially shine there, right, when you're looking at that.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

So I would argue -- oops, sorry, yes, go ahead.

Q - Unidentified Participant
(inaudible) if you have a (inaudible) of the program (inaudible)?

Q - Unidentified Participant
So what (inaudible)? Can you determine (inaudible) of your distribution strategy
(inaudible)? And does that (inaudible)?

FINAL

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

So the smaller risk side? Yes. What we had to do is in the U.S. especially, we've put in a
new system called (duck creek) in the back end that allowed us to actually move very
quickly. So all the products that are on there now that we should be done with over 3.5
years to a 5-year implementation allows us to do everything paperless and respond to
quotes in less than an hour, sometimes 20 minutes. So especially now in the small case,
what we've done is revamp the process where it's very much -- even less of an
underwriting where we've got underwriting assistants actually doing the underwriting and
turning it around in 20 minutes. So we've got a screen that'll say that's a complex risk. So
this way to an underwriter or this way to just a UA. And they can turn it around really
quickly. And if somebody wants to bind it with the new system, we can bind it and send
the PDF out in a day. So we've been able to actually build the back office there. And
(Sarah) shows up to get into that market. Typically, what we see in that market, we found it
actually can be more profitable. It's not a big business for us yet. It's a business that we do
want to grow. We see a lot of it more in the professional lines side. And it's our AXIS pro
operation out in Kansas City. And they do a really good job. And that's a little bit different.
You got to get know the brokers well on our underwriting side, explain the product to
them. Then it really comes into a central area. And then we turn the underwriting around
very quickly.

Q - Unidentified Participant
I have a question on the (inaudible) side. (inaudible) out there. (inaudible)? Or (inaudible) a
big factor (inaudible) out there and (inaudible)?

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Right now it's interesting. One, I don't like to talk about other people's M&A because
you'll never know. But Aspen had a process. They follow their process. And now it seems
like it's going through and see what -- so we'll have to wait and see what happens. But I'll
leave it up to the Aspen people. But they ran their process. I think the other thing that is
interesting, though, is there are a lot of -- there is a lot of -- there's a lot of assets in
Lloyd's that are actually for sale. You mentioned Chaucer. There's a couple of other
syndicates out there for sale, too. It'd be interesting to see how that goes and what
happens there because depending upon people's future -- thinking about the future of
Lloyd's, we'll get a view on how profitable big people think. The future of Lloyd's could be
based upon what we see some of this asset sell for.
Okay.

FINAL

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes. We just started -- it's on the reinsurance side. We just started that about three years
ago now. So it's not a big part of our business yet. We actually brought in some folks, built
our own models. We've got good relationship with some distributors. We're finding it's
good business. It's good, solid business. It grows very slowly. But we do find it attractive. I
think the pricing in that area is still solid. We can get a good ROE on that business today.
The issue will be on the go forward basis, I think, (Arch) has made it a very attractive
business to get into. The more people get into it, the more we may see margins thin. And
so that will be a year-by-year look at that business.
Yes.

Q - Unidentified Participant
(inaudible) payment on the new lines (inaudible) talking about (inaudible)? And the other
thing, too, is I'm saying (inaudible) the gaps (inaudible) never (inaudible). So maybe talk
about (inaudible).

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

You think about -- even in the past, even on the property side, you had to start to model
demand surge post cats. And I think that's what this is. And I think when you think about
social inflation. And one of our guys look at social inflation, you need to consider a variety
of factors. So me too -- you may not be able to say that specific to me too. But you need
to think about it when you're thinking about that social inflation factor on the liability side.
But it's not only me too, it's just where do we see court cases going, where do we see -we got jury awards. But then, in the long run, a lot of those come down. You get the big
headline. But then you don't know what the final award is and it's a lot less. So there's a lot
of analysis that goes through that. And I think you just have to watch. And you got to look
for actual, what is actually happening rather than speculative.
Yes.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

One point you mentioned in business, going back to that (inaudible), it's I guess, been a
little -- it felt like there was something there. But in terms of diversifying distribution, you
talked about building relationships with the wholesale distribution channel, which itself has
gone through a period of (inaudible) and consolidation, maybe not last year but preceding
years. That -- does that pose a similar sort of oligopolistic model to what we're seeing in
reinsurance? Does wholesale look like reinsurance?

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Wholesale has got -- I think part of it is the value that they bring to their brokers. And you
do have, on the wholesale side, the top number of wholesalers are really quite big. And
they are getting there. And maybe we will end up with the top, we'll call it, 4 or 5 or
Page 11 of 14

maybe even 3. But I think the key there is to make sure that you continue to bring value
through the distribution chain. So as we get to know those distributors today, we are
going to be going through brokers to clients. We're never looking to go direct. So we'll
deal with distribution as it is. But the more distributors that we have relationships with, the
more access to clients we get. So we will work with the big wholesalers. But to the extent
there's other wholesalers or regional or local, especially as we look, I'll call it, the smaller
market businesses, we might find ourselves doing more business with more wholesalers
but on a regional basis. So we'll always look for that. But we have really good relationship
right now with the top 3 there. We do look to do things that actually help them and help
us bring expenses down through the movement of data back and forth. And so as we
cement those relationships, we hope to actually be able to use that to our advantage and
their advantage. They'll have lower expenses. We'll get a greater look at more business.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Is there a trend of new wholesale brokers being formed? I don't think there is. Now
correct me if I'm wrong.

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

I haven't...

Q - Meyer Shields

Bloomberg Transcript

(inaudible).

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes, I haven't seen more being formed.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

So the (inaudible) players, are you establishing more relationships with people that are
out there?

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes. Yes.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, fantastic. And again, if there are questions, please just let me know. Please tweet
your question.
And this is a little simplistic. But we've put out a chart a couple of months ago just tracking
the number of publicly traded Bermuda insurers/reinsurers. Started off obviously very
small. Before 2001, I think it was what, probably 4 or 5 of them. Got close to or above 20
at one point in time. And particularly given the (Excel) acquisition, the (inaudible)
acquisition, (inaudible), there are fewer and fewer of these companies out there. What
does Bermuda look like? What's the future of Bermuda as an operating hub?

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes. First I'd say at AXIS, we are committed to Bermuda. That's where our holding is. I do
get that question. Are we looking to move off the island? We're not looking to move off
the island. We're committed to Bermuda. We have a good relationship with the BMA. And
we do like the -- we do like it down there. And one of the interesting things to think about
is as a lot of our competitors, I would use the word are no longer public versus got taken
out or the phrase because a lot of the companies are still there in Bermuda. They're just -they've just been accumulated under a bigger umbrella. So somebody like an Endurance
still has a big presence on the island. But they're part of something else. So they're not
publicly traded anymore. You're not following them anymore. However, they're still there
and they still have a presence on the island. They're still active on the island. They still
have a good step on the island. Actually, it's bigger than it was when they got bought by
Sompo. So we really do like the island. We do think it's a good hub for us right now,
especially given where we want to grow. I think that we're definitely committed to the
island. The expertise that's there, some of these consolidations have lent itself, thus
being able to pick up talent where we can actually use some talent. But other than that, I
think still Bermuda and the BMA is a good place for us to be on a go-forward basis.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Has the competitive environment changed at all in the wake of some of these, I
guess, takeovers where (BNC) still exists? It's just under different ownership?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes. We've seen pockets of people wanting to grow. And you'll get an initial growth surge.
But at the end of the day, everybody wants a return on their capital, right. And everybody
wants a decent return on their capital. So it's interesting we hear competition is tough and
it's a hard market. I mean, it's a soft market.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

It's difficult.

A - Peter John Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes. A difficult market. But that's -- I think that's going to be the go forward. I do think that
where we are today, the big cycles where you can just turn around to be able to get all
the pricing that you need, that has gone away. So we need to be smarter, we need to get
better at assessing our risk, we need to be able to pick our pockets and write profitable
business and appropriate ROE in the markets that we're in today in the current
competitive environment we are today. And I do think that even folks who've now -they're now called private but are still there, they've got new owners who want a return
also. So I do think that the competition is going to be there forever, the competitive
landscape. And I don't think being private actually reduce those hurdle rates too much.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Right, yes. Okay. Then I just wanted to do a quick surveys if there's any final questions.
And if not, please join me in thanking Pete for a very helpful presentation.
