Hello. Good morning and thank you, Andrew. Indeed, before moving to Q&A session,
let's take you through an overview of the main ﬁgures for the three months' period.
We have continued to see growth across all business lines, with total revenues up 2% on a
comparable basis and 10% on a reported basis to €31.5 billion. The higher level of
reported numbers is coming from the strengthening of all major currency versus the euro.
It's interesting to note that our businesses in the U.S., in Switzerland, in Hong Kong
represent circa 30% of the group revenues. The reported growth in the quarter illustrates
the beneﬁts of the geographical diversiﬁcation of the group.
On Life & Savings, gross momentum continued with a 4% APE growth and the strong
increase in net inﬂows at €3.1 billion...

Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

€3.9 billion.

Bloomberg Transcript

Gérald Harlin
€3.9 billion versus €1.8 billion in the ﬁrst quarter last year. The headwind from the
continued Group Life business mix repositioning strategy in Switzerland was more than
compensated by the strong performance in other geographies. As you would remember,
we started repositioning our Group Life business mix towards more proﬁtable semiautonomous schemes in Switzerland in 2014, and we continue to implement this strategy
this year. So there is, of course, a negative impact on APE this quarter. I would like to
remind you that full protection schemes in Switzerland are mostly renewed at the start of
the year.
Elsewhere, there was good growth in Protection & Health coming from Southeast Asia,
India and China region. Good performance in Unit-Linked, primarily due to the continued
success of our hybrid products in Continental Europe and an increase in client appetite
for Unit-Linked products following the improvement in equity markets. In General
Account Savings, sales went down, in line with the strategic focus on Protection & Health
and Unit-Linked products.
Also, there was an increase in Mutual funds & other line, mainly following an exceptional
sale of a large contract in France. The NBV margin remained healthy at 33%. The key
impacts were less favorable business mix and the negative impact of lower interest rates
on U.S. VA GMxB products, partly oﬀset by a positive impact from an improved country
mix and lower unit costs.
Life & Savings net ﬂows for the quarter were at €3.9 billion. We saw strong inﬂows in
Protection & Health and Unit-Linked business and outﬂows in General Account Savings in
line with our strategy.
P&C revenues. Now, P&C revenue growth gained momentum compared to last year and
recorded a plus 2% growth. The increase was mainly driven by the price increases in

FINAL

mature markets where we continue to maintain our leadership positions, as well as strong
recovery in Mexico and Turkey
We saw growth in both Personal and Commercial lines. Asset Management business had
strong net inﬂows at €19 billion with €14 billion net inﬂows at AXA IM and €5 billion at AB.
Along with the net inﬂows, positive forex impact and market appreciation also contributed
to the increase in assets under management, which drove the 7% revenue increase versus
the ﬁrst quarter last year. I would like to remind you that it was a 10th consecutive
successive quarter of positive inﬂows in our Asset Management business.
Our economic solvency ratio is estimated at 190% at the end of the ﬁrst quarter. The 11point decrease versus the year-end was mostly due to a spike in the spot level of implied
interest rate volatility, which has an impact of minus 9 points. The ratio was also impacted
by a lower level of interest rates and, of course, positively by operating return.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you would know, the implied volatility level has come down recently from its unusually
high level at the end of the quarter. And this reduction would be expected to have a
signiﬁcant positive impact on our economic solvency ratio compared to the level at the
end of the quarter. In other words, a combination of increased rates and reduced interest
rates volatility since the end of Q1 would mean we wouldn't be far from 2014 level, in the
present 2014 economic solvency level today. So, our economic solvency ratio remains
resilient, and I would say at a comfortable level even in the context of the exceptional
market conditions we saw at the end of March.
I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that we plan to share with you our
capital management framework at the beginning of December this year. We aﬃxed the
date for the 3rd of December, and the presentation will be held in the afternoon at our
London oﬃce.
So, I propose you to move to Q&A now.

Q&A
Operator
We have our ﬁrst question from Peter Eliot, Berenberg. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Two quick questions, please. First of all, on the repositioning that's
ongoing in Switzerland, I wonder if you could comment on how long we should expect
that trend to continue for, how much more there is to go in that repositioning.
And then, secondly, you showed very strong growth in Protection & Health in China. I was
wondering if you could comment on the outlook there and how sustainable that was.
Thank you very much.

FINAL

Okay. So, as far as Switzerland is concerned, it will be spread over some time. We cannot
say we started last year. That's the second year in a row. Let's say that it will last us some
time and some more years, maybe a couple of years, something like this.
So that means that as you know, our strategy now is we still are selling some full
protection but we are reducing this full protection. We still have some net inﬂows on the
existing contracts in full protection, but we are much more focusing on the semiautonomous contracts.
So yes, to answer your question, it will still last some time and it's something which is
progressive. As I told you many times, it's extremely positive in term of proﬁtability and in
term of return on capital.
On your second question as far as China is concerned, yes, we beneﬁted from a strong
increase in China. Taking China, the total EP is €35 million for the ﬁrst quarter which is a
signiﬁcant growth of 160%. In term of proﬁtability, it's mostly protection. In fact, it's
savings with protection and the proﬁtability, that 13%, that means the NBV margin is at
13%.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you.

Operator
We have a next question from Jon Hocking, Morgan Stanley. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Morning, everybody. I've got three questions, please. I just wondered, Gérald, whether
you could comment on how sustainable the ﬂows are in your mature Asset Management
businesses because we've seen a big uptick, particularly the €8 billion in recent quarter,
just wondering if you could comment on that.
Secondly, in France as well in the Life & Savings business, the net ﬂows number was pretty
strong in Q1. I think you mentioned the one-oﬀ but it does sound like it was in the Mutual
Fund business rather than the Life business. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit
about the products which are driving that.
And then ﬁnally, just if you can give an update on where you are with your Solvency II
discussions with the regulator. Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. So, many questions. Sorry, I go back to the previous question. It was €68 million.
What I mentioned was the improvement but it's in China, it's €68 million of EP. Sorry for
this.

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

And it was up €35 million.

A - Gérald Harlin

FINAL

And up €35 million. Exactly, up €35 million. Sorry for the confusion.
So, as far – your question is on the net inﬂows in France. And we could say that uniquely,
as far as France as a whole has a present net inﬂow of €1.1 billion, of which we have UnitLinked representing €0.5 billion. So, you can see that our strategy is still good. That
means that we are still increasing in Unit-Linked. What we sell in France is mostly hybrid
products and now, as a percentage of savings in Unit-Linked is roughly 42%, whereas the
rest of the market is at 22% to 23%. So, we are still ahead of the market, and our strategy
is doing quite well. As far as G/A Savings, we are negative in G/A Savings in France by
minus 0.2%.
So, pretty in line with what we told you in the previous meetings and it's going quite well.
And you can imagine that the perspective of the relatively low interest rates going forward
and this combined with an outlook on the equity market, which is better, helps us in order
to improve our mix.
The last part of your question, I believe, was about the discussion with the regulator.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Yeah and also the Asset Management ﬂows.

A - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Asset Management ﬂows.

A - Gérald Harlin
Asset Management ﬂows. Asset Management ﬂows, it's – so we are improving our net
inﬂows. Our net inﬂows, I would say, boasts a signiﬁcant part, as far as AXA IM is
concerned, it is in Asia. It's €8 billion in Asia, and then it's in Europe and also in the U.S.
We have close to €1 billion net inﬂows coming from the U.S. from our short-duration, highyield product mostly.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

So, is there anything which is obviously sort of lumpy or one-oﬀ nature? This is obviously a
big step-up but, presumably, we shouldn't be annualizing those sort of numbers for the
rest of the year.

A - Gérald Harlin
It's always extremely diﬃcult at the beginning of the year and after three months to give
you an outlook on what could be the rest of the year. But what I can tell you is that,
Page 5 of 21



Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity
Date: 2015-05-07

looking at the ﬁgures from April, I don't see any kind of one-oﬀ in the ﬁrst three months'
ﬁgures.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

FINAL

In the €8 billion you mentioned that Asia but, again, there's not a particularly lumpy
nature to that, but fairly broadly based.

A - Gérald Harlin
I would say that it's – no, it's – of course, there are much more ﬂuctuation and we can
expect to have more ﬂuctuation going forward, but I would not qualify these amounts as
one-oﬀs.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And just following on the Solvency II question?

A - Gérald Harlin
Yeah, the Solvency II question. I could say that, as you know, we will apply for our internal
models at the end of the present month. So far so good, I would say. So we won't have
any – we are expecting to have the ﬁnal framework at the end of November. And that's
why we will present you the whole target capital scheme and with the details of the
Solvency II internal models at the beginning of December. But I could say so far, so good.

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

We have our next question from Nick Holmes, Société Générale. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Hello. Hi there. Good morning, Gérald. Three quick questions.

A - Gérald Harlin
Good morning.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

First one is could you give us an idea of which countries contributed most of the volatility
hit? First question.
Second question is on direct selling. I noticed your P&C direct slowed a bit to 4% growth.
Could you elaborate a little bit on that and comment on your expectation for the future?

Page 6 of 21



Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity
Date: 2015-05-07

And then ﬁnally, just in the U.S., wondered if you could update us on the GMxB hedge
program. How did that fare in Q1? Are you expecting anything material in the way of
losses in IFRS earnings? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. What I could say, Nick, about the volatility. As you know, the volatility, I don't
believe that the key element or the key criteria is in which country. The point is that, as you
know, the volatility is a part of the embedded options just like NAV. And indeed, the
volatility was roughly, on average, at 40% at the end of December 2014. At the end of
March, it went as high as 100%. And now we are back these days. That means yesterday
we were back slightly above 50%. That gives you a good outlook.
And that's why I mentioned in my introduction that, more or less, it's most – I said that the
volatility and the move from 40% to 100% explained – and this, combined with the interest
rates move because interest rates went down between the end of December and the end
of March, this explains roughly minus 9 points for volatility and interest rates. It should be
minus – it should be, more or less, in line without the sensitivity that we shared with you in
December.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the meantime, that means between the 31st of March and now, things have changed
because interest rates went up by 50 bps, ﬁrst; and second, because the volatility went
down sharply. And that's why I'm quite relaxed to tell you that if we would do the same
calculation today, we wouldn't be far from the 201% that we published at the end of
December.
Your second – yeah, go ahead.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Sorry, Gérald. No. Thank you very much for that. I mean, that's very clear and I fully
understand that. I just wondered if it's correct that it's countries like Germany and
Switzerland where most of the sensitivity lies.

A - Gérald Harlin
No. It's not in Switzerland, so that's quite obvious. And in Germany, if you – that's – in
Germany, not so much. Why? Because ﬁrst of all, in Germany, like in other countries, we
don't have any speciﬁc ALM mismatch. That means that if you refer to the fact that in
Germany, there are guarantee, great. In Germany, we have a good coverage. That means
that we have a mismatch between assets and liabilities, which is more or less one year.
So, I don't have any speciﬁc fear relative to our German business. It's throughout the
business and we are consistent through all our businesses with the General Account. We
have a one year, half year duration mismatch. So that's Europe. So that's why we'll not
make a speciﬁc focus in it's coming from such and such countries.

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity
Date: 2015-05-07

Okay. Understood. Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. Your question is about Direct.

FINAL

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Gérald Harlin
I would say that the competitive position, we have – the Direct business went slightly
down in France because we had 1% growth in the ﬁrst quarter in Direct in France because
there was some competitions, especially coming from mutuals and from the banking
trends. That's what I can tell you and that explains the fact that we are at 4%. But our
business is doing extremely well in other countries. In Asia, for example, it's doing well in
Japan, in Korea. And it's improving also in Spain. Also in Spain, it's not at the level we
could expect but it's improving.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Okay. Very good.

A - Gérald Harlin

Bloomberg Transcript

There's still question...

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Gérald Harlin
Go ahead. Go ahead, Nick.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

No, no, no. Sorry, I was just saying, yes, on the last question on the U.S. GMxB.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. On your last question relative to the U.S. GMxB, I could say that the present
environment is quite good. That means that we have been – you know that the most
important driver of our business in the U.S. is the level of equity markets. And it's good
because we are not very far from 2,100 on the S&P 500.
The second is the volatility and the realized volatility, and we shouldn't make any
confusion between realized and implied. The realized volatility has been half year 13%, so
that's good. So, I would say that what happened in 2014, more or less, it's not very
diﬀerent. It's not very diﬀerent for the start of the year.

FINAL

We have the next question from Paul De'Ath, RBC. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Paul C. De'Ath
Hi there. Good morning. A couple of questions, if I can, on kind of products and stuﬀ like
that. So, the hybrid products that you've been in serving in France have obviously been
going well. I believe you're also selling hybrids into Germany and Italy. I just wondered if
there's any kind of signiﬁcant diﬀerence between – per the shape of those products in the
diﬀerent markets. I think you said in France around 43% is unit-linked and the rest is
savings. Do you have a higher savings down in Germany, for example, in order to get the
business sold? And some color on that would be great.
And then the second point was just on the P&C side and just whether or not you could
give any comment on the performance of Tian Ping during the quarter because, obviously
that's not included within the numbers. That would be great. Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. So I could say that as far as the ﬁrst part of your question is concerned and about
the hybrid products, yes, more or less, I would say that the hybrid products are more or
less the same, but it depends on the market. I would say that by far, it's in France that we
sell the most hybrid products, the most important number and volume of hybrid
products.
In Italy, for example, what we have been doing in Italy is that we have been selling more
unit-linked products at, for example, in MPS. So it's not hybrid products, but it was directly
unit-linked products.
The example in Germany, yes, in Germany, we are growing pure unit-linked quite
signiﬁcantly. And so, it depends on the countries, but the logic is always the same. The
logic is always to sell more unit-linked products and that's what we do.
And to give you an example, in Germany, we have been – although we have an EP which
is, as a whole, at plus 2%, we have our unit-linked in Germany which is at plus 56%. So, we
are starting from a level which is not very high. Because in the end, it's an increase of €10
million in APE, but that's quite signiﬁcant.
In other countries like in Belgium, we didn't hesitate, and that's the reason why we have a
negative APE move in Belgium. It's because we decided to stop the traditional G/A
products. So always in the same strategy and depending on the countries, it could be
pure unit-linked or hybrid products.

We have the next question from Niccolo Dalla Palma, Exane BNP Paribas. Sir, please go
ahead.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning and, ﬁrst of all, let me say congratulations for the new hire on the IR
team. And moving on to the questions, I'd be curious, on the Solvency II side, to hear your
views on two topics. First, the fact that EIOPA now clearly indicate that sovereign risk
should be charged for in internal models. What is your interpretation of their statement
exactly?
And secondly, the now very clear positioning of the Dutch regulator regarding their
comments on the UFR and the fact that they should not be used when setting dividend
policies. What do you think the stands will be of other key regulators in Europe on this
topic? Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. As far as your ﬁrst question is concerned, I believe and many times I mentioned in
this call that using internal models, we are post income capital in front of sovereign risk.
And so, that's it. I don't believe that there will be any questions around this, which is not
the case for the second topic.

Page 10 of 21



FINAL

Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity
Date: 2015-05-07

I would say that UFR is part of the – it's in the framework. It's in the logic of Solvency II. You
know that UFR concerns very long business, businesses between 20 years and up to 80,
90 years. And maybe there could be an individual position from the Dutch regulator. As
you know, you are not – we have no business in the Netherlands, but I don't expect UFR –
to change the concept of UFR is very important. And I'm personally, extremely surprised
to see that at the time where some countries are thinking about using transitional
measures and so on and so forth, at the same time, it would be a nonsense to push
companies to use transitional and to withdraw the UFR. It would be a nonsense. And I
believe that it's a position which is common to most of the companies in Europe these
days.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

Operator
We have our next question from Michael Huttner, JPMorgan. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Fantastic. Thank you. Just two questions. On the volatility, what index did you use? You
cited a ﬁgure above 50% or so. I couldn't recognize that. I saw a ﬁgure of 46%. I'd be
interested what index (27:57).
And then, the question Nick Holmes asked, and forgive me because I haven't been
following AXA very long and it is very complex group. But if the total volatility impact is
minus 9% and you say Europe is actually very small because there's only one year
duration gap and the U.S., of course, doesn't enter into the equation. Where is the
impact? I don't understand. Maybe I'm completely out. These would be my two questions.
Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. The point on the implied value, it's because we are dealing with its – you should not
miss the fact that there is the eﬀect of the volatility adjuster and the ﬁgures that I'm
quoting are net ﬁgures, so after all these adjustments. And that's the reason why you
don't ﬁnd exactly your – and there is also the liquidity premium impact. So, that's, today,
the liquidity premium to be clear. We are using the liquidity premium and not exactly the
volatility adjuster, and that explains why we have such an adjustment.
And your second question was?

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Well, you replied to Nick Holmes' question saying, the 9%, which is a big move for the
volatility change, didn't come mainly from Europe. It obviously didn't come from the U.S.
because that's a completely diﬀerent solvency system. So, where did it come from? I'm
puzzled. Actually, I'm confused.

FINAL

No, no, no. I said it was coming from – I'm sorry. Maybe I've not been clear, but it's mostly
coming from Europe. You are absolutely clear. You are absolutely right saying that it's not
coming from the U.S. because we are using equivalence. It's not coming from Asia
because, as you know, in Asia, it's mostly Unit-Linked business. So, it's coming from
Europe. I'm very sorry if I've not been clear.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay. And in Europe, you said not Switzerland, and the other countries, all of them?

A - Gérald Harlin
No. I didn't say it's not Switzerland, but I said that, in Switzerland, we have mostly – a
signiﬁcant part of our business is Protection. So, I said that, on a relative basis, Switzerland
was not so high. That's what I wanted to precise.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. And if I can jump in, Michael, as well just to clarify on the volatility. We can send it to
you, but you can ﬁnd it on Bloomberg by looking, for example, at the swaption 1010 at the
ticker – like, we can e-mail you the ticker or anybody who wants the ticker.
When you do that, that's where you will see roughly equivalent to the 40% that Gérald
spoke about earlier, the 100% at the end of the quarter and 50% as of yesterday. You'd be
able to read those numbers pretty much directly, but it's a mixture of maturities. But we'll
send you the tickers that we're looking at and so you'd be able to see those numbers
directly.

A - Gérald Harlin
And in the calculations, there is the adjustment that I mentioned to you.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Yeah. Very clear. So, just to understand this 9% move, it is mainly from Europe. It is linked
to the one-year duration gap, and the one-year duration gap is roughly across all
geographies the same?

A - Gérald Harlin
Right.

A - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. I was interested in the revenue growth in
the U.S. business. On a comparable basis, obviously, it's just 2%. And I got the impression
that your kind of growth outlook there was looking a lot better in terms of actual top line,
not just margin. I was wondering if you could give me some more guidance on when you
think your actual overall top line growth is going to start to be more positive there given
that a lot of other companies seem to be having some good opportunities in certain
products where there's been a lot of consolidation. That's question one.
And secondly, going back to some of the questions on net inﬂows, obviously, you had a
big one-oﬀ in the Life & Savings business in mutual funds. But even if you strip that out,
you're roughly €3.5 billion of net inﬂows, and that's sort of materially higher number than
you've been experiencing. So I was wondering whether we could see this kind of level
going forward or is that seasonality. Just for the sake of forecasting, what would you
recommend I do my model? Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. Maybe I can start with the latter part of your question, Farooq. I would say that you
cannot consider – ﬁrst of all, you cannot consider the French product as a one-oﬀ because
it's part of our business and it's in line with our strategy consisting in avoiding, taking risk.
And that's the reason why when you have a kind of back-to-back type of agreement, we
have a margin fee and we have a fee corresponding to the service we provide. We start
taking (33:23).
What I can tell you relative to the – to your much broader question relative to the net
inﬂow, I would say that, for net inﬂows, you have the gross inﬂows and you have the
surrender and lapses, outﬂows. And more or less, outﬂows didn't move signiﬁcantly. So
Page 13 of 21

what does it mean? It means that the inﬂows are directly linked to our top line business.
So, I cannot give you any outlook for the rest of the year, but it's important for you to
understand that it's not coming, for example, from a decline in the surrenders which
could be temporary, okay?

Okay.

A - Gérald Harlin
The ﬁrst question was? I'm sorry, Farooq. I missed the ﬁrst question.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Yeah. So, in the U.S., I've kind of been waiting for better growth. I mean, I know the
margin has been good and that's been very – give you some change and adapt it to the
new environment. But the growth – top-line growth just seems to be lagging some other
companies that we look at. And I'm just wondering when you're going to be – or if you're
going to be a little bit more proactive in the U.S. market?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gérald Harlin
No. That means that in the U.S. sale, we had – we experienced an increase in sales in Life
which is good. And because we launched a new product, and this was partly oﬀset by
slightly lower sales on our annuity business and it was mostly explained. And this drop in
the annuity business mostly explained by the decrease in sales in Retirement Cornerstone
because we will refresh our products quite soon and we can expect to recover. That's
what I can tell you.

We have a last question from Lance Burbidge, Autonomous. Sir, Please go ahead.

Q - Lance M. Burbidge

{BIO 3978332 <GO>}

Good morning. Yeah. Just a couple of quick questions. Firstly, you said, Gérald, several
times about the ALM matching, particularly in Germany, I'm interested because EIOPA in
its study says that on average it's about a 10-year mismatch. So I wonder how your
business is quite so diﬀerent from the average.
And then on the VNB margin, perhaps you could give some idea as to how much the
impact of interest rates falling in the ﬁrst quarter might have on business in Germany and
Italy.

FINAL

A - Gérald Harlin
First question on the German business, I don't believe that we could say that there is – that
the market is a 10-year ALM mismatch. I believe that it's exaggerated. And I can comment
only on my own business. What I can tell you is that we have been always consistent in
matching assets with liabilities. The problem, where is it coming from? It's coming from
the fact that a lot of business, as you know, and you can have a look at the – all the
disclosure that we made at the end of 2014, and you can see that, on average, on top of
my head, we have a guarantee of 3.4% in Germany on the Inforce book of business.
And for sure, at some time, companies stopped hedging considering that tomorrow will
be better and that they will catch up higher rates. And we never did it. So that's the main
diﬀerence. That's quite simple. That means that we have been consistent always hedging
our existing risks. I cannot be more clear. So, it doesn't mean that we have a great margin
in Germany. But the risk is quite remote. On top of this, I remind you that our German
business is relatively small.
I just want to remind you that, as a whole, (37:42) contribution of Germany was €130
million last year for Life excluding Health to be compared with €5 billion and €60 million
of underlying earnings for the group. So, ﬁrst it's relatively small; and second, we have
been quite consistent. That's what I can say. And we don't intend to change this strategy.

And, Lance, did you have a second question as well?

Q - Lance M. Burbidge

{BIO 3978332 <GO>}

I would guess it was just if you had some idea as to what the falling interest rates that we
saw in the ﬁrst quarter might have done to the German margin. I'm sorry to persist on
Germany, but your margin is very high there at 42%. I just wondered what it might be if
we restated it.

A - Gérald Harlin
Yes. First of all, we don't update the rates at the end of interim indicators. So, that means
that we – except for some speciﬁc business which is the VA business, because the VA
business is hedged on a dynamic basis. So that's what I can say.
But for the rest, you have the sensitivity and the best for you is to go back to the sensitivity
of our EV presentation. And there you will have the sensitivity of the NBV country by
country. And we can comment it oﬄine with you. But, ﬁrst, the sensitivity of NBV – we can
anyway. It will be – well, I propose you to take it oﬄine and to go with you – and the IR
team will go with you through the NBV presentation.

Q - Lance M. Burbidge

Q - Blair T. Stewart

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Good morning, Blair.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Two questions, if I may. Firstly, could you perhaps update us given where interest rate
covers have gone on the new money rates that you're able to invest and invest at at the
moment, please?
And, secondly, I wonder if you could comment on some of the proposals at the European
level to make it perhaps easier for insurance companies to invest in infrastructure assets
and structured credit as well. Is that something that is likely to lead that change in your
asset allocation over time? Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. Blair. First of all, you remember that, at the end of December, it was – no, it was
based on the end of December, but it was on the 25th of February, I shared with you a few
ﬁgures about the investment level, plans for 2015 up to – you remember that we said 2%
on average. And 2% on average, what I can tell you is that we are at 2%. We stick to this
2% for the ﬁrst three months.

FINAL

Can I – I would say that, on a marginal basis, a few weeks ago, at the end of December, I
would have told you that the investment would have been more at 1.8% for the future
assuming the level but with the recent rise of 50 bps, I believe that the 2% is still relevant,
and the 2% is mixed and for the euro is roughly 1.5%. So, as of today's condition, I'm
comfortable with the 1.5%.

A - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

For Europe and the two overall.

A - Gérald Harlin
The second question is on infrastructure. As you know, we are investing in infrastructure
and mostly in infrastructure debt. And at the end of last year, we had a level of a bit less
than €2 billion. We committed to invest €10 billion over ﬁve years. That's something that
we will do and we are working hard, and we have a team at AXA IM which is dedicated to
this business. Yes, we are quite active, and we are – like some of our peers, we are quite
active saying that, if we want the Juncker Plan of €315 billion to come alive, it's quite
important to invest in infrastructure. And we were speaking about ALM matching, and
infrastructure is a good instrument in order to achieve ALM matching.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, yes, as far as we are concerned, we are using internal models. So that means that, of
course, anything that could help the global industry would be good. As far as we are
concerned, we are using already the internal model. So that means that, for us,
infrastructure is a good use – a good investment already.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. I guess €10 billion for a company or a balance sheet of your size is still quite
modest, Gérald. I just wonder if there's upside to that number.

A - Gérald Harlin
Yes. Of course, there will be, but it depends. Look at the Juncker Plan, €315 billion, and it's
in the end of the European Investment Bank and nothing complete emerged yet. So, of
course, if it's in force, you can imagine that we'll be the ﬁrst one to be interested in it, and
we do everything we can.
You remember that last time I told you that we've been diversifying ourselves in less liquid
assets including loans, including mortgages, infrastructure, ABS. So, we are applying the
plan we shared with you a couple of months ago. So, that's it. And if we can do more, of
course, we will do more in infrastructure. You can imagine because the spreads are quite
nice.
And I summarized this diversiﬁcation saying that we were ready to sell and to – we were
ready to give up on liquidity but that we wouldn't give up on the quality of assets. And
this is part of this plan. And the much we can do in infrastructure, the best.

FINAL

We have a last question from Farooq Hanif, Citigroup. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks for taking my question again. Just wanted to ask if we exclude the U.S.
business, where obviously you have dynamic hedging, do you normally increase interest
rate hedging when vol goes up and interest rates go down? So, are you following a clever
dynamic process also in your European business?

A - Gérald Harlin
We have a small – we have a very small – you mean in term of VAs?

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

No. I mean – not the VAs. So, the rest of your business, do you – I mean, is there an
argument to say that (46:16) generally has increased its interest rate hedging in Q1? And
what's your own experience not including VAs?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gérald Harlin
No. We don't in itself, we don't hedge the volatility because, as you know, it's something
relatively expensive and we can consider that the present period that we live is a bit
extraordinary.
What we do is that we have, of course, the fact that we have some embedded options in
our General Account products makes that we have some options and that we are naturally
– for example, many times I explained that we are protecting ourselves against rise of the
interest rates, buying swaptions, when you have – we are long swaptions, and in itself,
being long swaptions means that you are long volatility.
So, that's it, but it's not in order in itself to hedge. I want to be clear. It's not in order to
hedge the volatility impact on the solvency ratio, but it's just to manage the risk, and it's
good risk management to protect ourselves against moves like the rise of interest rates. I
hope I'm clear.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

My question was more, did you change your hedging or increased hedging in Q1?

A - Gérald Harlin
Yeah. We didn't change the hedging in Q1. We keep exactly the same stance, and we
keep the same philosophy. And of course, these days, we are also taking the opportunity
of the low interest rates in order to slightly increase – to increase our hedges.

Page 18 of 21

In case rates would go up, but we don't have any speciﬁc program, and it's for us, it's
business as usual. It's another way to explain it. I didn't take in the ﬁrst quarter any speciﬁc
hedge in order to have a direct impact, if you want, on the solvency level.

We have a last question from Michael Huttner, JPMorgan. Sir, please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thank you. Thanks very much for this opportunity. (48:49) and the ﬁrst question is I spoke
with Unica yesterday. They actually report both the standard and the internal model, and
the point they made is that reporting both allows more comparability between companies
and I just wondered what your view is on that.
And the other is there seems to be almost like competition between insurers.
Competition is always healthy, but it's – it kind of produces interesting eﬀects. Zurich,
Allianz, AXA today and yesterday published their solvency updates. How do you see that?
I mean, is there – what is the outcome of all this? Are you married to a ﬁgure of 200% or
do you think 150% is ﬁne? I mean, just stepping back a little bit. Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. On the – no, we are using internal model. To answer your ﬁrst question, we are
using internal model and we'll always report on internal models. And the way we –
excluding the U.S., which was the question, we are using internal models. So we are not
using the standard formula, if it was your question. And we don't intend to do so. And all
the work we have been doing over the last years, we see French Supervisory is – as I told
you, we are in the last phase of getting our models approved. So we are using internal
models and we'll go on using internal models.
And as you may know, there is absolutely no recommendation or any kind of obligation to
report on a standard formula because it's – again, it would be contrary to the global

Page 19 of 21



Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity

framework and to the spirit of Solvency II because that standard formula, the internal
model are here in order to get a good – better matching between assets and liabilities.

FINAL

Your last question was about Solvency II. I'm not sure. Clearly, what was the – I'm sorry but,
Michael, but could you repeat your last question?

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Yes. Zurich, you and Allianz in the past two days, you reported your solvency numbers.
And clearly, there's competition between you guys in reporting this number. So, I
understand how you look at this kind of metric. What is actually your target, what do you
think is the right number?

A - Gérald Harlin

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's be clear. And I want to be clear, there is no competition. The ﬁgures that we publish
is the right ﬁgure. There is no competition. That means that we have a model that we
explained to you many times, I believe, in detail. And we will be even much more clear
and vocal at the beginning of December. And we have a model which is based on, I
would say, a consistent limitation of the mismatch, and that's the reason why.
I believe I gave you – I believe most of you were expecting that due to the rise in volatility,
due to the drop of interest rates, there would be a drop, and I've been quite clear telling
you that under today's condition, we would be back not very far from the 201% that we
had at the end of last year. So, it's not a problem from competition. What I can tell you is
that I consider that we have a solid balance sheet, that we have a solvency which is good,
and which has proven in this extreme market condition to be extremely resilient.
