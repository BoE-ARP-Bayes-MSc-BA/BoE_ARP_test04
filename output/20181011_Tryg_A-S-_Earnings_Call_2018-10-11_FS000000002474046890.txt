MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. This is Gianandrea Roberti. I'm Head of Investor Relations,
Tryg. We publish our Q3 results later on today. And I have here with me Morten Hübbe,
Group CEO and Christian Baltzer, Group CFO, to discuss the ﬁgures. Over to you Morten.

Morten Hübbe
Thank you, Gian, and we begin on slide 3 with a technical result of DKK 761 million which
is slightly below third quarter last year, but clearly impacted by an increase of DKK 173
million in large claims. We show a slightly lower investment income versus last year but
still satisfactory and above a normal quarter. Equities are positive while, of course, ﬁxed
income, of subdued returns. We see a good progress continuing in the underlying claims
ratio with some 50 basis point improvement both on Private and on the Group level.
Expense ratio 13.9, in line with our ambition to keep our expense ratio at or below 14% for
2020. Dividends per share of DKK 1.65 as in previous quarters. Solvency ratio of 291, bear
in mind, we still expect a solvency ratio of approximately 170 when Alka is fully
consolidated.

FINAL

On slide 4, we elaborate on customer highlights. TNPS continues to improve in this
quarter, particularly positive to see that Private Norway has a strong improvement.
Amongst others, we see an improved access time for customers and also improved
feedback to customers lifting the TNPS and also lifting retention rates. Very positive to see
retention rates improve across all areas. For the whole Group, retention was 88.9% for the
quarter compared to 87.8% year-on-year.
Private Denmark actually had the highest level of retention for the last nine years. And
after a decline in retention in Private Norway in 2017, we've now seen improved retention
rates also in Private Norway in all quarters so far this year. Also in Commercial lines, both
Denmark and Norway show increased retention rates.
The awareness of the Trygheds bonus continues to increase, both for customers and noncustomers, positive that for customers we see an increase to 74%, also an increase for
non-customers but still only at a level of around 22%, oﬀering lots of potential to further
improve in the future.
On slide 5, we show a slightly lower technical results for Q3, as mentioned, clearly driven
by the increase of DKK 173 million in large claims, but also as Christian will elaborate on,
an increase in run-oﬀ gains.

Bloomberg Transcript

We see broadly stable across the segments. Clearly, Corporate is the area hit by high
amounts of large claims, partly oﬀset by higher run-oﬀs. We continue to have a very high
focus on pushing the prices of, particularly Corporate Norway, upwards. That has been
successful in 2018 and we will continue to do so in 2019.
On slide 6, we show our dividend per share of DKK 1.65 for the quarter, bringing us up to
nine months' dividend of DKK 4.95. We aim at continuing to increase the annual dividend
on a nominal basis. Clearly, the combination of high and stable returns and rather limited
growth means that increased capital consumption is quite limited. So, we've been able to
focus on returning cash to shareholders for a long period and that focus will continue in
the future.
On slide 7, we've shown a new slide, elaborating a bit on the four strategic initiatives
presented at the Capital Markets Day on November 17. You can see more elaborate notes
on those issues in the report. But just a few highlights on claims, we see that in connection
with agricultural ﬁres this summer, our work with ﬁre tracers and ﬁre extinguishers have
reduced the claims by approximately DKK 10 million. We see an increase in the number of
fraud detected by around 25%.
In product, we see an improved trend that we put prevention into our products. We've
seen in the last couple of years an increase of around 30% in house claims related to rats,
and now we include a rat blocker into our products. No one likes to talk about rats but
they can actually take out 90% of the risk and more than 30% of our customers now
accept this solution.

FINAL

On digital, full throttle, clearly, log-ins to our digital universe has increased 40% year-onyear. We launched a new tracker to reduce number of non-value-adding calls and already
more than 100,000 customers have used that, and claims reported online have now
increased to 33%. And then we elaborate ﬁnally on a couple of distribution eﬃciency
measures to improve margins and ﬁnance a number of our investments in digital.
On Slide 8, we've taken a snapshot of Alka's Q3 report. Alka continues to produce a
strong ﬁnancial performance with nine months technical result of DKK 276 million and a
combined ratio of 83.7% despite a 3 percentage points lower runoﬀ.
Tryg has mentioned on September 25 that we've submitted nonstructural remedies
expected to resolve authority concerns in the approval process and that the process is
expected to be ﬁnalized by the end of 2018. And for your information, structural remedies
would for example include divestments, which is not the case.

Bloomberg Transcript

The solvency ratio is expected to be, as I mentioned, around 170% when Alka is
consolidated. And just to put the nine months results into perspective, you may recall that
we communicated an assumption of annual run rate for technical results in Alka of around
DKK 300 million and synergies in 2021 of around DKK 300 million. And then you may
recall we enhanced our 2020 technical result target from DKK 2.8 billion to DKK 3.3
billion.
All of those targets, including the timing is unchanged. But if we compare to the assumed
run rate of DKK 300 million for a full year, of course, DKK 276 million technical result for
Alka in the ﬁrst nine months is very comforting, but we have not changed our
assumptions.
If we move on to slide 10, we show a premium growth of 4.7%. Bear in mind that that is
helped by portfolio acquisitions. And excluding those, we see a premium growth of 3%
organically. Private lines, a growth of 5.3%, particularly improvement now in the
Norwegian part of Private and a continued positive trend in Denmark.
Commercial now also improving, we clearly see retention increasing and also price
adjustments helping the equation. Corporate Norway, particularly a good acceptance of
the price increase is carried out. So far this year, we've carried out price increases of
around 7% in Corporate Norway and we actually expect and even slightly higher price
hikes at the renewal, 1st of January 2019, in Norway to improve proﬁtability. And then we
mentioned that Tryg Garanti has been growing nicely at a combined ratio well below the
Group combined ratio.
On slide 11, we show as always, average price changes. Average prices are up in all
products and segments. We are pushing through across the board price increases of
around 3%, expecting inﬂation in claims of around 2%, 2.5%. In Norway, bear in mind that
the regulation of one very large and very proﬁtable partner agreement weighs on the
overall pricing picture.

And then ﬁnally on slide 12, we show a very positive trend in retention rates continuing to
improve, develop positively across all business areas. As I mentioned, highest level in
nine years in Private Denmark and now positively also increase in Private Norway, and you
can see a positive trend across Commercial Denmark and Norway as well.

FINAL

And over to you, Christian.

Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Thank you, Morten. Good morning, everyone. So, on page 14, we're giving some
highlights on the underlying claims ratio and it has been improving 50 basis points for
Private and for the Group, in line with our recent trends. We expect the pace of the
improvement to remain broadly around these levels. Of course, Private seeing more
stable quarter-on-quarter development and whereas we have seen some ﬂuctuation on
the Group quarter-by-quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Private continues to develop satisfactory while pressure remains, as Morten has been
mentioning, on the Corporate segment, where prices increases has been carried out and
will be carried out going forward. As Morten mentioned, we've been pushing through 7%
increases year-to-date on Corporate and actually getting good results on that. There's no
doubt that the stability of our underlying performance is important for us and we are very
satisﬁed to see the progress on this.
Turning to page 15 which is an update on our motor story in Denmark here speciﬁcally
where we kind of update some of the trends that we see. And one of the new ones we
have here is kind of showing that the number of vehicles on our roads are increasing and
the overall number of accidents also is showing an upward trajectory. Now, the tech part
of the claims mix is still increasing and we do see that, for example, here shown as
headlights, the technology that you put into these headlights actually are increasing our
overall cost of replacing them. These are, as Morten mentioned, being pushed through as
price increases also in this book.
Turning to page 16, we're giving a short update on our Norwegian motor book following
the Analyst Day in June and our previous communication. We expect price increases
around 5% whereas we kind of expect claims inﬂation of 4%, mostly driven by the higher
repair cost. On the upper right graphics, you can see that Tryg over the last six months
has been carrying out price increases. This is published statistic from FNO where you can
see two of our other peers, one actually also carrying out these price increases, and
another one not really getting the traction on price increases. So, very pleased to be
among those that are carrying out price increases to have a sustained underlying
performance of our book.
Turning to page 17, as Morten mentioned, this has been a quarter with a higher level of
large claims than what we've seen previously. Our overall large claim and weather claims
expectation are unchanged. but there is no doubt when we look at the ﬁrst three months
of these ﬁrst three quarters of 2018, both on weather and on large claims, we're seeing a
more normal level than what we previously have seen the last two years. Run-oﬀ, relatively

Page 4 of 22

Date: 2018-10-11

high in this quarter and nine months, 7.4%, is a reﬂection of our robust reserve position
and a capacity to absorb external shocks.

FINAL

Turning to page 18, as Morten mentioned, our expense ratio of 13.9% is in line with our
target of around 14% by 2020. We do see a slight increase in the number of employees.
Some of this is due to insourcing in our IT and also our portfolio acquisitions.
Turning to page 20, we're giving a snapshot of our investment split which is broadly
unchanged and also unchanged mix in our free portfolio.
On page 21, dive into the investment return. We see the free portfolio is reporting DKK 101
million return, driven by 3.5% return on equities, while overall ﬁxed income return was
negative. The match portfolio development positively is impacted particularly by the
regulatory deviation and this is driven predominantly by the yield between the Danish
and European swap rates narrowing.

Bloomberg Transcript

Other ﬁnancial incomes and expenses is at DKK 47 million and slightly better compared
to the recent guidance of above 60 DKK million quarterly expenses. Some volatility do
remain on this line. Total investment return of DKK 79 million is lower than third quarter
2017, but is satisfying compared to our overall expectation of a normal quarter in Tryg.
On page 22, a little highlight on our solvency position. The solvency ratio for third quarter
is 291, or 207 adjusting for the Alka capital raise. Tryg continue to expect a solvency ratio
of approximately 170 when the transaction is closed. Our funds move is predominantly
driven by the result and our dividend payout, and our SCR shows a very limited change
compared to the second quarter 2018.
Turning to page 23, on our capital and solvency ratio development, the Tier 1 issued
during the spring has utilized the remaining capacity as explained in our second quarter
call. The Danish FSA, as we have mentioned before, has explained that a solvency ratio
lower than 125 would result in an increased surveillance. Solvency ratio development
remains primarily a function of net proﬁts and the dividends, so we expect the underlying
development to be somewhat stable.
On page 24, we have an update on our solvency ratio sensitivity and there is no overall
change to the sensitivities pictures on this slide.
So back to you, Morten.

Morten Hübbe
Thank you, Christian. And just ﬁnally on slide 25, we reiterate our ﬁnancial targets.
Technical results target of DKK 3.3 billion in 2020 including Alka, combined ratio at or
below 86, expense ratio 14 and ROE post- tax at or above 21%. We should point your
attention to a slightly higher tax rate due to additions to the tax bill for 2017. And then as
previously communicated, we expect as part of the Alka closing to book a one-oﬀ charge
Page 5 of 22

of DKK 200 million in Q4, but that has previously been communicated, so really nothing
new there.
And then we just ﬁnish oﬀ with our old friend, John D. Rockefeller, on page 26.

FINAL

And with that, we're ready to take your questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. And our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Ida Gjøsund from Carnegie
Bank. Please go ahead, Ida. Your line is open.

Q - Ida Melvold Gjøsund

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you and good morning. A few questions from me, please. Firstly on premium
growth, you reported solid growth of 3% when excluding portfolio acquisitions. How do
you expect organic growth to develop going forward? Also, can you give us an update on
the competitive environment in both Denmark and Norway? Then on claims inﬂation in
motor in Norway, on slide 16, you write 4%. Just to clarify, is this related to average repair
cost alone? And if yes, what's the number on frequency?
And then last, on your Norwegian combined ratio, I understand there is a single large
claim impacting your numbers this quarter? Could you quantify the impact and perhaps
also what type of claims is this? Thank you.

A - Morten Hübbe
Good morning, Ida. Well, regarding your ﬁrst question, clearly 3% organically is slightly
higher than expected. We continue to have an unchanged outlook of 0% to 2% growth. I
guess the picture we're seeing is quite clear that our Private lines is improving with a very
positive trend that is continuing and that will pull up our group growth. I think that dark
horse is really what's the Corporate response to price changes will be. And we are
working with the assumption that we will see some negative topline reaction to Corporate
price increases particularly in Norway. But so far, the market has been quite willing to
accept price increases of 7%.
And that takes us really to your second question regarding or the question regarding
competitive environment. I think we're seeing in Denmark a quite stable development.
We have, of course, some tailwinds from the bonus program which is expected to
continue for the coming years. But broadly, we see the competitive landscape in Denmark
being quite stable. I think we'll see more change in the Norwegian competitive landscape
both with a number of smaller players struggling, also a corporate player struggling.
And I guess generally, you can see from the FNO statistics that pricing is unsustainably
low on Corporate Norway for the past three years. We've increased prices by 7% this year.

Page 6 of 22



Company Name: Tryg A/S

Date: 2018-10-11

We're increasing them even more 1st of January 2019. And generally, we see the
Corporate Norwegian market all increasing prices and it's quite clear from the data that
the whole market needs to increase prices. So all in all, I would say an improved
competitive landscape in Norway and an unchanged, quite stable landscape in Denmark.

FINAL

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Ida, you had two other questions, so on page 16 where we're showing the 4% repair cost
development, I think you can look at it in a way that the 3% is an inﬂation expectation from
comparable claims that you also see in the graph in the lower right corner where you can
see that trails around the 3% which is repair cost. The 1% that we put in in technology kind
of bucket would be a mix of both some frequency but also some of the technology
development. So the 4% is of course an expectation of the future and is the background
of where we're pushing through those 5% of increases.
Now this is an area that we monitor every single month. And if we don't see that we're
pushing through enough price increases, adjustment will be made to that. But we believe
that currently the 5% increase is something that will give us a good tailwind going into
2019.

Bloomberg Transcript

And on your question regarding the single claim that we're writing in the report of DKK
130 million net, you have to bear – this is a property ﬁre claim actually outside of Norway
from one of our customers in Norway that we have taken the exposure with them outside
of Norway. This is a claim that is DKK 100 million net and then the reinstatement premium
that we are paying in our reinsurance program to kind of top oﬀ the coverage is around
DKK 30 million. So the net impact for Tryg is DKK 130 million.

Q - Ida Melvold Gjøsund
Okay. Perfect. Just to clarify, so you haven't seen any picking up in claims inﬂation in
motor in Norway?

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

I think we've seen some – historically, we have seen someone taking kind of a toll of that
and pushing through price increases. Our expectation into 2018 has been of somewhat
stable, a little upward – kind of frequency increase. So, not something dramatic. I think
some of the dramatic frequency trend we saw was actually in 2016-2017 in Denmark, and
we are also seeing that frequency to somewhat tailor oﬀ and ﬂattening. Yeah.

A - Morten Hübbe
I guess it's fair to say that the trends have been slightly moving in diﬀerent patterns in
Denmark and Norway because the trend of higher repair cost inﬂation in Norway has
been there for a number of years now, and it's not a new trend. The trend of higher
frequency has really been a challenge in Denmark and we're seeing some early signs of
that in Norway as well. But it's the thing we've been monitoring in Denmark now for the
past couple of years, and we're sure to compare notes across the countries to capture
both the repair cost inﬂation and the frequency trends.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Asbjørn Mørk from Danske Bank.
Please go ahead. Your line is now open for your question.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Yes. Good morning from my side. A couple of questions as well, ﬁrst, on your underlying
improvement of the 50 basis points, if you could just elaborate a bit on how that looks in
Denmark and Norway basically the (23:22) split on country? That would be my ﬁrst
question. Thanks.

A - Morten Hübbe

Bloomberg Transcript

So, good morning, Asbjørn. I don't think we actually guide on the diﬀerent development
between Denmark and Norway. I think we have the luxury of having three countries where
we can take advantage of diﬀerent environment and actually have a combined more
robust portfolio because we have kind of some good legs both in Denmark, Norway, and
of course not as strong in Sweden. So I think you just should focus on the overall kind of
group development on the Private side and then we'll be managing, making sure that our
underlying performance kind of continues to improve.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Okay. Fair enough. Then if I may go to large claims. So, besides the DKK 130 million from
Norway, I guess there's a couple of larger claims in Denmark as well. So, just one question
being if – as I understand, this is not correlated with the weather in the quarter. Could you
just conﬁrm that? And then if I look at your ceded business, basically your reinsurance
result for Q3, it's much better than in previous quarters. Is that driven by these large
claims on the reinsurance that you have received from there?

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

So, you're right that the ceded is driven by the large claims and especially the DKK 130
million net claim has a bad impact. I think whether in some of these ﬁre claims that we are
seeing on large claim is driven by the drought that we had during Q3 is more speculation
than necessarily is a trend that we have seen. So, whether or not there is a one-to-one
correlation with the weather we have seen or with the large claims, it's really hard for us to
kind of get that gauge. I think one of the things we did see, and as Morten mentioned,
was that in our agricultural business we're actually done quite a lot of work on doing
these ﬁre tracing to kind of reduce the number of ﬁres that we see in our agricultural area
and thereby actually reduce what could have been much more damaging impact on our
portfolio had we not done this prevention.

A - Morten Hübbe

FINAL

Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity

I guess it helps the equation, Asbjørn, when you talk about weather versus large claims
that our – we're slightly below market share exposure to the agriculture in Denmark and
we are signiﬁcantly below our market share on agricultural exposure in Norway, and that
clearly helps our equation relative to others. But it's quite clear that when you look at
larger claims that in general comes from Corporate, it just highlights even more our work
– that Corporate lines across the board needs higher prices, worst in (25:59) Norway but
not only in Norway, and that's why we are working very determinedly to ﬁnd the right and
best path of ensuring our longer term improvement of returns in the Corporate segment.
And a big part of that is making sure you get high enough prices to pay for the large
claim risk. And a quarter like Q3 is a quarter that reminds everyone of that.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
And now that you've seen the large claims pick up a couple of quarters in a row and of
course this quarter in particular, is there any risk on your reinsurance costs going forward?
Should we expect a rise here?

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think that coming out of two quarters – or two years with very low level of both large
losses and weather claims has deﬁnitely been a help with our general kind of discussion
with the reinsurers. Whether we'll see signiﬁcant increases on our per risk, I don't expect
so. We still have kind of okay weather coverage and weather results on a net basis, so I
don't expect large movement in that area. But of course, the reinsurers will try to use the
argument that once we have large claims, prices need to go up and we kind of try to look
at a more longer history of claims.

A - Morten Hübbe
In addition to that, I guess, Asbjørn, that the general reinsurance market is still inﬂuenced
by higher capacity than demand which puts a cap on price development.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Okay. Fair enough. Then on the ﬁre risks, if you leave aside the agricultural business which
you were also out commenting a week ago, and look at the general ﬁre risks in Q3, how
do you see the development there from the drought and the weather?

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Not really something signiﬁcantly that has showed up in our books as spikes.

A - Morten Hübbe
I think it is really focused in Denmark on the agriculture and it's actually not the buildings.
Typically it's the machines. So use the machines for harvesting and that is why you
typically have the ﬁre claims and that's why we have this increase of 400%, which is really
quite steep. Then, we avoid the similar claims in Norway because we have almost no
agriculture exposure, but there's no particular property linked to ﬁre and that is where we
would otherwise see ﬁre that isn't property. So it is really an agricultural phenomenon
predominantly in Q3.

FINAL

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Okay. Fair enough. Then if I may go to slide 11 where you showed the price development
and basically focusing on the motor insurance, so two questions really. First, if you look at
Denmark, up 2.4%, which of course is solid. But if I compare with previous quarters, it's a
decline from 3% a couple of quarters ago, then slightly lower in Q2 and then now lower in
Q3. Have you sort of done the actual repricing around motor that you've been able to,
considering the TryghedsGruppen bonus, and we should expect structurally lower
repricing in motor in Denmark? That was the ﬁrst question.
The second question being on Norway, the 1.4% compared with the 5% price hikes that
you're carrying through right now, so we should expect that line to improve quite
substantially the next 12 to 18 months, I guess.

A - Morten Hübbe
I think it's important – broadly your logic is right, but bear in mind that the data we show
here is the total portfolio exposure versus price, which means that it's price as one driver,
it is of course also mix as a second driver. And then thirdly, it is also for instance, partner
agreements that often further follow a diﬀerent pattern than the direct business.

Bloomberg Transcript

So if you take the 1.4% on Norwegian motor for instance, if you were to calculate that for
the direct business or really everything besides one particularly large partner agreement,
the number would have been signiﬁcantly higher. But we show you the total.
And as I mentioned in Norway, if there's a one particularly, very large partner agreement
with a very attractive combined ratio, where we've seen actually price reductions in motor
and that pulls down the average of the rest. But in general, the expectation for the future
trend on Norwegian motor pricing is upwards, while I would say in Denmark, it is more
broadly stable. And also here, a few partner agreement pulls down the average, but only
a little bit.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Okay. Fair enough. Then a ﬁnal question from my side, relating to the Alka transaction or
potential transaction, so you mentioned, Morten, that a nonstructural remedies that
basically means you're not going to divest part of the business. But I guess, all things
equal, the remedies will leave you less well-oﬀ than if they hadn't been there and you still
reiterate your DKK 300 million guidance for the synergies.
So could you just elaborate a bit on whether in isolation, the remedies are expected to
have a negative impact and whether the DKK 300 million was a conservative number you
gave a year ago, and that's why you can reiterate the guidance, or how should we see
that? Thanks.

A - Morten Hübbe
I understand the question but at the same time, we need to respect that there's a process
where we need to respect the time and the investigation of the authorities. I think, when
Page 10 of 22

FINAL

you look at – so I cannot comment on the actual remedies that we're discussing, because
they're still being discussed, so we cannot give you a full picture of that.
Some of you have questioned what could be examples of non-structural remedies. You've
seen in other cases than ours, examples where for instance putting a cap on various fees,
could be an example of a remedy seen in other cases, just to give you a ﬂavor of what is
sometimes in the toolbox. We have no doubt whatsoever that we will deliver our
synergies. We see currently underlying run rate results that are actually slightly higher
than our working assumptions, and we have no changes to the timing of the synergies
and the results expected.
I guess what we've tried to do is to make sure that we spend the time well into a much
more detailed planning of the integration, which means that we are more than ready to
start the actual integration and process. And Asbjørn, I'm afraid I cannot comment more
details than that.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
That's fair enough. Very helpful. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Mads Thinggaard from ABG Sundal
Collier. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi, this is Mads from ABG. Thanks for taking my questions. The ﬁrst one I have is
going back to the battle for higher proﬁtability in the Norwegian Corporate segment. I
think, you have been alluding to before a kind of a target to get a 10% ROE among the
Corporate Norwegian customers, and now you are talking about, I mean, further price
initiatives. Could you kind of put a bit on that on how far we are from the 10% ROE and I
mean, how long time this journey towards 10% could be? Thank you.

A - Morten Hübbe
Morning, Mads. I don't think we've published an ROE target for Corporate Norway, but I
guess, the general logic is not far oﬀ in the sense that the ROE of Corporate is signiﬁcantly
below the Group. And if you look at the underwriting year, ROE in Corporate Norway is
negative. So that's why we've said that the expectation is really that we're looking at
something like a three-year journey of price increases in Corporate Norway. We've done
7% so far in 2018, and we expect for the 1st of January 2019 renewal actually a slightly
higher price increase than 7% again. And we expect that journey to continue for some
three years.
Of course, we will see how the market reacts. The market has reacted positively so far, but
that's also why we use a caution of the top line, because we are willing to accept some
loss of top line if necessary to carry out these price increases, because we clearly want to

achieve a higher long-term ROE in Corporate, also when we look at the underwriting year
in isolation and do not take into account the help from run-oﬀ gains.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Could you put a bit of ﬂavor on how much you kind of moderated your top line
guidance, I mean, due to the possibilities of customer reaction in this segment?

A - Morten Hübbe
I understand the question, but I think in a big Group with lots of moving parts, I think that
would be being more precise than we can actually control. I think, when you look at the
retention rate improvement with more than one percentage point just the last 12 months,
that's clearly more positively than we've assumed. Clearly, if that trend continues, our
assumptions are too conservative. On the other hand, just assuming that that trend
continues is probably (35:49) being too naive. So, we try to be cautious and we've put in
customer reaction in Corporate Norway as negative, but I wouldn't want to specify that in
more precision.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Okay. Understood. Then just one ﬁnal question on the Alka transaction and that is just, I
mean would it be a very big surprise to you if the deal were not approved by the end of
2018?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hübbe
That would be an extremely large surprise. And then to be honest, I don't have the fantasy
to imagine that that could happen.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two. So ﬁrstly, just to follow-up
on the claims inﬂation versus pricing dynamic, mainly in Denmark and Norway. Are there
any areas you ﬁnding it harder to price out claims inﬂation and are there any trends that
have surprised you?
Secondly, retentions, obviously (00:37:02) are very high, very good in Private, is this
mostly the customer bonus model properly working through now or are there other
drivers, and is there much beneﬁt still to come from that customer bonus run-oﬀ? Thank
you.

FINAL

A - Morten Hübbe
Jonny, so I should start with your ﬁrst one. We haven't really seen any areas with
surprising development compared to what we expected. There's no doubt that we often
look at the portfolio more customer by customer, not necessarily like product line by
product line and carrying out price increases is more tried to be done as in a customer
basis. So, I think that we feel we have a pretty good handle on both pushing through the
prices in the areas that we need to and also kind of oﬀsetting the claims inﬂation, either
by price increases or by their procurement and kind of in initiatives on claims. So I think,
we are feeling quite comfortable with where we stand, the trajectory that we are having
on the underlying development and proﬁtability of our book.

Bloomberg Transcript

I guess on your second question on the customer retention, I think it's fair to say that it's
not only the bonus, because actually we see one of the bigger jumps this quarter being
Private Norway and also Commercial Norway that has no bonus. If you look at Private
Norway, it's really positive to see that after a slightly more diﬃcult period, we've seen for
instance that our IT stability is much higher. We implemented new payment systems more
than a year ago where we've sort of completely screwed up that project, and there was a
long number of areas where we really were sending wrong premium calculations to
customers and also some challenges that gave negative response. All of that has been
stabilized.
We see that our accessibility in Private Norway is much higher. We've done very
systematic work to reduce the number of negative customer experiences. And across
Denmark and Norway, we are working very determinedly on the TNPS, all the way down
to individual employees, so that now we see what is the – when do we have negative
response to individual employees from the customers? How do we handle that? Can we
train that employee? Can we give them best practices? Do some of them have to have
other tasks, et cetera? So, clearly professionalizing the whole customer experience and
avoiding negative customer experience is very much a systematic process.
And then, I guess, when you look at the bonus, there's no doubt that that helps in
Denmark. We now did some 74% awareness amongst Danish current customers. When
we get further way from the payout, actually, that number still trails down. (00:39:59) is at
around 90%, so there's still potential for the customers. And only 22% of the noncustomers realize that we have a bonus scheme. And to us, that is really a quite low
number that we need to work up signiﬁcantly higher. So, we still see that we're really
having several years ahead of us, but clearly helping us also as we speak.

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

FINAL

Good morning, everyone. Wajahat Rizvi from Deutsche Bank. Two quick questions from
me, please. Firstly, can you please tell us what is your market share in the Car Leasing
segment? And can you help us explain the pricing and claims dynamic in this segment?
And secondly, there seems to be some correlation between your large claims experience
and reserve releases. Can you help us understand why the one would impact the other?
Like, I don't necessarily see why there should be a relation, or is it just some sort of claims
equalization reserve you guys have which you can release to smooth proﬁts? Thank you
very much.

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Yeah, good morning. I'll try it. On the market share, on the leasing, I think, we might need
to get the IR to give you some of the details afterwards. But the overall dynamic, you can
see, I think, we know we have more of the leasing market, and in Denmark, we have
probably less of the leasing market than our market share in general.
With respect to pricing, there are deﬁnitely some dynamics, where you have either a
three-year lease and you have a little bit more of stability in the price or you have pricing
or insurances through the actual leasing company. So – but we can give you more ﬂavor
and color on that after the call.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hübbe
And I guess when you look at the large claims versus reserve releases, you're correct. But
if we look at the quarter, we have more large claims than usual and we have more run-oﬀ
than usual. I guess, it's – fundamentally, there should be no correlation between the two.
But of course, we're very pleased that we have a very strong and comfortable reserving
position. And there's a general trend that we are being too conservative on reserves and
would generally have too conservative assumptions, which means that we are seeing
higher run-oﬀ gains than planned.
We had our semi-annual walkthrough of reserve positioning by our Chief actually
(00:42:30) with the board yesterday. And again, showed a more positive level of claims
reserves than previously assumed. So, I think, that's all I can comment.

FINAL

Yes. Thank you. Good morning. A couple of questions from my side as well. Back to the
Alka deal and the remedies, you say that they have not been set yet. What's the timing,
especially in the light of you (00:43:09), I guess, you still expect approval before yearend? Secondly, when the remedies are set, should we expect you to communicate to the
market, to us what they are or should we – or will we need to extract them from the
participant in the market study? I will assume they hardly can be kept as a secret when the
market study starts. That was my ﬁrst question.
My second question is on your top line guidance. You stated that you delivered 3% yearon-year growth in – or 3% organic growth in the third quarter. What are the organic
growth for the ﬁrst nine months, just to get a ﬂavor of where you are versus your 0 to 2%
full year guidance growth? That was the two questions from my side.

A - Morten Hübbe
Good morning, Per, and thanks for your questions. I think on the Alka timing, we've said
Q4. Quite clearly, we are not running the time schedule. So, I think, I would work with the
assumption that is Q4. That is clearly our expectation. I don't think we have enough
insight to be more precise than that. But on the remedies question, you can clearly expect
that once the remedies are ﬁnal, we will communicate very clearly to you what those
remedies are and how we see the potential consequences of those remedies? And then,
bear in mind that that would be under the heading that the assumed run rate, the
assumed synergies, the assumed target of the assumed timing is unchanged.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per Grønborg
Does this imply that you will communicate these remedies before the market study
(44:59) or if they actually advise – or if they – or will you communicate it when the deal
potentially has been cleared by the competition authorities...

A - Morten Hübbe
You should expect us to communicate it.

Q - Per Grønborg
...I'm not sure how to interpret it? (45:11)

A - Morten Hübbe
Yeah. Yeah. Just to clarify that, Per, you should expect the communication to happen only
after the approval has been achieved, because there are still moving parts and
uncertainties. So, it doesn't make sense for us to communicate in the middle of the
process.

Q - Per Grønborg
That implies that we need to get that information from the participants in the market study
(45:34) instead?

A - Morten Hübbe
Well, I think that one should always be very careful to get small snapshots of information,
if you don't have the full picture. So, if you choose to pick up small snapshots, that's of
course, up to you. I wouldn't expect that to give you a meaningful picture of the whole
question. So, if I were you, I would stick to two main themes. One, that the targets and the
timing is unchanged. And two, once the transaction has been approved and the remedies
discussion has been ﬁnalized, we will communicate to you very clearly what those
remedies are and how we see the potential consequences.

Q - Per Grønborg
Okay.

A - Morten Hübbe
Right.

Bloomberg Transcript

Per, on the top line organic part, I think it's around 1.8% that we have year-to-date on the
organic growth. And then, I think our guidance between the 0.2% (sic) [0 to 2%], yeah, we
are probably at the higher range of that. I think one can read into this kind of higher
ranges, but deﬁnitely, our retention rate in Denmark and Norway are showing very good
improvements, and we're really pleased to see that. And the other one is the acceptance
of price increases in Corporate Norway. And those two moving parts are kind of pushing
us in the upper end of this band.

Q - Per Grønborg
Okay. Perfect. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Ryan from Bloomberg

Q - Kevin Ryan

{BIO 1814771 <GO>}

Good morning. It's Kevin Ryan from Bloomberg Intelligence. Thank you very much for
taking my question. I just wondered if you could share with us what the digital investment
cost and your run rate is, and when you see this easing or is it a continuum? Thank you
very much.

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

So, good morning, Kevin. So, I think, if you go back to our Capital Market Day we had in
November, we actually alluded to the fact that we'll be investing quite signiﬁcantly in
digitalization in our portfolio over the next three years, right, (47:50) in 2018, 2019, and
2020 as much as where we'll be putting up DKK 0.5 billion on our balance as kind of
CapEx. So I think the overall investment, you can say, in digitalization, is increasing. But we
Page 16 of 22



Company Name: Tryg A/S

also see the beneﬁts from digitalization by better customer satisfaction, less pit (00:48:08)
manual processes, and kind of eﬃciency gains in general in the Group.

FINAL

We communicated back at the CMD in November that we will be maintaining our 14%
expense ratio around that.

Q - Kevin Ryan

{BIO 1814771 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

And what's – actually, if you open that up, then you'll have some larger investment in IT
and you'll have eﬃciency gains in that, so that we will maintain within 14%.

Q - Kevin Ryan

{BIO 1814771 <GO>}

Brilliant. Thank you.

A - Morten Hübbe

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes and it's broadly trying to make sure that we ﬁnance as much of that investment as
possible because clearly, you should, for the foreseeable number of years, see a higher
run rate investment in IT. I think you can see that in all ﬁnancial services companies, but I
think we're trying to make sure that we oﬀset that with actual savings, particularly in
distribution.
And that's why we talk a lot about and work quite hard on cost of sales, because if you
look at Tryg in a sort of ﬁve-year historical period, we've reduced most of our costs
signiﬁcantly, but the area where we have reduced costs, the least is in distribution. And
that is why that is currently a very big area of focus also to ﬁnance some of our digital
investments.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. Just on your run-oﬀ releases this quarter, I know they're quite
high. Could you give us any speciﬁcs in any kind of items or large items that closed and
you gained speciﬁcally? Or was this all related to the board actuarial review? And when
your auditors go through your reserving, what do they tell you and how do you manage
to continue to reserve at such a high level?

Page 17 of 22



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity

Secondly, on your interest expenses, I saw on page 22 of your report that your interest
rate expenses have gone up signiﬁcantly and they are DKK 113 million for the nine-month
stage, I think around DKK 50 million for the third quarter stage. Can you explain what's
happened here, please? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

So, good morning, Steven. So, on the run-oﬀ side, I think if you actually go to page 32 in
our investor presentation, you can see it actually split up, the run-oﬀ, by product line. And
here in Q3, a lot of it actually comes from motor and workers' comp. You can kind of say,
in general, it comes from our long tail businesses, where we have many years of kind of
having to keep the reserves before we actually have to pay the claims. I think what we
have seen, kind of in general on the trend on the long tail business is that kind of the
conservatism that we've had two, three, four, ﬁve years ago, kind of keep showing up as
more and more conservative.
We have a quarterly review on the reserves and half annual with the board. And I think, in
general, we feel very comfortable with where we are in the reserves. We feel that we are
still continuing having a conservative view on this and I think the discussion with the
regulators, in general, is they're actually very pleased to see that we are running a
conservative business and not trying to push too hard on the margins on the reserves
here and actually having more cushion buﬀer than others might end up having.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hübbe
I guess on the auditors, as you asked, Steven, clearly the auditors and their actuaries
continuously test that we have a healthy assumption and documentation of the various
risks within the reserving book and that those risks can justify the margin that we work
with. And we've also just had a review with the FSA that were satisﬁed with the way we are
running our reserves. So – and I guess, into perpetuity, reserves will be an area, where
there's lots of risk, there's lots of ﬂuctuation, and we're pleased to handle that in a rather
conservative way and we'll continue to do that.

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

On your second question, if I did understand it right, on page 22 in our report, you're
seeing the expense – interest rate expenses increasing from DKK 79 million in 2017 to DKK
113 million in 2018. The change here, I think, predominantly is actually from our bonds
issuing under (00:52:57) Tier 1, so we're actually having some of that in there. Does that
make sense?

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Yeah. But I can't sort of square the circle here because the bond issuance was Q2 and it's
only three-months STIBOR plus 2.5%, which isn't that much on a yearly basis for DKK 500
million?

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Youdish Chicooree from
Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open for your question.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. I've got two questions, please. The ﬁrst one is just to go back
on the dynamics in the Danish motor market. Your average price increases are
moderating down and this while accident frequency seems to be picking up. So, I was
wondering whether you are seeing a favorable development in other parts of the
portfolio, for example, on bodily injury? That's my ﬁrst question.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then secondly, just in your – in terms of your retention rate in Norway Commercial, it
has been improving for the last three quarters. So, is that just purely down to the smaller
players troubling or is there something else happening here?

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

I'll take the – good morning, Youdish. I'll the take the ﬁrst one. I think you're absolutely
right that we have seen an overall general trend over the last 5, 10 years where MTPL is
kind of decreasing in the risk per – kind of per car per insurance. So, there's deﬁnitely a
trend – long-term trend on that. I think the comprehensive trends that you're seeing here,
which is roughly around 40% of the motor book, is something that is ticking up. And if
you add those two together, then it is a trend where we feel that the price increases that
we're pushing through is being suﬃce enough to kind of improve our underlying.
And then back to our comment we actually also made a little bit earlier, I think, we also
see this as a portfolio. So, product line by product line, yes, we do monitor it very strictly,
but we also see other areas where claims inﬂation might actually be positive developing,
not negative developing and actually giving us more cushion to actually get an overall
portfolio proﬁtability that's much stronger. So, yes, we do show you some product line
speciﬁcs in our presentation. But bear in mind, we actually look at this as a totality
portfolio and development as a totality.

A - Morten Hübbe
And I guess on the customer retention rates in Norway, there is a number of moving parts.
I clearly see that the fact that we left a year, as I mentioned, with a lot of IT and payment
challenges, where we made a lot of mistakes causing nuisance to the customers, that is
helping the equation now because those challenges are over. But also, as I mentioned,

Page 19 of 22



Company Name: Tryg A/S

Date: 2018-10-11

FINAL

the work with accessibility has enhanced signiﬁcantly, so that it's much easier for the
customers now in Norway to get hold of us, both on the phone, but also, Norway is the
area where we see the biggest increase and use of digital claims solutions, which is
getting very, very positive customer response.
And then, we work with this 1 to 10 scale of positive versus negative customers. And
particularly in Private Norway, we have worked with the negative customer responses in
the range 1 to 3, the very negative ones to make sure that we limit those and understand
what they are and repair it and reduce the number. So, quite deliberate work. And as I
mentioned, we do this actually on an employee-by-employee basis, so we're getting very,
very close to the detail of that. We're starting to see that work pay-oﬀ.
And I guess ﬁnally, we do get some help from the fact that some of the smaller players in
Norway are struggling more. So, they are being slightly less aggressive than say a year or
two ago.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay. Understood. Thank you. Can I – just one follow-up in terms of your response on the
accessibility of your services in Commercial. I mean, could you just tell us, for example,
what is the roll-out of digital solution or automation in your Commercial segment versus,
for example, the Private segment, please?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Well, there's no doubt that Commercial segment is way behind Private lines in this area.
Actually, we are seeing that a number of the both access automation, digital solutions we
have in Private lines, we don't at all have in Commercial lines. But having said that, we've
now – we've invested more than DKK 100 million in Commercial Denmark, where we're
starting to see some beneﬁts. In Commercial Norway, we are now the ﬁrst company with
an online price and sales solution and more also online servicing. But we're still
signiﬁcantly behind Private lines. So, I would rather say that in Commercial, we have the
sort of beginning of that journey.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca.
Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. Just a very quick – sorry, good morning. Just very quick. The
underlying loss ratio trend. So, just picking up on the comment on the pricing achieved
on the Group being 3%, claims inﬂation being 2.5% Group wide, that automatically gives

Page 20 of 22



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2018-10-11

sort of a 50 basis point pickup. But, should we not expect some more given that you're
doing other stuﬀ with all these initiatives? So, what would you say to that? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Good morning, Vinit. I think that you deﬁnitely have to view our 2% to 2.5% expectation. I
think there's deﬁnitely some areas where we see frequency giving us some surprises or
where we see kind of trend going the opposite direction than anticipated. So for us, there
is deﬁnitely a cushion we want to maintain.
And then, yes, if you were to do just the simple math of 3% and then 2.5% in our claims
initiatives, you should see a better improvement. I think in general, we also do see that the
inﬂation trend can surprise us and we rather want to be two steps ahead of it than two
steps behind it. So, when we guide for the 50-basis-point improvement on Group 1,
especially on Private, that is where you'll see that.
Now, if you also are to do a little bit of the math, deﬁnitely, when we push through 7%
price increases in Corporate Norway and we say a 3% overall on the Group, you might get
some of your diﬀerences on the Private underlying kind of only "being 50 basis points."

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hübbe
And then I guess that this part of the equation, where I guess we don't publish numbers
on that always, it's slightly diﬃcult perhaps to monitor from the outside, but I think, we've
mentioned that we are pushing oﬀ the digital agenda quite signiﬁcantly. So, for instance,
if you look at the claims area, we're investing heavily in digital processing and in IT. Of
course, some of that ﬂows to the balance sheet, but also a signiﬁcant proportion of that
ﬂows directly to the P&L which actually turns oﬀ less costs, but as new claims costs
because claims handling is part of the claims line. So, that also ﬂows into the equation.
But I guess, the general historical learning, Vinit, is we need to overshoot somewhat with
the totality of the initiatives to make sure that we can handle the unknowns and the
uncertainties and the negatives, while still being absolutely certain, we can deliver what
we have set out. But I wouldn't work with an assumption of signiﬁcantly higher underlying
improvement than the 50 basis points that we have set out. So, that would not be our
advice.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Sure. And just quickly follow-up, please. On the run-oﬀ, should we be viewing that the
previous statements and guidances of 3% to 5% gradually is reducing? Given the light of
what's been released this year, should we be viewing that guidance as still holding or
should we be upping our numbers on the run-oﬀ?

A - Morten Hübbe
I would work with the same assumption. I don't know if you recalled in, we had the
discussion and maybe even you asked the question at the end of last year if we have been
reducing the run-oﬀ faster than planned and whether that was a negative signal? And
Page 21 of 22



Company Name: Tryg A/S

Date: 2018-10-11

now, I guess, we have the opposite situation. I think, we will continue to have volatility
between the quarters on run-oﬀs also in the coming years, but the overall signaling and
messaging is completely unchanged.
