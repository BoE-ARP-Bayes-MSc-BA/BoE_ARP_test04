Presentation
Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Ladies and gentlemen. welcome to this conference call on Sampo Group's January;
March 2013 results. My name is Jarmo Salonen and I'm head of Investor Relations at
Sampo. And with me at this call I have our Group CEO and President, Kari Stadigh; Group
CFO, Peter Johansson; and Deputy Head of P&C Insurance, Ricard Wennerklint. We'll
have the same procedures as always. Kari will start with a review of the quarterly
development and then we'll take whatever questions you may have.
Before handing over to Kari, let me remind you that you can follow this transmission on
our website, sampo.com/result, and a recorded version, of course, will then later be
available at that same address. And I will hand over to Kari. Kari, please?

Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Thank you, Jarmo. Welcome to the conference call on my behalf as well. Once again, we
report very good numbers, an EPS of EUR0.57 is well in line with the corresponding
quarter last year. Our NAV reached EUR21.03, an all-time high ﬁgure at the end of the First
Quarter. Our non-life operations had an excellent quarter as well, and delivered the best

FINAL

ever First Quarter combined ratio at 90.9%. The proﬁt before taxes for the period at
EUR204 million was up 3% from last year's First Quarter.
After the quarter, we also closed a deal to acquire three Finnish insurance operations and
are now up and running with the ﬁrst policies sold through Nordea in Finland. In the First
Quarter, Nordea's strong business momentum continued. Total operating income was the
highest ever First Quarter number and core tier 1 ratio rose to 13.2% despite the negative
impact from revised IAS 19 rules. We booked in First Quarter a dividend of EUR293 million
from Nordea and carry now at the end of First Quarter Nordea on our books at EUR7.57 a
share.
Our life insurance performed also well in line with the plan. Proﬁt before taxes was up 8%
at EUR36 million; and on top of this, EUR20 million was put aside to bring the discount
rate in 2014 to 2.7%. And as you all remember, the discount rate for this year is 2.5%. In
April, Mandatum Life further distributed EUR100 million in dividends to Sampo PLC,
maintaining its solvency ratio post dividend at the very strong level of 27.3%.

Bloomberg Transcript

So all in all, a solid First Quarter of the Group. And I want to sum up by saying I highly
appreciate the discipline and low volatility that can be recognized in all areas of our
business operations. Based on this, we are also able to narrow our combined ratio
guidance for the full year unusually early in the year to 89% to 92%.
As we have clearly communicated in earlier calls, our main challenge is now the low
interest rate environment in general, resulting in a gradually declining running yield for
our ﬁxed income portfolio. However, our internal cash ﬂow remains very strong and we
are committed to be a dividend stock also in the future.

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Thank you, Kari. And operator, we are now ready for the questions, please.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions) Your ﬁrst question comes from Per
Gronborg. Please go ahead.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Thank you. I think it was me, Per Gronborg from Danske. I have a single question related
to your liability side, the adjustments on the life side. It's coming down quite materially
this quarter. Have you made any changes to the discount rate you're putting in, or is this
only driven by high interest rates?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Page 2 of 16



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2013-05-08

High interest rates, it's mainly driven by, because we look at the reserves once a year
based on this review. There's a reduction on the eﬀect EUR90 million and then interest
rates are roughly EUR40 million.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

FINAL

EUR90 million from the review and EUR30 million from interest rates?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

EUR40 million from interest rates.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

And it was down some, something like EUR220 million?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yes. And then the rest is the discount rate eﬀect.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Isn't that only the EUR20 million that you had for raising the (inaudible) this quarter? Was
it the unwinding of what happened full year last year?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Then, when -- the EUR20 million is simply the amount (technical diﬃculty) we have rolled
over from previous quarters and added on another EUR10 million.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

So this is a ﬁgure we should expect to take material moves every First Quarter? Is that
correctly understood?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Not necessarily, actually. This was a bit of a surprise for us also, that this move was such
big.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay, but the discount rates are basically the same? The principals are the same as you
used last quarter?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Principals are same, yes.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Matti Ahokas. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. Two questions, please. Firstly, the large claims, as you say, were
below the normal level. Could you also say what was the ﬁgure for Q1? Then, I don't know
if you've gotten new information already regarding what the potential impact of the lower
tax rate in Finland next year would be; it would be greatly appreciated if you could shed
some light on that. Thanks.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Matti, this is Peter. I can take the tax rate. You should -- going forward, you should apply
then 20% on Mandatum Life, and basically that means that also if you look at the
(technical diﬃculty) custom life's deferred tax liabilities from unrealized gains. So
depending on where that number is in the fair value reserve at the end of the year, so
there will be a one-oﬀ on that one because basically we apply at 24.5%. So that's the main
impact.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then there will be a marginal eﬀect in Finland because we still have some -- I'm looking at
EUR300 million, EUR400 million of equalization provisions in Finland, so there's a
deferred tax on that, which is 24.5%, and then will go down to 20%. So this will have a
minor positive eﬀect on Group equity.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

But the eﬀective tax rate from 2014 onwards, is it a minor eﬀect? It is like one percentage
point, or what should we be talking -- looking for?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Because the life number is actually if we have the same amount of unrealized gains, it
would be -- in the life portfolios, the eﬀect would be $25 million. And I think the eﬀect is
pretty much -- we're quite not there, I think around EUR30 million to EUR50 million in
Finland. But this is, of course -- so, this is more what's going to happen during the coming
quarters.

A - Ricard Wennerklint
And I want to comment (inaudible), we have an EUR11 million better than normal result in
Q1 and EUR19 million better than last year. If you're asking about average large claims, this
was the level we're looking at, you can get an estimate , which is roughly 200 million
Swedish per month in large claims from industrial and commercial. But that is, of course, a
moving target since every time we write new business the normalized large claims
number will be diﬀerent.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Page 4 of 16



Company Name: Sampo Oyj

previously also stated.

A - Ricard Wennerklint

Yes.

Great. Thanks.

Operator
Your next question comes from Jan Wolter. Please go ahead.

Q - Jan Wolter

{BIO 1646844 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. Jan Wolter here, Deutsche Bank. I have two questions from my side.
As you said, it's unusually early to tighten your combined ratio guidance in Q1. What are
you seeing to make you communicate this now? That's the ﬁrst question. Then, I assume
you continue to adapt to the low rate environment in a measured way. What do you feel is
an appropriate discount rate in your life insurance book? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

This is Peter again on the discount rate. So basically, the Finnish rules are simple, where
you can -- or you have to use a three -- or on the old policies, 3.5% discount rate. Then, if
you underwrite any new risk/proﬁt business, the maximum risk discount rate allowed is
2.5%. So regardless of the movements of interest rates, the regulator has not changed
this. So basically, this extra reserving that we do, that's purely a Company decision.

A - Ricard Wennerklint
I'd like to comment to the tightening of the forecast for the year or the guidance. I would
say only this is a strong First Quarter that we have seen. That's the only new information.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

And for my part, I feel very comfortable with the guidance that I have received because of
the historic low volatility in our combined ratio. I think that now with almost any year track
record, it's such low volatility compared to our peers that we have this situation very well
under control, as well as you can have it in this industry.

Q - Jan Wolter

{BIO 1646844 <GO>}

Thanks a lot for that. And just to follow-up on my second question there, so are you saying
that the discount rate could really continue to come down to 2.5% and below that? Is that
what we should expect?

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}
Page 5 of 16



Company Name: Sampo Oyj

Date: 2013-05-08

FINAL

No. Basically, you have -- we have slightly less than EUR3.9 billion of guaranteed business
with proﬁt liabilities in our portfolio. And this is a portfolio that will gradually run up -- run
oﬀ. We estimate that now, during the next ﬁve years, there will (disappear) about EUR200
million every year. So there will be -- actually, slightly more. So we will be down
somewhere at EUR3 billion after four or ﬁve years.
So this means basically that unless there are no regulatory changes and unless we don't
move into Solvency II plus, then the second phase of IFRS, basically it gradually runs oﬀ.
And this is -- these are purely Company decisions, how we have smoothened out for
future proﬁts by lowering our 2013 and 2014 discount rates to make the hurdle lower to
make money on investments.

Q - Jan Wolter

{BIO 1646844 <GO>}

Okay. Many thanks for that.

Operator
Your next question comes from Blair Stewart. Please go ahead.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. I've got three questions, I think. Firstly, on
the ﬁxed income running yield in the non-life business, it dropped from, I think, 3.6%
down to 3.4%, and you talked about that carry as being a challenge. I just wondered if
that's the right sort of trajectory to be thinking about, what we've seen so far this year.
Second question is on the life business. You've taken a dividend from life; I think you had
previously said that you may not take a dividend from the life business. So I just wonder
what prompted you to say that, to take that dividend. Is it just the strong start to the year
of markets and high fair values over, et cetera?
And thirdly, on economic capital, you've seen a reduction in your economic capital ratio, I
think because the economic capital requirements for Nordea went up. I think we've had
some debates in the past about the way that you consolidate Nordea into your economic
capital and the way that Nordea does. I just wonder if you can clarify exactly what's
happened there in Q1. Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

So let's start with life dividend. We have distributed, I think, life at dividend from the life
Company, the previous time was 2011, and before that 2007. Of course, it was a long time
since we had distributed any signiﬁcant dividends if you take cumulative number of years.
So we felt comfortable, especially after the strong development in the beginning of the
year and the very strong solvency ratio the Company has to take out this dividend.
There is really nothing new in that. The Company should generate, I think, going forward,
if the environment stays like this, maybe EUR50 million in dividend capacity per year

Page 6 of 16

FINAL

plus/minus something. So if we want to take it out in step every second year as EUR100
million or every year as EUR50 million, that remains to be seen. And this is, of course,
subject to the development of the equity market.
Then, on the running yield, it's dropping, yes, it's coming slowly down. I think you asked
also in the previous call about this, how should you look at this going forward. I have no
better guidance than the previous time. We are piling up cash; I think the present ﬁgure
is, on the Group level, we have EUR1.8 billion in cash, and we see that there is less and
less value in ﬁxed income products.
So the situation remains -- we are not going to panic on this, so you will see gradual
decrease in the running yield; however, this is not, of course, for concern for us, this is
something we just struggle with. But you have yourself to calculate the steepness of that.
We are not dropping oﬀ any cliﬀ. You can calculate the steepness by you know our
duration, you know our maturity. So just remember that the major part is (inaudible).

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Blair, this is Peter on the economic capital side, actually, not they are reporting at year
end, they had an economic capital requirement of close to EUR18 billion, and that jumped
by almost EUR6 billion.
And simply because they have recalibrated their economic capital number up to higher
core tier 1 ratio targets that the regulators have set, that basically in our internal model we
take our share of that increase of roughly EUR6 billion, which is about EUR1.25 billion. But
that's done with a 99.97% conﬁdence level, and there we scale that back to a 99.5%
conﬁdence level, and that brings up our economic capital by roughly EUR1 billion.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. So there's still a gap -- just to make sure I understand that, Peter, there's still a gap
between yourselves and Nordea? There's a still a diﬀerence between the two, but you're
just reﬂecting their higher base and recalibrating it to your base? Is that correct?

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

That is correct, that the -- because of the economic capital model is our internal test
(inaudible; background noise) (investments), so we want to use same conﬁdence level.
But this actually is clearly above then any regulatory requirement that will be put on us, or
there's some margin on the regulatory requirement.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yes, understood. Thank you.

Q - Mika Koskinen

{BIO 1557965 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. Hi, there. Good afternoon. It's Mika from SEB. Just a question on the dividend. And I
know it's a bit early days to talk about next year's dividend at this stage, but you
mentioned that you want to strongly proﬁle yourself still -- or you're committed to be a
dividend stock. And if we look at this year's paid out dividend, should that be taken as an
indication that basically as long as you don't see meaningful acquisitions on the radar
screen you are willing to pay out basically all the free cash ﬂow that you are generating?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I think that my statement that we are dividend stock should be interpreted so that we
would like to see our dividend increase. But let's not (technical diﬃculty) it should be
(graphically) viewed also. So I don't know if it's linear or algorithmic or what it should
cause some enjoyment visually when the end dividend grows annually.

Q - Mika Koskinen

{BIO 1557965 <GO>}

The graphical appeal annually is very important. When you mentioned that you have
roughly -- and this is -- I know that there's a large margin of error into this, but you said
that Mandatum Life should have an annual dividend capacity of roughly EUR50 million a
year. If we take the corresponding analogy to if it's fair to assume that with the current
shall I say running rate of the business, the annual dividend capacity of it should be in the
range of EUR500 million to EUR600 million a year?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

I think that you have to correct it with some currency ﬂuctuations. And it's sensible to be
conservative, so I would say plus/minus EUR500 million is a better number.

Q - Mika Koskinen

{BIO 1557965 <GO>}

All right, fair enough. Thanks very much.

Operator
Your next question comes from Thomas Seidl. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. And good afternoon, everyone. Two questions. One on P&C. I look at
slide 32, the growth development by segment, and I wonder if you could comment on
industrial and on Sweden, where we sort of see them lower numbers now. Is this a
reﬂection as to the market environment and market dynamics, or what is happening in
this? And on the life side, slide 48, I think market share has dropped signiﬁcantly. And
what was sort of the main driver for this?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

P&C, our product life part, as you are well aware, we have no market share targets in any
of our businesses because we are (technical diﬃculty) to make money (technical diﬃculty)

ﬁnancial industry market shares are really dangerous. Mandatum performed exactly
according to plan; however, we can see that the market leader in Finland almost doubled
its volume in the First Quarter. And I think you have to direct the question on their
behavior, to them. But Mandatum performed according to plan on volume.

FINAL

A - Ricard Wennerklint
When it comes to growth in P&C, I will say we're quite happy with the overall growth
during the First Quarter. The number that you've seen in industrial, that's more a
reﬂection of our persistent increasing rates in the industrial market. It's a need for rate
increases and apparently will mean that we do some business with the current market
environment.
The Swedish number is partly reﬂecting premium increases, but also lower car sales,
which, as you know, has a direct eﬀect on our volume.

Q - Thomas Seidl

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Hi. Most of my questions have been answered, but if I can just jump in still on the
combined ratio, vertically the two markets of Norway and Sweden. In last three or four
quarters now, or eﬀective four quarters now, where there's no (inaudible) on the reported
level, at least, (technical diﬃculty) it's kind of worsened, if you see the trend that Sweden
has kind of improved successive quarters, last four quarters now. Is it just a coincidence
that this trend exists, or is there something else going on?
And the reason I'm also asking this is because the whole Nordic P&C market is almost at
its best ever and it's beneﬁting all the players. So one question from Europe that we
always ask is, is this cycle close to its peak in terms of proﬁtability? And I know your view,
that this is still a nicely behaving market, but I just wanted to see if there is any trend here,
or am I just reading too much into this chart? Thanks.

-- the market. So combined ratio by country would always be impacted by large claims.
Basically, we haven't seen any sign of a (technical diﬃculty) long time. It has been good
now for, let's say, about a year. And I make no estimate on where this market will continue
to move. The Swedish market has been quite bad and in need of premium increases, and
that it (technical diﬃculty) underlying results, Sweden should be improving.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Remember, when you at quarterly results, that there are certain mega trends we chart
(technical diﬃculty). One is that mutuals are becoming (least feed), or semi least feed.
That's very important. So I think the mega trends are really not changing in this
environment.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

And is competition still not misbehaving? In fact, that's the main thing, isn't it?

A - Kari Stadigh

The lower interest environment would support this, every P&C company to concentrate
on their insurance proﬁtability.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thanks very much. Peter Eliot from Berenberg. If we could just come back on two things
that's just been asked recently, actually. The ﬁrst one, and, Kari, I apologize if I'm trying to
read too much into this, but just interested by your comment on you'd like a linear or
even better progression. Clearly, over the last four years dividends have gone up by
pretty close to sort of 0.15 on average per year. Should we -- is there any reason you
should dissuade us from thinking that that linear progression can continue? And as I say,
apologizes if I'm reading too much into your statement, but that would be great.
The other thing I wanted to comment on was the life, your sales or market share. I guess if
sales across the market have been very good, then people are buying these products.
When we're talking unit-linked, is it a case that fees are not looking as attractive as they
were? I'm just wondering if you could comment a bit more on perhaps why -- what the
dynamics are that are perhaps making these products not look as attractive for you?
Thank you very much.

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

FINAL

The Finnish life market is such that there are actually three players who have 90% of the
market. And the distribution power in unit-linked is with main -- the three main banks. And
we have one of the banks, Danske, as a partner on an exclusive basis, and they are
performing really well; however, they are the smallest one of the three banks. So that now
it is clear that the two other banking groups, they have decided to sell more capital
redemption policies.
Then, that means that apparently what I interpret from the markets that ﬁx these fees that
they have guided their salespeople to systemically lead the client into an insurance
repper. And this has probably to do mainly with Finnish legislation, tax legislation. But as
these companies have very strong distribution power, they have been able to grow the
market under an insurance repper. This is more what has happened than any fee-based or
any proﬁtability-based change. You shouldn't read into more from this than just what I
explained.
On the dividend, I think that as with all artistic issues, they ﬂuctuate and they change. Even
if I'm an engineer, you can't read too much out of it. Then, as a concluding remark, it's the
board that decides what they propose to the (HEM) on these, but we are real artists here,
so we (technical diﬃculty) (see the) dividend regularly increase.

Q - Mika Koskinen

{BIO 1557965 <GO>}

Thanks. Just a follow-up, which you actually to some extent alluded to already, but I was
also curious about the competitive dynamics of the marketplace. And do you see -- ﬁrst of
all, do you see any changes or any diﬀerences in behavior on the diﬀerent markets, i.e., is
-- for example, is Norway diﬀerent than Finland for the time being? Then, have you seen
that anyone had become a bit more aggressive on market share after a long period of
very stable development?

A - Ricard Wennerklint
Let's put it like this, I think the most competitive market now is, a bit surprisingly, the
industrial market and the Swedish market. And I'm saying that because these are the
markets that are most in need of premium increases and we don't see that happening on
a sort of broad scale. The rest of the Nordic market, I would say, are doing quite well and
have been quite calm during the First Quarter.

Your next question comes from Gianandrea Roberti. Please go ahead.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon, from me as well. I have a couple of very quick questions. One was in
Mandatum Life, again, when you mentioned about the possibility of having around
EUR50 million per annum dividend. Maybe listed zero one year and EUR100 million on
two years, that's your real ramp.
I was also thinking about the fact that, if I understand correctly, Mandatum Life reserve will
go down around EUR200 million per annum going forward. And when I look on your
economic calendar model with a 25% solvency margin, just from the fact that this reserve
goes down EUR200 million, that it's EUR50 million of capital free up in that division. I just
would like to check if this assumption is correct and that's what you're counting in, or if it's
more general capital market development for that kind of EUR50 million range.
The second question is more life related than -- I was just thinking, your top line has
actually developed pretty nicely in the last two-and-a-half years, particular suppose
through raise in prices. And I know probably from a client's main household it would

sound like an insult, but I'm just trying to ﬁgure out if lower investment going forward but
could be oﬀset by more price hikes, if there is space for that or how do you see that
equation? Thanks.

FINAL

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Gianandrea, your on the ball here with my dividend guidance on life, because I don't
think I have ever guided anything on the life dividend. And of course, the fact that capital
or the (with proﬁt) balance sheet is melting, that also frees up capital, and that gave me
the conﬁdence to guide like this.
However, the situation is not that easy. We have to analyze a little bit the investment
market. And I think that if we analyze the investment market, what we see unraveling in
front of us is a very similar scenario that is happening now in Japan. I think that the
European Central Bank will follow very carefully what is happening in Japan, and I think
that there is a clear probability that people will ﬁnd this as a successful approach.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then, that leads to the conclusion that southern European countries will need more help
than they are getting today from the ECB. So I think the probability for even negative
interest rates has increased signiﬁcantly, and it has also become quite evident that now a
long duration and sovereign debt and loan debt, that's not the place where you should
be. So then you easily come to the conclusion that equities is where you should be.
And therefore, if Mandatum Life wants to maintain or increase its equity risk, then that, of
course, consumes capital. And therefore, I didn't want to put the bigger number than
EUR50 million because with this investment scenario which we see in front of us, it's quite
likely that equity is the one which will pay oﬀ and then we want to have enough leeway to
maintain and even increase our equity weight in the life company. And so, therefore, I
thought that the conservative number of EUR50 million is the right card to play in this
conference call.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Thanks, Kari, I appreciate the answer.

A - Ricard Wennerklint
(inaudible; microphone inaccessible) combined ratio going forward, with respect to your
question, would remind you that the most important target we have is return on equity
target of 17.5%, and, of course, return on investment or interest rates are an important part
of that. And there is no other way to go for us or anyone else in this market than to
increase prices if we foresee lower investment returns.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

And Ricard, just to add up, do you think that there's actually space in the market to do
that? Because in 2012, most companies have closed with a combined between 85 and 90.
And obviously, there are accounting reporting diﬀerences, but those are the numbers,

right? So in a way, it would sound a bit unlikely that you can push through even more
price hikes to lower the combined. That was the question, really.

FINAL

A - Ricard Wennerklint
I think there is room to improve pricing, if needed, to hit the ROE target. And I don't see a
diﬀerence between our Company or our competitors' companies. They have the same
type of balance sheet, they see the same interest rates as we do.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

And Gianandrea, you must remember that there are some big mutuals still around who
have combined ratios much higher than what you just described.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Absolutely. Thanks a lot. Thanks.

Your next question comes from Matti Ahokas. Please go ahead.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes, Matti here from Handelsbanken here. A follow-up question regarding the non-life
business and the impact of the consolidation of the (Turg) Finnish business. You got the
approval now very recently. Obviously, that business, when Turg was the owner, wasn't
very proﬁtable. What kind of ﬁnancial impact should we be looking for in 2013 and 2014
from this portfolio alone, for the non-life business?

A - Ricard Wennerklint
(inaudible; microphone inaccessible) -- a very small business. But from 2014, we're
deﬁnitely looking at a positive contribution from Turg business. This year, everything else
being equal, most likely we'll see a negative impact, but this is smallish. And it was
roughly EUR8 million in premiums.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thanks. Just a follow-up. I'm interested and amused by your comments on (Top). And I
just wondered, just trying to set your comments about being a dividend stock into that.

Philosophically, what's Sampo's view with regards to share buybacks such as dividends
from Top? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Really, we are not represented on the board of Top, as you are well aware of, and we have
bought into the concept of this excellent company. And we have no reason to be involved
in changing that concept as long as it is as powerful in underwriting and insurance
technicalities as it is today. If that were to change, then I think our opinion would be
diﬀerent.
But at this moment, our only worry is that the share price is too high. So we have to follow
that buybacks as such if the liquidity dries up or not making imbalances in the market. We
see no sign yet of that, but this is, of course, as a shareholder, something we follow very
carefully.
So we -- at the moment, we have no dialogue with the company where we would require
them to change anything in their concept. We are the happy shareholder in the ﬁrst row
of the (ATM).

There are no more questions registered at this moment, sir. Please continue.
Your next question comes from Jakob Brink. Please go ahead.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Hi, it's Jakob from ABG. I just have a very ﬁnal question, then. I'm just -- you said
something about Sweden, that it was remarkably the country where it's most diﬃcult to
raise premiums, even though you have been doing so. I seem to remember that after Q4
you mentioned, or (inaudible) mentioned, that Sweden was a theocracy which kind of
helped it perform in line with 2012 this year. Could you maybe give a bit more detail on
exactly how you expect this to play out, if Norway should be weaker than last year, which I
guess must be assumed? Thank you.

A - Ricard Wennerklint
That's a bit too much speculation. I'm just saying that during the First Quarter we have
increased prices in Sweden, but my -- what I can see, I don't see the rest of the market
doing the same, which is a bit surprising.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Okay. Thank you. If there are no questions, then let me thank you for your attention. But
before closing, two things I would like to point out. First of all, you probably have, and
hopefully have, received an invitation to our Capital Market Day on the 30 of May in
London. If not, please send me an email and I'll get you one. And secondly, if you have
further issues to discuss, please call Peter and myself this evening, since tomorrow is a
