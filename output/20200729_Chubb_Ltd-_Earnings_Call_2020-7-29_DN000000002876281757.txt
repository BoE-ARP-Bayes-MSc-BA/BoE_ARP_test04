FINAL

Now, I'd like to introduce our speakers today. First we have, Evan Greenberg, Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Then
we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members

And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.

Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Good morning. COVID-19 is an event of historic proportions, impacting societies and the
economies globally. This hit businesses and individuals hard and the impact will be with us
for some time.

Bloomberg Transcript

Chubb has and is performing well, while naturally shouldering our burden of responsibility
supporting our insured, both businesses and consumers. COVID-19 is a slow rolling global
catastrophe, impacting virtually all countries. Unlike other natural catastrophes, it has no
geographic or time limits and the event continues as we speak.
Together the health and consequent economic crisis will likely produce the largest loss in
insurance history, particularly considering its worldwide scope and how both sides of the
balance sheet are ultimately impacted. We pre-announced a few weeks ago an after tax
COVID related loss estimate of $1.2 billion which essentially caused us a quarter of
earnings. This loss is an estimate of our ultimate loss from the pandemic and economic
crisis, based on everything we know and then project. The estimate does not include for
the most part, a credit for potentially lower current accident year losses from a decrease
in exposures except for a very modest amount.
Looking beyond this quarter's catastrophe losses and the shadow it cast is an important
story to tell about our company. Our underlying health and vitality are excellent and we
are capitalizing on current industry, commercial P&C conditions.
Our published P&C combined ratio was 112.3% with a total after-tax charge of $1.5 billion,
including $353 million of natural catastrophe and civil unrest-related losses.
Separately, we took an after-tax charge of $205 million in unfavorable prior period
development with child molestation related claims emerging predominantly from reviver
statutes that into effect last year.
On a current accident year basis, excluding cats, the combined ratio was 87.4%, a 0.5%
improvement over prior year with current accident year underwriting income up over 18%
and constant dollars. The loss ratio was essentially flat with prior, while the expense ratio
was down 1.5 points. We benefited from expense saves due to the shutdown as well as

Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity

our ongoing efficiency efforts while we continued to invest in important areas to improve
our competitive profile.

FINAL

In the quarter, book value benefited from actions taken by the Fed to support the
economy during this exigent time, which positively impacted asset values that will
pressure future investment income.
Per share book value grew about 5%, while tangible was up over 7%, both are now
essentially flat for the year.
Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value, cats and prior period
development. Broadly speaking, two themes impacted growth in the quarter. On the one
hand, shrinking exposures from the decline in economic activity weighed negatively on
growth; and on the other hand, favorable commercial P&C underwriting conditions
contributed to growth.
In the quarter, P&C net premiums grew 1.4% in constant dollars. Growth was impacted due
to a one-time charge we took to estimate the ultimate impact on premiums that we will
incur from exposure adjustments on in-force policies due to a reduction in economic
activity.

Bloomberg Transcript

Excluding the charge, which is a better way of viewing our underlying quarterly growth, we
grew 3.9%. This is made up of 9.1% positive growth globally in commercial P&C and 6.3%
negative growth in consumer lines which includes A&H travel and personal lines.
In the quarter, we continued to experience favorable underwriting conditions in
commercial P&C, which vary by geography and product line. The commercial P&C pricing
environment is particularly strong in North America, the UK, the continent of Europe and
certain locations in Asia Pacific and it continues to spread further in North America, which
includes the US, Canada and Bermuda. Commercial P&C net premiums grew 10%,
adjusting for the one-time premium charge I just mentioned. And on the back of strong
new business growth and premium retention, with our major accounts and specialty
business, growing over 12% and our middle market and small commercial business
growing 6.5%.
In our international general insurance operations, commercial P&C net premiums grew
over 5.5% in the quarter in constant dollars. Chubb global markets, our London wholesale
business grew over 20%, while our commercial P&C business in Continental Europe grew
nearly 16%. In those markets where we grew, we continued to achieve improved rate to
exposure across most all commercial product lines.
Overall rates increased in North America Commercial P&C by 14%. In major accounts and
specialty, rates for property were up 21%. Casualty rates were up over 25.5% and financial
lines rates were up over 18.5%. In our middle market business, rates for property were up
18%. Casualty rates were up over 12 excluding workers comp. The comp rates were down
1% and finance lines rates were up 14.5 % in the middle market.

FINAL

In our international general insurance operations, rates were up 16% in our international
retail business and 20% in our London wholesale. Consumer lines growth globally in the
quarter was severely impacted, given the pandemic effects on consumer-related
activities.
Our North America personal lines business was an exception, as we experienced flight to
safety and quality in our high-net-worth segment. Net premiums written in the quarter
were up 2% on an adjusted basis and retentions remain very strong at almost 97%.
In our international personal lines business predominantly auto, home and cellphone,
premium shrink 12.5%, while our global A&H premiums, US and international, together
were down 13.5%.
Our Asia-focused international life insurance business, however, had a good quarter with
net written premiums up 30% in constant dollar.

Bloomberg Transcript

In sum, to provide you a better perspective, though we typically provide limited guidance,
we expect Chubb will have on a published basis positive premium revenue growth for the
full year. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump and Juan Luis Ortega can provide further
color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends.
As a company in the globe, as a normal company during extremely abnormal times
depending on where you are in the world with the exceptions a substantial portion of our
international staff is back in the office on any given day. This includes most of Asia Pacific,
where about 50% are back in the office; and in some countries, 100%. Europe where with
the exception of Spain and Italy, 25% are back. And while the UK remain closed, we
expect about 20% to 25% to return in (technical difficulty) and ready to begin our return to
office in the US but took a pause, given the increase in infection rates in many parts of the
country.
Among developed countries in the world, the US stands out in its inability to manage the
health crisis on a national basis. And this is damaging our economic recovery and our
image globally. Where conditions have stabilized in the US like the Northeast, we've
begun to bring employees back to the office for meetings, to collaborate, learn and plan.
We are ready to return on a broader basis when conditions warrant. The health and wellbeing of our staff is of paramount concern.
Insurance is an essential service. We never stopped or even paused in providing
coverage, paying claims or providing risk engineering and other services to our customers
and clients. We are very active on a daily basis with our clients and distribution partners
globally, and we have done so with service levels that are virtually the same as we provide
normally.
I'm going to say a few words about the business interruption issue that I know is on the
minds of many. As you know, the insurance industry is under attack by the trial bar [ph]
over business interruption claims. They represent many businesses which purchased BI
coverage that does not provide cover for pandemic and these customers are
Page 4 of 18



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2020-07-29

FINAL

understandably disappointed and upset. Plaintiff attorneys are attempting to torture or
reverse engineer insurance contract language to conjure up business interruption
coverage that for the most part simply doesn't exist.
Coverage for a pandemic was never contemplated in standard business interruption
policies and therefore no premiums were ever charged for that risk. In fact, state
insurance regulators who approved the policies have been clear that this risk is not
covered and that the industry could not cover the massive open-ended tail risk of a global
pandemic because it threatens the industry solvency.
Without the federal government playing a major role to cover the tail risk, pandemics are
simply under uninsurable on a broad basis.
Standard BI policies which are an addendum to a fire policy required direct physical loss or
damage to the property, for example, if fire or flood damages the property and prevents
the business from operating while repairs are being made.

Bloomberg Transcript

COVID-19 does not cause physical loss or damage to a property, despite the trial bar's
efforts to influence some government officials in the wording of their civil, public shutdown
orders.
Though it doesn't cover pandemic, standard BI coverage provides good value for the
money. We estimate the industry pays out about $0.70 in insurance claims for every
business interruption production dollar collected, with most of the remaining amount paid
in commissions, premium taxes and other expenses.
For Chubb, in addition to our normal losses this year, we will pay BI claims for policies that
specifically covered certain pandemic-related shutdowns, such as those for the
entertainment industry. We care deeply about properly supporting and servicing all of our
policyholders and I have particular sympathy with the millions of businesses that have
suffered terribly during the pandemic-forced economic shutdowns, but it would be wrong,
in fact, catastrophic and irresponsible to pay the claims of those who didn't have
coverage and in fact didn't pay premiums with a coverage by using funds that had been
properly reserved for the legitimate claims of the vast majority of our P&C policy holders
who number over a 100 million globally.
To provide some context, in 2019 Chubb paid $24 billion on approximately 4 million
property and casualty claims. Again, to pay billions of dollars in uncovered claims by rating
the reserves or capital needed, to pay claims on other kinds of policies such as auto and
home, commercial insurance exposures, respond to natural catastrophes, such as
hurricanes and wildfires would be irresponsible to the vast majority of our policyholders
and to our shareholders.
Beyond the business interruption challenges of the current COVID-19 crisis the insurance
industry has an important role to play in society and in the economy. And that includes fully
participating in the development of a prospective future pandemic business interruption
solution to crises arise.

FINAL

Earlier this month, Chubb released its pandemic business interruption program, designed
to mitigate the economic disruption and losses in the event of a future pandemic. Our
framework is not the first plan to be introduced, but the public-private partnership
framework we develop has important differences from the other leading proposals. By
sharing our ideas and approach, we hope to spark and influence a productive debate on a
solution that will work for businesses of all sizes, taxpayers, our industry and the economy
more broadly.
First and foremost, I believe the industry can and should take pandemic risk, along with
the government. This is a peril that can be covered to a greater degree than we do today
as long as the tail exposure is covered by the government. It is our job to figure out how
to do that.
We can do more than simply play an administrative role where we belittle ourselves and
we're less relevant than we can or should be. The framework we announced has
attributes that we believe will make for a successful program. It accounts for the different
needs of small, medium, and to a modest degree large businesses.

Bloomberg Transcript

Premium for small business will be affordable and they will be paid quickly. Large
companies would pay a fair and risk adjusted price to both the government insurers per
pandemic cover in a program built on free market principles. The government gets paid
for the use of its balance sheet. It's not a hand out to larger companies.
Our framework has incentives for broad participation by the industry and by committing
insurance industry capital and providing opportunity for increased risk sharing over time as
direct and secondary markets develop, the pandemic burden shouldered by the
government will ultimately be lessened to a degree. This is an important issue for our
nation. We look forward to contributing to the dialog as policymakers work to refine the
most effective solution.
Before I turn things over to Phil, I want to say a few words about an issue that concerns all
of us, and that's the persistent challenges arising from bigotry, racism and the racial
injustice in society, particularly for Black people. The events that unfolded across our
nation these past few months has focused our attention on what we should do as citizens
and as a company. We characterize Chubb's culture as an inclusive meritocracy. We
earnestly strive to achieve an environment where all colleagues feel comfortable to
perform to their full potential and are recognized for their contributions. It's a never
ending work in progress and we can do more.
We developed and recently shared with our employees an action plan to which we will
hold ourselves accountable. The plan has a few simple objectives. We do want to enhance
our individual and collective understanding of racism in society and strive within Chubb to
be anti-racist in our behavior as individuals and as an organization. We want to actively
support each other. It starts with more frank dialog between our employees of color,
particularly Black colleagues and our White colleagues to create better understanding and
awareness about the realities of racism.

FINAL

We will hold leaders more accountable for curating and leading an environment of
inclusion and will eliminate policies and practices that potentially create bias and inhibit our
ability to create greater racial mix of our workforce at all levels of the company. This is an
enduring process, not a momentary event in time. We believe we have a responsibility to
do our part with candor, open minds and a commitment to change.
In closing, our company is very strong. Our balance sheet is in excellent shape, in fact,
outstanding shape. And we are operating well around the globe during very difficult times.
Our underlying strengths are enduring. And we are capitalizing on favorable market
conditions as we simultaneously navigate the extreme headwinds and uncertainty created
by COVID-19.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil and then I'm going to come back and take your
questions.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Evan. Our financial position at quarter-end is exceptionally strong. COVID-19 is
an earnings event for Chubb, while our balance sheet remains in excellent shape. Our
balance sheet features a $112 billion AA-rated cash and investment portfolio with a
duration of four years, a consistently conservative approach to loss reserving and total
capital of $70 billion. We are a balance sheet business operating in an extremely uncertain
times and we have maintained a conservative level of capital.
Our operating cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion and our liquidity on a global basis
continues to be excellent. In the quarter, we returned $353 million to shareholders in
dividends. Adjusted net investment income for the quarter of $857 million pre-tax was
below our guidance range, mainly due to foreign exchange, lower rates on our floating
rate obligations and an acceleration of prepayments in the mortgage loan portfolio.
We remain consistent and conservative in our investment strategy and do not expect to
materially adjust the portfolio's asset allocation. We intend to maintain a high quality bias
and conservative duration. Debt easing actions have inflated asset values causing a
disconnect with underlying credit conditions so that many classes of debt appear
mispriced. We will continue to focus on risk-adjusted returns and not reach for yield.
While there are a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income, we
now expect our quarterly run rate to be in the range of 850 million to $860 million.
Turning to book value, per share book and tangible book value were up 4.9% and 7.2%
respectively in the quarter. Our core operating loss and dividend payment were more
than offset by net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter of $3.1 billion after tax
including $2.7 billion in our investment portfolio, $410 million from favorable foreign
currency movements, and $110 million mark-to-market gain in our variable annuity
reinsurance portfolio. The gain in the investment portfolio is due mainly to the narrowing
of credit spreads in our corporate bond portfolio and a decline in interest rates.

FINAL

At June 30, our investment portfolio was at a net unrealized gain position of $3.4 billion
after tax. Our net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $1.8 billion pre-tax or $1.5 billion
after-tax as previously announced and are further detailed in our financial supplement.
And net loss reserves increased $2.7 billion in constant dollars including the significant
catastrophe losses and adverse prior period development.
The paid to incurred ratio was 59%, reflecting the catastrophe losses. We had unfavorable
prior period development in the quarter of $75 million pre-tax or $52 million after tax. This
included a charge for US child molestation claims of $259 million pre-tax or $205 million
after tax as previously announced. The vast majority of these losses were reviver statute
related. Excluding this charge, we had favorable prior period development in the quarter
of $184 million pre-tax split approximately 79% in long-tail lines principally from accident
years 2016 and prior and 21% in short-tail lines.
Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter of 15.3% was impacted by the high
level of catastrophe losses. Through six months, our core operating effective tax rate was
16.5%, slightly higher than our expected 14% to 16% range. We now expect our annual
core operating tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 17%.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Karen.

Thank you. At this point, we're happy to take your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions). And we will take our first question from Michael Phillips with
Morgan Stanley. Go ahead.

Q - Mike Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Thanks. And thank you, good morning. Good morning everybody. Evan, thanks for those
comments especially on the BI stuff. Appreciate that. I guess, can you talk about the
impact that COVID and shelter-in-place is having on your acquisition expense ratio? And
then longer term, maybe you've made some good strides in your expense rate in general
even prior to global, so kind of how we should think about a good run rate going forward
from there?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yes. Let's say, the acquisition ratio benefits fundamentally from a mix of business change.
You had consumer lines that as I said, had a negative growth to them and they run a
higher acquisition costs than commercial P&C does and we're growing underneath, as you
could see commercial P&C at a rapid clip. And it has a lower acquisition ratio.

Page 8 of 18



Company N ame: Chubb L td

Date: 2020-07-29

FINAL

The OpEx ratio did benefit reasonably well in the quarter from COVID-related shutdown
and I expect that we'll continue to receive benefit from that as we go forward in future
quarters. And so, overall, I think the expense ratio will continue to benefit in future
quarters. How much and to what degree, I'm not going to prognosticate or give guidance
on.

Q - Mike Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Okay. No, thanks. That's helpful. I guess, second question on COVID and frequency
benefits on commercial line, can you talk about what specific lines maybe benefit the
most from frequency benefits? And then with some of the reopening as we've seen
recently, has there been any change in trends, certainly in the frequency that you've
noticed that'll pick on because of the re-openings?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, commercial lines, fundamentally, most classes of business in traditional property and
casualty benefit to a degree and it varies by line of business from the COVID shut down
on one hand. On the other hand, we took a massive charge to recognize the COVIDrelated claims that will arise. But excluding that, the frequency, when you take those away,
the frequency and severity in most traditional lines will benefit and are benefiting at least
to this point in time, because commercial activities are down and that would be both in
the short-tail lines, as well as in the long-tail lines. But it varies by class, obviously, in
professional lines to a lesser degree than, say, in general casualty or in excess casualty.
And as you know, our policy has always been, we recognize bad news early and we're
very slow to recognize good news. And so, many of the benefit we might be seeing short
term right now, for the most part, from the reduction in economic activity and the shelter
in place and the lack of social activity around the world, we're very slow to recognize that
and will be, because we are in very uncertain times and we don't know what the future is
going to bring.
Secondly, what I would add is that overall in commercial P&C, for the most part, we are
achieving rates that are in excess of loss cost trends, and again we're in uncertain times
and we're conservative in our approach.

Q - Mike Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Thanks, Evan. I appreciate it.

Operator
And we will take our next question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go
ahead.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, thank you. Good morning. My first question on Evan follows up on your response to the
last question. You guys are getting a lot of price,14% within your North America

Page 9 of 18

FINAL

commercial book picked up pretty nicely from where you guys were last quarter. Can you
just give us a sense of where loss trend is within that business? And just, as we think, and I
recognize you gave us some guidance on the premium side and you don't like to give
forward guidance, but as we think about price up in the teens and depending upon where
you're loss trend is, just trying to get a sense of the potential for margin improvement
within that North America commercial book?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No, I understand. And, Elyse, I'm not going to give you much satisfaction in that question.
We don't give forward guidance on that, as you know. And I'm going to rest on the
statement that in most commercial lines areas, we are, not all but most, we are achieving
rate in excess of loss cost trend which is reasonable to achieve a proper risk adjusted
return in those classes and it is needed.
As far as where the exact frequency and severity of loss is and trend is over the last
number of months, it's very difficult to tell and we measure it typically quarterly. But at this
point, we measure it monthly. And because of the economic shut down, you really can't
see what the actual is though it's lower. We do though price on anticipation of reversion to
the mean as the economy opens back up and activity returns to normal. And I think I'm
going to leave it at that, Elyse.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. And I had a couple of other numbers question related to North
America commercial. The last couple of Q2s you guys had some LPTs on the book that do
typically lead to higher loss ratios. Was there any LPTs on the book this second quarter?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

There were. And as you know, we write LPTs virtually most quarters. It's just the amount of
it varies by quarter. And this quarter, we did have LPTs as we do in most quarters.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

And it was within a reasonable range of what we wrote last year in the second quarter.
Last year was a pretty big quarter for LPT. This year, we wrote a number of transactions as
well.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And then within North America commercial, your retention went up to 84.5%
[ph]. It had been trending in the high 70s. Was there anything specific to the second
quarter or just as we think about maybe kind of a change in retention in terms of that
book on a go-forward basis?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No, it's more of, the difference this quarter I would attribute more to a change of mix of
business and what we wrote then, than I would to a major shift in the retention net to
gross.

And next we'll hear from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hey guys, good morning. I guess, following up on that last one in North America
commercial, there's clearly some cross currency area, the structured transactions, some
COVID frequency benefits, but there is about 0.7 points of year-over-year, underlying loss
ratio improvement. Evan, is that a fair representation of what you think the relationship is
right now between rate and loss trend? Maybe, around that point, 0.7 points in North
America commercial or is it higher than that you think moving forward?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

As I said, Ryan, I'm not going to prognosticate future. We just don't provide guidance that
way. I made a couple of comments that I think they're probably important to you. Number
one, that we are achieving rate next in aggregate, in excess of loss cost trend. Secondly,
we are -- we haven't noticed a major change in trend, but on the other hand, you know
you're masked by all of the COVID-related impact. Number three, we have COVIDrelated benefit from the economic shut down given the period of greater uncertainty
we're in, we are very slow and fundamentally haven't recognized good news, while we
took what we think is a reserve to ultimate for COVID-related losses.
And so, in this period of time, I think you're -- and it is our policy. We were conservative in
our underwriting and we're conservative in our balance sheet management. And in
periods of great uncertainty, it puts a point on what is our normal policy to recognize bad
news early and if there is favorable news to recognize it in a prudent way late.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Understood. I guess my follow up is can you just talk a little bit about the COVID charge
that you took? It's obviously conservative. If you ever have to add to it, what do you think
the reason would be? Would it be another outbreak later in the year? Like, give us a sense
of why, the degree of conservatism around that loss [ph] selection? Thanks.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

We didn't do it in a conservative way. We pitched it right up the middle. We modeled what
we think and we took from what we know of that others, economists will project from
various organizations. We projected what we think the economic patterns are going to
look like. We projected what we think from the best we know at the time, what the health
situation is and will be and how the two work together. And therefore based on all the
information we know today, we modeled both top down and bottom up particularly shorttail losses, longer tail, you have to model more top down and based on what we know of
prior events and history and how things work, and so, we used all that based on the
picture of economic and health as we can see it going forward from this pandemic event
to project a loss to ultimate.
Did we get it precisely right? God knows. And is there risk around it? Of course, there is,
because you tell me, whats' the next six or nine months precisely going to look like. No
one knows. There is great uncertainty. But we did our best within uncertain times to try to
reflect the ultimate loss on our balance sheet, our liabilities.

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

Good morning and I hope you all are well. I was wondering if you could talk about how the
business interruption claim issue has evolved not necessarily just in the US but outside the
US. It looks like to me at least that the courts are trending in the industry favor so far in the
US, but I don't have a great sense of how that's happening outside the US and how that
might differ from the US.

Yes, Paul, it's very early days. The UK, for example, as you know, when you're following,
I'm sure is in a process that is very interesting where the regulator has stepped in and to
avoid like we have in the US, just a free for all of lawsuits and a waste of expense and
time and money. They've kind of stepped in and are acting to represent the
policyholders, all of their arguments, in one place before a panel of judges with the
industry presenting its arguments and that one is going to unfolds and it's a very rational
process. And by the way, if you haven't followed it, I would tell you, it really is worth doing.
It's admirable how they're doing about it.
And that will unfold over a period of time and come to a conclusion if I recollect properly
by around year-end.
In other countries such as Australia, et cetera, it's bubbling and you have a number of
court cases that are just proceeding to test the veracity of the wordings that are against
regulation that is quite different than in the United States. And then where the most
activity is, and that will be on the longest, most prolonged period of time to resolve is in
the United States.

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

My second question. We've seen a lot of rate increases in the reinsurance business. I was
wondering if the changing market environment had changed your view on the fairly
narrow approach you take in the reinsurance business overall?

FINAL

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yes. In the main, we're pretty steady about it. We buy reinsurance fundamentally to be
able to provide limits of liability beyond what we want to expose our balance sheet to. We
buy it for protection of volatility where it makes sense. We measure all reinsurance. So we
do it for fundamental business purposes and we buy reinsurance in a manner where we
measure the risk reward and the proper risk adjusted pricing as what we're willing to pay
for protection.
And so, those fundamental principles lead to a pretty steady approach. At the same time,
obviously, when rates are not adequate to earn a reasonable risk-adjusted return, we
shrink exposure as a company. When rates are adequate to earn a proper risk-adjusted
return and may increase to a point where they justify greater volatility, we will increase our
net exposures. And we do that alongside how we purchase reinsurance.

I'm sorry. I was thinking more about the actual reinsurance business that you have and
whether you might be interested in (inaudible).

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yes. I got it. Yes. We are more active and in our reinsurance business, it
is a greater growth area for Chubb now. We have like our E&S business, particularly in
London, where we have been disciplined and shrunk for a number of years, because we
were getting paid to take risk. We are getting paid more adequately take risk and in a
number of classes, and that is growing by the quarter. And therefore, we are leaning into
that.
And our reinsurance business, from what we can tell today, we'll continue to expand as
we go forward.

Q - Gregory Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Good morning. Just FYI, Evan, there is a little bit of feedback that we're hearing
throughout the call. So I'm not sure what's going on there.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

Can you still hear the answers? And can you still hear well enough though to get the
information?

Q - Gregory Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Yes, yes. It's coming through. Its just there is -- it's just, there is a little feedback
somewhere in the system. So, in your prepared remarks, you offered to have some of the
other executives provide some commentary around conditions, pricing, et cetera, in the
respective segments of the business, and I was wondering if you could follow through
with that offer?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Love to. Thank you for asking. I'm going to start with John Lupica on major and specialty.
And then I'm going to have Paul Krump do middle market.

A - John Lupica

{BIO 4213297 <GO>}

Sure. Thank you, Evan. And thank you, Greg. Let me give you a little more color on what
we're seeing in major and specialty. I'll start really with rate and premium retention. In our
major portfolio, we're looking at over 16 points of pure rate increase in Westchester. Our
E&S business, we're looking at 18 points of rate increase. And in Bermuda, our high access
business, as you know, we're looking at 40 points of rate increase.
And when I break that down, and so, just some segments on the retail side, our primary
casualty risk management business is getting some of its best rate in the history of the
organization at 8 [ph] points rate and the adjusted premium retention ratio of 97.5% when
I take into account one large front to trade [ph].
In our excess casualty book, we are getting 48 points of rate and achieving a 111 points of
premium retention. And as Evan noted in our property business, we're getting 21 points of
rate with 109 points of pure premium retention.
And in our financial lines again another note in the retail business that Evan had 18 point of
rate and 103 points of premium retention. And we're seeing the same in our E&S lines of
Page 14 of 18

business. Our property business is getting 18 point of rate with 103 points of premium
retention. Casualty book is getting 31 points of rate, with 87 points of premium retention.
And our financial lines is getting 17 points of rate. So as you can see pretty healthy rate
environment, the premium retention inside of the retail and E&S marketplace.

Paul Krump?

A - Paul J. Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

Yes. Hi, Greg. Good morning. I'll start out with the mono prop [ph] that Evan mentioned
getting over 18 points of rate there. Our retention in that line of business is 95%, so just
excellent. As respect to package, we're getting 6 points of rate and 97% retention. In our
excess umbrella, we're getting over 20 points of pure rate increase and 94% retention.
Auto has got 11 points of rate on it in the last quarter, 99% retention. And our professional
lines as Evan mentioned is at 14.5, and there, we're getting 98 points of retention.

Bloomberg Transcript

As respects terms and conditions as briefly I tell you that obviously a lot of these rate
increases were tightening terms and conditions. I'd say, in particular, we're pleased with
where deductibles are going and how much they have increased. We've also been able to
trim down some of the sub limits for the cat perils of flood and quake, as well on the
excess umbrella, we've been working on attachment points and that's been going
extremely well also.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

There you go, Greg, more than you ever asked for.

Q - Gregory Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Well, it's never enough. If you take all of those businesses that were just summarized with
rather robust rates, what percentage of the total premium are we talking about just to put
this in perspective, because not all of your business is getting these type of rate
increases?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

When I add in the international areas that are in a similar hard [ph] market conditions, it's
over 50% of our premiums, globally. That means all the business, not just commercial
P&C. It means of our total business.

Q - Gregory Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And then, obviously, it begs the question when we're hearing about the
substantial rate increases, what's the commercial customer response to this because this
is far exceeding inflation trends with the rest of their business and a lot of your
commercial customers are experiencing pressures because of COVID and the economic

Page 15 of 18

slowdown or whatever you want to call it? I have to believe you're getting a lot of
customer push back or maybe you could give us some perspective around that.

FINAL

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

We're not. We're actually -- there is a lot of goodwill between us and customers. Look,
why is this occurring? Because loss cost trends, even when they're benign have far
exceeded premium rates charged for a prolonged period of time. Rates have gone in
one direction while loss costs have continued to rise. And so, industry results overall are
severely elevated and many lines of business just were so inadequate in pricing and it
varied by company. If you were trying to gain market share at that time, well, it's coming
home to roost and it will continue to come home to roost for a period of time. If you were
more disciplined and shrunk exposure at that time, then it had less impact on you.
But rates are now moving in a direction where over time they'll achieve adequacy. And
there are lines were adequacy is achieved. And there are lines were given loss cost
trends and then you have on top of that, things like social inflation that have exacerbated
trends means that rates need to continue to move higher.

Bloomberg Transcript

The other dynamic about all of that is that companies are pulling back and capacity is less
available. Chubb is stepping up. We're offering capacity. We're consistent to our
customers that we're there. We're not in and out. We've been consistently speaking to
our customers that, you know what, this is not going to last, the good times of of rates
going down or premiums going down is irrational and it's not going to last and that we will
remain consistent. It's the market that will wane and wax. Well, they understand and see
that.
And by the way, as we can get more adequately paid and as capacity has shrunk, we've
actually stepped up with bigger lines and bigger solutions and more creative solutions to
customers. And so we're consistent in that service. And during this shutdown period,
there is no company that has been more available to dialog and to be on the front line
with customers and respond on a moment's notice globally than has Chubb.
So I would actually say our reputation and our image in all of this and the goodwill with
customers has been building. And yes, I understand the notion that insurance pricing is
going up, when all of this is going along with COVID, but that trend, which is very rational
was occurring before COVID ever began and to deploy the capital, you've got to get paid
adequately. And capital, risk capital is precious.

And we will take our final question from David Motemaden with Evercore. Please go
ahead.

FINAL

Q - David Motemaden

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning. Just a quick numbers question on the current accident year loss
ratio ex-cat and North America commercial. Just in the past you've talked about the
impact that some of these large structured transactions have had on the loss ratio. I think
in 2018-2019, in those second quarters it was around 100 basis points of an elevation in
the loss ratio. Just wondering how I should think about that impact this quarter within
North America commercial?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yes, it had an impact on it. I can't give you an exact basis point number. It's one of those,
so we could probably take it offline with you. But it had -- we wrote LPTs fairly consistent in
the neighborhood of what we wrote in aggregate last year. And they have an elevated
impact on them [ph].

A - Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

Year-on-year revenue [ph] impact was 70 basis points.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Phil.

Q - David Motemaden

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Great. Thanks, Evan and Phil. That's helpful. And then just a question. So the recent GOP
stimulus that includes some liability shields for businesses and health care providers, just
wondering how you're thinking about this, how important this is for you and the industry
and outside of this going through, just wondering what sort of underwriting actions you're
taking to mitigate the future liability claims that you may be getting?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I think that this kind of liability Safe Harbor that the Republicans are proposing as part of
the bill is so important for our nation. We have -- we right now confront such economic
headwinds toggling between trying to manage the health crisis and open up an economy.
And the burden on business, all businesses throughout the United States today is
extreme.
To add on to them the additional expense and burden of liability exposure when, for
those who are practicing the right protocols and protecting their employees and
customers and in trying to open up the economy, to ascribe to them, the burden of
liability and cause them to be more cautious or foist on them an additional economic
expense, and which ultimately benefits frankly one industry and that is the legal
profession, the trial bar, I think would be a travesty and a shame.

FINAL

And I think that is the wisdom to try to remove some of that and create certainty for
business in an environment of tremendous uncertainty. And not only do we applaud it, we
support it actively as a company, and not for the benefit of the insurance industry, to the
benefit of all of our society right now. We need to open up this economy. We need to
control this health crisis better than we are, and my God not believe that living at home
and working from home is the new normal for America. It doesn't make any sense to me.
With that, thank you very much.
