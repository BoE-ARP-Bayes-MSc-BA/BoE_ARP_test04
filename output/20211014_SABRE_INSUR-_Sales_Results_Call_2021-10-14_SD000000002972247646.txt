Okay. Thanks.

Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

All right. Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this Q3
trading update, not a thing we normally do. But it feels to us like we're just emerging from
a period of fairly unprecedented change and a bit of chaos. It's quite a long time until the
end of March, when we'll be doing our next full update.
So we thought it was pretty worth doing a bit of context for the trading results. We've
announced today a bit of looking backwards, a bit of looking forwards, give you as usual
our views on how the markets developing. We've only got 10 or so slides, and then time
for Q&A at the end.
The results context, our view continuing stock market, head of the FCA pricing reforms,
our view of market prices continue to lag claims inﬂation. We've experienced I think
probably had experience to be a better context or better tense here, a material temporary
reduction in our normal addressable market, that was due primarily to the impact of
COVID-19, reducing the ﬂow of drivers and delays in new car registrations.

FINAL

We are being rigorous in applying our strategy. We continue to treat volume as an output.
We haven't let go of our disciplined approach to pricing. We continue to be a volume as
the output, not the target.
We've written at the top end of our normal combined operating range. That's a deliberate
policy to optimize the proﬁt and volume mix. That's given us a natural short-term
reduction in premiums and knock-on eﬀect earnings. But we've done that deliberately to
protect the medium and long-term health of the business. I think we'll start to beneﬁt from
that in the fairly near future.
I would say we are very satisﬁed with our current volumes and margins as we sit here
today but new business volumes are pretty good. In some ways, the renewed -- the
premium is partly driven by the lack of renewal premium from business we haven't been
in previous periods.
Just for those you might not have read the INS [ph], Im sure thats nobody, these were the
numbers. I won't repeat these. You've obviously read them already this morning.

Bloomberg Transcript

I guess the ﬁrst bit of context here is that we think traﬃc levels are now pretty much back
to normal. Theres some time of day diﬀerences in terms of how rush hours work, but
fundamentally, traﬃc volume is now back to normal. I would say it's questionable if market
prices are yet reﬂecting this.
This is probably a really key slide for us, and perhaps, more important for us than some
other of our competitors. This is the monthly driving test passed as went through in '19
and through the pandemic. You can see normally around 140,000 tests a month and just
under half of that -- around half of that are passes.
If you look at the -- for lockdown period, it's a collapse in new driving tests, and therefore
new drivers entering the market. If you look at the blue line, at the far right-hand side,
you'll see that's now back in terms of test passed. Its somewhere like a normal run rate.
Well that's not doing the course is clearing out the backlog for people who haven't
passed over the last year or so. So , good sort of BIU position but not yet, and I don't see
how that will immediately clear out the -- clear out the back log.
Another big thing is new car registrations. If you look at the sort of the line here is
probably the best one. That shows the year-to-date sales across the last few years. You
can see this is new car registrations, a distinct drop in car registrations in '21 and indeed
'20.
So car purchases tend to be a prompt to shop around. It shows have diﬀerent views
clearly on the relative risk of cars. So , changing cars tends to be a prompt to shop around
for policies.

FINAL

Claims inﬂation. These are graphs we've shown before. The top left shows the average
increase in car parts. The right-hand side shows the year-on-year care cost inﬂation.
Signiﬁcant inﬂation numbers in here. We see no reasons to suspect that claims inﬂations,
any less than our 7.5% to 8.5% range we've discussed before.
I would say our view is if anything claims inﬂation could get slightly worse. I would say I
think claims inﬂation is not a bad thing. Divide new price for it. Claims inﬂation gives you
top line growth, provide new cover in pricing. But what's clearly a very bad thing is if you
don't cover it. A couple of bits one relatively hot oﬀ the press is the MIB Levy has just
been announced, which is a 21% increase for 2022. That impacts all insurers equally.
Used car valuations, as you might know are currently sky high. That clearly will have a
knock through the total loss and theft claims. That's probably more of a temporary
inﬂationary increase the margin perhaps spoke into the long-term.
Absolute evidence coming through our care worker shortages and wage inﬂation in that
market. If you watch the BBC News last night, they were talking about over 100,000
vacancies for care workers in the U.K. and a real struggle to ﬁnd care workers at all, never
mind the wage inﬂation that sits with that.

Bloomberg Transcript

And what we think is going to be merged is pressure on repair network, people who
actually ﬁx the cars. A lot of skilled laborers, skilled painters, were from Europe. So me of
those might not have returned on ball up return (inaudible).
Then, of course there's pressure on the less skilled roles in terms of validators car,
perhaps car delivery people. I think all the things we read about in the wider economy,
about pressure on labor is equally well applied into that repair network.
So we could see pressure coming what we think we will see pressure coming through in
the repair network as well. The important thing for us is all of these things are in our
minds, all of these things we are pricing for, as we sit here today.
If that all sounds a bit gloomy, that's really not the way we feel about life at the moment.
We have absolutely gritted our teeth and sacriﬁce volume in this recent diﬃcult market in
order to maintain discipline. We think we will very shortly start to reap the beneﬁts of that.
So we've maintained our pricing discipline within that 75 to 80% range. We're going to try
and demonstrate the year-on-year position to you today but actually, it's incredibly
diﬃcult to do. Why is that diﬃcult to do? We've got claims inﬂation that we've covered.
We think we've covered fully.
You've got the temporary lockdown period discounts, where we reduced our prices
temporarily to reﬂect a lot of claims frequency during lockdowns. Then the discounts that
have been applied for the Ministry of Justice whiplash beneﬁts.

FINAL

So I think anyone trying to equate average premium increases to price changes is going
to be setting themselves an impossible task at this point. I think what we can say is we are
seeking and we believe we had continued to price in our normal range taking all these
factors into account.
This is a really important one, I think quote volumes do the big for aggregators or price
comparison websites. If you look at the two dips there during lockdown periods,
signiﬁcant, over 20% down in terms of -- these are compared back to 2019, which is
probably the last normal year, we can think of.
Here, look at '20, there was a massive bounce back in quote volumes straight after the
ﬁrst lockdown. We haven't really seen that in '21. But what we have seen is a return to
broadly ﬂat quote volumes across those big aggregators.
I think this is quite important. I think it lets the bit of steam out of the competitiveness in
the market. We suspect some of our competitors, you have lower volume in the market,
therefore, you're discounting your prices even more strongly to try and chase that lower
volume.

Bloomberg Transcript

That's not a game we played. We maintain discipline through here. So as quote volumes
returned to normal, I suspect for some people that might take out some of the pricing
pressures.
Pricing policy change. Actually, we've been growing quite nicely during the Third Quarter.
If I look at the last four or ﬁve weeks, we've been growing consistently between 500 and a
thousand policies a week over the last four or ﬁve weeks. That's despite putting on price
increases during this period.
So actually, we're feeling pretty encouraged at the motion to get price increase as a way
as not adversely impacting our volumes. As I mentioned earlier, a new business ﬂow is
looking pretty good at the moment.
So I think quite an encouraging picture that we are growing as we head towards the end
of this year and into next year, and that's before we see any signiﬁcant price -- market
price changes for the for the FCA market reform.
I guess overall, having gritted our teeth and taken the pain of the last 18 months or so,
within the outlook is looking pretty rosy at the moment. We've taken the hard decisions
on acetylate volume go, which is exactly in line with our most successful long-term
strategy.
We think we're going to see natural growth as market pricing corrects. The reﬂection of
the FCA price would be our pricing view changes and our addressable market returning
to normal.

FINAL

Alongside that, I guess we've got what you might call some self-help initiatives. The ﬂex
product will come online, which we discussed over here, will come online in the next few
weeks, but also working on two or three other fairly signiﬁcant development initiatives, all
of which we can fund from existing capital, all of which we'd expect to have fairly nearterm beneﬁts to earnings rather than an earnings drag for a period.
I'm sure all of them are cut oﬀ, but we're pretty conﬁdent at least a couple will. We'll talk
about those at the four-year results in March. We do see some signs of tentative market
price increases. I saw the confused survey came out an hour or two ago, which shows a
decline in the sort of price job. I think what we're seeing is we're able to put prices up in
our part of the market at this point.
So we are, if anything, this feels a bit like January 2020, which was when we ﬁrst thought
the market was starting to turn pre-COVID. We don't want to call it a market turn at this
point, but we are in a slightly unusual niche.
And these are only a few weeks before (inaudible) things feel -- there's tentative increases
that feels reasonably positive. We haven't seen any structure market changes or any
signiﬁcant competitors moving into our space that undermines our ambitions or strategy
here at all.

Bloomberg Transcript

So I guess in summary, as we move into 2020, we anticipate the COVID disruptions
starting to move into the rearview mirror. We've maintained our price discipline, and we
expect to beneﬁt from that as natural price increases come through the FCA price and
reforms starts to buy and from our own development initiatives.
The key message drive in the guidance change today is at the expense ratio is a bit high,
pending growth coming through to absorb that. We're still going to deliver a great loss
ratio, I think it's fair to say by their historical and absolute terms.
Our view at this point is the ﬁrst half was spectacular. Q3, Q4, as we expect is going to be
great, but putting not spectacular, and we just wanted to do a bit more guidance that we
do expect to be towards the upper end of that combined ratio for this year.
I think that's probably all I wanted to say at this point. Thank you for listening. I think now if
we can use the raise hands option, Adam, you will come to people and invite them to ask
questions.

Questions And Answers
A - Adam Westwood

{BIO 20481660 <GO>}

Yes, that's right. So if you could raise your hands to ask the question, I will then allow you
to talk, how you can mute yourself and ask the question, and then I'll try and progress to
meet you again. We do have a Q&A text function as well, if you want to type your
questions in there. So let's go right ahead. First, we have a question from Greg Preston
[ph].

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Hi. How you doing? I think you're on mute.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant

FINAL

Can you hear me?

A - Adam Westwood

{BIO 20481660 <GO>}

Yes. We can now, loud and clear.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
It could cost [ph] me three questions. Could you give us a number for your -- during
premium rate increases on average during the Third Quarter?
Second question is, we said the building levels will be supported by the strength of
capital position. Does that mean that the total dividend declared in 2021 will be ﬂat yearon-year versus 20?
Then, ﬁnally, in your half year presentation, you noted damage to personal accident
claims were 55 to 45. I was wondering if that is potentially going to change in 2022, postCOVID. What will be the implications for claims inﬂation? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Yes, that's right. I'll take those in reverse order, if that's okay. In terms of the personal
injury to damage claims, this is quite an interesting question. As you may know, the MHA
Whiplash Reforms on our life with the new portal.
I think we've paid a grand total of nine claims for that new portal so far. We are seeing a
reduction in the number of PII claims coming through. Our view would be they're at the
lower value end. So past claims that may have been speculative in the old regime.
I think it's been early to say exactly where those numbers are going to settle. It's going to
take a few more months to get clarity on how much that's changed around the severity
and the frequency of the PI claims.
On the dividend, I think you can see we're still generating capital, we're still going to have
a strong capital range. I think when we get to March and April next year, we have the
ability support a dividend that is a very attractive level. We'll be balancing that against
whether we need any more capital to support the growth initiatives that we're also
looking at.
But I think we have an ability to support the very attractive dividend they're still. The year
one premium position, we can't get the year-on-year for reasons about uneasily growth.
We could happily take that oﬄine.

What I can tell you is we've put on several points of rate increase in the last couple of
months, more than we would perhaps have expected to allocate the money that's
covering -- that's coming, we think potentially worsening claims inﬂation, rather than
improving the margin.

FINAL

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
So you're not putting through, you haven't made any adjustments for frequency as you
did in the ﬁrst half of the year.

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

No. We think we've priced appropriately for the emoji [ph] changes that we foresee.
That's the -- a slight reduction in frequency, but we don't know where severity will go yet.
It's going to be a while before we take any bigger steps around that.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Thank you.

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Okay. That's great.

A - Adam Westwood

{BIO 20481660 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Great. So , the next question is from Alex Evans [ph].

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Hi, Alex. Hi there.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Great. So just on the combined ratio. So basically, you're saying towards the upper end of
that range. I think previously at half year you said that next year is going to be worse
essentially. How do we think about that? Or is the risk that you go out of the upper end, is
that 8% target? And just how we should think about that.
Then I think the other thing on basically pricing. I think it was one keyway you said there
was green shoots, and we're still seeing it not materially harden. What are the main
catalysts that you see for this to happen then? And why is it been so depressed in your
view?

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Okay. Again I'll take those in reverse order. Adam, maybe you can take the core one from
the second. I think the green shoots. We're being very careful not to call the market turn
here today. Because I don't think we're in that position yet.

Page 7 of 17



Company Name: Sabre Insurance Group PLC
Company Ticker: SBRE LN Equity
Date: 2021-10-14

What we are seeing is in our part of the market and ability to put through some price
increases without adversely impacting our new business volume. That might be unique to
our part of the market, rather than the wider -- a wider issue.

FINAL

I think that's probably the main thing there. I think on the core, Adam, I don't think we
expect to be at the top.

A - Adam Westwood

{BIO 20481660 <GO>}

Yes. I think we'd be very cautious on the core guidance for next year, because we don't
expect to have the same kind of frequency beneﬁts that we're seeing in the ﬁrst half of
this year, which could be a negative core at the same time, we might hope that growth
might spur a reduction in say expense ratio. Or indeed, if a market term does come
through, then we'll be able to put prices on, which could bring the loss ratio down.
So we're cautious about guiding. We've warned that it might tip up above where it is this
year. But there's a lot of this year's going and quite a lot of next year as well. So some -just a note of caution on next year's CLR, relative to this year (inaudible) on that.

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

I think it was a question -- a part of your question I didn't answer. Do you mind (inaudible)
I skipped over?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Yes. It was just on sort of what the key catalysts are for pricing turning given that
everything that you've addressed with claims inﬂation, frequency, that were still not really
seeing that for the market.

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

I think -- I think there's two things. One is that no quotes have been suppressed. No quote
volumes in the market have been suppressed. That feels like it's coming back together.
I guess the ﬁnal one is the FCA pricing review. Well we know the world is going to look
diﬀerent as we go ﬂuid into next year. I don't think anyone knows exactly how. I think
everyone's looking at each other. There's all sorts of game theories being played out.
There's all sorts of strategies being put together.
I haven't met many people who don't think that a combination of claims inﬂation and the
FCA pricing review isn't going to lead at least a double digit increase in price as we go
into next year.
And I will see where -- we'll see where that goes. We'll carry on doing our thing. And at
the moment, that seem to be working okay as we come through the Third Quarter.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Page 8 of 17



Company Name: Sabre Insurance Group PLC

Date: 2021-10-14

Thanks, Geoﬀ [ph]. Can I just follow up as well, if there's any sort of diﬀerence in activity
that you've seen bits between the more mass market level and some of the more nonstandard risk level.

FINAL

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

I guess I don't like to work the mass market because I'm not -- we don't track it as intently
as others will do. What we are seeing, for example, is our price competitiveness on our
broker panels, increasing -- or continue to increase quite signiﬁcantly.
So that's the number of times you have big brokers, where the cheapest price they can
ﬁnd amongst all the insurers they deal with. At the low point, that was probably down at
about 4%. As we sit here today that's probably near eight or 9%. So , we're becoming
generally more competitive across the ﬁeld in the broker market.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Okay. Thank you very much, guys.

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Adam Westwood

{BIO 20481660 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And so it's -- the next question is from Meng Zhu [ph]. Oh, I think I was surprised to do to
(inaudible). So rry, mate. There we go.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Hi. Good morning. Could you hear me?

A - Adam Westwood

{BIO 20481660 <GO>}

We can loud and clear.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Thank you. First question -- I have three questions, please. First is your net earned
premium is down since -- it's down greater than your gross written premium. I'm trying to
ﬁgure out your gross return amounts, how much that reduced last year and then month's
year-to-date? So I couldn't ﬁgure out why there's some more. It's because you bought
more reinsurance and -- or any other reasons.
And my second question is that you mentioned your new growth and initiatives. I think
Geoﬀ, on the earlier in the presentation mentioned that this will be funded using existing
capital. I think at the same time, he also said, that's enough capital to support the
attractive and dividends.

Page 9 of 17

FINAL

So I'm just trying to get a bit more color in terms of, ﬁrst, when would you using that? And
second is, when you say support attractive dividends, I think so far historically ordinary
plus special, you've been around 100% payout special. I mean is that what we should
continue to look at going forward?
And yes, my ﬁrst question is that you're -- I think pre-pandemic you've said your market is
about three -- a three quarter now standard, one quarter a mass market. Could you just
give some color in terms of where do you see the fast recovery for Sabre? Thank you.

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Yes, sure. Okay. Thanks. Again I'll take those in reverse order because I hadn't time to
build up the net on premium question. I think in the proportion of non-standard,
standard, I think that where we would view growth coming from is probably the fringes of
the mass market as we describe it.
So the higher average premium, actually moving slightly more towards the mass market,
as market prices increase, that's where our prices then become more competitive. So , we
haven't really seen any intrusion of it onto our non-standard book.

Bloomberg Transcript

In fact, if anything, we're seeing increases and inquiries there (inaudible) footballers at the
moment, for example, which historically we've not necessarily seen, high average
premium, not bad risks.
So I think we'll see the growth people on the fringes of the mass market will be my take,
which is why average premium won't necessarily reﬂect as we grow because some of that
might be at a slightly lower average premium.
The new growth initiatives, we believe nothing here involves as (inaudible) take on debt
or seek external funding. We can manage this from internal resources, depends how
much growth we have the opportunity to take there on the ﬂex products I will launch in
the next month or so.
Other products will probably be maybe halfway through next year. We'll just have a look
at as we go into March, how much we think we should hold back a bit of capital, how
much we can -- we can fund on the dividends.
We have paid out 100%. I think we've always been very clear. We're prepared to use the
capital range to pay more than that potential if we need to. Adam, do you want to pick up
from there?

A - Adam Westwood

{BIO 20481660 <GO>}

Yes. Another premium point, I'll answer it high-level now. If you want to go into more
detail working through them, then we can take it oﬄine. The short answer is we had a
slight reinsurance cost increase on the ﬁrst of July.

Page 10 of 17



Company Name: Sabre Insurance Group PLC
Company Ticker: SBRE LN Equity
Date: 2021-10-14

So that will obviously feed through to net premium in Q3. Other than that, it's really a
function of when the written premium was written and having that earned across the
year's period, that there isn't much more to it than that. So it's just -- we take level of detail
later, but that's the high level view.

FINAL

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Thank you.

A - Adam Westwood

{BIO 20481660 <GO>}

Great. Thank you, Meng. Now, we have a question from Tom Bateman [ph]. Tom.

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Tom, hi.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Hi. Morning, Adam, morning, Geoﬀ. I'm just trying to get a bit more of a feel for how the
book looks. So , can you give us a number or a split of, like, what portion is new drivers?
What is non-standard? What is standard? What are used cars, new cars, those type of
things? And what they look like now and what would they look like maybe in a year's time,
if pricing does harden materially?

Bloomberg Transcript

And just on the these new initiatives, how material are these? Can you put a number on
how big they might become over the next 12 to 24 months?

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Thank you. Yes. I mean yes, I could give you spill on young drivers, new drivers and
things, but I'm not going to touch it. I want to tell our competitors either. I think -- I think
what we can say for example, is we would over index our young drivers, we believe,
compared to other competitors.
Now, that's not necessarily just young drivers buying their own car, it's young drivers
being added on to parent's cars, for example. So , we know on certain partnerships,
where one of the few people who will insure younger drivers on certain of their parents,
cars.
So the combinations on between buying their own car and been added to a parent's car,
for example. New drivers, in some ways, it's not quite the new car registrations, it's to
trickle down into the secondhand car market. So , we know a lot of those cars haven't
come back in stock levels.
Secondhand cars have been low at the moment or have been very low. So , I think in
some ways, it's got trickled down from new cars and secondhand cars, which prompts the
buying -- the buying decision.

FINAL

On the new initiatives, I mean the ﬂex product that there's -- this looks like a growing
market. We haven't set ourselves a target, because we don't want to chase a number that
might not be attainable. We think it could be reasonably signiﬁcant. A few million
perhaps.
Other ones might be more. I think we're in a similar place. We're not going to move at all
the way around to the right, but we wouldn't be doing them brilliant if they could have a
meaningful impact on our -- on our premium levels.
So we'll happily talk to you about them as they go live. So me of them there might be
more deﬁnite targets. The ﬂex product is test and learn and see where it can take us.
Adam, do you want to answer those questions?

A - Adam Westwood

{BIO 20481660 <GO>}

No. I think you have that well covered, Geoﬀ.

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. (inaudible) Tom.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Yes, no. We're good. Thank you.

Thanks, Tom. We're now going to Nick Johnson [ph] please.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Hi. Morning, everybody. Just one question actually on the combined ratio. Obviously it's
good you've managed to keep it in the range. Just wondering what you're assuming for
reserve releases and guidance. It's only signiﬁcant coming through to expect from the low
frequency last year, or is that now already fully booked n numbers? Thanks.

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Adam, do you want to take that one?

A - Adam Westwood

{BIO 20481660 <GO>}

Yes. So , our reserving methodology remains exactly the same as it always has been. So ,
we reserve through assessment for the -- for the consistent management margin on top.
That hasn't changed. So we've talked about reserve releases, reverting to a normal BAU
runoﬀ rate, which was just over half of where it would have been during the 2018, '19
period.

Page 12 of 17



Company Name: Sabre Insurance Group PLC

We saw reserve releases come oﬀ further than that last year. We explained by at the time
that it happened. So all else being equal, I wouldn't expect what has happened in the last
couple of years to have a material impact on reserve releases either way.

FINAL

I -- that we would expect that normal run rate of I think I call it some four to 5% coming
through in future years. Clearly that subject to some degree of changes as time goes on.
But that's where our guidance is at the moment.

Thanks, Nick. Okay. We have a very similar question from Eva [ph] who's come through on
the text, which covers reserve releases. So I think we've just answered that. And has also
asked whether you're given indication of what growth should be possible to say the next
year, if indeed the market crash and he covers the claims inﬂation.

Yes. I mean we want to be cautious here and not overcall this. So , we think it could be -- if
we look back into our history, at the last time the market turned in what 2015, '16, Adam?
We saw a growth of 15 or 20%, come through earlier. That's possible. It could be much
more subdued.
It really depends how much the market reacts to the SEO pricing review. We will continue
to price for proﬁt. We were happy to accept as much volume as we can ride of those -- of
those margins, I think is fair to say.

Thanks, Geoﬀ. Thank you for your patience, everyone, with your hand up. We have a
question from Ben Cove [ph].

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Hi. Good morning. Hi, hi. Yes. Could I ask -- could I ask two things? Firstly, just on the -- on
the expense side, you mentioned that -- I think you said the key reason that the combined
ratio this year is going to disappoint is because the impact of volumes on ﬁxed expenses,
I guess.
Could you say what you're doing to manage those ﬁxed expenses? Are there any changes
that we should make in terms of underlying expenses? Will you just look to hold those ﬂat
regardless of volume?
And the second question was just to follow up on the reserve release points in terms of
claims inﬂation. What levels of general inﬂation do you think we would need to be
worried about risk to prior releases?

Because presumably, where you -- where you've set a management view, a margin in
there, if prior years don't develop in the way that you were thinking about, there could be
some risks onto that. Thank you.

FINAL

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Yes, sure. I mean on the expenses, I guess we run a pretty lean operation anyway. There's
certain costs we can't do much about. We can't do much about the MIB Levies. We can't
do much about some of the PLC costs, I guess.
We have deliberately maintained our stock levels and overstock level in claims. One, we
think it's the right thing to do. Secondly, we are conﬁdent we're going to grow back into
that headcount.
Last time, we grew heavily was back in '15, '16. We were able to turn away business
because we didn't have the capability and our clients seem to handle the volume that we
saw coming. We don't want to be in a position this time where we're having to turn away
volume because we don't think we can handle the clients.
So that and, I think the fact we're maintaining probably a 30% overstaﬃng level in clients
gives you a view of that. We think over the next few years, we're going to grow back into
that headcount. Adam, on the inﬂation side, anything else on expenses you want to add?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Adam Westwood

{BIO 20481660 <GO>}

No. Expenses were covered. I think on inﬂation and the impact on reserves. Clearly, when
we -- when we sell our reserves, we do have an assumed inﬂation in there, and that
inﬂation will be consistent with the view that we use to pricing.
And therefore, a material deviation from the numbers that we've been talking about today
could inﬂuence where we are on reserves. We think we have the appropriate amount of
cautious on those inﬂation assumptions. So , getting -- it would have to be relatively
material deviation, as I said, that is possible. Similarly, if inﬂation is better than we expect,
that -- that's also possible to have an impact.

Hi, mate.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant

FINAL

Hello, there. I just got one less actually that hasn't been asked before. So in your press
release, you talked about three tailwinds -- pricing tailwinds, which should beneﬁt you
going forward.
And I just wondered if you could put any weighting on the three. I presume the FCA
pricing review will be the most likely to beneﬁt yourselves, but also cost inﬂation and the
reversal of COVID discounts. I just wondered how you saw it in terms of the weighting of
the importance of those three, please.

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Sure. I would say probably cost inﬂation and FCA prices, if you're going to get jumbled
together would be my -- I think it'd be quite diﬃcult to pick apart the impacts from both.
I would say I don't think anyone believes claims inﬂation has not been running through. I
don't think anyone believes necessarily that the whole market has been keeping track of
that claims inﬂation. So there must be a correction to come there.

Bloomberg Transcript

The SEO part of you, I'm sure we're going to see all sorts of strategies coming out as we
go into next year. I think -- I think those two together, they will be so that they're going to
be combined into the increase we see going into next year. I'm not sure I can pull them
apart really.
I'd imagine most of the COVID discounts are now starting to unwind. I would hope so
anyway because the traﬃc is back to -- is back to normal.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Great. Thank you very much.

A - Adam Westwood

{BIO 20481660 <GO>}

Thanks, Barry. We have a couple of questions that have come through in the -- in the text
which I will just read out. So , we have one from (inaudible). Are you going to share what
ideas you have to increase your addressable market, or at least give an indication of how
much you expect to increase your addressable market by?

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Yes. So , I guess the important point here is that we currently quote for 98.5% of the
market. I think most -- though many of our competitors will probably be near 60 or 70%.
So we fundamentally believe there is a right price that everybody just got to work out
what it is.

FINAL

What we are looking at is in other parts of the market, but we haven't statically converted
business. Is there any way we could, we could look at ﬁnding new niches in the market,
and that's one thing we'll probably come back to as we get towards next March.
So I think it's really about ﬁnding is there any areas where we have a missed call. A date
has taken a note to getting something diﬀerent on any areas we could ﬁnd what we think
we could be more competitive if we ﬁnd some new data sources, for example. So that's
one of the things we're looking out for next year. So , the addressable market is
everybody, it's just how we can become potentially more competitive for some parts of it.

A - Adam Westwood

{BIO 20481660 <GO>}

Thanks, Geoﬀ. We have one further question from Carl Morris [ph], which says, I
appreciate the comments surrounding the backlog of new drivers. How do you think
about the disruption to new vehicle manufacturing that has seen signiﬁcant cuts in
production aﬀecting your growth prospects?

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think it's been deﬁnitely one of the factors that has -- that has inﬂuenced volumes over
the last year. I think what we're seeing now is the quote volumes being back in -- quote
volumes being back in the market.
The market is there to be written. I think now the SEO pricing review and claims inﬂation
will probably start to become more inﬂuential than the dropping -- but then dropping car
sales. So , I think now FCA and claims inﬂation become the key drivers as we're going to
next year.

A - Adam Westwood

{BIO 20481660 <GO>}

Thank you, Geoﬀ. That is the end of the raised hands and the Q&A. So unless I see any
hands raised. No. Or I think that's all the questions.

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Okay. Look, thank you very much for your time and your questions. I guess we would -- we
would say that it's been a -- it's been a tough year and a half to two years for reasons
partly outside our control. We've been very disciplined in applying our strategy.
It does feel like we're now emerging from the crowds into slightly sunnier weather. We
think the beneﬁts of the discipline we've applied will now start to pay oﬀ. To one of the
questions earlier, I think we would intend to grow back now into our expense ratio and
headcount. So -- and we are feeling pretty, pretty competent about the outlook from here.
So thank you very much for your time. Any other questions, do get in touch with Adam or
myself. We're happy to pick them up during the course of the next couple of days. Thanks
a lot. Bye now.
