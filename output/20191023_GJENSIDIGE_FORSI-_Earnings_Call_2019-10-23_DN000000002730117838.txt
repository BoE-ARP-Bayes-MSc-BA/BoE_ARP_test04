Presentation
Operator
Good day and welcome to the Gjensidige Q3 2019 Results Presentation. Today's
conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms.
Mitra Hagen Negard, Head of IR. Please go ahead, ma'am.

Mitra Hagen Negard

{BIO 3974076 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good morning and welcome to this third quarter presentation of
Gjensidige Forsikring. My name is Mitra Negard and I'm Head of Investor Relations. As
always, we will start with our CEO, Helge Leiro Baastad, who will give you highlights of the
quarter, followed by our CFO, Jostein Amdal, who will run through the numbers in further
detail. And we will have plenty of time for Q&A towards the end.
Helge, please.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Mitra. Good morning and welcome everyone. I'm very pleased to report yet
another solid set of results, starting with a few comments on our third quarter results on
Page 2. We generated a proﬁt before tax of NOK1.3 billion, signiﬁcantly up from the third

quarter last year. Group underwriting result amounted to NOK1.1 billion, corresponding to
a combined ratio of a solid 83.2%.
Our results reﬂect eﬀective pricing and re-underwriting measures as well as weather
conditions, more or less in line with what we should expect from a third quarter in the
Nordic region. Our Norwegian operations recorded strong results and progress outside
Norway was broadly in line with our plan. Large losses were lower and run-oﬀ gains were
slightly higher than the expected level.
And we continue to demonstrate good cost control. Our investment portfolio delivered
returns of NOK279 million or 0.5% in the quarter. Annualized return on equity year-to-date
adjusted for the gain on the sale of Gjensidige Bank was 21.6%. This is well above our
annual target of 20%. Jostein will revert with more detailed comments on the results.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then turning to Page 3. I would like to elaborate on the operational status in a few key
areas. I'm very pleased with our operations both in and outside Norway. We have
maintained our strong position in both the private and commercial segments while
carrying through necessary pricing and re-underwriting measures in a highly competitive
market. Retention remains very high, a strong evidence of our strong oﬀering to our
customers.
Our pricing measures in the Private segment were somewhat oﬀset by lower volumes in
the quarter, comparing with the same quarter last year. However, with continued positive
momentum in new sales and the lower impact from the termination of the NITO
agreement, we have seen Private segment volume rise compared with the second quarter
this year, a trend we expect will continue.
Thanks to the successful pricing measures, proﬁtability for motor in Norway has reached a
good level while we see further potential for improvement for our private property line.
We have continued our successful pricing eﬀorts in the Commercial segment without
shedding volumes. There are still pockets in this segment, which we need to address,
particularly among large corporates and hence we will continue to raise prices.
We are very pleased with our cooperation with Nordea, exceeding our expectations. Our
reach towards the Private segment will be further strengthened through Nordea's real
estate agent chain starting later this year. Cooperation in the Commercial segment has
been approved by the FSA. We are in the process of preparing relevant processes and
will start up right after new year.
Our operations outside Norway are progressing according to plan, although with
somewhat diﬀerent progress, and as a natural consequence of the segments' diﬀerent
starting points.
Our eﬀorts across the operations are the same, centering around analytics, digitalization
and automation of customer interaction and processes. This will lead to improved CRM,

tariﬀs, sales eﬀectiveness and thus in turn more satisﬁed customers and improved
competitiveness and a lower cost level. We are conﬁdent in our ambition of achieving an
underwriting result of NOK750 million ex run-oﬀ from these operations in 2022. We
expect a back-end loaded progress towards this goal as it takes time for the measures to
take eﬀect.
Then turning to Page 4. I'm very proud to present the results of this year Ipsos reputation
survey released last week. Once again, we ranked number one in terms of reputation in
the Norwegian ﬁnance sector, and independent of sector, Gjensidige ranks number six
among over 100 companies in the survey. In Gjensidige, we ﬁrmly believe sustainable
solutions are key to long-term value creation. Therefore we are very pleased to see that
Norwegian customers recognize us as the most socially responsible company in the
ﬁnance sector.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our sustainability goals are focused on three areas; contributing to a safer society,
reducing carbon intensity and socially responsible investments. Our most important
contribution to a safer society is claims prevention for the beneﬁt of the climate,
environment and health. Gjensidige has a long tradition in claims prevention and a new
action to get a better understanding of climate eﬀects going forward is a cooperation with
the acknowledged research institute Norwegian Computing Center. The purpose is to
improve assessments of climate impacts inherent in our risk assessments. This will in turn
improve our ability to set the right tariﬀs. A better understanding of climate impact will
also improve our ability for proactive claims prevention, for example, related to water. We
have already established SMS alerts for signiﬁcant weather incidents and we will improve
this service going forward.
We are also further developing claims prevention services related to personal health.
Mental health problems are rising, particularly among young people. Addressing this
challenge, we have launched an online service providing mental counseling for our
customers within the framework of child insurance.
Our second goal is to reduce carbon intensity both to lowering our own emissions so that
we will be climate neutral by 2030 and by lowering claims related emissions through
claims prevention and circular claims handling solutions in close cooperation with our
suppliers. On this end, we have entered into an agreement with the global ESG rating
company EcoVadis who will track the performance of our largest suppliers across a range
of ESG indicators and develop corrective action plans where necessary.
And last but not least, in terms of socially responsible investments, we continue to screen
our investments and cooperate with our fund managers to ensure that our investments
are in line with our sustainability goals.
With that, I will leave the word to Jostein to present the third quarter results in more
detail.

Thank you, Helge, and good morning, everybody. I will start on Page 6. We delivered a
proﬁt before tax of NOK1.3 billion in the third quarter. This is considerably higher than the
third quarter last year, driven by the signiﬁcant increase in underwriting result. Our
regional operations were the main contributors to the improvement, but Denmark and
Sweden also delivered high results. Underwriting results year-to-date are now NOK3.1
billion and similar to the quarter, driven by improvements in Norway, Denmark and
Sweden. Proﬁt from our Pension business was slightly higher than last year whereas the
investment portfolio generated a lower return.
Turning to Page 7, earned premiums were up 3.3% or 2.7% adjusted for currency eﬀects. In
the Private segment, we continued to put through price increases primarily for motor and
property. This was somewhat oﬀset by lower business volume compared with the third
quarter of last year.
However, as Helge pointed out, the positive trend in new sales and churn continued in the
third quarter, resulting in higher volumes compared with the second quarter of this year.
Together with the successful turnaround in motor and our strong competitiveness, this
continues to provide us with ample ﬂexibility going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our pricing initiatives in the Commercial segment continued into the third quarter,
resulting in a healthy 7.2% growth in earned premiums. We will continue the price
increases to at least reﬂect expected claims inﬂation, but in a diﬀerentiated way, so that for
some customers and segments, the price increases will be higher.
Earned premiums in Denmark, and measured in local currency, were broadly in line with
the third quarter of last year. We have been through a period of signiﬁcant repricing and
re-underwriting for both the private and the commercial customers. And although we still
see some areas requiring further pricing actions, we are starting to reach a point where
you can expect growth in line with the rest of the market.
Our Swedish operations saw a 9.3% decline in earned premiums in local currency. Four
percentage points of this was due to termination of one large and proﬁtable contract. Our
new motor tariﬀs have been received well by the market. However, the signiﬁcant price
increases have resulted in loss of volume as expected. We need to continue improving
the quality of our Swedish portfolio and increase prices to reﬂect the inherent risk
premiums. The Baltics reported a higher top line than the same quarter of last year.
Competition in this market is ﬁerce putting pressure on prices. However, we experienced
good demand, particularly for health and motor products.
Turning over to Page 8, the loss ratio decreased by 5.9 percentage points to 69.1.
Although this was somewhat helped by lower large losses, it was primarily due to
improvement in the underlying frequency loss ratio. This was a result of the signiﬁcant
pricing measures we have continued to put through across all segments, in addition to
somewhat better weather conditions than last year.
Run-oﬀ gains were somewhat lower than the same quarter of last year. Our planned
release of excess reserves remains unchanged at NOK1 billion per year through 2022. Our
Page 4 of 15

loss reserves have recently been conﬁrmed through a review carried out by a third party.

FINAL

Proﬁtability for motor in Norway remained at a good level in the third quarter. We expect
claims inﬂation to remain stable at around 3% to 4% excluding the impact from currency
movements. With the continued pricing eﬀorts reﬂecting expected claims inﬂation, we
expect proﬁtability to remain around the current good level going forward.
Proﬁtability for the private property line improved compared with the third quarter of last
year following better weather conditions. However, we are not satisﬁed with the current
proﬁtability level and will continue to put through necessary measures both in terms of
pricing and adjustments of terms and conditions to improve proﬁtability in this line going
forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

And I'm very pleased with the improvement in proﬁtability for the Commercial segment.
Denmark and Sweden generated stronger underlying proﬁtability on the back of
improvements in both the private and commercial lines. And our Baltic operations
showed a higher underlying frequency loss ratio.
Let's turn to Page 9. We recorded NOK888 million in operating expenses in the quarter,
corresponding to a cost ratio of 14.1% and 13.3% excluding the Baltics. I'm very pleased
with this level, thanks to continued cost discipline and eﬃciency measures across the
Group. The ratios were down 1.5 and 0.2 percentage points respectively from the third
quarter of last year. The decline is primarily a result of the restructuring provision of
NOK80 million recorded in the corporate center during the third quarter of last year.
Higher premiums also contributed to the decline. We will continue our focus on
simpliﬁcation of processes, automation of internal operations and further digitalization.
We expect further eﬃciency gains from our eﬀorts, particularly in Sweden and the Baltics.
A few comments on our Pension operations on Slide 10. The pre-tax proﬁt came to
NOK43 million, somewhat higher than the third quarter of last year. Continued growth in
our customer base and an increase in assets under management resulted in a higher net
operating income. This was partly oﬀset by lower ﬁnancial income driven by lower returns
on property investments.
Annualized return on equity came to 16.8%. Assets under management increased to
NOK35 billion at the end of the quarter, reﬂecting a positive market trend. The ratio of
shared customers with our general insurance business is high. As of the end of the third
quarter, 68% of the customers in our Pension business were general insurance customers
as well.
Moving on to the investment portfolio on Page 11. The investment portfolio yielded a
return of 0.5% in the quarter, reﬂecting the market conditions in the quarter. The total
investment portfolio amounted to NOK57.5 billion at the end of the quarter. The Match
portfolio yielded a positive return of 0.5% on a portfolio of NOK35 billion. A large part of
the Match portfolio consists of bonds at amortized cost, which yielded a return of 1.3%.
The running yield in this portfolio was 3.7% at the end of the quarter and the average
reinvestment rate during the third quarter was 2.7%. Unrealized excess value amounted to
Page 5 of 15



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2019-10-23

approximately NOK0.9 billion. Return on the Match portfolio was negatively impacted by
redemption on Danish mortgage bonds prompted by the interest rate development.

FINAL

The free portfolio, which amounts to NOK23 billion, yielded a return of 0.5% in the
quarter. Good returns on property investments were partly oﬀset by the development in
emerging market securities, impacting our investments in other bonds and current equity.
We also had lower returns on our PE funds.
Looking at our capital position on Page 12. As you can see on this slide, we have
introduced a new illustration of our solvency margin development. The purpose is to
provide you with a better overview of the main drivers of our capital generation. The
solvency margin, according to the approved internal model as at the end of the third
quarter, was 235%. This is down 7 percentage points from the second quarter, following a
slight increase in eligible funds and a relatively higher increase in capital requirement.
Eligible own funds increased with the Solvency II operating earnings and the ﬁnancial
results from the free portfolio. This was to a large extent oﬀset by the formulaic dividend
based on an 80% payout on IFRS earnings.

Bloomberg Transcript

The main driver of the increase in the capital requirement was changes in exposure and
asset allocation in the free portfolio during the quarter. We have tightened our solvency
target range to 150% to 200% in connection with our annual ORSA process. This range
supports both our rating ambitions and the necessary ﬁnancial ﬂexibility for the Group.
Our remaining ﬁnancial targets are unchanged.
Gjensidige's capital position is strong with the solvency ratio well above our target. We
have given ourselves some time to explore diﬀerent M&A opportunities in our
marketplace. We do not have any new communication on this. We will stay disciplined
and rational and return excess to capital to our shareholders over time if good
opportunities do not arise. The next point in time for our Board to address the topic of
dividends is in connection with our fourth quarter earnings release.
Finally, a few words on the latest development of our operational targets on slide 13. I'm
very pleased with the progress on these metrics, which support our eﬀorts to deliver on
our ﬁnancial targets. We have increased customer retention outside Norway. Sales
eﬀectiveness has risen to currently up 6.8% compared with our base-down [ph] year 2017.
The share of automated tariﬀs has risen further, thanks to the latest inclusion of tariﬀs on
travel and content. We have also increased the level of online claims reporting and claims
straight-through processing, now at 69% and 18% respectively in Norway.
I will then hand the word back to Helge.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Jostein. Then, to sum up on Page 14, we delivered a strong third quarter result.
We have carried out signiﬁcant pricing measures in Norway, while at the same time,
maintaining our superior position. This is a strong vote of conﬁdence from our customers
and conﬁrms our attractive oﬀering.

FINAL

Our insurance portfolios outside Norway are improving according to plan, thanks to our
signiﬁcant pricing, re-underwriting and eﬃciency measures. We prioritize proﬁtability over
growth. Hence we will continue making sure our prices and terms collectively [ph] reﬂect
risk premiums. This means that we will continue to raise prices where necessary.
We continue to implement eﬃciency measures across all segments. This has given strong
results and we still see more to come. We have a solid ﬁnancial position and we remain
ﬁrmly committed to exert strong capital discipline. Sustainability is at the core of our
business and we strive to have strong environmental, social, and governance standards
and continuously improve as opportunities arise. This is a win-win for us and all our
stakeholders.
I will now open for the Q&A session. Thank you.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Matti
Ahokas of Danske Bank. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. Couple of questions on the -- or two questions actually. First one on
the investment income, the mark-to-market or the free portfolio bond return was very low,
even though market was very good. Was there anything speciﬁc behind that? And then
the second question is more of a general nature, even though you mentioned that you
will not comment on the M&A front at the moment, but obviously one thing which has
happened in the market is that interest rates have come down quite a lot, even though up
slightly recently but, has in general, have you see in your markets, a more willingness of
many players to sell assets because of increasing pressure coming from lower interest
rates and solvency pressure caused by that? Thanks.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Okay, okay. On the investment income in the bond part of the free portfolio, there is
reduced interest rates, which has -- is positive, but on the other hand, we also had
exposure towards including net towards emerging market debt, which has not been that
positive in the third quarter. So that I guess is the main explanation for and the surprise
there. And on the other part M&A, rates down, I don't think that has really had a huge
impact on the movements within that space.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

But do you think that could be a trigger for increasing willingness to sell insurance assets
within your region?

A - Jostein Amdal

Lower interest rates is mainly a negative for the life and pension companies more than for
the non-life insurance companies. Although it does also hurt our earnings, but it's easy for
us to compensate through higher underwriting proﬁts. And we are, as you know, mainly
interested in non-life.

FINAL

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Overall, we think compliance and technology investments and the need of scale will drive
actions going forward, more than the interest level.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great, thanks a lot.

Operator
The next question comes from Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi there, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Two, please. So ﬁrstly, so it
sounds like this is the case, but can you conﬁrm pricing in aggregate is in line with the
claims inﬂation across the book. Are there any parts of the book, you'd highlight where
pricing and claims inﬂation are running at diﬀerent levels? And then secondly just, some
exposure. So, obviously, premiums up 3.3%, It looks like pricing is a big driver of that, but
can you just try and break out the premium increase by price and exposure and of the
exposure, whereas where is most of that coming from, is it personal loans or is it
commercial? Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I can maybe comment the claims inﬂation and pricing ﬁrst and Jostein, maybe the second
question. To take the main product areas, I commented motor and Jostein also. We
expect claims inﬂation to remain stable at around 3% to 4% and we will at least price up in
line with the expected inﬂation going forward and you know what we have done recently.
When it comes to private property, we expect around 4% going forward when it comes to
inﬂation and Jostein also commented private property in his presentation and we have
done several adjustments to our tariﬀ and we have also in addition to that ﬂat 5% to 6%
increase in prices behind us from October 1st, 2018 and if you look forward, we will price
above the claims inﬂation based on what Jostein commented. So we will do adjustments
to the tariﬀ. We will price, I guess, twice above the index in the market. So we have pricing
initiatives going forward. Yeah.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

On the second part of 3.3% overall growth as you've commented, 0.6% of that is due to
currency movements, so it's really 2.7% if you adjust for currency movements and as I
pointed out on one of the slides, it's mainly due to pricing. If you look at take segment by
segment in private, we have increased prices, and as we stated, quarter-on-quarter, there

Page 8 of 15

Date: 2019-10-23

FINAL

is actually a negative development in the number of objects insured or customers insured
but from second quarter to third quarter we see a positive trend.
In Commercial, the whole -- the volume is more or less stable. So the earnings growth we
see is price-driven. Denmark we have seen that, we do need to raise prices. And we
underwrite, meaning that we do lose some on the volume side but increase prices and
Sweden, negative growth and of course there is an underlying negative volume growth
there and then but price level increases. Baltics is under pressure, we do have some
business or volume growth as well in addition to price increases.
Overall, the 2.7% for the group on the earnings growth is to a very large extent pricedriven.

(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Erik Gjerland of ABG. Please go
ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Hey, good morning. It's Jan Erik Gjerland from ABG. Regarding your proﬁt in the Private
segment, sort of, looks to be weaker development and short of expectations. Could you
share some moment on what do you think could be the underlying transaction, is that
because you're not making volume growth, as you expected as price increases are in line
with your expectation or is it sort of this higher claims again?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Well, not commenting on expectations. But our results are. So...

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

It's down -- it's down from 5.84 [ph] in Q2 though, if you go with the 50% down
(inaudible)

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yeah. Quarter-by-quarter it's 1 percentage point improvement in the underlying frequency
loss ratio and that's how we've already commented and the motor proﬁtability is where
we think it should be at. So it's a really good level, we do have kind of competitiveness
there so we can capture the volume growth in the market going forward. And we've seen
positive trends from second to third quarter. And I actually believe you already
commented that in the second quarter as well, but as you saw during the second quarter
that we had an underlying improvement in business volume.

FINAL

Private property, as we've already mentioned a couple of times, we are not happy with the
proﬁtability level as such there, there is a slight improvement from third quarter last year,
but mainly driven by weather improvements or more beneﬁcial weather. Most of the
business lines recorded kind of small improvements in the loss ratio compared to the
same quarter of last year. And as already mentioned on the previous question from Jonny,
there is a negative volume development from third quarter to third quarter, that has
changed during the -- from the second to the third quarter.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Maybe just to add that -- note that although we don't have seen extreme weather in third
quarter this year, we had several local heavy downpours, particularly in Eastern Norway. I
think our competitors also commented that. So adjusting for the total amount quantiﬁed
in third quarter ' 18 Related to frequency claims is not correct, actually, so we had some
weather also in third quarter this year.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. Just to follow-up Matti's question then, if you saw that you have ended more sort of
exotic bond markets ﬂow to get yields out there, so why is it so that you have most of your
bookings in Norway and this kind of exotic bonds have been the exceptions?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

It's still most (inaudible) most of the book in Norwegian kroner and the Match portfolio
matches both the currency and duration of the insurance assets, whereas in the free
portfolio. We have a wider mandate to invest globally but within a fairly limited overall risk
appetite, I would say. There are other asset classes there, we do have high-yield bonds
that could include from time to time, or emerging market debt, for instance.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

And ﬁnally just on the free portfolio, the yield on FX [ph] hedge of that free portfolio
evolve [ph] either, (inaudible) either the bond side.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yeah. Yes, overall, we hedge, as a general rule we do hedge within a band each asset
class or each mandate on the free portfolio

Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. I've just got one more. And sorry
to bring it back to private property. I was just wondering how claims inﬂation has changed
in that line over time. And you said it is currently running at 4%. What is the drive for that?
Thanks.

FINAL

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I think over time it has been quite stable around 4%. The building Index is type of
indication for what the cost to replace claims and it's 3.1% for 2019. That's the common
billing index in the market and then you have some new standards for replacing
bathrooms and things like that so, I think it has been around 4% for many years actually.

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

So what's causing it to have, I guess, less than ideal proﬁtability there, is it just a
competitive market?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, I think as Jostein mentioned on the previous question, there is an increase. If you
look at the longer trend on more kind of weather-related losses in property for whatever
reason, be it climate change related or not. And we saw also in the third quarter some
downpours. But the main problem is getting it through the kind of the necessary price
increases in the shortened oﬀ time frame, really. I think that is a market problem, not
(inaudible) problem

Our next question comes from Blair Stewart of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please go
ahead.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Hello, good morning. Just a clariﬁcation on the Match portfolio again, please. There was a
loss in the current bonds line. I think you mentioned the redemption of Danish mortgage
bonds in your prepared remarks and then under the Q&A, you talked about emerging
market and bonds being the issue, so I'm just a little bit confused as to what caused the
loss there in that particular line. And secondly, in the free portfolio, you talked about an
increase in capital requirements and, is that due to changes in your asset allocation. And if
so, could you just talk about that a little bit more? Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yeah. Sorry if I was unclear. The negative development on this line current bonds in the
Match portfolio is related to the Danish mortgage-bond issue as you correctly state. The --

FINAL

my comment on the emerging market debt as being part of the other bond's in the free
portfolio. So I'm sorry if that was unclear.
So on the increase in the capital requirement for the portfolio. And within this, as I stated,
a fairly limited mandate on the assets allocation and risk taking on the -- in the free
portfolio, there would all the time be variation in the capital requirement because it is
based on the actual allocation decisions by the investment department. This quarter there
is an increase of 0.3% there and it is not dramatic, there is, I mean if you look at the market
risk in the solvency GAAP requirement [ph], it's around NOK7 billion and part of that rate
is the Match portfolio, part is the free portfolio, but as a percentage terms, it's like 5% to
10% maybe changed and it is maybe slightly higher than the average, but there is nothing

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Good morning. I just wanted to have a quick question on your cost ratio. I don't know if I
missed this earlier, but it's signiﬁcantly improved in the third quarter, the share, down
14.1% I think. Can you tell me whether this is a new trend or if this is just a summer lull in
the expenses? Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I think the right answer there is that our target is to be below 15% and as we have
communicated before, below 15% we will be able to invest into a completely new legacy
system. We will be able to invest heavily into all kind of initiatives to develop the business
on the technology side, but to manage that we have to drive the cost base further down,
so it's the same type of target going forward, but I also commented that we have been
quite eﬀective and we see further potential actually.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Okay, that's good. So you are taking out cost obviously, but you're going to reinvest in the
business so we shouldn't really think about change in the 15% going forward?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I think over target, it's a good starting point for this.

Thank you. Just one follow-up please. So I guess on the underlying loss ratio
development, if you strip out the abnormal weather eﬀects from the prior period, there is
just over two points improvement, which I think was behind consensus. I just wonder, is
that because you're using some of this kind of margin improvement to waive in loss picks
[ph] a bit higher to build more conservatism into the reserve? Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Our reserves are at best estimate. If you take away the communicated planned reserve
releases, we still believe we are reserving at best investment at the second quarter as well
as for the second and third quarter so kind of no increased conservativeness ramping [ph]
in the reserves.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay, thank you.

A - Mitra Hagen Negard

{BIO 3974076 <GO>}

And just to point out what Helge said previously that it wouldn't be correct to adjust for
the full weather eﬀects that we quantiﬁed last year because we have experienced heavy
downpours this quarter impacting the private property lines.

Can you help us with the quantum of that, just so we can get, we have like for like
improvement ﬁgure?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

We have shied away from providing a precise estimates on that. It is, of course, to a lesser
extent than what we saw in 2018, much lesser extent. Whether this is the new normal, it is
least within a normal volatility around what is the normal for this kind of (inaudible)

Thank you and our next question comes from Phil Ross of Mediobanca. Please go ahead.

Q - Phil Ross

{BIO 20618440 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. Just one from me. On the start of the call, you mentioned progress
outside Norway was broadly in line with plan. I just wondered if you can give us anything
speciﬁc on sort of what things you're seeing that's in line with the plan or is it just that,
generally speaking, that's heading in the right direction, albeit progress is back end
loaded. Thanks.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Well, if you look at the actual underwriting result excluding run-oﬀ outside Norway, yeah,
it's actually quite good. When we comment, according to plan, we are looking more at
this kind of measures that we plan to take to receive that 750 in 2022 and there we are
progressing according to plan, there will be kind of volatility from quarter-to-quarter and
this time the volatility has kind of been on the good side. Measures we're taking as you
look at the cost ratio in Baltic and look at nominal cost in Sweden, the cost ratio in Sweden
will suﬀer somewhat because of the top line and negative top timeline development, but
we have new tariﬀ in place in motor and we got these kind of measures that we're talking
about, when we talk about the measures needed to reach that 750 in 2022 and they are
progressing according to plan.

Q - Johan Strom

{BIO 17541253 <GO>}

Thank you. First on the premium side. The volumes that you had to say goodbye to during
the quarter, the churn, I'm just curious on how you look at kind of the quality of the
retentions, retention level. I mean if we look at Q1 and Q2 in particular, I remember, you
commented that the retention was on -- looks strong on the best customers is still a trend
that you're seeing. And then secondly, on the capital side, we're in 150% to 200%, do you
intend to be still in the higher end of that range? Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

On the churn, as we have commented in previous quarters, there is -- there was an
increase in churn over the ﬁrst two quarters, because, we did lose a very good agreement
with the NITO there is (inaudible) organization at January 1st and of course that led to an
increase in churn as we started selling on that one. However, we see that the losses from
that portfolio is tapering oﬀ now in the third quarter.
So, I think, we'd say, as expected. We also had in 2018, you know this -- the change in the
regulation around the third-party liability insurance for motor in Norway, which led to an
inﬂux of kind of single product customers in Private Norwich, kind of where low quality -there are less proﬁtable customers if we have only one small policy with us. So that we
also see a higher churn there but taking away those two special eﬀects, churn is down to a
very comfortable level, I would say. So, not that concerned about the churn situation really
in private Norway.
On the capital side and from commercial, I already commented in earlier quarters, we did
get through quite high price increases, especially at the January one renewals without any
increase in churn at all. So it's very kind of happy with the competitive position we have in
Norway. 150 to 200, the new solvency margin, the range, we're not repeating that in the
Page 14 of 15

higher end of that range, we think that is a comfortable range to be in, compared to the
rating target that we have and giving us enough ﬁnancial ﬂexibility. So it's kind of within
that range, not in the upper end of that range.

Q - Johan Strom
