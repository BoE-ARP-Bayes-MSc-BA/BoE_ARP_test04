FINAL

I would now like to introduce your hosts for today's conference, Mr. Dinos Iordanou; Mr.
Marc Grandisson; and Mr. Mark Lyons. You may begin.

Constantine Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Thank you, Krystal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our
fourth quarter earnings call. As many of you know, this is my last earnings call as CEO of
Arch Capital and I could not be more proud of the team and organization that we have
built over the past 16 years. We announced our CEO transition plan three years ago, and
I'm very pleased with the work, Mark and the entire executive team have done to position
Arch, for the challenges they will face in the future.
In our 16 years as a company, we have come a long way. We have taken an idea to build
from scratch, a specialty insurance and reinsurance platform that can generate superior
risk adjusted returns, and we have done that. We also saw an opportunity after the
financial crisis to add a new segment mortgage that profitably diversifies our company
and we have achieved that also.

Bloomberg Transcript

Through the P&C cycle, Arch has produced average annual returns of 16% and book value
for shareholders, average returns of 16% and book value per share growth, growing 10
times from $6.03 a share in March of 2002 to $60.91 per share at December 31, 2017. And
a share price of $87 before this call, from a split-adjusted $8.84 back in 2002.
On my own I cannot have accomplished these results, but with the help of many people,
much has been accomplished. The challenge for all of us was to improve the intellectual
capability of the company and its ability to manufacture, as I always say profitable
decisions. Most companies do not pay enough attention to their most important asset
they posses, their employees. Here at Arch, is the foundation of our success.
For Arch, the question has been how do you create a culture in a cyclical business that not
only empowers but also helps our employees to make the best decision that they can.
You have to pay off for them, you have to share knowledge, you have to teach, you have
to be reward them, you have to provide an opportunity for employees to constantly learn
and transfer knowledge up and down the organization, as well as our core segments and
channels.
The more knowledge your employees possess, the better decision makers they are, and
that is what producing -- that is what produces outstanding results. You have to believe in
the success of the team, or with the success of the individual, and you have to be willing
to challenge and be challenged. Collaboration is the secret sauce that enables quick
execution and achieving extraordinary result. For the past 16 years, I've had the honor and
privilege to help lead Arch and to have a hand in its formation and success is one of my
greatest personnel achievements.

I'm now passing the baton over to Mark. And I'm confident that we will see not only a
continuation of the culture, that has made Arch successful, but that also I expect the
future awards will be enhanced under his leadership.

FINAL

To take an analogy out of car racing, which I'm a fan of, Marc, here are the keys baby. The
Ferraris, are in the starting position, the fuel ready to go, achieve greatness, my friend.

Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Thank you, Dinos. Wow. You'll see me on my Vespa in Bermuda. Stay with the Italian team.
But good morning to you all, I've had the privilege of working with Dinos for more than 16
years, and I feel its appropriate to pause on this earnings call. Dinos' 59th consecutive
earnings call and to express a big thank you from all of us, at ACGL. Thank you for your
leadership, for the values and culture that you've helped to establish here at Arch. Enjoy
your family with the two newest addition Mariel [ph]and Evelyn, [ph] Mr. grandpa.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to the quarter and year-end review. 2017 brought catastrophe losses of about 135
billion to the industry and cost Arch shareholders about $386 million. For the year ended
December 31, 2017, Arch produced after-tax operating income of 447 million, or $3.21 per
share for 5.7% operating return on equity. On a net income basis, the results were slightly
better as a company reported $566 million, or $4.07 per share for the year ending
December 31, 2017, producing a net return equity of 7.2%.
Our investment returns were good this quarter, as you probably know, we manage our
investment portfolio on a total return basis, which in US dollar basis was a positive 79 basis
points for the quarter, 71 bps on a local currency basis. Our book value per share in the
quarter rose, as Dinos mentioned to $60.91, an increase of 10.4% for the full year and our
risk management structure and diversified business platforms performed as designed in a
face of challenging P&C market condition and significant cat activity.
One year into our acquisition of UGC, we are pleased with the contribution that our
mortgage segment makes to our returns and value creation. Our group-wide insurance in
force or IIF grew to $352 billion at year-end '17 from nearly 316 billion the prior year,
helped by the UGC acquisition gross written premium grew a 142% to $335 million for the
fourth quarter of '17 versus fourth quarter of '16 for the entire mortgage segment.
Reinsurance sessions to our Bellamy 3 insurance linked securities and other third-party
reinsurers, as well as target reductions in US single business and Australian reinsurance,
led to receive sequential decrease of 6% in net premiums written to 272 million for the
fourth quarter of '17.
Earned premium worldwide grew 2% in the fourth quarter to 280 million, as a result of
growth in our insurance in force. For our primary US mortgage business, NIW of 14.4 billion
in the fourth quarter of 2017 was down from 17.7 billion in the third quarter. Part of this
decline is due to normal seasonality in the fourth quarter, but it also reflects our efforts to
manage growth in the higher to loan-to-value above 95 mortgages, and our ongoing
conservative approach to the pricing of singles. We estimate that our market share of NIW

FINAL

in the US for the fourth quarter of '17 was just below 21%, which is consistent with our
expectations we discussed since completing the acquisition of UGC.
Mortgage market conditions remain favorable in the US, however, competition is
increasing in the CRT space as well as in the primary mortgage insurance market. While
we are being marginally more selective in our underwriting, the overall quality of the risks
written are strong and the mortgage segment are continue to generate risk adjusted
returns above our long-term target of 15%.
Next, turning to our property casualty operations and our reinsurance segments
specifically. As you have already heard on a number of calls this quarter, rate increases in
the property cat lines were not nearly as robust as many of us hoped, given the significant
cats in 2017. We saw few opportunities to put capital to work at the January 1 renewals,
but not enough rate movement to warrant a material increase in our writings. Rates across
our reinsurance portfolio were up 2.5%, including 5 to 7.5 for our cat book. As you can see,
it's a positive, albeit tepid starting point for the year. Returns for cat business are low by
historical standards and in our view, do not fully capture risk volatility in this line of
business.

Bloomberg Transcript

For the fourth quarter of 2017, gross premium written rose about 5% in our reinsurance
segment over the same quarter in '16, and 2% on a net basis. The growth came primarily
from our specialty businesses, including international motor treaties, while other lines such
as our property ex-cats were reduced. Our reported combined ratio for the reinsurance
segment was 94.5 in the fourth quarter on a core basis, excluding Watford.
Turning to our insurance segment, gross premiums written of 768 million in the 2017 fourth
quarter, or 8.5% higher than in 2016 fourth quarter, while net premium in insurance were
10.1% higher at 513 million. The higher level of net premiums written reflected increases in
national accounts, travel and growth in two of our newest programs areas, where we
currently see opportunities in US insurance.
Focusing on P&C insurance market overall conditions, they remain challenging, although,
we have seen rates stabilize and improving in some lines in the fourth quarter, particularly
in property, commercial auto and some casualty lines. Our current view of the market is
cautiously optimistic. We are seeing a slight upward movement on the pricing side with
some margin expansion. However, after considering changes in terms and conditions and
other factors that can influence claim trend on an absolute basis, rate levels are not
sufficient to support the allocation of more capital to our insurance segment, especially
given our opportunities in the MI segment.
Next, I would like to discuss our PML. As we mentioned last quarter, we're also reporting
to you our exposure to mortgage risk from a systemic stress event, what we call a realistic
disaster scenario or RDS. It stood at 17% of tangible common equity at the end of the
fourth quarter. We have begun using tangible rather than stated equity as a result of UGC
acquisition, as we believe that is more appropriate and prudent risk management
yardstick. Our net property cat exposures are substantially the same as last quarter with

Page 4 of 26



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2018-02-13

our 1.250 year [ph] PML for the peak zone, the US Northeast at 6.5% of tangible common
equity.

FINAL

In summary, we're always preparing for opportunities that the market presents, but we
remain discipline in allocating capital to the various units to maximize risk adjusted returns
for our shareholders.
Now, here is Mark with more detailed financial analysis of the quarter. Mark?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Right. Thank you, Marc, and good morning to all. On today's call, I'm going to comment on
the fourth quarter results as usual, I'm also going to focus on some unusual accounting
impacts and one-off charges driven by US tax reform and other items in this busy, busy
quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. So, now into some summary comments for the fourth quarter. All on a core basis
and as just as refresher, the term core corresponds Arch's financial results excluding
Watford Re, whereas the term consolidated includes Watford Re. So, core losses
recorded in the fourth quarter from 2017 catastrophic events, net of reinsurance
recoverable and reinstatement premiums were $800,000 or nearly one-tenth of loss
ratio point compared to four loss ratio points in the fourth quarter of last year on the
same basis. The activity was primarily driven by the California wildfires, pretax estimate
68.4 million along with approximately 69.1 million reductions associated with the third
quarter hurricanes, Harvey, Irma and Maria.
The reductions in the third quarter hurricane estimate results from lower industry loss
estimates from outside vendors in conjunction with our own lower than expected
reported claims volumes. Most of the reduction emanated from the reinsurance group
both (inaudible) and overall estimates for Harvey and Maria were reduced, whereas Irma
remained relatively flat.
As for the California wildfires, we see more exposure from the Northern California fires
versus Southern California roughly three-to-one and see this primarily as a reinsurance
event for us. With respect to net pure loss prior period favorable development
approximately 54 million, or 4.9 loss ratio points was recognized in the quarter compared
to 6.5 loss ratio points in the fourth quarter of last year. This net favorable development
was led by the reinsurance segment with approximately 32 million favorable, while the
mortgage segment provided approximately 20 million at favorable development.
The calendar quarter combined ratio on a core basis was 82.5% compared to the fourth
quarter of 2016's 88.3%. The core accident quarter combined ratio excluding cats was
87% even compared to 90.74% last year's fourth quarter. The reinsurance segment
accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats of 103.2%, includes two unusual items and
the comparison to the fourth quarter of 2016 needs one unusual item comment. The two
items impacting the 2017 action quarter are one, the non-recurrent 1% federal excise tax
or FET associated with the fourth quarter inter-company loss portfolio transfers previously

announced, which resulted in a 5.3 point increase to the reinsurance segment expense
ratio through the acquisition line. And second, the reinsurance group incurred
approximately two combined ratio points of negative impact associated with the former
Gulf Re operation over the prior year's comparable quarter.
The item affecting the fourth quarter of last year was a large retrocessional recoverable
of approximately 11.5 million that had no counterpart in the fourth quarter of 2017, and
represents a 4.6 combined ratio point impact. Taking all of these items into account,
resulted a 95.9% fourth quarter accident quarter combined ratio, which therefore,
represents only a 20 basis point increase over the adjusted fourth quarter for last year.
Moving on to the insurance segment, the accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats
was 99.7%, which included 2.2 loss ratio points of large attritional losses relative and
higher than the fourth quarter of 2016 along with a flat expense ratio. This is
approximately a 130 basis points higher than the comparable accident quarter in 2016.
This is a loss ratio increase and primarily represents higher loss tax due to our view of
competitive marketplace conditions on an earned basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

The competitive conditions experienced in the insurance and reinsurance segments were
more than offset by the continued strong profitability in mortgage segment amplified by
the net earned premium being a larger proportion of the total. The mortgage segment's
accident quarter combined ratio improved to 47.1% from 54.8% quarter-over-quarter and
their net earned premiums represented nearly 26% of the total core net earned premium
compared to only 9.6% in the fourth quarter of 2016.
The accident quarter loss ratio of 25% was negatively impacted by approximately 10.4
million of charges, primarily associated with higher delinquencies stemming from the third
quarter hurricane events, a catch-up of 2017 reported losses from one lender and a small
adjustment to put loss reserves on parity between our East and West operations. The
accident quarter loss ratio after taking these items into account would have been 21.3%.
I'd also like to point out the subsequent to UGC acquisition, which closed at the end of
last year, the 2017 accident quarter loss ratios for the mortgage segment have
sequentially been as follows from first to fourth quarter: 21.5%, 19.5%, 20.6% and this
quarter is 21.3% on an adjusted basis. The expense ratio improved from 37.9% in the
fourth quarter of last year to 22.1% this quarter. On a sequential basis to the third quarter
of 2017, however, the expense ratio increased by 150 basis points from 20.6%. This was
primarily driven by increase in the amortization of deferred acquisition expenses.
Remember, that is closing the UGC transaction at last year-end, all deferred acquisition
expenses were written off to zero, they are now rebuilding and being amortized into
income.
Moving on to other unusual financial statements in this busy quarter. Let me begin by
discussing three items that have been included as reflected within operating income. First,
as I noted earlier, we executed one-time inter-company loss portfolio transfer this quarter
and incurred 13.6 million of federal excise taxes were approximately $0.10 per share.
Second, we established the $10 million valuation allowance against our UK insurance

FINAL

syndicate deferred tax asset this quarter was $0.07 per share. Third, as discussed earlier,
the mortgage segment recognized approximately 10 million plus of pre-tax charges and
6.8 million of after-tax charges representing $0.05 a share. All-in, these one-off items
within operating income as described, total $0.22 per share.
Shifting to an update on integration costs associated with the UGC transaction, the
original combined workforce has been reduced by approximately 30% as of year end
2017 along with 120 contractors. There was $1 million in severance-related costs in the
quarter, totaling 14 million for the full year and the run rate of quarterly pure salary savings
is 9.5 million, or 38 million on the annual basis. The vast majority of employee-related
savings has now been realized, if any additional future benefits likely being a systemintegration oriented.
As for the beneficial accretion stemming from the acquisition of the UGC on an EPS basis,
we examined the full year performance of the overall company, the mortgage segment
and UGC incremental addition and adjusting for the normal level of cat losses, shows the
earnings accretion projected to reach 35% within three-year period has been nearly 75%
achieved just one year later.

Bloomberg Transcript

Total investment returns for the quarter was a positive 79 bps on a US basis, as Marc
mentioned and 71 basis points on a local currency basis.
Returns on equities, alternatives and non-investment grade fixed income primarily drove
the return. The full 2017 year total return was 5.87% on a US dollar basis, the investment
duration was 2.83 years at the end of this year, down sequentially from 3.14 years in
anticipation of inflationary pressures.
Operating cash flow on a core basis was negative 32 million, primarily due to an increase
in net paid losses stemming mostly from third quarter cat activity. The return on cash
collateral associated with a long -- a large and long time customer and the timing of tax
payments between both the quarters.
As for taxes, we incurred $21.5 million charge this quarter, that results from the change in
the US corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% on our deferred tax asset. This has been
excluded from operating income, since this is not reflected of operational performance.
The effective tax rate in the quarter, our pretax operating income was 15.4%, excluding
the impact of the change in US tax rate, I just commented about and 17.6% for the full 2017
year on the same basis.
Now, we don't like to give guidance, but there's been so much havoc on the third and
fourth quarter of this year. We'd like to provide our view that 2018's tax rate on pre-tax
operating income is expected to be between 11% and 14%. Although this range results
from various scenarios tested, actual results could still fall outside this range depends on
the level of location of income or loss, the level a location of catastrophic activity and their
impacts rates in each jurisdiction. As respect to financial leverage, we repaid another 25
million down in the revolving credit facility this quarter and that combined with strong
earnings, continue to improve our leverage ratios.

During the quarter, we also issued 100 million of Series F preferred at 5.4% and
redeemed all of the remaining 92.6 million of Series C 6.75% preferred, with the clearing
date of January 2, of 2018. As a result with the two-day overlap of having both Series C
and Series F outstanding, so we adjusted that overlap resulted in GAAP debt plus
preferred ratio of 25.8% at year-end 2017 versus 28.7% at year-end '16, which is 290 basis
point improvement in net leverage. The ongoing preferred dividend amount is 10.4 million
a quarter, which will result in 4.4 million of lower dividend amount in 2018 than in 2017. We
did not repurchase any shares during the quarter and our Board authorization remains at
$446 million plus.
On a personal note, Dinos, we have been working together now for about 35 years, and
I'm still waiting for you to get something right. No, I'm kidding. But seriously, because of
your leadership, the company is smarter, our families are happier and each one of us is a
whole lot more wealthy. So, thanks very much for your leadership, Dinos. (Foreign

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Elyse Greenspan from
Wells Fargo. Your line is open.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. First off, congratulations on Dinos on your retirement. It's obviously
great job for all of us working with you through the years. To the quarter, my first question,
in any of your two segments, was there any kind of current accident in your catch-up in
terms of the margin, specifically the loss ratios and how do we think about, just given the
market commentary that you've provided still being pretty defensive, I would say in both
insurance and reinsurance. How do you think about the margin profile in both of those
businesses, sorry, as we look out to 2018?

A - Constantine Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Hey, Elyse, it's a good question, I think we're prepared for that one, obviously. I think there
was somewhat of a small margin expansion in the fourth quarter of this year, this is clear
that we have seen it. We think it's about 30 bps on our portfolio, maybe 50 dps. It's a
positive, it's small, but it's a positive and it's also on the heels of 2.5 years of margin
compression. With that you have to keep that in mind the one quarter change does not
Page 8 of 26

FINAL

know repair 2.5 years of margin depression. That's what we are cautiously optimistic. It's
holding in January our initial discussions with our team is that the market is holding up the
rate level, the same as it was in the last quarter.
Essentially, if you talk to our teams, they will tell you that 2017, the last quarter of rate
changes pretty much meant that 2017 was a wash. So, we sort of have a stable year
versus '16, and this is what's behind our commentary about the market. So, we -- it's
holding, slightly improving and clearly there has been -- there is an improvement at that
level. There's also an improvement in ROEs and return on margins and a lot of it has not -does not have a whole lot to do with the rate level themselves. A lot of it has to do with
the tax rate changes, specifically in the US and as well as their interest rate environment
that we see all around us, right.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, those two together account for about 200 basis points of pick up in return. So,
historically, we've told you, we have about a 7% to 9% ROE, this was middle of '17. So, I
think we're probably moving towards the higher end of that range. But the one thing that I
mentioned that I really want to impress upon you, these are all quantifiable changes, risk
changes and trend in losses. There's a lot of stuff out there that's called terms and
conditions and a lot of it has been given away over the last 2.5 years to 3 years and we
don't necessarily factor that very well into our calculation.
And the trend has been going up, the trend was 1.5% and closing in on 2% for this year.
So, that's why we are cautious because, yes, we're seeing some compression, margin
expansion. For the last quarter it seems to be holding up at the January level -- January 1
renewal. But there's a lot of uncertainty as to where we're starting from and what is -what it will mean for the next -- for the remainder of 2018.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

And I would just add, at least, we've talked about that as a management team. When you
look backward, the actual risk depicts never works in a soft market. It's always worse than
you think and it's terms and conditions as Marc highlighted. So, that's what our great year
comes from. We've been throughout of these things that you have to be thinking more
conservatively.

A - Constantine Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

It's prudent, from an old guy it's always prudent when you can't calculate something. And I
think in my 42 years in the business, the effect of the change in terms and conditions
never really mathematically can get factor, is prudent to be a bit more cautious. And I think
what Mark and the team have done for determining the accident year is prudent in my
view.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

And Elyse, again, this is just one quarter worth of the information and we'll have to wait
another 3 to 4 years to see whether that -- these numbers are holding up to what we
think that holding up and that also means that we pick 2013 through 2017 at the right level,

Page 9 of 26



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td

Date: 2018-02-13

which one could argue that not everything is as probably as really as people might think,
the proverbial bond maybe little bit are the bond as we would like to say.

FINAL

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then my second question, in terms of capital, when you guys announced
the UGC deal, you effectively said that you weren't going to be buying back stock for
2017, as we think about 2018 and just capital, obviously, there is some potential PMIER
changes related to your mortgage business, you also with that the lapse, the AIG quota
share only runs for '14, the '16, so you are holding on to more mortgage business. How do
we -- you guys think about that holistically and could we see Arch buying back some stock
in 2018?

A - Constantine Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

So, right now, the best -- as best we can tell is, we would return capital to shareholders if
we didn't see opportunities. And frankly, we are seeing opportunities and clearly MI is one
glaring area, where we think the returns are very appropriate. So, right now where we
stand is, we have opportunities that may develop or may not develop and it behooves us
to keep the capital, at least, hold it behind so that we could maybe able to deploy it in this
year and in the subsequent years. That's really what I would -- Mark, you want to add
something?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yeah. I would just add Elyse. This was six months ago, the idea of returning if we couldn't
deploy it would have been tougher. Now it's -- we're trading about 142% of book. I think as
of this morning over three years, that's 12% plus getting closer, not at, but closer to where
we are. So, it's not impossible, but we're looking to deploy in our businesses, first and
foremost.

A - Constantine Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Exactly, on the PMI note, that's a good question you're asking, it's going to be asked.
Currently, we don't see any change in our capital plan. We're totally -- everything is in line.
It's going to be some changes, we can't talk about it, but it's already within the plan and
budget. So, nothing to talk about.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

You're right. So, that might add 1 bps point to your expense ratio, I guess. So, my first
question is on the pricing outlook, it looks like the January renewals have been sort of
modest increase, given what you know today and what's your outlook for new year
renewals? And how much rate increase you would need for you to get back in the
property cat reinsurance business, or increase riding on that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Constantine Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yeah, we talked about last quarter I think the number I put in the ground for to make it
valuable, in terms of to get back to historical returns, we would want from the property
cat perspective, precisely because of the volatility around it. We would have won about
30% increase. And now where we are, we probably gained anywhere between 5% to
10%. So, we would need not an insignificant amount of rate increases. So, one thing I'll tell
you about the middle of the year, this is property cat exposed business insurance or
reinsurance, they're very, very similarly in terms of rate needs.
It's too early to tell. I think there's a lot of adjusting for position in the marketplace. One
thing that surprise us, I'll tell you for January 1 and it might be another reason, why we're
bit conservative in our comments is that, capital does not seem to go away at all if
anything -- I think capital has been increased as 1-1 renewal. And the capital is committed
for one year. So, maybe we would expect very similar round of rate change by mid-year.
We think it should be much bigger than this, much higher than this, but we may not be
able to get this because of the microeconomic forces of supplying the amount of capital
potentially.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. That's great. And then switch to MI, just have a couple questions there, one is the
delinquency going up for the quarter sequentially, because you think the impact from
hurricanes will be one-time rather than long-term trends in terms of delinquency trends.
And then the second, what's your run rate do you think on your -- like expense ratio as
well as the acquisition ratio is like 2017 would be a good run rate going forward?

FINAL

Yes. Delinquencies are getting better and we have our delinquencies, the case of
delinquents that we have on our portfolio, if you exclude, to your point, the recent storms,
it is still decreasing and sequentially as it with everybody else in the sector. We have seen
a blip about 3,200 new claims. We think it's kind of hard to see through all the claims
specifically, but we estimate about 3,200 claims from the storms. You're quite right, it's a
blip. It went up from one quarter, we expect the fuel rate for those claims as you heard
from other people to be very, very high.
Typical delinquency now that we see that non-hurricane related, probably cures tune to
the tune of 87% to 92%, the ones on the storms are going to be way -- expect north of
95%. But you're right. So blip, we have to recognize it. There were some reserves put
aside for this, as a result of that event. But we are expecting this to be a blip and go away.
As of recent, I think the Mark, we have already a decrease in claim, yes 3,200 at the end
of the year, I think of January, I believe. We already have 400, that cured. So, we expect it
to be fully curing, also we should know, probably you've heard about some other call that
Fannie and Freddie had put programs to stay any delinquency to give people credit and
give some leniency on that payment -- on the payment of the storm to recognize the rest
on which they are, for the storm. So, anything that we hear and see indicates that it
certainly will repeat itself, and there will be a blip that goes away in a large part.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

And if I -- Marc, didn't mention, I apologize if he did. But when you adjust for those
hurricane-related without the delinquency rate 1.9 [ph] it's virtually flat with the prior by
quarter end. So, that really accounts for. As far as your second question on expenses, for
the quarter the segment was 20, little over 22. We have to keep in mind is, yes, we're
growing on our premium and you got the AIG quota share session starting to wane
marginally a bit. But as I commented on in the prepared comments, the deferred
acquisition costs were zero on the UGC transaction. So, they are building back up and
being amortized. So, I would not to give crazy guidance, but I would say at best, it would
marginally improve from the 20 to 21 [ph]. So, that's I can do for you.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

I'm sorry. One quick question, just in terms of modeling. Do we have sense as to how
much the acquisition expense ratios have been impacted, not counting the fourth quarter
LPT for excise taxes?

FINAL

A - Constantine Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

The only real impact you're really seeing a significant is in mortgages, we talked about. I
mean there is some growth in NWP, as Marc has delineated on a written basis. But the PC
side is really not -- to date has not really impacted, it's really at the mortgage side.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. And can you -- I'm not sure I'm asked this. But can you talk about the --

A - Constantine Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

I'm sorry, Meyer, yeah, you did have a second point is, now I can just pointed out to me.
The FET on the 13.6 million was reflected in the reinsurance group's acquisition ratio. It's
all expensed. So, it's five point plus.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Right okay. You know I got that. Thank you. I was wondering if you could talk about the
analog to trend in the mortgage insurance business, whether that's changing? You talk a
little bit about pricing getting more competitive.

A - Constantine Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yeah. The trend -- well, the trend in loss trend really the equivalent for the MI is the trend
in credit riskiness of the underlying policyholder, or mortgage interest policy. And for this
one, we're not seeing a significant amount of changes, in the regular -- in the regular is to
be average lender, a borrower. But having said this, if you look at the overall MI portfolio,
there is an increase for instance a 95 and above LTV. So, you do have an underlying
riskiness of the portfolio that has changed over the last two years. So, the single, who are
already there, they're not necessarily more risky, they are just a different, they are in
economic discussion and which we have lowered as you know. But the two elements that
are getting riskier in the marketplace are the 95 plus LTV, which I mentioned, which are
supported by the GSEs. And the second is the DTI above 43, which is an another one that
is encouraged by the duty to serve aspect of the overall mortgage risk provider.
So, these two elements are not -- actually not insignificant, right. I think the DTI over 43
[ph] is about 20% of the NIW for the MI industry and the 95% plus LTV has grown to 12.5%.
So, the overall risk of the portfolio is increasing as a result of that specific phenomenon.
But if you look at the -- but it's actually buffeted to some extent by house prices
depreciation going up and affordability still being at a very healthy level. The DTI for the
average borrower still below 30%, which is lower than historical value. So, I think it's -- at
the margin, the volatility around the expected I guess is increasing a little bit, you don't
have necessarily an average risk going up significantly. So, does that makes sense?

A - Constantine Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Let me just add a little color. What Marc said is absolutely correct. But I want you to
understand that a risk price methodology, adjust for the riskiness and for that reason, our
reduction in exposure has been mostly in the 95 LTV and above. And of course, singles
that we have been mentioning for the last three quarters. Just a little more color.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Thanks, and also congratulations, Dinos, on retirement as well as the outstanding
career. Question first is on the MI business, I'm just curious on your thoughts on the
competition that you kind of highlighted. Do you anticipate the tax reform will have any
kind of incremental pressures with respect to pricing in the MI business?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I think from at a high level, Brian, I think, once investors look at returns after tax. Most of
the US MI provider of capital of US MI business are US based, therefore, US taxpayers. So,
I would expect in general for that should mean everything else being equal, which should
never is that the returns would increase for the US MI provider. Therefore, the question is,
is that will be -- will that be okay with this, will investor expect a higher return, or that the
risk change in any significant way.
So, I think all has been equal, I would expect the market has been such not only in MI
specific, it's also a PMC in any market for that matter phenomenon that if there is more
money left after you paid the taxman that there was an adjustment for the returns. So, we
would expect to have some kind of effect, I don't think, we're seeing it quite yet, because
as we all know collectively, the PMIERs 2.0 on the horizon and that might taper somewhat
what happens over the next 6 or 7 quarters. Probably we don't have a crystal ball as you
know, but all of being equal, when tax rate go down, when there is more money available
for shareholders, everything else being equal and we would expect price to go down
slightly, yes, it would.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

And I'm just curious, Marc, in your 15% kind of return assumption the base minimum, if
you're looking for the MI business. What is the tax rate that you're assuming on that?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Mark, can you just (multiple speakers).

FINAL

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yeah, we would expect an incremental benefit now, Brian. Of course, the 35% to 41% that
we have it's all US, we have US tax group that goes beyond mortgage, of course, it's all
very -- but that's -- may I have already talked about, the other US stock companies
benefiting enormously. If you have other US-based income, you are benefiting too, just as
we are.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

And we said, you know, -- and Brian, we said we are meeting the 15% return, which means
by implications above that.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Right, right, right. So, I'd just see it's 35% is what the tax rate you were using, and I guess
will be 21%, not kind of your blended tax rate with the quota share offshore?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Well, before we were paying 35 would -- there was a quota share to ARL for capital
management purposes. So, I would blend it to 17.5% absent the SET on the other side,
now which the 21% for what's in the US and there's a quota share, although, we have to
weigh that with the D-tax that comes in to play as well. So, we are sort of somewhat
similar in a similar position after-tax and we were before it's not improved slightly as Mark
mentioned.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

(Multiple speakers)

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah. Perfect. And then another one just curious here Watford just looking at the results
continue to have fairly high combined ratio this year. What is the kind of outlook right now
for Watford as we think about it?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I think its purpose is still very much alive. I mean we have other guys coming up with total
return reinsurance still as of yesterday, I believe, it was announced in the marketplace. So,
I think that one thing that happened to Watford is that they were essentially participating
on the property cat portfolio and just sort of happened to run into the 2017 cat as well. So,
the question is, was this appropriate, then we can the back and be money, money quarter
back [ph].

FINAL

But at the core of what Watford is doing, we are -- there is no much change for its
purpose and is still very much alive and what it's doing, the reinsurance play as you guys
remember was initially what we're trying to do get Watford into. There has been a shift
over the last six quarters, as I mentioned the reinsurance market in terms and conditions
that progressively worse since we establish Watford Re, there is a push for Watford to
become more of an insurance provider in the US and that will certainly help those kinds of
combined ratio and volatility specifically around the results.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

And I think another Brian, a good characteristic to keep in mind, is they are north of 50, I
think they are 55% in the quarter direct on their own paper, rather being said in last year.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. Helpful. Then last just quick one here in the MI business. Marc, is it possible to
give us what the kind of reduction you see on AIG quota share kind of a look like in '18
versus '17?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

In the premium side?

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah, the premium. Just like because most of the growth in that obviously right is the AIG,
you know, --

Thanks and good morning.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Good morning.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

And I would also like to echo my congrats to Dinos for being -- leading one of the top
value creator franchises out there. Two questions. The first question is going back to the
discussion on the insurance, AYLR. And I think you mentioned there was some movement
from the attritional losses. Can you just maybe just flush that out a bit more in terms of
how we should think about the underlying LR trend going forward? And does it drop off or
there is some volatility continue going forward?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Constantine Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Let me start it. I think the ongoing movement over the last few years, that Marc
highlighted in the past of smaller policies, lower limits continues to constrict the volatility,
which is part of the game plan. And large attritional losses you still will occasionally get,
we've got the fourth quarter of last year, you've got it again this year. It seems to be a
common theme on insurance and reinsurance and the onshore energy being the
exposure that's generating that, which is requiring different actions, say it, whether that
you have a common view of that across. So, I think the corrections for that are going to go
I think a long way towards stabilizing. And you can never say never, but that's a high
capacity business that can hit you with large pops.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

And just to be clear, there wasn't any adverse movement netting out against the
favorable movement in reserves?

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Nothing material. Okay. I guess, the only other question I have is, maybe a broader
question. And this is for Marc. Based on the transition, I was curious -- this obviously has
been in the pipeline for some time in terms of your role. Have there been times, when
you thought differently than Dinos? And strategically how do you think about Arch from
here going on forward?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

See, the best question -- the best way to answer -- I'll ask Dinos to try and to confirm what
I am going to say. But I think that Mark Lyons, myself, and Dinos worked together for over
16 years. We've had our differences in our agreements and disagreements. But by and
large, I think over time we find ourselves a lot more agreeing on things than not. I think
we're both -- and the three of us come from the very rational -- a very economically
rational way to analyze businesses and make decisions. And I think that something that is
sometimes missed or that you should appreciate that. And I think Dinos would echo this.
The strategic -- the strategic visions or strategic play that we've had and we did over the
last 16 years were not -- Dinos was certainly the proponent and one publicly advocating
and talking. But then all these things were really done and came to, as we talk together,
jumble our results were very instrumental on this as well. So, I think that we all grew
together in that environment and had more successes than failures. I think we don't do
everything right. But I think the overall -- I think we grew to agree more together, not
because I came to his view or he came to my view. It's because if you look for the truth
and look for the right rational thing to do, we sort of come up to the same all very often
and very similar conclusion. That's what I've noticed over that 16 years.

A - Constantine Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Let me give you my two cents on it. What Marc said is absolutely correct. First and
foremost, we're a very collaborative management team. And beyond that, we're very
collaborative with our Board of Directors. So, the alignment is to where we're going to go.
Yes, we do the groundwork. The management team does the groundwork. And Marc
mentioned himself and Mark Lyons and me, but there were others. Yeah, it's Nicholas and
there is Maamoun, and I can go on and on and on. And there is Mike Price and on and on
and on.
So, there is collaboration in examining what opportunities and where we're going to go.
And the good thing about it, is that when we arrive at a decision, then beyond is about
execution, it's not about. If I step back and I look at the past 16 years, I would put a 95%
plus agreement between the senior management team and the Board ratification of
where we wanted to go. The other 5%, I don't -- I will never call it as a major
disagreement. But directionally, maybe a little more to the right and a little more to the
left. And then at the end, we agree as to how we're going to do it. And I expect the future
to be pretty much in the same direction.

Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2018-02-13

Having said that, let me also address the other aspect of what we are as a company.
We're opportunistic. So, I don't know what opportunities will be detected in two years
from now, three years from now, four years from now. But I can say, me -- my duties as a
Director and being on the Board and the management team operationally, which
occasionally bring ideas up to the Board as to what we're going to do, that collaboration is
going to continue. But I can't tell you what the future is going to say. There is a change in
strategy. If there is a change, it's because based on our opportunistic approach to the
business, we see an opportunity in the future that wasn't present today or in the past as
we've done with the mortgage. None of us thought we're going to be in the mortgage
insurance business when we started it in '02 all the way until the financial crisis. And then,
after that, we saw the opportunity, you know, we worked on it first as a reinsurer. And
then, later on, we said, there is more value to be a primary insurer. And we took the steps
and the acquisition to get us there.
So, I don't -- I mean, it's a very important question. But I think we've done a great job in
not only transitioning leadership and building from within, which basically is another one of
our foundations. And a lot of our senior managers, they grow within the Arch culture. And
we like to promote from within. And we don't rely significantly on going and bringing
outside talent. But it makes it easier later on to execute the strategy because everybody
is in alignment. And I believe because we do have that collaborative culture. Listen, John
Vollaro officially retired in '09, right. I don't think anybody here thinks he ever retire, right.
Like I said, yes, you do retire. You don't -- you are not operational. John was not -- never
operational. I will never be operational. The management team's responsibility is to be
operational and make all those decisions. But they are for consultation. People are going
to call, we're going to discuss things. We are going to discuss them at the Board. And at
the end, I don't anticipate major changes, unless the market dictates this because there is
an opportunity that none of us is seeing today, but we might see it in the future.

to get you down there?

(Multiple Speakers) So, I was involved -- I worked on the IPO of Arch. So, it just goes back
many years. At that point, many of you remember there was a lot of companies coming
public and being formed, and they all sounded reasonably good, good risk management,
good underwriting, good management teams. And the question would often come up,
well, which ones are the best? And I would tell people like, ask me at about 15 years and
I'll have a good answer. Well, I think we have our answer now. Congratulations, Dinos.
Thank you.

A - Constantine Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yeah, well said. Thank you, Cohen. I'm getting old maybe. My eyes are getting watering
now.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. Your line is open.

Q - Ian Gutterman

Hi, thank you. I'll just follow-up, which Jay said, which is, as I recall around the same time,
Dinos, and you and John will remember these meetings well. Everyone giving your hard
time about Zurich and questioning your ability to be successful at Arch. I think a lot of
people regret they haven't given a board on sooner. So the --

That's a great motivator. Isn't it?

A - Constantine Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yes, absolutely.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

My first tongue-in-cheek question is, how can I sell my thunder here a little bit Marc. But
my first question is, will the menu change next quarter?

A - Constantine Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, I don't know. My duty is going forward is Board duties, choosing the menu for the
calls. I won't participate on the call, but I'm going to be talking to the chefs as to what they
are going to offer for lunch. And, of course, I will be available for golf games and dinners,
especially if I don't have to pick up the tab. So, you know my number. So, if it is good golf
games, if it is good dinners, and I'm always available.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

My follow-up question for you on that Dinos, is in your prepared remarks, when you talked
about Arch's secret sauce, I thought that was just a tzatziki.

A - Constantine Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

The tzatziki is true. This is my mother's secret sausage. I mean secret sauce, which is a lot
better than zanziki [ph]. And zanziki, every good restaurant have it.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Okay, that's good. So, serious questions. Last quarter we had a discussion about the cats,
as I'm sure you recall that. The so-called missing losses and the modeling agencies never
being write the first time and always being too low and how will this play out? And it
seems that the way is played out is actually the modeling estimates what you hide for
once and everyone's releasing results just three months out. So, I'm curious, now that you
have some more time to assess, what do you think -- what are the implications for that? I
mean, is there a reason to believe there is some -- there was a flaw in the models and we
might see them be high in the future, again, like this and we need to reassess how we
think about hurricane risk, or is just this was an anomaly and every once in a while they're
going to be way too high?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. So, if you look at that loss, Ian, we thought about it, most of the uncertainty and
change in our ultimate were in the reinsurance segment. So, if you look at loss, the high -Page 23 of 26

the difficulty in analyzing this loss was how widespread it was among many primary
companies. And then clearly that was not as concentrated as we thought it was. So, this
became clear to us after repeated discussion with our clients on the reinsurance side, I'm
talking. Insurance side we haven't changed much of our view. It's still the losses of the
losses we have and then it's not going away in a sense that we -- there were just let them
estimate. But on the reinsurance side, I'm not seeing that collectively as an industry that
might explain some of the exuberance that we've seen on other calls or in the January 1
renewal, that loss is largely an insurance loss.
So, that made it a lot harder. We are reinsurance, where most of our capacity on the cat is
allocated to the reinsurance. So, it was very hard at the end of last quarter to revalue
where loss was coming from. So I've ask our team in Bermuda to see what kind of return
period we're looking at for those kind of losses. And we are in 1 to 20, 1 to 30 years, so
it's not as unusual as you might think it is. So, I guess I would just describe due to the fact
that the losses spread out and the losses in California, which could have been more
concentrated, it's a significant loss, but is not significant enough that we will have that, that
much of an impact on -- certainly on the reinsurance segment and on the broader
marketplace.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, I think it's still possibly also too early, there might be some losses develop afterwards,
there might be some creep of the policy language that may change things, these are
things that will have -- we'll have to see how they develop. But so far, you're right. I think
that the missing losses are, not missing that were probably not there to begin with,
specifically on the reinsurance side. Dinos, you want to add.

A - Constantine Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

I would pick up what Marc said. I mean, yes, the losses in the aggregate I mean is three
losses and then you have the California fires and all that. You're still over 100 billion.
You're still over a 100 billion. So, this is not what I would call a small event. But as Marc
said, the most of the absorbed -- these losses came by the primary rider. And for that
reason the reinsurance market and especially some of the -- what you will call alternatives
capital did not get hurt as much as potentially could have been hurt . And for that reason
that capacity remain in the marketplace and it got easily reloaded et cetera, and that has
an effect as to how you're going forward with the rate. I don't know if Marc and his
comments was more specific.
In the primary property arena, we've seen gradual improvement on the pricing that is not
diminishing, it happened in December and is continuing in January and at the end of the
day, I anticipated it would -- it's going to continue, because that's where they heard this.
Most of the losses they are getting paid by the primary company. Now it didn't affect the
reinsurance as much, and for that reason, I think there is capacity is plentiful and rates
have now escalated based on what we were anticipating. Marc mentioned 5% to 10%,
which is not what we want. If you were 30%, which it would have met our threshold, you
would have seen us writing a lot more cat business than --

The only chapter we haven't seen I think the last of is, the Maria loss in Puerto Rico. That's
the only -- that's the only what I would say, I would throw back at you Ian and saying, it's
still not too early, but we still have to see how that one develops. I think Harvey and Irma
are pretty much came down right now.

FINAL

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Let me just throw once again, Ian, I know you asked an industry question. But as it relates
to Arch, especially with Dinos' and Marc's comments about the primary side. I, in the
prepared remarks made the comments that there were reinsurance releases three and
facultative. As facultative is sister process, rest in our portfolio, similar to insurance. But
attachment point saves you there and the primary guys are ground up, whereas -- in fact
the facultative unit is very skilled were to attach.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

I guess I was trying to ask something a little bit different I guess more than sort of the
pricing impact or the return periods is more about -- it seems like damageability across
the events, across all three events was a lot less than we all would have thought. And to
be honest, Marc, it's not just the reinsurance, the primary is being HARP for release,
Allstate release, travel is released and Big Dollars, right. So, everyone's released, it
seems like it is damageability per claim has been a lot less in the models expected. I'm
wondering if there is some -- is that an anomaly, or do we think there's something
meaningful in there that might make us reassess how we think about cat risk?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Constantine Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, the only thing I would tell you, Ian is -- and I live in Florida, I mean, Marc, while on the
high hit right over my house et cetera. My house had very little damage to maybe
20,000, because it's built with a new standard. So, it's cat-5 type of a home. And for that
reason, the damage I had it was minute. But I can tell you, when I drive around Marco
Island, most of the roof damage has not been repaired yet. There is still tarps and believe
me there is price escalation. I have a neighbor that he lost 30 tiles in his roof and the
cheapest price he got to repair, it was $4,000, that's over a $100 a tile, I mean. And he
says, I'm not getting water in the house so, I'm not going to repair it because -- I'm going
to wait for prices to come down, but there is still -- there might be a little creep that we
haven't seen yet.
