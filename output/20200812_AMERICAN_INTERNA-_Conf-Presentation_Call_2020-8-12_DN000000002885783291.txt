Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning, everybody. This is Brian Meredith, I'm the insurance analyst here at UBS.
Apologies for all the technical difficulties we've been having here. But we are here for the
AIG fireside chat. With us with us today, we've got Mark Lyons, who is the Chief Financial
Officer of AIG; Sabra Purtill, the Deputy CFO; and Shelly Singh, who is in charge of Investor
Relations for AIG.
Mark has got a couple of quick comments he's going to give, and then I'm going to get
right into the fireside chat and the questions. Mark, I'll hand it over to you.

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Great, Brian. And thank you. And so rather than take up a lot of time on pre-comments,
especially that it's been cut short a little bit, I'd rather just get into a lot of the questions. I
think first of all, thanks again Brian for inviting us for two days. And so we're very, very
happy to be here.
We think AIG is very well positioned right now, both from a capital liquidity, subsidiary
capital and liquidity perspective as well as taking full advantage of the marketplace on the
General Insurance side. But you know, and there's other aspects in the quarter you guys
will probably ask about. So, Brian, why don't I just hand it back to you?

Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes, let's just go ahead. So the first kind of broad question, Mark. So as I look 12 months
from now, if you look back on the impact of COVID-19 on the P&C insurance industry and
life industries, what do you think the long-term implications are? And how is AIG position
to respond?

Well, it's a -- you started off with a crystal ball question. So let's see how good my crystal
ball is. So -- well COVID, I think it's clear, has been an accelerant in the -- certainly in the PC
marketplace. The market was already, I think, hardening pretty materially. So I deem this
an accelerant rather than a cause. AIG, so it's done -- it's lifted all boats, if you will. I think,
AIG has been taking maximum advantage of the marketplace and using our breadth and
influence and pricing power and so forth to really push things, but really across the board.
But I think the reason we are positioned is because of all those couple of years of hard,
hard underwriting changes and redefining appetites, and having a protective reinsurance
structure and so forth and so on, that you've heard us talk about before. I think longer
term, there's going to be fewer businesses to ensure maybe that's medium term, Brain
more than anything else on that.
On the L&R side, whether that affects long-term mortality or not, my -- I mean the
actuarial review, assumption review for us will happen throughout the third quarter. But
based on what I've seen to-date, I would really believe it's going to affect things longterm. It could be like a blip, but that blip would only come to pass to be elevated, if
there's feeling of secondary, longer-term issues associated with COVID. So deep-tissue
organ damage, things of that nature that prolong on. But we have to wait and see on that,
and I think there'll be some as a result of fewer businesses and other aspects is probably
more credit hits coming in across various industries, affecting everyone differently. But I
think the net-net is for the medium-term, smaller insurable exposures.

Bloomberg Transcript

Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great, thanks. So first question is for you, Mark. So COVID-19 charge you took in the
quarter was based on claims activity to the first and second quarters. I guess the question
is, does this mean that you're likely to have more COVID-19 development here in the next
12-months? And if so where do you think it likely to come from?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Well I think Sabra and I will ham and egg this a little bit. Let me just start off more
conceptually and then I think Sabra can pick it up on some of your more detailed question
aspects. But -- so I think from an industry perspective and then I'll give AIG's view on this is
-- I think we've been -- we've attempted to be clear on how we've done it, why we've
done it. And why we've taken some of the coverage positions that we have. But more
broadly, I think there's confusion in the marketplace. Whether it's because of commentary
or misinterpretation of commentary or what have you. But the way I look at things and the
gray hair that I've amassed over these 40-years, is we have to watch reaching forward
and try to reserve today for actions that have not yet occurred. Now I'm talking specifically
from a PC perspective.
So why do I bother talk about that. Firstly, it's the responsibility of any property casualty
company to reserve as of the balance sheet date for all accidents that have occurred on
or prior to that date on an ultimate basis, management's best estimate on an ultimate
basis. So at the end of the first quarter, it was for accidents that occurred 3/31 or prior. At

Page 2 of 13

Company Ticker: AI G US Equity
Date: 2020-08-12

FINAL

the end of the second quarter at 6/30 or prior, whenever you look to first quarter, so forth
and so on. So if an accident hasn't occurred yet, you shouldn't reflect it.
And the secondary question would be, why not? And the answer to that is, that's the
function of your unearned premium reserve. When you write a $100 policy on day one, all
$100 are unearned and there is a loss provision in there. Let's say, $70 loss ratio. So $70 is
associated with accidents that will occur as that exposure earns over time. So to have a
loss reserve up for a future occurrence and to have a -- on a premium reserve up for a
future occurrence is overlapped, and I don't think any accounting firm would actually ever
allow that. So therefore, there's got to be -- it's going to be a misinterpretation. AIG has
done what I said, which is we look at all the coverage triggers across all the policy forms
that are out there and reflect what's occurred at that point in time.
The reason I say coverage trigger is because, event cancellation is a good example of
one where you're noticed earlier, say, then the 6/30 date for a sporting event that's
effective in October, let's say, and the decision is made prior to 6/30, as well to cancel by
the bank that's the trigger to reflected into your statements as of 6/30 not waiting until
the October sporting event. So in that way it reflects and it's consistent with what I just
said. But I wanted to clear that up from a -- I think an industry confusion point of view. And
with that, I'd say, Sabra to throw in her $0.02 on this.

Bloomberg Transcript

Sabra Purtill

{BIO 1764408 <GO>}

Yes, sure. So just as a reminder, we put up about $730 million of COVID-related reserves
year-to-date. About 70% of those are for business interruption/property, where we have
affirmative coverage for infectious disease, combined with what we put up for
contingency and travel. Obviously, as we looked into the second quarter, we did see
some reserves that we put out for some other lines, including trade credit, marine, some
on casualty, workers' comp, A&H financial lines and then some in our reinsurance business.
As we look towards the second half of the year, I would expect that where we would see
claims are going to be more on those. What I would call lines that are impacted by the
continuing economic crisis as opposed to exposure to the disease itself so trade credit
would be an example, for instance.
But, as Mark said, it will reflect the claims activity and events that occur in the third or the
fourth quarter. As we believe that we have reserves that are ultimate for what has been
reported to us to-date for the -- through the second quarter.

Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great, thank you. So second quarter commercialized pricing AIG, up 16%. I guess the
question I have here is one, do you think that continues to accelerate here and for how
long? And then on that topic, I know Peter mentioned something about diversification of
the commercial lines portfolio, what areas was he referring to?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Okay, thanks for that. So I guess a couple of things. As Peter highlights on the calls, the
North American commercial segment, reportable segment because that's where most of
the changes have occurred, that's where AIG had applied the most surgery. And the
reason for that is, that's where it's been a recurring problem for AIG over the years. So I
think you leave with where the most correction was made. So the comment about 16%
overall, I think you went further to say that it was 21% in commercial North America and
10% internationally. And when you dissect that a little bit further, I think on a prior call, we
had talked about the UK already being at 10% and that's continue to accelerate, which
means therefore non-UK is less than 10%, but it is increasing in an increasing way.
So we see none of these areas abating, we see no evidence of a debating. And we still
had seen things increasing in an increasing way, which I think is good news for everyone.
So the reason I brought up the focus on North American commercial Brian, is because
what can get lost in the sauce is personal lines business. And when you look at the Japan
book in total, for example, that's $5 billion or $35 billion, just 15% of the book is basically
getting one or two points, which weights and mute the overall results down pretty
materially in that regard.
And similarly in lines like action and health and some of the others, which are very
predictable year in and year out, but are really aren't a rate issue. So you get these
flattening aspects to it. So I wanted to bring that up. In terms of diversification on
commercial lines, I think it means more a function of where are the opportunities and
therefore where you're going to put time, attention, the capital into those opportunities
that are both improving the most rapidly on a relative basis and providing going from red
to green or yellow to green, so that there, it hits profitability return standards. So you can
accelerate, writing more business there and perhaps keeping more net there. So I think
that it really constitutes a mix change that will be different a year from today than it is
today.

Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got it, thank you. Next question, so how is commercial lines pricing relative to loss cost
trends? You think that with this 16% average price increases margin should be expanding
pretty materially from here. And from the second quarter call, you've kind of sounded like
you're taking a cautious view on loss trend particularly related to social inflation. Maybe
you kind of clarify that a little bit for us?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Sure, sure. Well, I think some of what we can talk about is really derivative from your prior
question actually. But I don't think, I really said much different than I said in the past. I think,
I've talked about a range of one or two points on some lines up to upper, knocking on the
door of double-digits and some other areas and I think, I pointed out excess casualty and
commercial auto in those as well.
So I think it's still within that framework. I think, I've talked about the social inflation in the
past on prior calls, as well as -- and there were conferences. So I think it's been fairly
consistent with that. So it's really with regard to the expansion of it, and I think it's clear, I
Page 4 of 13

FINAL

mean, let's take North America Commercial. You're getting 21% rate increases, I think it's
pretty clear, you're going to have margin expansions. I don't think anyone on the call
would be thinking we're having 21% loss cost trend at this point and therefore everything
stays flat.
So I think it's reasonable to expect that there's going to be margin expansion, but it's not
going to be uniformly felt. Going back to our prior discussion, I think it's safer to say in a
rank order, there should be a more of that coming through North American Commercial,
probably followed by International Commercial and then followed by Personal Lines Areas.
So I think that's one kind of view of few.
And secondly, as I kind of alluded to it comes down, you can't just look your rate changes,
you have to look at where you are given those rate changes and making sure that's where
you want to really invest capital for expansion. And the good part, though is, I think we
showed the 6% and 7% increase in net written premium, even with new business down,
this shows the strength of the renewal pricing and the retention we've been able to
maintain to get that kind of growth. So we've been so defensive, right? Now, we can see
some offense coming in on that, and there should be some expansion, but there's still
that uncertainty on some aspects of loss cost trends. So I think we talked about this once
before that we've been implementing a reserve philosophy that's a lot more let's
recognize bad news quickly and good news more slowly. And I think you'll see that
reflected on a go-forward basis as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

Sabra Purtill

{BIO 1764408 <GO>}

Yes and Brian, I would just add to that, that really strongly encourage people, particularly
because of the impact on personal insurance with the travel business, as well as the
syndicate changes that they really need to look at AIG's combined ratios on a segment
basis. So for North American Commercial lines for the quarter, we improved 320 basis
point, for international it is 500; year-to-date North American Commercials improved by
200 and internationals 180. So clearly, we are building margin in the book on of
commercial lines basis.

Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. That makes sense, and given where pricing is relative to trend right now, you
think that trend should continue to be pretty good?

Sabra Purtill

{BIO 1764408 <GO>}

Yes.

Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Let's see next question here. Generally, I'm just curious here, how much lower does your
combined ratio target need to be today versus let's call it last year at this time? In order
to achieve an acceptable return on capital given the interest rate environment with the
kind of decline we've seen?
Page 5 of 13

FINAL

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Yes, that's a weighted average question. I mean, but I think we can go back to the same
kind of commentary, we've done in the last couple. As Sabra just said, that's a function of
each segment, with each got it's own characteristics. European trends -- America has 70%
of the world's players, right? So -- which -- a catch phrase, I always use which just
highlights the fact that things are going to be different in different areas of the world. But
we're going to get that margin expansion, when if you guys look at things on the
componentry of an ROE and you look at leverage, I think it's pretty clear, when you look at
AIG, you're closer to one for one premium to equity ratio on the GI side but you're closer
to 3.3, 3.4, I think on invested assets. So the leverage associated our ROE from a change
plus or minus in the NII yield, because that's operating view right, that's a total return
that's unrealized in there is more impactful. So to the extent that you want to stay even, I
don't care what your target is, you're going to have to make up for it more, because of
the leverage difference on equity. So it's not proportional.
So if you're going down 100 basis points in ROE, because of reduced NII, you can't just go
100 basis points in the combined ratio, you're going to have to go more. And I think I'm
informing you, when you look at those relativities on leverage between invested assets
and premium to surplus that guide you, so what it is, you have to do.

Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, thanks. That's helpful.

Sabra Purtill

{BIO 1764408 <GO>}

Yes. And I would just add, kind of like back of the envelope, I think the way to think about it
is, you got to look at the duration of the investment portfolio. Our portfolio in AGI about 3,
3.5 years on duration. So as you lose about -- if you were to lose like 10 basis points of
yield on the total portfolio that's maybe 25 to 30 bps on the ROE as opposed to 50 basis
points on the combined ratio gives you 30 to 40 bps. So there is obviously a balance. But,
as Mark said, it's the impact on the ROE is -- comes much more from the combined ratio
improvement, then it would be detracted by the yields.

Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. Makes sense.

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

The other thing -- I just want to add, Brian, on top of that very, very quick, on Sabra's point,
is that you can't talk about a combined ratio without talking about duration. And whether
we're of 1.5 year duration in Property Casualty business, let's say assuming captive first,
excess work comp, which is 16 to 17 years. And your decision to grow there is more a
function of interest rates been pricing, that's going on is -- has to be reflected. And -- and
Sabra's point of us being 3.5 years. Let's say an average duration, that's not a huge -- a

Page 6 of 13



Company N ame: American I nternational Group I nc
Company Ticker: AI G US Equity
Date: 2020-08-12

monolithic block. There's radically different targets across the board as a function of that
duration.

FINAL

Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes, great. Okay, lets pivot over to, why Syndicate 2019, been a high topic the last quarter.
Maybe you can go through kind of the economics of the transaction of your fee income, a
CD commissions. Is this dilutive to earnings? And then another question, how much capital
is actually freed up by the transaction, so maybe it's ROE-accretive, but earnings dilutive
initially?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, I think, Sabra and I will ham and like this one as well, so we provided some guidance
or info to you, which was -- on the last call, which was for the North American Personal
Insurance segment, as we reported, which has more than PCG in it, but I know you're
trying to help you guys in totality, was $425 million of net written and $345 million of net
earned is kind of the average by quarter, each quarter that we might expect for 3Q and
4Q. So there's that.
I think secondly, you've got a couple of other consequences associated with that unlike a
weighted average impact the loss ratio and expense ratio. And Sabra, I think will go into
that a little bit more, but it changes that mix a bit, but it has created some havoc on GOE,
if you will, in that area because you have this both out of premium. So you have a
depressed premium size, and when you get to some of the businesses like, travel and
other things for in there, you're still carrying those GOE costs of underwriting and sales
and call centers and whatever else you've been there.
Especially if you expect travel business to not be a long-term sustained hurt industry, and
therefore travel insurance supporting the travel industry, and we don't view that as a longterm. We view that as transient, so why would I get rid of all the underwritting -- the
systems, everything else that we have associated with it. So that's a distortion that can
come in for a while and it could be other noise as well in the balance of the year dealing
with, like CAD costs and how that's shared amongst all the capital providers and
everything else in there. So, and that noise will oscillate its way out. So as I think -- as I said
on the call going into 2021, we're going to have a much different view of us being back to
mid to lower '90s in that. And -- but to your point on how does that affect our recognition
or our revenue model. Instead of being a 100% underwriter now, we now have a
distributed capital model, it was one of the last things, Peter and his team really have the
focus on, because we had a lot of bites at the apple on that, you're under any side,
because renewals over multiple years. But this continued to be a spike in the
concentration risk in CAT. As the old joke goes, rich people like to live together and they
like the live on the coast, so you get -- you can't really avoid that concentration risk. So
there's other ways to ameliorate, spread that.
So we'll ultimately wind up as you segue into 2021 with about 25% net on that in terms of
enjoying the underwriting gain associated with it. And the rest of morphs into more of an
MGA model where we have fee income and possibly some reinsurance overrides
Page 7 of 13



Company N ame: American I nternational Group I nc
Company Ticker: AI G US Equity
Date: 2020-08-12

associated with that, reinsurance that will find its way into the AP ratio and the fee income,
which I will have to put a loss reserve up against that drops through, but I hope that
answered your question.

FINAL

Sabra Purtill

{BIO 1764408 <GO>}

Yes. And I would just add, the way I think the way people should think about it for the
second half of the year is because we still have expenses in the travel business. Although
we're not really getting any earned premium from right now. Combined with just the -what I would call kind of the impact of the syndicate. I would look at the personal lines
business has being kind of breakeven from an underwriting basis, obviously, depending
on what happens with CATs for the portion that we retain, there might be some impact
from that as well.
But then as you look going forward for 2021, hopefully, we'll have a travel business back,
but the premium itself will be much smaller going forward for the personal lines business.
And hopefully we'll have cut off the tail on underwriting volatility is really I think one of the
things that I keep trying to remind people of is for personal lines, you can't really look at it
is excluding CATs, because that is one of the major loss drivers of a personal lines book,
particularly a heavily dominant homeowners book like we have in PCG. And then as we
get to year end and we've rolled this portfolio or at least 75% of it. Fully into the syndicate
the back of the envelope with respect to your question about capital, it's maybe roughly
$500 million of capital a little free up. So you will see that for your year-end RBC numbers.

Bloomberg Transcript

Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got it. Makes sense. I've got a couple of questions coming in and just wanted to get a
clarification on my last question. Mark when we talked about, interest rates in effect on
kind of combined ratios and stuff. I guess the question is as you think about the interest
rate environment. Have you actually lowered your ROE expectations on underwriting?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

On an explicit basis, no. And I think what it really implies is that, this is a great market right
now and this is a market where you attempt to get within reasonable asset as much as
you can out of it and don't limit yourself to -- and a line of business ex ROE, which you can
actually get more, so that those areas are going to be pushed very hard, especially when
you look at the elasticity between rate change and retention, so there's a lot of focus on
that.

Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay, great. Next question, actually I got another one coming in here from the audience.
In terms of emerging market strategy, how do you see your business in Latin America
going forward? And are you contemplating any strategic alternatives there?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}
Page 8 of 13



Company N ame: American I nternational Group I nc
Company Ticker: AI G US Equity
Date: 2020-08-12

Well, it's kind of hard to comment on it not that large for us now. I think a lot of people, it's
tempted to grow by going through the Brazilian reinsurance approach. AIG had gotten out
a lot of Latin American areas the past regime before the current regime that in, that
probably worthy of a revisit I'll leave it like that.

FINAL

Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. Okay, another one actually just came in with respect to your ceded reinsurance.
Obviously, you've done a massive rework of your ceded reinsurance program really lower
volatility should we -- given the reinsurance markets have kind of firmed up here too.
Should we expect that that's going to be a bigger cost here going forward or could we
start to see you guys retain more risk as your book kind of improves here?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

A couple of -- great question. A couple of good views of that, first off on the dovetailing
on Sabra's comments back about capital, with the structure changes on the high net worth
business -- PCG business that on a forward basis should make the structure of our CAT
program, maybe in the first program cheaper for AIG, because you don't have that kind of
concentration aspect in there and it's in, but into a much lesser extent. And so on a goforward basis everything else is being even for a minute, you could enjoy cheaper
programs going forward.
Now on the second part of it any company should be reevaluating its reinsurance
structure as a function of the -- not just the marketplace, but what the marketplace is
doing to your view of the gross profitability, so to the extent that you want to retain more,
because either the volatility you feel is better and the odds of making that profit are
better. You may wind up ceding less. So -- and if you have demonstrated a material
change in the book of business, that's audited by reinsurers and verified by reinsurers.
You have a strong argument for actually ceding commission a positive change. So just look
at it this way, in certain pockets there is an opportunity to grow on the front-end and
possibly they grow because compoundedly, because of less session out the door.

Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. Makes sense. Here's another one that could just came in I think it's a good one
here. So, if we take a look at what your stock's trading right now obviously valuations really
low. And I think we could probably to be part of that to the life insurance aspect of your
business, right? If life insurers are trending pretty low, but even on some of the parts at
least from my math, it's still looks really, really cheap here. The question then becomes,
what kind of thought have you kind of put into maybe breaking up the GI and the life
insurance businesses here, would AIG be better off actually having two separate
businesses. Being two separate companies, publicly traded, whatever it is?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Yes, well I don't think that's not been in Management and the Board's mind. I mean that
kind of thing always is thought of, going back to years and years and years ago before I
Page 9 of 13

joined the company. So, I mean with the tax reform, of course the DTA argument
lessened, right, because of what you'd lose on foreign tax credits and NOLs, but it's still
there. It's still a big number. Let alone the diversification loss and capital that you get,
mostly from the rating agencies. What I think of diversification loss, I don't think of our
internal capital, because that's inside baseball, what are your real binding constraints on
capital, which is generally external, these rating agency forces and others. So it's the
diversification change associated with their view of it. And the combination of those two
things are still material, but I don't want you to think that it's not something that
management would routinely strategically, think about. Sabra, anything you want to add?

Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got it.

Sabra Purtill

{BIO 1764408 <GO>}

Yes, look, I would just add that, those two reasons that are there still obviously significant
for shareholders and would have a significant impact on shareholder value creation. But I
would just note that strategically, there's no reason why our GI business needs to have an
L&R business they have separate sales force and separate operations and the rest.

Bloomberg Transcript

Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. Makes sense. Let's see, next one, given where we are with current yields. I
guess, it sounded like on the recent conference call that you're not expecting base
spreads to kind of be greater than kind of -- greater contraction that original kind of
forecast was which you kind of laid out maybe remind us, kind of, what's the impact?

Sabra Purtill

{BIO 1764408 <GO>}

8 to 16.

Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes, the 8 to 16, is that, that's still what do you think, even though rates have come down
even from those levels. I think when you originally gave us the 8 to 16. And then maybe on
that topic. What kind of the outlook right now for sales and surrenders in the individual
business?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Do you want to take that Sabra?

Sabra Purtill

Yes, I'll start with that. Yes on 8 to 16, that is up from where we are seeing the
compression going back nine months ago or so, and obviously 100 basis point drop in the

10-year treasury over that time. But definitely put some pressure on the reinvestments.
But the reason why it's still in the 8 to 16 range, I would say is that first of all credit spreads
were a lot wider. So that has actually helped with some of that compression. Yes, we're
largely an investment-grade corporate investor in the life and retirement. And the other
aspect of it is that the portfolio duration of life and retirements like eight to nine years. So
there is only a certain amount of the portfolio that's rolling off.
There's actually been and it will be interesting to see how this changes your last year we
were seeing a lot more compression coming, because there is a really active tenders and
calls on corporate debt in the second quarter just with all the market disruption we had,
we didn't -- we had some other yield enhancement income, but it wasn't saw the same
impact. So what I would kind of point people to is keep the eye on credit spreads, as
much as you keep it on the risk free rate and keep an eye on what's happening with bond
call activity. Because that -- those are really the key drivers that would impact the spreads.

And then obviously the other thing in life and retirement is really what happens with our
alternatives. And that's been a tale of two cities so far, first quarter, we had negative
impact on the hedge funds, but the private equity as you know is reported on a one
quarter lag. So we had decent private equity returns in the first quarter. Second quarter,
we had big gains on hedge funds, because of the market. But then we booked to losses
on the private equity. So as you look into the third quarter, at least for private equity, we
know what the market was at the end of June. So knock wood, that should be a favorable
margin on the hedge funds. You tell me what the market looks like at 9/30, but so far this
quarter, it looks pretty decent, and that's -- like I said, that's another component of the
net investment income for life and retirement.

Makes sense. Okay, I know we're just about out of time here. And we've got other things
on the meetings to get to. Let me ask just one quick other question here assumption
reviews in third quarter, do you all with assumption grew in third quarter with your life
insurance business and any reads on potential charges, there?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

No, it's too early, Brian they're still go through that. But the only thing I could offer at this
point is my comment on mortality where it wasn't severe enough of a change from the
pricing assumptions that made us say, we got a -- let's front-load that into 2Q, so they're
going through that now. So I don't have any antenna, I don't have cilia vibrating.

Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you.

Sabra Purtill

{BIO 1764408 <GO>}

Yes and Brian. I would just add to that, because we have been asked for people about like
a one factor sensitivity for the change in the interest rate on the DAC, and I know some of

our peers do that, but just remember that the assumption study looks at everything. And
when you look at lower rates you're also generally looking at lower surrenders on the
products that you have that's fixed rate oriented. So it's not just one factor sensitivity, we
look at everything from mortality surrender activity policyholder behavior with respect to
utilization of guarantees, which is one area that can surprise you people don't always
behave economically and then obviously expenses market rate assumptions interest rate
assumptions and the rest, so it's really soup to nuts.

Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

All right, great.

Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

And just to highlight also Brian, what Sabra talked about before on spreads. Everybody
likes to focus on the 10-year bullet, right?

Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay.

And only one piece of the pie, right and only one piece of the pie. And one of our
competitors this quarter, who does their assumption in the second quarter. I think went
from a 3.75 to a 3.25 and we're already at 3.50. So on the bullet, if you will, that's just the
risk free, there's already not much of a difference.

Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Makes sense. Makes sense. Mark, Sabra, so I really want to thank you all for your time. I
apologize about all the technical difficulties here, but we got some good content good
discussion and really, really appreciate your time. And everybody, just want you to stay
safe, stay healthy and thanks for joining us.
