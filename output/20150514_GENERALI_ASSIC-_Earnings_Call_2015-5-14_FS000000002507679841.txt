MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to the Generali Group First Quarter 2015 Results Q&A Session.
Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference
over to Mr. Spencer Horgan, Head of Investor and Rating Agency Relations. Please go
ahead, sir.

Spencer Lee Horgan

{BIO 4241901 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our Q1 2015 results call. As the operator said,
we're ready to take your questions. But before we do that, I'll hand it over to Alberto for a
few brief opening remarks. Alberto?

FINAL

Thank you very much, Spencer, for this call. And thank you very much to all of you for
being on this call. I will just give you some numbers and some very short remarks on the
very strong operating performance of the group in this first Q 2015.
Our volume of premiums has exceeded to €20 billion with a very strong performance in
the Life business and also I would say with a very good resilient performance in the P&C.
In the Life business, the growth of the unit-linked production is visible in every single
countries where we do operate. At the moment, one quarter of the entire new
production is based on unit-linked business.
The net income has increased by 3.3% to €682 million. And in terms of our profitability the
combined ratio is 93.3%, slightly above the combined ratio of the first quarter 2014. But
you have to remember that we pay a very huge price in terms of nat cat burden in the
first three months of the year.
In terms of capital, the Solvency I ratio has reached 168%. If we also consider the likely
outcome of the BSI transaction on a pro forma basis, we will reach 177% once we close
this transaction. And the net shareholder equity has increased to €26 billion, plus 12.5%.

Bloomberg Transcript

As we have noticed, we have not provided any information on our economic solvency
ratio and I will ask you to wait for our investor day in London. We will provide some
indication about the capital position based on our full internal model, based on Solvency II
principles.
And I would like to take this opportunity to convey the message that to the old model
anyway is in pension, and we are now starting a new phase of Generali, a new phase of
understanding our risk profile through the new fully running model that we have been
working on in the last two years.
I would now leave it to you for any questions you might have. Thank you.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. We will now take our first question and it comes from Gianluca Ferrari from
Mediobanca. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Gianluca Ferrari

{BIO 15042989 <GO>}

Yes. Hi, Alberto. Good morning. Three questions from my side. The first one is on the
current year loss ratio. I noticed that Q1 2015 has been a record ever with 67.5% if you can
elaborate a little bit on the reasons behind these very, very good result on the current
year loss? My second question is if you can give us an update as of today or the most

Page 2 of 23

FINAL

recent data you might have on the equity and the AFS reserve, so where we are today
with these two numbers.
And the third and final question, I will not ask you anything about economic solvency under
the new internal model. But during the full year 2014 conference call, you were telling me
that the economic solvency as at mid of March was more or less stable with full year 2014.
So, it was in the region of 157%. Can you confirm that the economic solvency at the end of
Q1 was in line with that at the end of full year 2014? Thank you.

A - Alberto Minali

{BIO 16909383 <GO>}

Thank you, Gianluca. Start from the first question, the current year loss ratio. Yes, it's very
low indeed. It's sort of a historical record, the 67.5%. I wanted to highlight two things. I'm
sorry to bother you on this. The reserving policy of the group has not changed at all. We
still keep a very prudent stance on the way we reserve the claims. This is just the 67.5%.
This further improvement is because of the very good quality of our underwriting. We
don't see signals at the moment of deterioration in the motor business, neither in terms
of frequency nor in terms of increased cost of claims.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, I will say that this improvement in the loss ratio of the current generation of business is
entirely due to our technical ability. If you also look at the slide on the combined ratio,
you'll see that the release of runoff is 4.2% versus 4.1%. Again, this is just an attritional
thing, nothing to do with any maneuver of reserves that what we might think of.
In terms of the available-for-sale reserve, this has decreased of €600 million vis-à-vis the
number we had of €8.8 billion at the end of the quarter. And so, we have lost roughly 3
percentage point of Solvency I because of the rally upward of the interest rate from the
end of the quarter until the end of April.
In terms of economic solvency, I will ask you to be patient and to wait until the investor
day, so a couple of days more, in London, and we will provide you with a lot of information
regarding the economic solvency position of the group. But certainly, it's more than
adequate.

Q - Gianluca Ferrari

{BIO 15042989 <GO>}

Thank you.

Operator
Our next question comes from Mr. Peter Eliot from Berenberg. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. I'll refrain from asking a direct question on the economic solvency,
but just if I look at the duration of your fixed income portfolio behind the Life business, I
see that increase by 0.5 years across the quarter. I'm guessing that the duration of your

Page 3 of 23

Date: 2015-05-14

FINAL

liability has nicely going up by a bit more than that. So, just wondering if you could
comment at all on what might have happened with the duration gap across the quarter.
And I guess related to that, if you can say anything about any sort of management actions
that you may or may not have taken to help as well? A second thing was I note that you
said you strengthened the policyholder reserves, and you gave a ZZR cost of net €27
million. Given where reference rates were at the end of the quarter, I guess that sort of
sounds roughly in line with what I would've expected. So, I was wondering if you could just
comment on whether you've done anything more than the minimum there.
Third and final question, I note that the acquisition cost ratios have gone up a bit both in
Life and non-life, admittedly partly driven by volumes. But I was wondering if you could just
sort of comment and perhaps give an outlook there? Thank you.

A - Alberto Minali

{BIO 16909383 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Peter, for the question. In terms of the duration of fixed income, in anticipation
of the market trend and I think the timing was really perfect, we have lengthened the
duration of our fixed income portfolio. But at the same time, due to the duration of the
liability, that does not change equal to 9.1 year. We have reduced the duration mismatch in
the Life business.
Bear in mind that the reinvestment has been done in an average rate around 2.5%. And
we have reinvested here roughly 3% of the stock. So, for the reinvestments we have
done, we have really increased the duration buying assets, especially corporate bonds in
the long-term part of the curve. But this has helped up to further reduce the mismatch,
and so to keep under control the absorption of capital for interest rate risk.
In terms of the ZZR impact, yes, the accounting with ZZR is driven by the regulation. There
is no maneuver behind ZZR, but I want to mention that in another country, for example in
France, in the first quarter, we have allocated €200 million of realized capital gains to the
reversement of this reserve, which when we inherited this company was very low, indeed,
and we have continuously reinforced this provision for facing interest rate volatility in the
French portfolio.
Going to your third question, yes, acquisition costs are up in the Life business and non-life,
mainly driven by volume. But I must say that in the P&C business, because of the slight
contraction of the premium portfolio in the motor and the higher production in terms of
non-motor business, which usually attracts a higher acquisition cost, it's not a matter of
volume. It's a matter of composition of the new production that we have underwritten in
the P&C business.
Predominantly, it's a volume effect. That's right. But for the P&C business, it's also a
switching effect from the motor one with – has a very low acquisition cost into more
sophisticated business which requires higher acquisition and also administration cost.

Thank you very much. Could I just quickly check on that first point that I understood you
correctly that the increase in the asset duration will have limited impact from higher liability
duration, but we shouldn't necessarily expect the gap to have come down. Is that correct
understanding?

FINAL

A - Alberto Minali

{BIO 16909383 <GO>}

Yes, it's correct. The gap between asset and liability last year was in the ballpark of one
year. This year is six months. So by shortening this gap, we make our Life business less
exposed to interest rate volatility. And we did have this room for lengthening the duration,
especially through the investment process.
We did the same also in the P&C business even if in the P&C business, the duration
mismatch has probably different meaning because the liability are not interest ratesensitive.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks a lot.

Our next question comes from James Shuck from UBS. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is
open.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two questions, please. Firstly, on
Italian Life sales, seen very strong flows, net flows, I think they doubled year-on-year in Q1.
Presumably that's being driven by the Valore Futuro product. I've got kind of two related
questions around this. Firstly, if the net inflows have doubled in Q1, could you just explain
why the APE growth is only up 3%? I can't quite seem to reconcile those in my mind.
And then related to the Italian sales, just on Valore Futuro, I mean, the charges are quite
high on this product and the crediting rates are quite generous partly because there's a
form of cross-subsidy between old business and new business. I guess my question is
that how sustainable are these assets going to prove? Because ultimately, gradually over
time, the crediting rate is going to re-price downwards, and policyholders are not going to
be quite as happy with the return that they're getting. So, how are you thinking about the
scope for outflows if yields stay where they are?
My next question is on French Life sales and I was interested to see that the APE was up
very strongly in Q1, close to 40%. Could you just explain how the margins are looking on
that business? Because at the end of 2014, I think your IRRs and payback periods were
around 6% and 10 years, respectively. So, that business doesn't seem particularly
attractive to me. So, I'm just struggling to see why you're selling so much of it. Thank you.

FINAL

Thank you. Let me start from your first question on the Italian Life sale and the strong net
inflows. Yes, it's driven by Valore Futuro. You know that we are using this hybrid product in
most of the countries in the group in order to push the sale of unit-linked business. And I
have to say that the savings business is acting as a sort of ancillary business for selling
more unit-linked, keeping very high the profitability of the whole production and of the
whole group.
So Valore Futuro explains a lot. You have to remember that in Italy, we had roughly €4.3
billion of net inflows, of which €2 billion are unit-linked and only €1.2 billion are savings and
pension. The Banca Generali network is doing a great job, but also the traditional sales
network of Generali Italy are doing a great job in switching the production towards unitlinked.
And this explain why even if we have a very strong net inflows, the profitability has not
deteriorated at all. On the contrary, really kept at a high level. The APE is only up 3%
because, as you know, in the calculation of the APE, we do have one-tenth of the single
premium that gets into the computation. And that's an interesting question, the
sustainability of the crediting rate versus the charge on Valore Futuro.

Bloomberg Transcript

Bear in mind that most of our business is a fee-based business, which means that in this
very low-yield environment, we extract from the Life business always a portion of money
of profitability that is, let's say, not sensitive to interest rate and not dependent upon the
performance of the policyholder funds. We take out a fee from managing this business.
So, crediting rates are generous or not generous, that's in a way is a commercial issue but
this does not impact on the shareholder account. The sustainability and the mutuality is
always the same because this also happened in the past. When you have a policyholder
funds, people there getting – also get a portion of the unrealized capital gains and people
that leave, leave also portion of the capital gain there.
So, it's a normal phenomenon in the mutuality of the insurance business. What we need to
avoid is to have a ballistic, let's say, production of saving business, which deteriorates the
asset-liability management position of the policyholder funds. But that's exactly what we
have avoided through the EBRI products because the saving business, as I said, is done
ancillary – as ancillary business for the unit-linked.
So, my understanding is that this is sustainable over time and the profitability of the Life
business, especially in Italy but in the group, is there because of the structure, the feebased structure of the products we said.
On the French business, I totally agree with you that this business is not particularly
attractive. If I look at the new business margin or the French Life business, it's the lowest in
the group. We are working a lot with our colleagues to improve the profitability of this
business, but there is also a market situation, a market environment and a higher volatility
in the French Life industry than in other industries.

FINAL

So, margins in France are not the one we do expect from the Life operation. But in this
process or change in the production, we need also to feed the sales network. And so, the
sale of this product, even if are not extraordinarily profitable, are very important for
keeping our sales network. And so, we can have the better condition for restructuring also
the Life portfolio.
You are right, not a fantastic margin but we are working on that because we are aware of
this situation and we have already started to tackle it.

Our next question comes from Mr. Farooq Hanif from Citi. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi there. I just want to come back on one of James' questions and ask one other. So, just
want to understand the net flows in Italy, you say that you're roughly half of – just under
half of those net flows at unit-linked. But including the Valore Futuro product in there,
that's not quite unit-linked entirely. So, I just want to understand exactly what you mean by
unit-linked in Italy. And then, associated with that, are you kind of quite confident that €4
billion net flow or something around that level continues for the rest of the year?
And my second question is on your Italian combined ratio, obviously, claims frequency and
severity is stable, but you have very, very intense competition on pricing. I just wonder
when – it seems that your combined ratios have never deteriorated. I wonder what we're
missing. So, if you have stable kind of experience but falling prices, you'd expect
eventually that to come through to the bottom line. So, I was wondering how you would
kind of square that for me. Thank you.

A - Alberto Minali

{BIO 16909383 <GO>}

Thank you, Farooq. Let me give you some data and I apologize because in answering the
question earlier, probably I gave you the data of the group. So let me recap the Life net
inflow for the group, which are €4.3 billion, of which €2 billion are unit-linked. I must also
say that the maturities in percentage are stable, even maybe decreasing. And the
surrenders are decreasing. So, it means that our Life liability, Life technical reserves are
stable overall.
In terms of the Italian business, we have a €2.1 billion Life net inflows, of which more than
€700 million are from unit-linked. So in the accounting of the Valore Futuro, you are right.
Valore Futuro is not 100% unit-linked. It's 90% unit-linked for the product we sell through
Banca Generali, which is called Stile Libero. And the 70% unit-linked for the product we sell
– 30% unit-linked for the product we sell through the AG's network. But we do account in

Page 7 of 23

FINAL

separate ways. So, the products get into the accounting system and the unit-linked
portion goes in the unit-linked bucket and the saving portion goes in the saving bucket.
The idea is not to have any cost subsidization between one bucket to the other. That's
not the case. The idea is to sell more unit-linked business, providing also a savings rider
attached to it. In terms of the net inflow trend, I do think that the trend especially in Italy is
very strong, very good because also the general market condition, and honestly also
because of the restructuring of the sales network that we have done in the last months,
and this switching of the sales network towards unit-linked business, which is something
very new for our network.
So, our network is really starting to sell different type of business with higher marginality,
higher profitability and less capital absorption. And this I think goes in the right direction.
For the Italian combined ratio, it is true that the frequency and severity are stable. There is
a lot of competition in pricing especially I would say essentially in the motor business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our combined ratio does not deteriorate or it does deteriorate less than the peers. And
honestly, you are not missing anything in this equation. We do have a frequency which is
very low and still decreasing. Cost of claims are not increasing, but there is a huge price
competition. The combination of these elements still delivers a very good performance in
the motor business.
The Motor business was in 3.6 percentage points. The non-motor improves 5.3
percentage points. So the net impact, it's a positive on the overall P&C book. Bear in mind
that Generali does not enter into any price war because we think that we needed to
deliver better service to the customer. Price is not the only element. And we think we are
working much more than the others on customer issues and on service in order to make
our products less price-dependent but more customer-centric.

Q - Farooq Hanif

May I quickly ask? In Italy, did you have a higher reserve release in 1Q 2015 versus 1Q

Q - Federico Salerno

{BIO 2565091 <GO>}

Hi, everyone. Alberto, still on Life, please, in Italy. Traditional – looking at premiums, these
were up 18% year-on-year on the traditional side. I guess only a small portion of that being
driven by the new hybrid products. Are you still doing something to rein in the agents? As
you mentioned last year, considering the low and falling margins that we see on these
products, is customer demand still very high? If you could spend a couple of words on that
please. And the second question is on P&C, you still have about 10% of assets held in
cash. Do you see these declining in the coming quarters? What do you think about this?
Thank you.

A - Alberto Minali

{BIO 16909383 <GO>}

Thank you, Federico. On the Life traditional premium, yes, are up. I would say that a small
portion, yes you're right, is driven by EBRI products. We are doing – during the process of
transforming Generali Italy and merging several companies and also making this very
complicated IT integration, and the Life IT integration is over and completed with success,
we are now spending a lot of time and resources on the training of the sales force. And
the EBRI products is the first of these training process of the training idea in order to
switch them towards unit-linked business.

Bloomberg Transcript

We do see a customer demand very high in this space. There is a very little choice of
alternative investments for a retail consumer at the moment in Europe. So, the life
business is still on a strong demand. But what we need to do in the sales network
traditional especially is to further increase the portion of unit-linked business in Valore
Futuro, and then all the micro links are working in increasing this type of split.
For the non-life, for the P&C business, 10% of assets invested in cash. That's a temporary
operational type of cash; nothing to do with the asset allocation. It's just a seasonal effect,
but we will reduce it quickly over time.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Holmes from Société Générale. Pease go
ahead, sir. Your line is open.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Hi there. Thank you very much. Two questions. First one is can you give us a little bit more
color on why the P&C expense ratio rose by 1%? I mean, it seems just a bit surprising
given your focus on cost reduction. I know there's acquisition increases, but I wondered if
you could elaborate more on the background there?
Then the second is with Life. You've explained you're writing a lot less guarantee
business, a lot more unit-linked and protection. And my question is do you expect this to

Page 9 of 23



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA

accelerate even more when Solvency II comes into effect next year? Now I'm thinking not
just your own book, but what are your thoughts about the sector as a whole, I mean, if the
whole industry is going to stock pricing this guaranteed stuff ? Thank you very much.

FINAL

A - Alberto Minali

{BIO 16909383 <GO>}

Thank you for your questions. So the P&C expense ratio has increased by – if we split it,
let's say, 0.2% for administration, 0.7% for acquisition cost. If you look at the detail, the
dynamic of the acquisition cost, monetary terms, these have increased by 4% because of
the different production type mix of products. The acquisition costs have increased very
strongly in Germany because of the new non-motor business we are writing, and also in
France and also in Central Eastern Europe, while in Italy have remained predominantly flat.
In terms of the guarantees and the unit-linked protection business, I must say that I don't
believe that Solvency II is the real driver behind the consumer to get more unit-linked
business. That's sort of a supply market where all the companies are trying to increase
the offering of unit-linked business because they consume less capital, and they are trying
to diversify away from the traditional one. So, I do expect that this trend will continue
within the Solvency II, but not because of the consumer demand, but more because of an
insurer offer of different type of products that will create their own demand in the market.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Could I come back very quickly on the admin ratio with P&C? I mean, are you a little
bit disappointed that there hasn't been improvement there?

A - Alberto Minali

{BIO 16909383 <GO>}

In terms – your question is for the administration ratio?

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Alberto Minali

{BIO 16909383 <GO>}

No. I'm not disappointed. This is a marginal, let's say, variation. Bear also in mind that the
first quarter of the year is particularly strange from a business point of view because we
have huge renewal of business especially in some countries that traditionally have a lot of
insurance business except in the first Q. So, I don't see these as a negative signal in terms
of deterioration of the administration ratio. I don't have absolutely this view.
We still keep a lot of focus on administration and acquisition costs. And we still keep a lot
of focus on the overall cost base of the group. And also, you'll see at the investor day that
these will be still an important issue that we want to carry on in the future. So, I am not
concerned about this slight pickup of administration ratio.

sir. Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Matteo Ghilotti

{BIO 2333793 <GO>}

Good afternoon. Just a question on the combined ratio because I think your indication was
to expect a roughly stable combined ratio this year. And I wonder if given the first quarter
and your indication that pricing is, generally speaking, soft, if you agree that the flat
combined ratio is becoming probably a bit too optimistic forecast? Thank you.

A - Alberto Minali

{BIO 16909383 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Matteo. The general rule of the house is not to give any expected or any
forecast because it's impossible for us to do so. I want just to point out that in the
Solvency, in the combined ratio of this quarter, we do have a very heavy burden for cat
claims. These are honestly unpredictable things. And because we sell also policies with a
cat cover in it, we are by nature exposed to the nature. So, it's very difficult to predict. I
must also say that in the first quarter, we have €115 million of cat costs which cannot be
recovered – because of the size of the claims, cannot be recovered from the reinsurance.
So, they flow immediately into the P&L.
This has really changed the loss ratio in some countries. For example, in Germany, has
increased by 5.9 percentage point at the local combined ratio, while, for example, in
France, we didn't have any cat claims during the first quarter. So, if you look at the
combined ratio of France, it seems that is dramatically improving. But we know very well
that it's slightly improving, but not so hugely improved as you can see from the number
because it benefits from zero cat claim.
So, I think the cat claim component in the combined ratio remains unpredictable, remains
something outside our control. The best we can do is to have an effective reinsurance in
place if they reach a certain level and to have a very well diversification business on the
territory, on the country locally.
So, I don't share that maybe your implicit comment that we are becoming too optimistic.
No. I think we still are very prudent and a portion, a component, of the combined ratio
cannot be predicted at all. So, this is something that we need to accept.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Oh. Hi there. Three short questions. First of all, on France, maybe, Alberto, you could just
bring us up-to-date on where we are on re-underwriting of the book and when that
should cease. I think the expectation was in the second half of this year, but maybe just
recap on how that's developing. And I guess on France, I mean, it did improve. As you just
pointed out, it was all down to an absence of nat cat. Should we still be thinking we should
see some underlying improvement this year? And maybe at what point you think we
should be below 100% on the combined ratio?
A quick question on Italy. Just to clarify, of the 9% fall in motor premiums in the first
quarter, how much of that was price effect? I mean, you suggested you weren't
participating in the price wars, but I guess you're still taking some price effect. So, how
much of the 9% was price?
And the third, just one observation, a technical question. In Italy, on the Life new business
profit, the margin went up on an APE basis, but it went down on a PVNBP basis. I mean,
which one matters more? And what – why was that – is that just to do with, I mean, the
nature of single versus regular premium or some duration change? Or have you looked at
that? Thanks.

Thanks for the questions. So, the re-underwriting of the book in France is not over for the
simple reason that we had contracts in the portfolio with a two, three years maturity. And I
think in the next probably one, two quarter, we will complete the re-underwriting the
motor, fleet motor, and garage related business, which really created a lot of losses.
But we have been very tough in improving the portfolio. So the re-underwriting of the
book so far has been very effective even if we don't have a combined ratio below 100%,
which is the target we want to achieve very quickly.
France did not improve in P&C. We don't make any, let's say, forecast about the France
combined ratio by the end of the year. Our colleagues know very well that they have to
work a lot in cleaning the portfolio.
The improvement of the French combined ratio is predominantly due to the absence of
nat cat claims, as I said. But we do see some signs of recovery in the portfolio. And
especially, the season of losing customers is almost over. And we have now reached a
level of, let's say, stickiness of the portfolio and customers and contracts, and we can
work on it.
So, I think France, it's on the right path but there are still a lot of work to do. And I don't
expect it to improve below 100% by the end of the year essentially. I feel there is a lot to
do still in France, but we are doing that.

{BIO 16909383 <GO>}

In terms of Italy, the motor business, we had a minus 9% in terms of gross written
premium. Bear in mind that the new production premium has gone down by 6.5%. We are
not losing contracts in Italy. We are not having an increase of the frequency. We are not
having any increase of cost of claims. So, is it price effect? No doubt, but the underlying
profitability is very strong and offset the price mechanism.
In terms of the margin on APE, I think there is a very technical explanation. Let me, one
moment, read what my Egyptian colleague has written here.
[Foreign Language] (36:12-36:19)
Yeah, you – I think you spotted the duration of the business is different. So, new business
margin in APE terms increased, but the margin in terms of present value of future
premiums essentially is constant, 3.1% versus 3.2%. And this is due to the diverse different
duration of the business. For any other technical question on these, Egyptian
understanding please refer to our group (36:52).

Our next question comes from William Elderkin from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - William H. Elderkin

Thank you, and hello, everyone. Two questions left. The first one is still on the Life new
business profits. I think you may have partly just answered it. But I was surprised how
resilient the margin was in the first quarter both compared to the sensitivities you've
provided at the full year and also one of your peers have been reporting. Could you just
sort of, in simple terms, walk through the maths of the downward pressure? Obviously,
there must have been some from a low interest rate environment and then the balancing
factors of proportioning more unit links, more protection. And then, you've also
referenced having reduced crediting rates inside the pricing assumption, which would
have helped as well as they became a lot more resilient than I was expecting. And then
secondly, can you provide us an update with what source of new money rates you're
achieving this quarter going into the P&C and Life books?

A - Alberto Minali

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

{BIO 16909383 <GO>}

I think the first question, if I understand correctly, because it's a very wide question, the
resilience and the sensitivity, we had during the first quarter further reduced the level of
the guarantees, I would say quicker than the peers. We have now a level of the
guarantees which is in the ballpark of 70 basis points for the new production. And this will
help reducing the overall level of guarantees. And this will make our business very, very
resilient.
On the other side of the coin is that we were very successful in changing the mix – the
product mix. And the combination of lower guarantees and the changing of the product
mix has really kept very high the new business profit.
If you look at the single new business margin movement, we have a positive recovery in
Germany and CEE. We have roughly 1.7 percentage point improvement due to this
changed product mix, while we do have a worsening financial condition in the calculation
of the business margin which is in excess of 4.5 percentage points.
So, if you see the variation of the margin quarter-over-quarter from 22.5% – from 25.2% to
22.5%, I would say that 170 basis point come from the product mix, and the rest is
negative variation coming from interest rate structure we have used for calculating this
margin. I don't know if I've been clear but your question was...

Q - William H. Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

That's really helpful. And within that 170 bps of positive mix effect, does that also include
the crediting rate effect?

Yes. It's included and this 170 basis point comes predominantly from Italy which is positive
and a minor portion also from France. The reinvestment rate on the P&C and life book,
the reinvestment rate first Q 2015, in the Life business is 2.5% and in the P&C business,
2.1%. So, it's a very good reinvestment rate.

Our next question comes from Michael van Wegen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Michael van Wegen

{BIO 6435238 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi. One question please on the Life business. If we look at the different sources of
profit, then I noticed that in the investment margin, the policyholder sharing was lower in
Q1. I think it's around 80% right now. Is that mainly due to the higher capital gains? And
how do you see that evolve the rest of the year? Should that go back to a more
normalized level or do you think you can keep it as low as it was in Q1?

Page 15 of 23



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity
Date: 2015-05-14

FINAL

And for the other source of profit, your technical margin tends to be a little bit volatile. Q1
was perhaps a little bit weak. Is it indeed as simple as that or would you see it as a bit
more structural? And for the expense margin, the acquisition cost being up € 91 million
year-over-year. Obviously, it's driven by the strong sales efforts that you had. How do you
see that evolve going forward? Thank you.

A - Alberto Minali

{BIO 16909383 <GO>}

Yes, thanks for the question. The policyholder participation rate is not something that we
can maneuver. It's already in the books. It depends on the dynamic of the reserves that
we have already accounted for. So, I don't expect any policyholder participation rate in the
next years to move dramatically. If we carry on pushing towards unit-linked business, the
savings business will become less important, and the unit-linked much more important. In
terms of profitability, we are switching towards something which is capital-light. So, the
policyholder participation will have its own natural dynamic and I don't expect it to change
– the level to change in the next years.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of the technical margin, if I look at the operating result and the split, I see that the
technical result is plus 1.6%, which is driven by the loadings and also by very good
contribution of the unit-linked fees that goes into the technical result. Investment result is
up because also we have decided to realize some capital gains also for the benefit of the
policyholder. Expense result is very high as you said, driven only by the volume.
So, this €90 million acquisition cost is entirely due to strong sales that we had. And since
that we carry on with these underwriting philosophy, I can expect that the expense result
to be still a good chunk of negative of our operating performance. But I'm not concerned
about the acquisition cost. I'm always much more concerned about the quality of the
production and I'm pretty sure that we are moving in the right direction.

Q - Michael van Wegen

We will now take our next question from Michael Huttner from JPMorgan. Please go
ahead, sir.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Hi there. Apologies because I joined the call later. If I asked a question which you probably
said earlier you mustn't ask it, apologies for that. But on solvency, you did say in your
prepared remarks that the new model, you're comfortable and strong. Can you an idea of
what that exactly means? In the past, I've always sort of thought that strong meant
anything above 160%. But any indication, any kind of around this wording would be great.
Then I noticed from slide 31, you've got this big hybrid redemption during 2016 of €1.2
billion, and I just wondered is this already prefunded or is that something we should
expect soon?

FINAL

And then finally, given how much we've spoken about Life and the new mix, et cetera, can
you say a few words about Banca Generali which is doing differently and how much more
strong performance we might expect there? I was just reading the transcript on
Bloomberg, and they kind of indicated that they've acquired a big network last year, so
Credit Suisse, and that there may be some more stuff like that in the pipeline. Thank you.

A - Alberto Minali

{BIO 16909383 <GO>}

In terms of Solvency II, I mean I just made a comment that you'll need to wait until our next
strategy day to have more indication about the capital position of the group. I reiterate
once again that we are abandoning the old model. We are now cruising into a Solvency II
framework, and we will show you the different components, available capital and the riskadjusted capital, and so you can get a feeling of it. So, I'm not in a position to disclose
anything else here and now because you need to be – you need to wait for the investor
day in London.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the big hybrid debt, €1.2 billion in 2016, yes, that's something that over time we will
refinance. We are discussing internally if that makes sense to exploit favorable conditions
that we see in the market. We are not in a hurry to refinance now, neither to buy it back.
Now, we're in a very comfortable situation from a debt point-of-view because there are
still many months ahead and we will refinance in advance, I would say, but with a calm and
prudent attitude.
Banco Generali is an engine that is working very well, has very good strong performance.
Probably, one thing that we have to do is to increase the target for Banco Generali but –
because every single year, Banco Generali is able to beat the targets that the corporate
center give them.
They are enlarging and recruiting new financial promoters. They are perfectly in line with
the strategy of the group, selling unit-linked products. But also, they have additional
sources of revenues because of the asset they manage and because of the banking
products they sell. But they are a very important distribution network in Italy, which
perfectly complement our traditional one we have in the country.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

And that comment, which they gave on the conference call, which was a couple of weeks
ago, that because of their strong capital position, which is back to the level before the
Credit Suisse deal, they could look at things again, can you put any color on that?

A - Alberto Minali

{BIO 16909383 <GO>}

I mean, they have a very strong capital position also because Banco Generali does not
have any real banking book and credit exposure. It's a bank servicing the financial
promoter. They will use the capital for expanding, acquiring new financial promoters, only
focusing on the business they run.
And I think because of the very good performance of the bank, they can restore, anyway,
the capital position they had earlier than the transaction they concluded. So, it's a machine
Page 17 of 23

that is auto-generating capital that they want to reinvest and we want them to reinvest in
the strengthening of the sales force.

Our next question comes from Paul De'Ath from RBC. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Paul C. De'Ath
Yeah. Hi there. Just one quick question if I may. Just looking at the Life business and the
sort of earnings there, clearly, the investment return has been boosted by some of the
actions that you've taken to realize some of the gains, which clearly has helped
policyholders as well. I'm just wondering how much of that can we think of as effectively
one-off impact in the quarter. You used to increase duration, et cetera. And how much is
more of an ongoing amount? Any thoughts there on that would be good. Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alberto Minali

{BIO 16909383 <GO>}

Yes. You are right. The investment return has been boosted by the decision we took on
realization of capital gains. Our colleagues on investment department believe that there
are tactical situation in the market that we need to profit from. And so they have decided
to reduce the allocation to some, let's say, lines of business. And they have decided to
realize capital gains, which went also to the policyholder benefit because of the
policyholder participation.
I don't think we can say this is as a one-off impact. It's part of our strategy to invest, to
take duration risk in the past in advance of the market. And now, it's part of our strategy
also to realize capital gains to support – I have to be very transparent on this point, to
support the performance of our funds and the remuneration for our policyholder.
This is part of the overall investment policy that we have discussed with the group
management committee. Bear in mind that what we have realized this quarter, €1.2 billion
in the operating side of the coin, is just 2% of the unrealized capital gain we've got on the
books. So, it's a minor fraction, but it's important that we keep this dynamism in the
market.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. Three questions on investment income, particularly
Life, if I may. First question, also what you just discussed about the record high harvesting,
especially on the bond portfolio, how should we think about the running year that it fell 40
bps year-on-year, sharper drop than reported by peers? Is that in the context of the big
harvesting you did recently? The number you would expect also for coming quarters will
contain a sharp fall in underlying investment income? First question.
Second question, impairments, up €100 million to €155 million. I think that's a number we
haven't seen for like two years. And it seems like a ride. And so, my question is, would you
agree, is there a tendency that we see a normalization of operating impairments here?
And the last question goes back to the reinvestment yield. Is that 2.5% in Life? I think at
the full year call, you mentioned 3.2%. And you also mentioned it's mainly corporate
bonds. I mean, I look at investment grade bonds in Europe, that's not something you
should be able to get. So, I wonder if you could provide color how you get to even a 2.5%
number which is again significantly above peers. Thank you.

A - Alberto Minali

{BIO 16909383 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I will start answering. Then I will leave the word to Nikhil on the reinvestment. But I will start
to answer your question on the harvesting and the bond portfolio and also the
impairments. Let's start from the impairments. We have a €231 million impairments this
year. €141 million of impairments are the impairment we have taken on the bonds
guaranteed by the Carinzia region of Austria on the Heta transaction.
You know that we have €300 million Heta bonds and we have taken an impairment of
50%, higher than the one that other peers have taken because I think we should be
prudent on this point. The net impact on the operating performance has been €25 million,
so a very modest one.
But I think impairments, because of the size of the group and because of the complexity
of the group, is something that is very difficult to predict, first of all, and unavoidable in a
certain way. So, we need every single quarter to think that there are impairments coming
through from the different assets we've got in the book.
I pass the word Nikhil on the reinvestment, what we...

A - Nikhil Srinivasan

{BIO 7419225 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Alberto. Just a couple of points, questions raised there. The reinvestment
yields firstly on corporate bonds, how do we get the level in terms of rates? Essentially,
we've got it through having a very active private placement business we started two-anda-half years ago, which we are executing both in Europe as well as partly in Asia, but it's
really been a European business. So, that's really how we've gotten it, and that's how
we've managed to keep our yields relatively sustained through which is pretty much a
difficult period.

Page 19 of 23



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA

FINAL

Having said that, of course, yields have come down, and you'll continue to see yields
coming down. Although Q2 should just – might be a bit of back up again. But I'm not
proposing that we're going to have substantially surprising yields on the upside. But our
edge, so to speak, has been the fact that we have a very active private placement
business which we activated two-and-a-half years ago.
Your question on running yield, yes, of course, running yields will get hit. I don't think we
get hit as much as you see in Q1, but the running yield will continue to get hit just simply
because you get maturities in yield flow apart from having any realized gains. So, that's
only a very, very small part of it.
I mean, the fact is we will have maturities in yield flow of several billion euros this year, and
the reinvestment rate is as you see it. And that affects the running yield. So, to assume
that running yield is consistent from year-on-year, I think you can assume that. But to
assume another significant drop from where we are today until the next quarter, I think I
wouldn't assume that.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Why would Q1 be specifically a sharp drop of 40 bps? Is there any specific reason for
that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Nikhil Srinivasan

{BIO 7419225 <GO>}

No, I mean I don't – there's no specific reason for that. No, there isn't. I mean, it is the
market. It is what – I have not seen our peers' results, but I can't imagine that their running
yields have been stable year-on-year. I mean, that's just the way it is. But I mean, I want to
assure you that our realized gains, which is €1.2 billion this year, is not the sole reason why
our yield is coming down. It's just that we have a significant amount to invest. And I think
that the (56:31) the front end of our business doing as well as it is, there is a lot of inflow.
There's inflow we'd rather not deal with, but that's the way we have it.

Yes. Hi. Ralph Hebgen from KBW. I'm afraid it's the same question. I mean, it's partially
answered. Thank you very much. If you could just share with us perhaps your thinking on
how you manage medium term the overall economic return you're getting from your
investments because obviously, currently, you have a sort of optimization exercise to
solve? There is realized capital gains opportunistically to be achieved from selling bonds.
But then that will come at the expense of the investment margin of the running years
going forward. So, how are you thinking about this? And what do you – do you target an

Page 20 of 23



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity

overall economic return, which you'll be able to achieve? Any guidance on that would be
helpful.

FINAL

A - Alberto Minali

{BIO 16909383 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks for this question, which goes back to the way we set the business plan for the
entire group. We make an extensive analysis in terms of financial performance of the
different units. So, we don't have any target of performance specifically at the group level.
We do have several targets of performance in the different portfolios. We need to have
an ALM approach. And we need to look at the assets that backs technical reserves.
So, it's not something that we set as a top-down ambition. It's something that comes
from a bottom-up analysis of our portfolio and our investment. In general terms, we are
not creating, let's say, overall economic return from real estate and equity by a huge
tactical movement. I mean, we have a very strategic asset allocation approach, especially
for the asset classes which consume a lot of capital, while for example, in the bond
portfolio and in the corporate bond portfolio, we can become more tactical.
And as you've seen, we have lengthened the duration in the last years, benefiting from
the drop of the interest rate. And this has really created huge capital gains. Now, we see it
on huge capital gains, so it's a matter, as Nikhil said, of balance between the current
running return and the way we use this buffer of wealth over time.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Nikhil Srinivasan

{BIO 7419225 <GO>}

Thanks, Alberto. I mean, look, the entire industry is facing low rates. So, I think any time we
have a call like this with any of our peers, you'd have the same issues. We addressed to
that as I said partly through the private placement business. But really we addressed it
fortunately by lengthening duration a couple of years ago and even a year ago. And I think
that's really kept things stable right now. Stable in a way that it's declining, but because
everyone's declining, but the decline, there's a stability in that decline.
And I think that's – today, we are with the market, but you saw what happened in the last
month. You've seen yields back up. And what we have done is we will be opportunistic. I
mean, obviously, we are governed by an SAA that's derived from an ALM, but we are
opportunistic in that when we think opportunities might be right in the market to actually
extend duration or go into corporate bonds, we will take them. And I think now, we feel
coming into May and June, we have a better position to actually do the things we want to
do and use some of the cash we built up than we have perhaps in Q1.

FINAL

Hello, and thank you for taking my questions. My first question is about the average level
of guarantees in your Life portfolio. You have provided us the data for the new business
which is approximately 70 bps. I was wondering about an average level if you have not
provided it yet?
The second question is about the trend of your net inflows. It seems to be very strong.
So, I was wondering whether we can assume a total net inflow for the current year above
the level of last year.
And the final question is about the holding and the other businesses segment, given the
strong performance and the strong business momentum for Banca Generali, would you
expect this segment to provide a positive contribution to your operating income for the
current year? Thank you.

A - Alberto Minali

{BIO 16909383 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks for the questions. I will start from the average level of guarantees, which is around
2% at portfolio level. But I want to point out that the new business have a minimum
guarantee rate which is much below that level. Just to give you some numbers, the
minimum guarantee rates on new business is 86 basis points. For the Italian business, it's
at 51. I can mention France where we have 15 basis point minimum guarantee rates. And
the rest is Germany where the minimum guarantee rate is set in a different way according
also to local legislation, which is 1.4%.
The net inflows trend, that's a very tough question again because it's difficult to multiply
by four and say, okay, we will reach the same level last year. But I think that the
macroeconomic conditions in the market are more or less the same with last year. So, the
Life products will become a very important product for the wealth allocation of retail
consumer. So, I don't expect it to have a drop of the net inflow in the next quarter. So, I do
expect to have still a good level of this.
Banca Generali is already performing very well, and contributing to our operating income.
Very difficult to say whether the performance fee of Banca Generali can be repeated in
the future because this quarter, we had a fantastic injection of value from performance
fee.
But because of the recruitment process of Banca Generali, a good management team, I
do expect from Banca Generali to carry on contributing to our operating performance also
in the next quarter and in the next years. So, it still it is something which is minor vis-à-vis
the whole group, but important in terms of element in the holding and other business
segment reporting.
