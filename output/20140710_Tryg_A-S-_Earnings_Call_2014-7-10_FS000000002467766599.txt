Bloomberg Transcript

Lars Møller
Good morning, everyone. This is Lars Møller, Head of IR at Tryg. Welcome to this
presentation of Tryg's Q2 and First Half Results 2014. With me today I have our CEO,
Morten Hübbe; and our CFO, Tor Lønnum with us. And with this just short introduction, I
will hand over to you, Morten.

Morten Hübbe
Thank you, Lars. And if you turn to slide three, we're very pleased to announce for this
quarter strong ﬁnancial results with a pre-tax earnings of DKK 1.15 billion and a combined
ratio of 80.7%.
Now when assessing the quality of earnings this quarter and how that may impact the
future earnings, it's very important to realize that we've had positive impacts from one-oﬀ
results. We've seen a positive impact from our pension scheme in Norway, and vice versa
a negative impact from IT costs. And the net of those two is a positive up DKK 135 million
or an impact of some 2.8 percentage points to the combined ratio and the cost ratio.
Also we've seen in this quarter a signiﬁcant tailwind from fewer large claims and an
unusually strong investment return for the quarter. So actually, the most important is
perhaps what is going on in the underlying earnings where it is very satisfactory to see an
improved trend on top line customers from a negative top line of 2.6% in the same

quarter last year to a negative of 1.2% in the second quarter this year which makes this the
best top line quarter in six quarters.

FINAL

Also we see a very important continued positive trend in the cost ratio which drops 0.2% if
we disregard the one-oﬀ positives. And also we see a continued positive underlying trend
in claims.
Now if we turn to slide four, we highlight a few important news. On the earnings side, I
think it's fair to say that the eﬃciency program continues to play the lead role in improving
our results and that we're pleased to see almost DKK 100 million in the second quarter.
And still you may recall another DKK 260 million remaining for our DKK 1 billion program.
On our product and customer side, we have launched another three new price
diﬀerentiated products. We've launched a number of initiatives to enhance the quality of
our customer service. And we're progressing well in the integration of Codan's
agricultural portfolio in Denmark. Then we've been pleased to see the FSA report
following their survey of Tryg with a positive view of capital and risk and a clear
conﬁrmation of our reserving margin strength.

Bloomberg Transcript

On slide ﬁve, we show an improved combined ratio on all four business areas, of course
positively impacted by the one-oﬀ eﬀects. If we look at the underlying claims, clearly the
improvement comes particularly from Private in Sweden, which Tor will elaborate on a bit
more. Whereas in Corporate, we actually reported improved combined ratio. But when
you take into account underlying the positive one-oﬀ impacts and the positive from fewer
large claims then the underlying development is actually a slight increase.
And on the cost ratio side, clearly, the largest improvement is in Commercial with an
underlying drop of around 1.3%. And bear in mind we've announced several times that
Commercial is one of the areas where we need to improve cost the most.
On slide six, we elaborate a bit on the progress of the eﬃciency program, some DKK 28
million in the quarter improvement on expenses, and some DKK 65 million improvement
on claims. Well, of course, we're very pleased to see that now building and content is
becoming more of a driver, whereas previously this area was trailing behind a bit
compared to motor and health insurance, for instance.
If we turn to slide eight, we show how the various business areas contribute to growth and
technical results. As I mentioned on the growth side, clearly, we still have a slightly
negative growth, but the best quarter in six quarters. In Private and Corporate lines, we
have turned negative top line year-on-year into a slightly positive top-line development.
And Private lines, clearly, helped by improved sales of the more price-diﬀerentiated
products both in our own channels, but also in our bancassurance with Nordea. On
Commercial, we still show a negative top line of 3.9%. If you disregard higher premium
discounts, the underlying development is minus 2.4%. And we do see a positive
development both in retention and in sales although sales are still slightly too low in
Commercial.

In Sweden, clearly, the negative impact is from the lapse of the Nordea portfolio whereas
the underlying portfolio has a slight positive top line development. Clearly, on the righthand side, you see that the technical result has been improved in all four business areas,
but as I said, bear in mind that you need to normalize for the positive DKK 135 million.

FINAL

And with that, over to you, Tor.

Tor Magne Lønnum
Thanks, Morten. If we move on to slide number nine related to the average premiums,
you can see that we have more or less a ﬂattish development in the Danish business lines
and there's a slightly lower growth than last quarter in the Norwegian business lines.

Bloomberg Transcript

There are really three drivers. It's related to a change in the business mix. We see, for
instance, in the house product that there is an increased retention level. And we also see
to a certain extent that there are some competitive pressure in the market, i.e. that you
see some level of falling prices.
If we move on to slide number 10, you can see on the customer retention, it's actually
relatively positive both in the Commercial lines and also in the Danish Private lines. You
see that there is a small decrease in the Norwegian retention, but relatively small
diﬀerence. I think from our side, we'd like to highlight the fact that there is a continued
positive development in commercial which supports the turnaround in that area, as
Morten mentioned. And I think if you look at sort of the Private lines in Denmark despite
the portfolio conversion going on, we're glad to see that at least it seems like it's leveling
out.
If we move on to slide number 11 and looking at Private Sweden, there is no doubt that
there is a continued issue related to the portfolio development in the Swedish portfolio.
Morten has mentioned the Nordea portfolio which continues to have an impact.
Although we see that customer retention is leveling out, but still at relatively low level, so
we feel that, as Morten said, there is a stabilized underlying portfolio. There are still issues
related to the Nordea portfolio, and we see some pressure on the existing contracts in the
portfolio, which is why Sweden needs to be a focused area going forward as well.
If we move onto slide number 13, there is no doubt an underlying improvement in the
underlying claims ratio, which we're pleased to see. Roughly 50% of that underlying
stems from one-oﬀ eﬀects related to the pension and IT expenses that Morten has
explained, which means that the underlying improvement is more or less in line with what
we have seen in the previous quarters.
If you look at the business segments, there is a ﬂattish development in Corporate and
improvement in the other segments.

FINAL

If we move to slide number 14, as Morten mentioned, it's signiﬁcantly lower impact of
large claims both related to Q1, and if you compare to Q2 last year an impact of 1.7% this
quarter. If you look at weather-related claims, it's at a relatively low level, as you can see.
And run-oﬀ is perhaps worth mentioning which is slightly lower than what you saw last
year in Q1, but it brings it more or less in line with what we have seen in previous years, if
you look at the year-to-date. And as Morten said, no doubt it conﬁrms that there is a
strong reserving level in our reserves.
If we move on to slide number 15 and talk a bit more about – in detail about the expenses,
I guess. It's important, ﬁrst and foremost, to recognize the fact that we had mentioned that
there would be some one-oﬀ eﬀects in Q2 related to the IT transition agreement.
However, we have not mentioned anything related to the pension change in Norway,
which is due to the fact that the negotiations were, in fact, terminated or ﬁnished actually
in Q2.
I guess, it's fair to say that we do recognize that that of course have created some
diﬀerences in terms of how the one-oﬀ should be interpreted. But I think it's fair to say
that, ﬁrst and foremost, we are extremely pleased that we're now able to take a signiﬁcant
part of the volatility related to the pension agreement out of the future balance sheet and
P&Ls going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

I guess, the ﬁnal comment I'd make is that if you look at the nominal, there is a nominal
reduction of about DKK 50 million in the quarter and, of course, it underpins the
continued eﬃciency focus that we have in the company.
If we move on to slide number 17, as Morten said, strong investment return. Overall gross
return of 1.5% or 6% annualized. More than 50% of the result is driven by equities, which I
think we have highlighted in the report as well. We have seen beneﬁcial returns or
movements in the interest rate markets as well, which have yielded about DKK 80 million.
High yield and emerging market debt of about DKK 40 million, so a lot of positive factors.
And then I guess which is probably a bit more of a surprise is that you see that there's
about DKK 100 million on the match portfolio as well. And there's two drivers, one is that
there is a technical change related to the benchmark and the other is that we have a
signiﬁcant exposure on AAA-rated covered bonds, which have performed actually better
than benchmark in the quarter.
Finally, on slide number 18, in terms of capital, you see that there is a capital growth in
terms of surplus, about DKK 600 million and plus this quarter. Equity is slightly down due
to the dividend payment this quarter and buyback.
And I guess the ﬁnal comment I'd make is that you have – I guess, you have all seen the
recommendation from the Norwegian FSA to the Ministry of Finance that the Natural
Perils Pool fund and the guarantee scheme fund will not be counted as capital under
Solvency II implementation, which in our mind is a relatively big surprise and, of course, is
something that we need to work proactively with going forward.

Page 4 of 17



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2014-07-10

However, we do know that there are some upsides, some positives related to the
Solvency II implementation as well. And one is that we can utilize expected future proﬁts
and the other is subordinated capital or full inclusion of that. It will not have a full
mitigating eﬀect, but it will, to a certain extent, mitigate some of the eﬀects should the
Norwegian FSA recommendation be taken, be accepted by the Ministry of Finance.

FINAL

And back to you, Morten.

Morten Hübbe
Yeah. Thank you. And let's hope that the Ministry of Finance realizes that they shouldn't
accept it, but clearly, it is a risk. And if we look at slide nine scene, I think we should just
conﬁrm that we're very pleased to have reported a strong result for the quarter. If we look
at the future, it's very important to distinguish between the continued positive underlying
trend in the cost ratio, 0.2%, and in the claims ratio, as you explained, Tor. And that we do
not take the one-oﬀs on costs or the tailwind on large claims and investment income into
our expectations of future results.
We continue to be very committed to our ﬁnancial targets to a combined ratio at or below
90%, to an ROE of about 20% post-tax, also in periods with less helpful investment results
and let's face it, we'll probably face more of the more normal periods than the slightly
unusual period we've seen in Q2. And the target of reaching a cost ratio of below 15% in
2015, where our eﬃciency program of DKK 1 billion continues to play a key role.

Bloomberg Transcript

And with that, I think we are ready to take some questions.

Lars Møller
Yes. Operator, please.

Q&A
Operator
Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator
Instruction] Our ﬁrst question will come from Mr. Jakob Brink from GBD. Please go ahead,
sir.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

It's from ABG. Good morning. Just two questions, please. The ﬁrst one is regarding the
Norwegian FSA letter, you're right and you've just mentioned that this was a big surprise
to you. So how could this impact your 20% ROE guidance?
Also, I mean if we look at 2014, I guess you will make 20%, but at least partly driven by the
adjustment of the Norwegian pension obligation as well as very strong investment proﬁts.
So I guess next year, it will be diﬃcult to make it without similar positives. So could you
Page 5 of 17



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2014-07-10

give us some details around that, and especially the Norwegian FSA letter, how that could
impact you, given that it was a big surprise?

FINAL

And then secondly, could you give us a bit more detail on the Norwegian pension
obligation, please? I mean, what exactly is it that is being changed? Thank you.

A - Morten Hübbe
Yeah.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Do you want – yes, again, good morning, Jakob. I guess I can start with the latter, related
to the pension obligation. And principally you can say that there has been an obligation
related to the Norwegian-deﬁned beneﬁt scheme to adjust the future payment with a socalled Norwegian base amount. And that is a relatively heavy, so to speak, interest rate
guarantee related to the deﬁned beneﬁt. And that is actually what we have now changed
in the Norwegian pension scheme. So it's now reduced to being based on the actual
investment return in the pension funds. This is a change which, I guess, more or less, all
the other companies – ﬁnancial companies in Norway already have introduced. So it
brings Tryg in line with the other deﬁned beneﬁt schemes in the Norwegian ﬁnancial
sector.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hübbe
And I guess on your ﬁrst question, Jakob, on the FSA letter on Norwegian Natural Perils
Pool, the reason why this is a surprise is that for more than a decade, all of the Norwegian
insurance companies has been reporting their part of the Norwegian Perils Pool as part of
their capital.
This was conﬁrmed in 2005 when Tryg was IPO'd. It was conﬁrmed in 2010 when
Gjensidige was IPO'd. And for the Ministry to potentially come to the conclusion that they
would now all of a sudden decide that it was not part of capital would be a very unusual
conclusion. Borderline and expropriation debates which I tend to think that hopefully the
Norwegian Ministry will not come to that conclusion as it would be very unusual and very
surprising.
It is something that, if carried out, would have an impact on 2016, not 2015. As Tor said,
they will be mitigating factors in the other drivers that have positive impacts, although
slightly smaller. But we will participate in the debate with the FSA and the Ministry and
hope that they come to the right conclusion and know that there's a period of time until
this has an impact.
And then I guess – you can add to that, Tor, if you want, but then I guess on your question
on the ROE, clearly, we expect for the remaining part of 2014 and for 2015 less of a
tailwind from investment income to support our 20% ROE. And we remain of the view that
we need to continuously improve our underlying insurance results in order to deliver
more than 20% ROE also in low return investment environments.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum

FINAL

Yes. So just to enhance what Morten said related to the ROE, there's no doubt that the
overall target is to deliver an above 20% ROE. And, of course, that is something that we
will have the attention to deliver on that target no matter what, I mean, in terms of
investment return or one-oﬀ eﬀects.
I would just like to highlight one more issue related to the Natural Perils Pool fund that
Morten mentioned because I guess in our mind, at least, it's relatively unclear still what
the Norwegian FSA actually means. Because if you deﬁne that the Natural Perils Pool fund
and the guarantee scheme is to be viewed as a – as actually a debt then, of course, that
may have an impact for the accounting treatment of those funds as well because today
they're recognized as equity.
So, I think in our mind, it's a bit unclear and it doesn't really seem consistent, the
assessment that the FSA has made. So I think it's still early days for us based on the
recommendation that the FSA made.

A - Morten Hübbe
And the Ministry has the ﬁnal call.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes.

A - Morten Hübbe
Yeah.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

I guess the ﬁnal thing on this is what is the Standard and Poor's will think, I guess, if the
regulatory side won't approve it, isn't it fair then to assume that S&P won't either or do
you have any insights on that?

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
No. I guess that it's a very valid point, Jakob, so I think that's – it's clearly a risk related to
that.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks a lot.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
But bear in mind, again, as Morten said, that we mentioned sort of here the DKK 1.2 billion
eﬀects related to these two lines in our equity statement, but bear in mind that there are
some positives as well related to implementation of Solvency II, which I'd say that it will
have at least a substantial mitigating eﬀect.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. Sure.

Operator
And our next question will come from Mr. Vinit Malhotra. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Hi there. Good morning. Just three topics, please, quickly. The competition issues that
you have been raising in the past and this quarter we saw the Privates lines also on an FX
adjusted showing a positive bend, a small positive bend. Could you just update us on
how much those concerns are less or more now versus maybe six months ago or three
months ago? So that's on the competition.
Secondly, just to clarify if the positive eﬀects could be substantial, could you just clarify a
bit more because these future earned proﬁts are more a life business phenomenon
usually, and I was just wondering how that could be a substantial oﬀset? And I think that's
the two topics I would raise. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hübbe
Well, I guess on your ﬁrst question, clearly, you're right that the Private lines turns a
negative top line second quarter last year to a slight, slight positive this year. And as Tor
showed, positive development and customer loyalty and somewhat higher sales. And I
guess that shows a fairly stable competitive environment, but with some pressure on
particularly car pricing where you also see a drop of 0.5% in our Danish car average price
development, so a combination of a mix change towards the smaller cars with less risk,
but also slightly higher competitive pressure.
But I think with the development of our new products with more and stronger price
diﬀerentiation, slightly stronger distribution, we're able to show some improvement in the
top line. And to be honest, we're not targeting a dramatic improvement in that area at all,
but a slight and patient gradual improvement in line with the development with the better
price-diﬀerentiated products. So I wouldn't say that's a big change two months, three
months ago until now. We're roughly at the same area of market competition (25:22).

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yeah. And so I think it's – I think, Vinit, in terms of sort of the top line going forward, we will
expect sort of negative development in the top line for the remaining quarters of 2014 as
well.

A - Morten Hübbe
Page 8 of 17



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2014-07-10

Yeah.

FINAL

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
And we do expect, at best, sort of a ﬂattish development in 2015 because as we have
mentioned, there are some positives, as Morten said, related to the price diﬀerentiation,
et cetera. But there is competitive pressure in the market no doubt. And also we do see
that there will be a new wave of conversion in 2015, which, of course, will have an impact.
Although, we do see that the conversion now in 2014 is at least progressing relatively well,
so.

A - Morten Hübbe
And while we see the trend shift in Private lines and Corporate, we do expect that there
will be a substantial period of time before we see a strong improvement in Sweden. So
there will still be, clearly, negative impact from Sweden also in this year and next year.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum

Bloomberg Transcript

And then to the ﬁnal question about sort of the positive eﬀects, you do know that there is
a part of our subordinated debt that is not eligible for Solvency II purposes, so that will
have a positive, as I said, mitigating eﬀect. And then the other is that we will be able to
take in parts of the calculated future proﬁts as a capital element. And those two will have,
as I said, a mitigating eﬀect. It will not mitigate the full eﬀect should the Norwegian FSA
recommendation be sort of the ﬁnal verdict. But let's say more than half of it, at least, will
be mitigated.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Sure. Thanks. A second follow-up, quickly. The competition question was not top line
question. I was more worried about progressiveness in the marketplace leading to
ultimately combined ratio eﬀect, but I've seen that you are still in a stable position, so,
yeah. Okay. Thanks.

A - Morten Hübbe
Well, I think our view is that the way we manage it is by making sure that our eﬃciency
program continuously drive underlying improvements because clearly, as we're not
seeing any signiﬁcant price increases, we need to drive earnings improvements from
elsewhere and that is from the eﬃciency program.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
And I think to the latter, as Morten said initially, you can now see that 74% of the DKK 1
billion is actually sort of coming through the account. And I guess, we're relatively pleased
with that development.

A - Morten Hübbe
Clearly (28:23).

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

And is that likely to continue that rate or...

FINAL

A - Morten Hübbe
I think we'll have to stick to the fact that we've announced DKK 1 billion and we'll deliver
DKK 1 billion. And then you can do the math and see that we have DKK 260 million
remaining.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

All right. Thank you.

Operator
Our next question is coming from Mr. Per Grønborg from Danske Markets. Please go
ahead, sir. Per Grønborg, you're up now. Please go ahead, sir.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per Grønborg
Yes. Good morning. It's Per from Danske. Starting oﬀ in Norway, we saw all the
announcement from the Norwegian FSA, they addressed the Perils Pool, but they also
addressed the claims reserves that new (29:11) Norwegian companies have provisioned
too more so (29:14) claims compared to what they were allowed to under Solvency II. How
does that impact your business, I guess you are primarily regulated by the Danish
regulator also on your Norwegian business. In this context, you'll of course, also have the
Danish FSA review by at least (29:30) like the Danish FSA thought that your security
margin in your provisions were too high. What are the thoughts on these topics?
The second question is your main shareholder, TryghedsGruppen, was out with an
announcement in an interview and they're basically saying that they were considering a
client dividend. What are the timing, when should we expect any announcement from
your main shareholders if you have any insight into that – their process? Thank you.

A - Morten Hübbe
Good morning to you as well Per. I think clearly, we've had, as you said, announcements
both on the Norwegian and Danish FSA. Clearly, we are as a group regulated by the
Danish FSA. And as you said, the Danish FSA has pointed to the question of our strength
in claims reserves. I think the wording was that they would ask us to reconsider how we
see the strength of our claims reserve, as they were pointing to the fact that they saw the
strength as being very high. And I'm sure we will have an evaluation of that, and I'm sure
we are very comfortable that the assessment is that the strength is high. It's a bit unusual
to have the FSA conﬁrming that it is high, but I guess that is a comfort both for us and for
you, as analysts and also shareholders.
There is no wording in their document saying that it is too high and that we have to take it
down. But they point to it as an area of focus and something that we should continuously
evaluate as it is rather high. But as we see it, that's probably a positive.
Page 10 of 17



FINAL

Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2014-07-10

On TryghedsGruppen, you're right, Per, that our 60% shareholder is considering whether
they should pass on dividends from Tryg to Danish policy holders as part of their future
operating model. And there is a process on their side where it needs to be debated
amongst the group of representatives. So that is some 70 people representing
shareholders. To be honest, I don't think there's any strong link or change to what we do
in Tryg. But, of course, we follow that with interest and I think they will debate this ﬁrst
time during the autumn. But it is probably likely to be 2015 before they make any clear
decisions. But as I said, this is their task and not ours, but of course we follow it with
interest.
And then I guess on the Natural Perils Pool, was anything new on that?

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
No. I guess, just to follow up on Morten's comment related to the FSA – the Danish FSA,
Per. I guess they stated relatively clearly, actually that they did not consider our reserves to
be too high. They just stated the obvious that it will be – that the likelihood is that you'll
see a positive reserve release going forward. And in my mind, there's nothing new in that
message because as you know we do, in principal reserve with an additional margin that
should come in through the numbers going forward. So I guess, in our mind it's a
relatively clear statement of, as Morten said, that the reserves are strong, but not that
they're too high and that has been relatively explicitly said from the Danish FSA.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per Grønborg
Tor, can I rephrase my question slightly? The Norwegian FSA is basically saying that
Norwegian companies, they are provisioning too much compared to what they are
allowed to under Solvency II. The Danish FSA is saying that you are well-provisioned.
What's your impression, are Tryg (33:43) provisioning more or less conservatively than
you would have been if you had been on the Norwegian regulation?

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
That's a diﬃcult question. Per, I guess, I think I'd stick to the statement saying that we are
sort of – we are comfortable with our own reserve position. We do think that we do on a
regular basis, internally, benchmark our reserves against our competitors both in
Denmark and Norway. And we do feel that our – as I said, we have a comfortable
reserving position.

Q - Per Grønborg
Okay. Thank you.

FINAL

Yes. Good morning. This is Gianandrea from Carnegie. I have a couple of questions here
as well. All this discussion are on the Natural Perils Pool and the development from the
regulatory side in Norway, just really prompts me one question. Is there a risk that your
dividend buyback policy can be changed on the back of this? That's my ﬁrst question.
Second question is around the run-oﬀs, this quarter were only – highlight only 340 bps on
CR, were 730 bps in Q1 and above 500 bps, if I remember correctly, for the last two years.
So it's quite low. And I assume there's less need of that also looking at the already pretty
strong level that you're printing. I'm also intrigued a bit by the split of this run-oﬀ because
it seems like in Denmark you have almost nothing and everything is coming out of
Norway in this quarter, or almost everything, right? While you had a very high number on
a consistent basis for quite a few quarters in Norway. I'm not sure if you can add any
comment on that but it would be highly appreciated.
And ﬁnally, I'm just wondering if your thoughts on the top line developments are anything
diﬀerent compared to Q1. I guess it must be pleasing to see the Private lines growing,
although by 0.1% in a quarter after quite a few quarters. Thank you.

A - Morten Hübbe

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. I can start with the last question and Tor can add on the two ﬁrst questions, Gian
(36:19). No, we don't see that this quarter's development on the top line changes our view
on future top line. I think we've said for the past year or so that we are patient about the
process of turning the slightly negative top line into a slightly positive top line.
We're seeing the ﬁrst signs in this quarter of Private lines and Corporate lines moving into
slightly positive territory which conﬁrms that we're on the right track. I think the higher
customer loyalty and the higher distribution or slightly higher sales conﬁrm that we're on
the right track as well. But as Tor said, we'll continue to see the two next quarters this year
with a negative top line. We'll have a rather ﬂattish development next your. And we'll
continue to see that Commercial and in particularly Sweden will struggle to deliver
positive contribution to the top line.
So there's really no change, but I guess a conﬁrmation that the steps we've taken is
moving us gradually and slowly in the right direction. And we feel very comfortable that
this slightly higher sales is done on the back of new and more price-diﬀerentiated
products where we see a higher quality and a better risk selection of the new customers.
And then on the two ﬁrst questions, Tor.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yeah. I guess, Gianandrea, on the Natural Perils Pool question, I guess there is no
guarantees given, but the way we look at it at the moment, at least, there is no plans to
change our dividend policy or the thoughts around the capital structure. So, as I said, no
guarantees but at least we don't have any plans in that respect.

In terms of the runoﬀ, yes, you're correct, there is a slightly lower runoﬀ this quarter and it
brings it more, let's call it, to a normalized level year-to-date as I mentioned. And I guess
to a certain extent, you will see some ﬂuctuations in the runoﬀs without putting too much
into that. I guess, in principle, you can say that if we look into sort of there are some
movements in the reserves this quarter, and that is also the reason why you see some
diﬀerences between Norway and Denmark, as you mentioned, because there is a change
related to the workers' comp reserves in Norway.
So we have seen some relatively positive developments in the motor segment and then
we have had actually some strengthening related to the workers' comp business because
there is a likelihood that there may be a change in the interest level – interest rate level
used for compensation. So, yes, there are some, as you mentioned, some relatively large
movements this quarter isolated. But you shouldn't read too much into it in terms of the
longer term view of the reserves.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks for that. I actually have a very quick ﬁnal question that I forgot. On the – again,
looking at the geographical split, the Norwegian combined ratio ended up at 65.9%. But I
guess that's heavily impacted by the change in the pension scheme that you mentioned
previously. You didn't disclose the impact of that, but would it be fair to assume that
adjusting for that Norwegian combined ratio would have been anywhere between 75%
and 80% this quarter?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yeah. It's – we haven't, as you said, disclosed it, Gianandrea, but it's 13 percentage points
related to the eﬀects on the Norwegian combined ratio. So as you mentioned, a relatively
signiﬁcant impact on the combined ratio in Norway this quarter.

Our next question is coming from Daniel Do-Thoi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Two very, very quick questions from me. The ﬁrst one is relating to the
cloudburst in Denmark which, you say, was covered by your reinsurance program. Could
you just give us the gross loss attributable to this cloudburst, i.e., what you would have –
the cost you would have incurred if you were not in the money on the sideways
reinsurance.
Secondly, on the match portfolio, could you just help us understand the performance
within this, particularly when you split it out into the two components, the regulatory
deviation and the match portfolio performance? And if you could just – I mean, in the past

you always guided to sort of return to zero over time, does that still apply? Or how should
we think about particularly the match performance component of that line? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yeah. I can answer both of them. As you said, Daniel, on the cloudburst on a gross basis,
we're talking in the area of DKK 50 million, so not a very signiﬁcant amount. But as you
said, there's no doubt that it's been covered by the sideways reinsurance.
But also what is mentioned in the report is related to actually how we account for the
sideways cover which makes it slightly tricky to understand the accounting, but that's why
we have shown the weather impact and you'll ﬁnd the coverage on the reinsurance
program on the runoﬀ side.

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Related to the match, the match portfolio is, yes, you're correct in your assumption. The
regulatory deviation should over time more or less be equal to zero. I guess, the most
important factor to mention there is, as I said, the DKK 50 million, which we'll call match
performance which, in principle, is that we see that we have had a very favorable
development on the assets that we have held in the match portfolio, i.e., that there is a
substantial amount on Norwegian and Danish AAA-rated cover bonds that has perhaps
performed better than benchmark, and of course that is something that at least a
substantial part of that is a proﬁt that we expect to keep.

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay. So it's a function of spreads tightening? Could there be (43:42) performance
component of it?

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Well, you can say it's on the basis of speciﬁc papers that have (43:49) performed better
than benchmark.

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Two questions from my side. First, regarding the Swedish market. I understand
you have a positive eﬀect from the Danske Bank agreement. You also have your own sales
force in place in the Swedish market. The Swedish market which actually gives you 2%
increase there, if we deduct the Nordea agreement. I was wondering if you could give a
bit more insight to the terms of the Danske Bank agreement, how much of this growth
actually comes out of this agreement?
My second question goes for the IT transition, which you are partly through now, I
understand. How much could we expect to see from costs in relation to this transition in
the third quarter? Thank you.

A - Morten Hübbe
If I take the ﬁrst question. Clearly, we are working hard to making sure that our own sales
force and the Danske agreement can compensate for the drop of the Nordea distribution.
So far, the fact that we're selling as much now without the Nordea agreement as with an
Nordea agreement is mainly the result of our own sales force being increased, and that is
mainly our outbound call center in Malmø (45:19) which mainly does cross-sales to
existing customers with only single products from our niche areas.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, so far Danske actually has been started very positively and we're very positive about
the future and we're starting to see referrals and sales. But the sales are not yet at a level
where it contributes signiﬁcantly to the overall growth.
And bear in mind that the model between Danske and us is not the they sell for us, but
rather that they refer customers to us and for us to do the actual sales. So we started well,
but it doesn't play a signiﬁcant role in the actual sales numbers yet.

Q - Thomas Eskildsen

{BIO 18627844 <GO>}

Thank you

A - Morten Hübbe
And then your second question, I think?

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yes. Related to the IT transition, you can say that the transition is ongoing. We have just
started and it will continue throughout the second half of 2014. In terms of the accounting
eﬀects, we have made a provision for the double operating expenses that we will see
related to that transition. And also parts of the compensation that we need to pay related
to the transition. And that's really why we haven't disclosed the amount because this is a
part of an ongoing negotiation with the vendors.

Q - Thomas Eskildsen

{BIO 18627844 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

FINAL

Hi. Can you hear me?

Operator
We hear you now, sir.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Okay. So the questions are on the reinsurance cover and the large claims. Could you just –
the sideways reinsurance cover renews at the 1st of July. Has there been any signiﬁcant
movement in the cost of that program, up or down, this year?
And the second part is, you've given expected annual level of claims of, what, a DKK 1.50
billion between large claims and weather claims. Is there any signiﬁcant seasonality in the
second half from your experience that we should take into account or is it is roughly half
of the budget? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yeah. I guess I can answer. The ﬁrst one is that, yes, the reinsurance cover has the
sideways reinsurance. So the frequency cover has been renewed and there's no
signiﬁcant changes in terms of the program or the prices, slightly, slightly increased
prices, but nothing signiﬁcant.
In terms of the annual budget, as you mentioned, for weather and large claims. You can
say that the large claims is – of course, it's natural to say that you take one quarter every
quarter, so to speak. So 25% every quarter because it's, by nature, diﬃcult to anticipate
when those large claims will occur. In terms of the weather-related claims, you can say that
that will have – it will have a heavily tilt in Q1 and Q4, and less of an impact in Q2 and Q3.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma
