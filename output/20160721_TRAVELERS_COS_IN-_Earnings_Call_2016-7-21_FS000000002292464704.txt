Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Thank you, Gabby. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This
morning we reported second quarter operating income of $649 million or $2.20 per share
and an operating return on equity of 11.6%. Our underwriting results remain strong as
reflected in our 93.1% combined ratio for the quarter, despite the impacts of higher
catastrophe and non-cat weather-related losses year-over-year. For the six months, we
reported operating income of $1.35 billion, or $4.52 per share, and an operating return on
equity of 12%.
Given the cumulative impact of eight or so years of declining interest rates on our
investment portfolio and also relative to the fresh lows in the risk free rate, we feel terrific
about the returns we continue to generate. Our expertise in risk selection and pricing, our
thoughtful and consistent investment strategy and our active approach to capital
management all come together to enable us to achieve our objectives of delivering
superior returns and creating shareholder value.
Turning to production, the second quarter was another example of the successful
execution of our marketplace strategies. We're very pleased with the record volume of

Page 2 of 24

FINAL

premium that we wrote in the quarter and we continue to be very pleased with the
modeled returns in the business we're writing.
In our commercial businesses, retentions remained high and renewal premium change
was positive. Underneath that, consistent with our very granular approach to execution, in
Middle Market we retained 90% of the premium from our best performing accounts with
only a modest decline in renewal rate change on that business. On our poor performing
accounts, we achieved renewal rate change in excess of loss trend. You might have
noticed that renewal rate change in domestic Business Insurance was slightly positive as
compared to slightly negative in the first quarter and renewal rate change in Middle
Market improved by a full point. We don't forecast rate and we're not calling a bottom,
but the significance of this to us is that the market remains remarkably stable and we're
generally successful in achieving our written return objectives.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of new business, we are actively seeking and finding opportunities that meet our
return thresholds and we delivered strong new business growth in our commercial
businesses, including 10% growth in new business and domestic Business Insurance. In
Personal Insurance, net written premiums grew 9% to a record of over $2.1 billion with
accelerating momentum in both auto and homeowners. New business was up 21% yearover-year driven by the success of the Quantum product. Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to
meet our financial expectations and is successfully enhancing our market position.
Our success in the marketplace across all our businesses really speaks to the value of the
talent that we have in the home office and in the field and their ability to leverage our
data and analytics and work with our distribution partners to deliver great products and
services at fair prices to our customers. Franchise value matters.
Before I turn the call over to Jay Benet, I'd like to acknowledge and thank all of the
colleagues in the Claim organization for their extraordinary efforts in handling the claims
of our customers affected by severe weather and fire so far this year. These experts are
on the front line for us, delivering on the promise we extend with every policy that we
write and it has been a very active year so far for them. Their responsiveness and
expertise are great for our customers and an important competitive advantage for us.
In Canada, where we saw significant wildfires in the Fort McMurray area, both our
customers and we benefited from the work we've done to replicate our U.S. claim model,
which enables us to respond to large-scale events with our own highly-trained
professionals and resources without resorting to independent adjusters.
So, all in all, solid results for the quarter in the first half, particularly in light of the weather
and wildfires, and continued excellent execution in the marketplace.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet.

FINAL

Thanks, Alan. As I did in the first quarter, I'd like to start by saying that we were pleased
with our results, operating income of $649 million and operating return on equity of 11.6%,
despite them being lower than in the prior-year quarter. These reductions did not result
from significant changes in underlying business trends. Notably, as indicated on page four
of the webcast, the quarter-over-quarter decrease in operating income was impacted by,
among other things, PCS CAT events and lower fixed income, net investment income.
Losses from PCS-CAT events that met or exceeded our threshold we're recording as cats
were $79 million higher after tax than in the prior-year quarter. While losses from PCS-CAT
events that fell below our cat thresholds, which we recorded as part of non-cat weatherrelated losses within underlying underwriting results were $56 million higher after tax than
in the prior-year quarter. And fixed income NII was $21 million lower after tax, primarily due
to the continuing low interest rate environment as we had anticipated in the outlook
section of our first quarter 2016, 10-Q. Everything else was pretty much a wash.
We continued to experience net favorable prior-year reserve development, which totaled
$288 million pre-tax or $192 million after tax this quarter, up from $207 million pre-tax or
$133 million after tax in the prior-year quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Business and International Insurance, net favorable development of $138 million pre-tax,
or $94 million after-tax, primarily resulted from better than expected loss in domestic
workers' comp for accident years 2006 and prior and accident year 2015. Better than
expected loss experience in domestic general liability for accident years 2011 and 2015
and better than expected loss experience in our European operations partially offset by
an $82 million pre-tax or $53 million after tax increase to environmental reserves.
In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $150 million pre-tax or $98
million after-tax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experience in fidelity
and surety for accident years 2010, 2013 and 2014 and better than expected loss
experience in GL for accident years 2007 through 2011. Year-to-date, on a combined stat
basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years have developed favorably or had de
minimis unfavorable development.
In addition, other than commercial multi-apparel, all product lines have developed
favorably year-to-date. While CMP has developed unfavorably by $42 million year-to-date,
you may recall my telling you in the first quarter that there was an offsetting favorable
development in the property product line as middle market property losses that had
been recorded in the property line at year-end 2015 were subsequently determined to
be CMP related.
Operating cash flows of $443 million were very strong particularly recognizing that they
were net of the $524 million payment we made this quarter as final settlement of the PPG
asbestos litigation. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $1.75 billion
and all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels.
Net unrealized investment gains increased to approximately $3.6 billion pre-tax or $2.3
billion after tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively at the beginning of the year,
Page 4 of 24

while book value per share of $85.73 and adjusted book value per share of $77.61
increased 7% and 3%, respectively, also from the beginning of the year.
We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our business and,
consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned $747 million of
excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $197 million and share
repurchases of $550 million. Year-to-date, we've returned over $1.5 billion to our
shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Before turning the microphone over to Brian, there's one additional topic I'd like to cover,
our cat reinsurance coverage. In addition to our Corporate Cat Aggregate XOL Treaty,
which had renewed at the beginning of the year, our cat reinsurance includes cat bonds
that are specific to the Northeast U.S., along with the Northeast Gen Cat Treaty. With
respect to the cat bonds, one that had provided up to $300 million of coverage for
certain losses, expired as scheduled in May 2016 and, given our current risk profile, we
decided not to replace it.

Bloomberg Transcript

With respect to the remaining cat bond, which will not expire until May 2018, the
attachment point and maximum limit were reset, as required annually, to adjust the
modeled expected loss of the layer within a predetermined range. For the year beginning
May 16, 2016, we will begin recovering amounts under this cat bond if losses in the
covered area for a single occurrence reach an additional attachment amount of $1.968
billion. The full $300 million coverage amount is available on a proportional basis until such
covered losses reach a maximum $2.468 billion.
And finally, our Northeast Gen Cat Treaty was renewed on July 1. This treaty provides up
to $800 million, part of $850 million of coverage, subject to a $2.25 billion retention for
certain losses arising from hurricanes, tornados, hailstorms, earthquakes and winter storm
or freeze losses from Virginia to Maine. A more complete description of our cat
reinsurance coverage, including a description of earthquake and International coverage, is
included in our second quarter 10-Q, which we filed earlier today, as well as in our 2015 10K. While the total cost of these treaties is small in relation to our operating income, we
were able to save some money by not replacing the expiring cat bond.
And with that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian.

Brian William MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Thanks, Jay. In Business and International Insurance, we're pleased with the results this
quarter. In domestic Business Insurance, we achieved very strong retention, along with a
modest increase in renewal rate change versus the first quarter, and higher levels of new
business. Our strategy has not changed as we strive to retain our best performing
accounts, get rate where needed, and write new business when it meets our target
returns. This has been our strategy for some time and as a result, we continue to be
viewed as a stable and financially strong market by our distributors and customers. Along
with the meaningful competitive advantages that we deliver, this consistent leadership
position is resulting in additional growth opportunities for us.

FINAL

Turning to the financial results for the segment, operating income was $393 million, with a
combined ratio of 97.5%. Cat losses for the quarter were $143 million net after-tax, which
included $61 million from the Canadian wildfires. Excluding the Canadian fires, cat losses
were slightly higher than the prior-year quarter.
The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats in prior-year reserve
development, was 95.5%, up 2.4 points compared to the second quarter of 2015. The
loss ratio increased by 1.7 points, driven primarily by non-cat weather, which was higher
than both the prior-year quarter and our expectation. The expense ratio was up 0.7 point
over last year, driven primarily by commissions, as the second quarter of 2015 benefited
from a one-time favorable adjustment.
Net written premiums for the quarter were in line with the prior-year quarter, with
domestic Business Insurance premiums up about 2%. Given the returns that we are
generating in this business, our focus continues to be on retention. And so we were very
pleased that retention remained at 85% for the quarter. Renewal premium change was
just over 2 points, including renewal rate change that was slightly positive. New business
of $525 million was up 10% versus the second quarter of 2015.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to the individual businesses within Business Insurance, beginning with Select, we
achieved retention of 82% and renewal premium change of nearly 6%. Rate change was
down slightly versus the first quarter of 2016, while exposure was in line with recent
periods, and new business was up slightly year-over-year.
In Middle Market, retention remained very strong at 87%, with renewal premium change
of about 1.5 point, in line with recent quarters. In terms of new business opportunities,
given our leadership position in the market, submissions were up year-over-year.
Accordingly, we had more opportunities to quote on the types and classes of business we
find attractive, and to grow our new business while maintaining our return thresholds.
In Other Business Insurance, retention of 82% was up 1 point year-over-year, while
renewal premium change was a 0.5 point, and new business of $154 million was
consistent with the second quarter of 2015.
As we've mentioned in the past, Other Business Insurance includes our National Property
business. While there continues to be some rate pressure in this business, returns remain
attractive, and as a result, retention is our priority. As you can see on page 13 of the
webcast, excluding National Property, renewal rate change for Other Business Insurance
remains positive and was relatively consistent with recent quarters.
In International, net written premiums for the second quarter were down about 12%
quarter-over-quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net written premiums
were down about 9%, driven by disciplined underwriting actions in our UK business, along
with lower economic activity, impacting the marine and energy lines of our Lloyd's
business.

FINAL

New business of $107 million was up 67% year-over-year, driven primarily by Optima, our
new strategic Personal Lines auto product in Canada, which was modeled after our U.S.based Quantum Auto 2.0 product. So, all in, a good quarter for the segment with strong
production and profitability.
I'll turn now to Bond & Specialty Insurance, where we had another terrific quarter.
Operating income of $202 million was up significantly from the prior-year quarter, driven
by a higher level of net favorable prior-year reserve development. The underlying
combined ratio of 80.9% remains exceptionally strong.
As for top line, net written premiums for the quarter were in line with the prior year as
growth in Management Liability was offset by lower surety premium. The lower surety
volume was due almost entirely to favorable one-time reinsurance impacts in the prioryear quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Across our Management Liability business, retention remained at historically high levels
and new business volumes were up as we continue to execute our strategy of retaining
our best accounts, and writing more business in our return adequate product segment.
We continue to feel great about this segment's performance.
In Personal Insurance, results were again strong and we remain particularly pleased with
our ability to add top-line growth at appropriate financial returns. Net written premiums for
the quarter of $2.1 billion were an all-time high with double-digit growth in Agency Auto,
while growth also accelerated in Agency Homeowners & Other. In both products, we
continue to produce strong retention and new business levels. Agent and consumer
receptivity to Quantum Auto 2.0 remains exceptional, and importantly, a significant
amount of Quantum Auto 2.0 business are now coming through their renewal cycles.
We're pleased with the retention rates we're seeing on those policies.
In Homeowners, our growth momentum is building due to crossover benefits from
Quantum Auto 2.0 as well as pricing changes and improvements to agent and customer
experience.
Turning to profitability, operating income for the segment was down compared to the
prior-year quarter due primarily to lower net favorable prior-year reserve development.
The underlying combined ratio of 89.5% was in line with our expectation but up about a
point from the prior year, driven by the impact of the significant new business volume in
recent years, and normal quarterly volatility in weather and other loss activity.
In Agency Auto, the 101.3 combined ratio included 2.7 points in cats, primarily resulting
from hailstorms. Weather also impacted the underlying combined ratio with 1.7 points of
non-cat weather-related losses, which is approximately 1 point higher than both our
expectations and the second quarter of 2015. The remaining increase in the underlying
combined ratio was driven by the high levels of new business that I just mentioned.
As we've noted before, the Quantum Auto 2.0 business is priced to our long-term target
returns and loss experience is performing in line with our expectation.

FINAL

Turning to Agency Homeowners & Other, underlying financial results remain strong. The
second quarter underlying combined ratio of 78.2% is well within our target return levels
as we continue to execute our disciplined underwriting and pricing strategies. So, overall
for Personal Insurance, we feel great about the growth and the financial returns that the
business is generating.
Before I turn it back to Gabby, I would like to take a moment to recognize Doreen
Spadorcia, who announced her retirement from Travelers, effective September 1 of this
year. Over the past 30 years, Doreen has played an important role on our management
team and we wish her well as she enjoys a new chapter of her life.
With that, let me turn it over to Gabby.

Thank you, Brian. Tina, we are now ready to start the Q&A portion of the call. If I could ask
the participants to limit yourself to one question and one follow up please. Thank you.

Q&A
Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. One moment, please, for our first question. Our first question comes from
Randy Binner of FBR and Co. Please go ahead.

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

Hey. Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to talk about the underlying combined ratio in
Business and International. And I think in the comments and in the press release, you
attributed the increase of 2.4% to non-cat weather but as well as loss costs not being
covered by earned pricing. Can we get more granular on that because we're at a point in
the cycle where not covering loss cost with earned trend is potentially an issue, and just
wanted to get a better detail on that?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Sure, Randy. It's Alan. I'll take that. So the underlying combined ratio in that segment,
you're right, was down 2.4 points. Part of that was commission and that was a year-overyear comparison thing, nothing going on there.
The other piece of that was in the loss ratio. The majority of that does come from non-cat
weather. There is a relatively small piece of earned rate versus loss trend coming through.
And one of the reasons we showed you page four in the webcast was to try to put that in
a little bit of context. So really what's impacting year-over-year is the weather.
As we said before, we've tried to make clear that rate and loss trend is one small piece of
what goes on but there's also taxes, expenses, base year, mix, the impact of changes in

Page 8 of 24



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2016-07-21

claims handling, things like that. Everything else, as we would have expected, was a wash.
So there's nothing in that earned rate versus loss trend that was surprising to us or that
we think shouldn't had been evident from the written information we've provided over
the last year or so.

FINAL

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

Is the piece of it though that's the loss trend versus earned pricing is that – I think you're
saying that it's not surprising you but it does seem to be changing. Is it a bigger piece of
the equation than it has been in the last few quarters?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Well, it's the earned impact of what we've been disclosing as written over the past year.
So it's earning in as we would have expected and we called it out just in the interest of
transparency. But, again, nothing that surprises us and given where our written and earned
returns are, nothing that we're not comfortable with.

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

And then (24:11) so then...

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And I'd add...

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

Sorry. Go ahead.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

I was just going to say as I said in my prepared remarks, Randy, we're very comfortable
with the model returns on the business we're writing and so just to give you a little bit
more context.

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

And then with non-cat weather this would be truly episodic. Nothing trend wise you're
seeing in that?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

That's correct. Nothing trend-wise in that. It's a normal volatility and non-cat weather.

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

All right. Great. Thank you.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Yeah, good morning. First question is on the pricing, slight uptick in the second quarter.
Could you give a little bit more granularity in terms by lines or by account size? What do
you see underlying sort of trends there in term of – both from the supply and demand
side and what do you see could potentially be the upside pricing as well as the downside
to that pricing?

A - Brian William MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Yeah, Kai. So, this is Brian. I'll start a couple of broad dynamics. I think not surprisingly auto
is the line where we're seeing the most positive pricing movement. Comp is I think the
line with the most pressure. And that's I think really consistent in workers' comp, if you see
what's coming out of NCCI and other competitors that's not surprising.

Bloomberg Transcript

From an account size perspective, larger accounts under more pressure. So, we've talked
a lot and others have talked about a large property business. We think that's somewhat
consistent with the returns that have been in that business. But some pressure is there. I
think even larger casualty business is under a little more pressure than the middle and
small type of business. I don't think from an industry perspective there's anything
appreciable. But that would be the broad strokes.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. Then a follow up on the reserve side. It looks like reserve continued to be strong.
And I just wanted to focus on sort of three areas. One is that the workers comp release in
2015 is that sort of like – is that too early for a long tail line of business? And secondly, the
$82 million environmental charges looks like we are having those amounts for at least for
the last five years to six years. Just wondering, like why wouldn't you book if you know the
pattern is there, why wouldn't you book a big charge upfront? And then, the third piece is,
pretty strong like a Bond & Specialty continue release (26:55) any underlying loss cost
trends there will be appreciated? Thank you so much.

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Thanks, Kai. This is Jay Benet. Let's try to take them in order. So, as far as the workers'
comp, you're absolutely right, when you have a very long tail line of business, you look
very, very carefully at things that happen in the short term and don't necessarily react to
them. In the case of the workers' comp what you're seeing here is favorable
development in 2015 that related to a relatively short component of it relating to medical
where medical bills come in quickly, they get resolved quickly and the assumption that we
had put in there for medical inflation was just too high. So while the line itself is a long tail
line, there are components of it that are more short tail and that's primarily what we
reacted to there.

Page 10 of 24



FINAL

Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2016-07-21

As far as the environmental piece is concerned, I think if you look at us, as well as the
industry, you'll see a similar pattern, if you will, of people trying to, at various points in
time, estimate what the ultimate is going to be for environmental losses and recognizing
that you're dealing with something that is a very difficult kind of reserve to truly evaluate.
So in doing so you have to make various assumptions as to what the future is going to
look like in terms of new claims, new policyholders, what the average frequency and
severity might be associated with things that have been reported or not reported. And it's
those assumptions that you're constantly updating as time goes on.
So what we disclosed and I'll point you to the 10-Q, what we disclosed this year is actually
very similar to what we've disclosed in prior periods and what you've seen other
companies disclose that there really hasn't been a change in the environment per se.
Things have gotten a little better. But the rate of them getting better has just been less
than what was previously assumed or hoped for and that's a chunk of the reserve
addition.
In addition to that, we're always subject to judicial rulings or other things that take place
episodically in various jurisdictions. And there was one that came out of the Northwest
that increased modestly, some of our claim costs there that we also recognized.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then, finally, on the Bond & Specialty, this was a quarter for a fairly large prior-year
reserve development benefit. I wouldn't say there was anything unusual about it. This is,
as you know, it's a high severity, low frequency business. It's one where information
emerges slowly. As it emerges, you're always evaluating whether or not it's blossomed to
a level where you really feel action is appropriate.
So there are things that have been taking place whether it's in items related to the
financial crisis or whatever that we've been watching. Things got to a point this quarter
where we recognized that it was appropriate to take some reserve action. It wasn't any
one product line. It wasn't any one particular claim or things like that. It was pretty much
spread across the whole Management Liability and Surety book of business.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you so much.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Please go
ahead.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Thanks so much. Can you talk a little bit about – when we talked about non-cat weather in
BI and Personal Auto? Can you talk about non-cat weather in Homeowners' book and how
that has looked recently?

A - Brian William MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. I mean – Michael, this is Brian again. In this quarter, similarly, there was some, but not
to the same degree. So, just to quantify it, because I said about 1 point on the auto side, it
was probably about a 0.5 point on the Personal Property side, of some impact there. So
some, but not as dramatic of that, again, that's specifically the PCS event that I discussed
(31:27).

Q - Michael Nannizzi

Got it. I guess, I'm just curious because it looks like, in the last few quarters like, especially
in BI, we've talked about non-cat weather impacting the underlying, and sort of the driver
for the year-over-year comps being negative. And then, in auto, looks like it was a factor
this quarter as well. But when I look at my estimates and your results over the last several
quarters, Homeowners has been consistently better, and I think better even relative to
your outlook, as you've disclosed in your Qs. So I'm just trying to understand why the
impact is potentially disproportionate in these areas? Is it because the nature of the risk is
different, or reinsurance, or it – or something else that's causing non-cat weather to be –
looks like a tailwind in one, potentially, and a headwind in the others?

A - Michael F. Klein

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

{BIO 1843589 <GO>}

Yeah Michael, this is Michael Klein. I think what you're seeing is a combination of factors in
the home product, and weather is one of them. In the case of this quarter, I think what you
see is, to Brian's point on the net impact, it's a couple moving parts underneath. You've
got the weather impact, but we've also had underlying experience on fire, non-weather,
water losses that, again, also fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. So when Brian talked about
weather and other normal quarterly fluctuations, that's really what he's talking about. And
this quarter was an example of that, where we had some other non-cat weather, again,
non-weather water, fire experience that came in better than expected. And importantly,
for the year-over-year comparison this quarter, there actually was a significant individual
risk fire loss in the second quarter of last year that helps the quarter-over-quarter
comparison, just to give you a little bit of color on that.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then maybe, Brian, on BI so it sounds like, from
Alan's comments, that the lift in the expense ratio was commission related. I'm guessing
that means that that should continue, because I'm also just sort of trying to square that...?

A - Brian William MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

No.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

Yeah, last year in the second quarter, we had a takedown in our contingent commission
accrual that reduced the number, so that created a year-over-year kind of difference.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah, the delta's not really in the base commissions. The delta's in these other things.

A - Brian William MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. So my point, the 33.3 expense ratio in this quarter, forget the comps, but just the
absolute number this quarter, is that how we should be thinking about it? It sounds like
there were one-offs last year, but this quarter, is that how we should be thinking about the
expense ratio from here?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

It's Alan, Michael. I guess I would say that we try not to forecast on these individual pieces,
but what I'd suggest is maybe you go back over the last – I don't know, somewhere
between two and four quarters, and average the number and maybe use that as sort of a
proxy for a go-forward number. But there's always going be some volatility quarter-toquarter.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay. Got it. Just because it does screen relatively high when I go back...?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

So it sounds like maybe there's some volatility. I was just trying to understand what drove
some episode of a higher expense ratio that should cause that to normalize, as you're
sort of suggesting it should. But maybe I can follow up afterwards. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Thanks. My first question I guess is for Brian. I was just hoping for a little bit more color on
what's been driving the solid new business growth in middle markets. I think you
mentioned submissions are up but, I guess, sort of like over the past couple of quarters it
has been pretty strong, and just sort of what you're seeing on the new business front?

A - Brian William MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Yeah. I think it's a couple of factors. We believe, as I tried to say in my comments, driven
by the fact that I think we're in a pretty strong position in the marketplace, we've been
executing in a very stable and effective way, I think, for a long period of time. We've got
some real competitive advantages.

Bloomberg Transcript

The overall market is pretty stable ,but there has been some pretty well-publicized
dislocations, and at least a couple of very large carriers have been very open about taking
profit improvement actions, and so that's created some specific opportunities. But I think,
we think more broadly, has also created a little bit of a mood in the marketplace of flight
to quality.
So like I said, we've seen our submission activity up a decent amount and we've also,
consistent with that, been driving a message to our organization, not strategically to do
anything different with returns, but to be more active and to be out there quoting more.
So just to be blunt about it, we're pushing our place pretty hard right now, to be real
active in the marketplace and get out the quotes and not compromise on returns. But try
to meet the opportunity of the submission activity. And that's been paying off and
specifically, our Core Middle Market Commercial Accounts business and the construction
areas.

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Ryan, I would add to that, that part of our motivation behind pushing a little bit more
activity is just where returns are, product returns in the marketplace, after five or so years
of price increases. And so there's a lot out there that's potentially attractive to us,
consistent – and this is really important, consistent with our return objectives. So we're not
making any compromises on that.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Okay. That makes a lot of sense. I guess my other question was just on just looking at the
margin trajectory in Agency Auto, and how to think about that on a go-forward basis. I
guess year-to-date, there have been a couple things that seemed to be have been
weighing on the loss – on the accident year loss ratio sum. There's the new business drag.
Then there's the elevated non-cat weather. But something that we thought was
interesting was, looking in the 10-Q, it looks like the language looking into 2017 was that
margins would remain kind of where they've been. And I'm kind of curious, as you lap the
Page 14 of 24



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2016-07-21

elevated new business and you get rid of the lower non-cat weather, why would margins
not be improving kind of as you look out into 2017?

FINAL

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

So I think just couple quick comments then I'll pass it to Michael. Certainly we view the
non-cat weather as episodic and so we think that should absolutely return to normal
levels.
On the new business dynamic, the good news is that we continue to write some
significant levels of new business through that product. So we feel great that we are
building real embedded value in that portfolio but it is going to take longer. The stronger
the production top line is the longer it is going to take for that to really work through the
loss ratio.
The other point I'd make is the Quantum 2.0 product also was designed to have a lower
expense ratio and a little bit higher on the loss side. So you have to look at the combined
in total to get that product.

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, Ryan. If I could just clarify something, one of the things we actually added to the Q this
quarter was in the outlook section we had previously spoken to underlying underwriting
margins. And we thought it was important to add combined ratio because people often
use those terms interchangeably. And as you know, the combined ratio is a function of the
premium volume whereas the margins are just dollars.
And just to clarify what we're seeing here in the Q for auto, which I think is what we're
talking about, the early part of 2017 the company expects underlying underwriting
margins, the dollars to be slightly higher because of what's taking place with writing higher
volumes of business that's profitable. But writing a higher percentage of new business
relative to the base is also causing a slight uptick in the underlying combined ratio. So you
have this feature here where the dollars are going up, at the same time that the
combined ratio is going up. So I just wanted to clarify that.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Yeah. That's helpful. I think I was a little bit confused by that. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.

A - Brian William MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Ryan, the other factor just to note, it's not all this new business impact from what we're
writing. As Michael explained a second ago, we haven't had this in the last quarter or so,
this favorable non-weather loss activity. And as we also highlight in the 10-Q we expect
that to return to the more normal level. So, that's also having, on a go-forward basis, a
slight adverse impact.

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

FINAL

Thanks.

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 1843589 <GO>}

This is Michael Klein. The only thing I would add is underneath it, just to reiterate right,
Quantum Auto 2.0 was priced at the same return level as the book of business has been
priced to. It really is the dynamic of preponderance of newer – think of it as younger
business, right. The portfolio is getting younger because of the outsized growth that
we've seen over the last couple of years. But the long-term return targets for the product
remain consistent with where they've been.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Kumar of Macquarie. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Thanks, and good morning. Two quick questions, probably these are follow-ups and I
apologize if I'm still not clear. Just going back to the discussion on BI and what Randy was
asking, if you ex out all the moving parts, and just focus on the underlying discussion on
the negative loss cost trends versus – on pricing, is it episodic is what you are saying or is
this the usual sort of trend line, i.e.; you've talked about this in the past that over time this
equation would get flipped now we're at the point where it has flipped? I'm trying to
understand that.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah, it's not episodic. There is a trend there. But I think what we've told you in the past is
there is some danger to looking at that very narrow definition of rate versus loss trend.
Obviously anybody can look at rate which is sort of around zero and loss trend which is
something north of zero on a written basis and it has been moving in that direction for
some number of quarters.
So as anybody, as we would have expected as that earns in over time, there will be some
negative pressure on margin but what we've said in the past is, you've got to look at that
in the context of all the other moving pieces that impact underlying underwriting margin.
Things like we have a tax impact year-over-year this quarter, there's expenses, there's
base year, there's mix. All those other things go into that number. And what we've shown
you this quarter is all that comes out to about a wash. And I guess I'd also point you to the
outlook where we give you a sense of over the next four quarters or so that we would
expect the underlying underwriting margins obviously subject to the volatility of weather
and what not to continue to be probably consistent.

A - Brian William MacLean

The other thing I'd emphasize. This is Brian. Is that there's a lot of things in there that we
have to react to and there are other things in there that we are actively managing. And so
you shouldn't have the impression that we're just sitting by and as Alan just said, pricing is
at roughly zero this quarter. Rate and loss trend is something north of that. That we're just
conceding that margins will receive. We're managing our mix. We're taking actions in
underwriting selection. We're taking actions in claim execution which are all impacting our
loss trend. And then we're reacting to weather volatility, et cetera, that might be moving
through the business. So there's no denying that the sheer arithmetic of that narrow
piece, the loss trend and the rate right now is a negative. We've said in the past that it's
relatively modest and it continues to be relatively modest and then there are all the other
impacts that are going through.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Got it. That's a fair comment. The second question I had was just going back to the
discussion on Quantum 2.0. In the past, when we've talked about loss cost trends,
frequency was pegged at 0.5 point, severity was at 2.5 points. Has there been any
evolution in that number, or is it still the same?

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Nope. We didn't see anything different in the core underlying trends of what was going on
in the auto book. So we would be at exactly those numbers you just said, about a 0.5
point of frequency, 2.5 points of severity.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Got it. Okay.

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

And as we've said in the Quantum Auto 2.0, specifically, still running consistent with our
loss expectation.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets.
Please go ahead.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Good morning. Thanks for getting me in. I guess, I'd like to follow up again on following
Amit on Quantum 2.0 and the Agency Auto book. And the clarity – I realize there's an
additional disclosure in the Q but how you guys expect the auto book to evolve out? I
guess, the commentary of early 2017 being plus or minus 16%, which is plus or minus 15%,
and you say that you are underwriting to the same return dynamic? But, I guess, this has

Page 17 of 24



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2016-07-21

FINAL

been a book influx, that coming out of 2011 and 2012 where it's been underperforming
and the introduction of Quantum 2.0. Just where is a run rate on what we should expect
that there's so many moving parts, but it seemed like this should be a story that was
improving? And I guess the commentary seems to be that it has maybe gotten as good
as it's going to get. Is that right?

A - Brian William MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

So the message, absolutely, is not this is as good as it's going to get. The core from a
profitability perspective – well let me start with a top-line perspective because what's the
story on Quantum 2.0. We have been pleasantly surprised with the traction the product
has gotten in the business and in the marketplace. We clearly went in with an expectation
that this would enhance growth and we've done better than our original expectations
there. And you can see the numbers. So we feel good about that. And we're not sure
where that's going to go exactly in the future. But we think that we're going be able to
sustain some pretty decent amount of growth going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

From the profitability perspective, just as is true of all business that we've ever written in
this product, it matures over the years. And so there's a tenure impact. And as Michael
just said, the younger tenured business is typically not as profitable as we write the
business where we're targeting a tenured longer-term return and we're on track to do
that. So, as this portfolio matures, and as Quantum 2.0 – as we get more and more of the
aging of the book, we believe the trend should absolutely be improving profitability on
this business.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Okay. I guess, on that, could you give us some additional insight on the tenure, the curing
of the auto book? On what is the average policy life for you guys on this? I guess, when I
think of some commercial accounts that might be longer, it seems that auto is still, is a
quicker turn product. So, this introduction of new growth that's really been strong. What's
the timeline for curing on an auto book and how long do you on average keep auto
policies?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 1843589 <GO>}

So, Charles, I don't know that I'll get into the specifics of the policy life expectancy et
cetera but to give you a little bit more color – this is Michael.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 1843589 <GO>}

On the aging of the auto book, you have to really think about both components of what's
going on here, right? So, first you need to think about a vintage and think about a book of
business we write in a given policy year. And that new business that we write in that term
that comes on at a higher loss ratio early and then as we renew it, it improves. If you look
at the production statistics that we've been disclosing and the high levels of new
Page 18 of 24



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2016-07-21

FINAL

business, what's happening inside the portfolio then which is the second piece is on
average the portfolio is getting younger, right? And if younger business carries a higher
loss ratio that's what we describe as the increase in the combined.
So when you look at the outlook for the second half of 2016, we say the combined ratio
will be higher due to the impact of the higher new business levels we've been writing.
That is the underlying dynamic that's flowing through the book. That does continue into
the first half of 2017. It just gets offset by an expectation of return to normalized non-cat
weather levels. And so, the underlying dynamic of the book getting younger, meaning less
tenured, right because we've had the accounts not as long, continues into 2017.
Recognize also though that as we write more Quantum Auto 2.0 business there is a
benefit to the combined ratio from an offsetting improvement in the expense ratio
because it carries a commission.
So, that underlying aging of the book or reducing average tenure of the book does
continue into 2017. It just gets offset by again an expectation of return to more normalized
weather. That's why the outlook reads as it does.

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

It's an assumption not an expectation.

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 1843589 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sorry. It's an assumption, yeah. Sorry, Jay.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

So, one other point on that. So, again, as Michael said, we're not going to give you
explicitly the target we have for life expectancy on policies. We think that's part of our
competitive kind of conversation. We clearly accept that hitting the expectations of
retaining the business is important, which is why in my comments I emphasized that, as
we're going into year two, and in some cases year three for the Quantum Auto 2.0
product, we feel really good that we are hitting the retention rates we expected. So
whatever our expectation was for life expectancy, along with our statement about losses
are progressing, so is the retention of the business. And you can look at our long-term
retention and begin to deduce some kind of policy life expectancy by just doing the
arithmetic.

Thank you. I was hoping to get a bit more insight on the pace of share buybacks, it's
slowed over the past few quarters on a linked-quarter basis, and the slowdown in share
buybacks was actually a little greater than the reduction in earnings from the first half of
2015 to the first half of 2016. Can you give us a bit more insight on that?

FINAL

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Yeah, Jay. This is Jay. I think you're looking back at a period of time where – as we've said
in the past, over time, share buybacks are going to be enabled by earnings. And while
there's pension contributions and whatever, it's the earnings of the place over time that
will drive what the total share buybacks and dividends are. And what you saw, and I think
you even asked the question in the past, can we continue to buy back at levels that are
higher than our earnings, well, this is the flip side of it. This is just an indication of the
timing element of when we look and see what the future quarter projections are. They
obviously come out to be whatever they'll be. And we're just picking numbers in the
particular quarter that we're doing the share buybacks over a long-term view to say, in this
particular quarter, $550 million sounds like the right number. So, I wouldn't read anything
into it in terms of a change in philosophy or a change in execution. It's just going be – what
we would refer to as the normal quarterly variation in a policy and a discipline that's been
set for a long period of time.

Q - Jay Gelb

Q - Jay Gelb

Okay. And while you're – if you have that number – I also want to ask about – I know the UK
leave vote is not significant relative to Travelers' in its overall business, but if you have any
thoughts on that, I think that will be real helpful for us.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Sure. In terms of Brexit, the most significant impact to us will be whatever it means for
overall economic activity. The amount of premium that we write out of the UK that relies
on passporting is very, very small. It's something like 5% of our overall International
premium, and about half of that's through Lloyd's, and we assume that, one way or
another, Lloyd's will address the passporting issue – as will we, by the way. Long way to go
to see how that's going to work out and what the ultimate arrangements are going to be.
But other than the overall macro impact, we don't expect any significant impact to us.

Q - Jon Paul Newsome

{BIO 3522950 <GO>}

Good morning, and congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to ask about the competitive
landscape in the Personal Lines business. We've had a few management changes of
recent note, like places like Progressive and State Farm. And I'm wondering if the
components of who is being competitive out there have changed in the last year?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 1843589 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Paul, this is Michael Klein. I would say, broadly speaking, the answer to that question
is no. Competitive dynamics are very local in the business as well. And so, while there
have been changes in management at some national competitors and frankly, some local
regional as well, the broad competitive dynamics in the business remain consistent. When
we look at the rate filing monitoring that we do in the business, to assess the rates that
carriers are taking in particular states in auto or home, we don't see a lot of shift in
behavior there. So I would say the competitive dynamics are broadly consistent.

Q - Jon Paul Newsome

{BIO 3522950 <GO>}

The general idea that the agency folks keep losing share, and the regionals and the direct
people are the most competitive. Is that still kind of really (56:23) the case?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 1843589 <GO>}

I think, if you look at the latest A.M. Best data, you continue to see some incremental shift
in share by channel. Interestingly, I think, consistent with the last couple of years, the
majority of the gains you're seeing in the sort of online direct channel are actually coming
from captive, and less and less from independent agency. But broadly, I think those trends
continue.

This is Jay Benet. Somebody had asked the question about, what was the impact on the

you a little bit of a preface to it. We are parsing things very thin here, and talking strictly
about that.

So if you asked the question, what's the impact of non-cat weather on the combined ratio
on a consolidated basis, we would say it's 150 basis points. But I'd also point out that, if
you asked the question about well, what about other losses? That goes in a different
direction. And what about mix? And that goes in a different direction. So we will answer
your question, but there's lots and lots of things that are taking place here that make the
one number not necessarily indicative of the trends or of what's going to – or what the
expectation is. So I would just urge you to go back to the Q and the outlook to see what
all of this, to us, actually translates into.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Please go ahead.

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. Just to follow up the language in the Q on the commercial, on the
Business Insurance segment where you extended your commentary on the margin into
2017, again, the broadly consistent language, I assume that's largely because the first half
of 2016 had a high level of loss activity of non-cat weather. Is that fair?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That's right. There's some large losses in non-cat weather that in the outlook we would
expect would return to normal levels we would assume.

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Got it. Thanks. And then the second question maybe for Bill Heyman because he hasn't
had a chance to speak yet. Obviously as we would expect, the non-fixed income returns
are always going to be variable. Can you give us a sense – given how the portfolio is
constructed today, what is an expected return for that portfolio at this point?

A - William Herbert Heyman

{BIO 3429455 <GO>}

Thanks, Jay. I think an expected return for non-fixed income ought to be in the high-single
digits pre-tax. If you look at this quarter, we made a bit more in real estate than we
figured. Real estate has two components: rentals from properties we own and NII from
real estate funds. Hedge funds were below what we expected but positive. And the big
variable was private equity. Where the portfolio was almost flat maybe few million dollars,
we would have expected about $50 million pre-tax.
Now what's interesting is the cash flow from that portfolio has remained at historic levels
and it simply hasn't contained as much NII in the past. So we would aim for a double digit
pre-tax return on these assets. And if we didn't feel we could do that we probably would
reduce our allocation. But I think a fair expectation is high-single digits pre-tax.

FINAL

Thank you. Our final question comes from Larry Greenberg of Janney. Please go ahead.

Q - Larry Greenberg

{BIO 16478161 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks. And I'll apologize for going back to this but, I mean, just listening to some of
the chatter that's out there this morning there's something of a view that you guys
elaborating on the pricing loss trend relationship in Business Insurance suggests that
you're seeing or thinking something new. And, if I hear what you're saying, it really doesn't
appear to be the case. And I just want to be sure that I've got that right.

Yeah. Larry, it's Alan. Let me be clear about it. There's nothing that's changed. There's
nothing that's surprising us and everything is consistent with what we have reported to
you on a written basis over the last fourth quarters.
The real reason we put in there is we wanted to be completely transparent about it. It's a
very small piece, but we thought, gee, if we didn't put it in there you or somebody would
have said to us, gee, how can this not be happening because we're looking your written
numbers over the last three or fourth quarters. So, I will just reiterate it. It's small. It's within
our expectations. It's wrapped up with all the other things that are typically moving around
in the quarter. It's about a wash in terms of the year-over-year impact. And no message
intended in terms of anything out of the ordinary. Completely expected. Completely
consistent with what we've seen on a written basis. And we continue to be very pleased
with the model returns on the business that we're writing.

Q - Larry Greenberg

{BIO 16478161 <GO>}

Great. And then just my follow up, Jay, in your discussion on non-renewing that cat bond, I
think you said that the reason was due to your current risk profile. And, I'm just curious
about that comment and if you can elaborate a little bit on that?

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Primarily our cat program is one that protects capital, not one that really deals with income
protection.
If you look at where the limits are and things of that sort, and where the attachment
points are, it's pretty high up there. So, in any given period, we're looking at the entirety
of it, where our property exposures are and just giving away the book has evolved over
the last few years we just felt that this wasn't really adding much on a risk versus cost
basis. So, we decided not to renew it.
