FINAL

Thanks, Dennis. Good morning, everyone. Before getting into the Second Quarter's
results, I want to ﬁrst make a few comments about the events of the past six weeks. I can
say without hesitation that the number and magnitude of catastrophic events that we've
witnessed are unprecedented in my 21 years in the industry and with Intact.
The ﬂooding in southern Alberta was unique not only because of the volume of water
involved. But also because entire communities were devastated. The recovery eﬀort will
take months and even years for some areas. I'm conﬁdent, though, that we have the
people and the expertise to be there for as long as it takes. Our promise is to get
customers back to their normal lives and we're more committed than ever to doing that.

Bloomberg Transcript

The tragedy in Lac Megantic is beyond anything I have seen before given its atrocious
nature and devastating impact on the lives of many individuals and families in that
community. Within a few hours of the accident, we had a fully functional mobile unit onsite and our people were there to help our customers in those trying times. Our thoughts
are with these families. I was on-site in both these places and had the opportunity to see
our people in action as they helped our customers.
I've been impressed by the speed of their response. But more importantly by the empathy
that they have displayed in those diﬃcult times. I want to thank our people on location, as
well as across the country, who went beyond and above to respond to these and other
events this summer. Despite the CAD0.92 per share in total losses from catastrophes, this
morning we announced Second Quarter net operating income per share of CAD0.89. Our
combined ratio of 97.5%. reﬂects the resilience of our business in light of these events.
Continued strong performance in automobile insurance and improvements in our
expense ratio were the drivers behind the underwriting proﬁt. From a topline perspective
premium growth of 10% reﬂects the continued successful integration of Jevco, as well as
solid organic growth. I'm pleased with our ability to leverage the Jevco products across
our distribution platform. This has oﬀset or more than oﬀset the expected impact we have
seen from re-underwriting parts of the acquired business, particularly, in commercial lines.
Our earnings over the past years have generated an operating ROE of 14.4%. And a 9%
increase in book value per share.
From a capital perspective we're comfortable with our MCT of 197% and expect to
maintain it between 195% and 200% through the remainder of the year. The frequency of
severe weather events in the past few weeks has made it clear to me that the sustainability
of home insurance in its current form is being challenged. While we have made
meaningful progress with underwriting proﬁts on average over the past three years in that
line of business, our approach needs to evolve further given the environment we face and
will likely face in the coming years.
So while our 3,100 claims employees were focused on helping our customers, a special
task force composed of folks from coast-to-coast busied themselves laying out a robust
plan to be implemented in the coming weeks aimed at ensuring the sustainability of our

Page 2 of 21

FINAL

oﬀer in the coming years. The plan we have in mind will focus on ensuring customers
have a better understanding of the risks they face and what they can do to better adapt to
climate change.
We will further implement meaningful rate risk selection, as well as product actions. This
issue is not one solely aﬀecting the insurance industry. But rather society as a whole. And
as such we will work and support communities across the country to raise awareness and
help provide guidance as to how they can better protect themselves against the impact of
extreme weather. We expect our plan to generate a minimum of 10 points of combined
ratio improvement in that line of business.
Moving to automobile insurance, our view is largely unchanged from the First Quarter. We
are operating in an environment where both competitors and regulators behave fairly
rationally. And costs have been generally stable in the recent past. Understandably,
Ontario has been a source of concerns with investors in the past few months. It has been a
source of concern for my team and I, as well. But our view has not changed.

Bloomberg Transcript

While it will be diﬃcult to achieve, we continue to work with the government to bring cost
reductions in the system to improve aﬀordability for Ontarians. In their quest to achieve
15% reductions over time, the government understands that meaningful cost reduction
measures will be critical to ensure availability of the product given the fact that the
industry operates at breakeven at the moment. We will continue to work with the
government and the Insurance Bureau of Canada to identify and quantify additional costs
reduction measures.
We expect new regulations resulting from the budget to become available in early fall.
These will likely lead to rate actions in the ﬁrst part of 2014. We're pleased with the 50%
reduction in mediation backlogs that the government has engineered so far in 2013. This
is in my view another example of their focus on improving the environment. They expect
the backlog to have disappeared by year-end. This should help alleviate some of the
inherent uncertainty in the system. It's important to bear in mind, though, that the direct
consequence of sharp reduction in mediations is an increase in arbitration.
So during the ﬁrst four months of 2013, the number of industry arbitrations increased 37%.
Now, due to our proactive approach to managing our ﬁles in dispute, IFC's arbitrations
have increased only 7%. Beyond that, our view of the Ontario market is largely
unchanged. We feel strongly about our ability to outperform in that market.
When it comes to our outlook for the industry, we foresee similar growth in the near-term
to that of the past 12-months. However, we do expect the current hard market conditions
in personal property to accelerate meaningfully for the foreseeable future. We continue to
expect ﬁrming conditions in approximately one quarter of the commercial P & C industry
in 2013. And we think that the low interest rate environment and the elevated losses from
catastrophes should support our outlook.
Turning to the industry, we do not expect the industry to reach its long-term average of
10% in the next 12-months, largely due to the elevated CAT activity which has already

materialized. Looking speciﬁcally at Intact Financial, we believe we will continue to
outperform the industry's ROE by at least 500 basis points. Mark will provide updates on
our integrations in a moment. But clearly we have made some good progress in the
quarter. I continue to be impressed with our employees' dedication. And want to thank
them for their hard work in ensuring our customers and brokers continue to receive topnotch service.
In conclusion, I believe the disciplined approach we take towards operating our business
will continue to serve us well. I'm conﬁdent that we will confront new challenges with the
same level of determination that has brought us to where we are today. Given the quality
of our operations and the ﬂexibility provided by our ﬁnancial position, we believe that
we'll continue to outperform the industry and defend our superior level of proﬁtability.
With that I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mark Tullis.

Thanks, Charles. Last month Southern Alberta experienced storms and ﬂooding resulting
in historic levels of damage to the homes, autos and businesses of our insureds in the
Calgary and High River areas. Teams from Intact immediately went to work. The ﬁrst day,
we began to transform an industrial building on the north side of Calgary into a claims
center with one hundred desks and computer connections as our oﬃces in downtown
Calgary were closed due to ﬂooding.
Public transportation was shut down. So we chartered private buses so that our
employees could go to work. We brought in claims staﬀ from throughout Canada. And
within three weeks we had visited and performed initial evaluations for virtually all of the
claims. It will be months before everything is back to normal for the people of Alberta. But
Intact moved quickly to help our insureds begin this process. We have shown the same
response to the Toronto ﬂooding and the tragedy in Lac Megantic.
Events like these separate world-class companies from the rest. And Intact has been up to
the task. With this as a backdrop, today we announced Second Quarter underwriting
income of CAD42 million with a combined ratio of 97.5%. Strong results in our auto lines
of business. And strong property results outside of Alberta, particularly in Ontario, proved
once again the advantage of diversiﬁcation both geographically and by line of business.
Both auto lines of business had combined ratios below 90% despite the elevated CAT
losses.
Personal auto, in particular, had a strong quarter with a combined ratio of 87.2%. Our 14%
growth in premiums reﬂects the addition of Jevco, as well as solid organic growth. The
combined ratio in commercial auto remained excellent at 89.6%, although higher than last
year's exceptional performance. Our personal property line of business has been most
aﬀected by the recent storms with a combined ratio almost 9 points higher than last year
due to the CATs.
As Charles mentioned, we are committed to mitigating our CAT exposure for this line of
business. And we're taking action on multiple fronts to build a sustainable product

oﬀering. Our actions will include product changes in risk selection, as well as additional
rate increases starting on the fall on top of those already in the system. Our commercial P
& C business also experienced elevated catastrophe losses amounting to CAD40 million
in the quarter, which in conjunction with a higher level of large losses, led to a combined
ratio of 108.2%. As with personal property, we are reviewing our product in underwriting
in light of the new climate reality.
Our expense ratio at the total company level was 0.9 points improved versus 2012. This
change was driven by a drop in variable commissions from the lower level of proﬁtability
in the quarter. And also from acquisition-related expense synergies. Our eﬀective tax rate
of 14.9% reﬂects a higher proportion of tax free dividend income relative to underwriting
income, which was lower due to the CATs. Our net investment income of CAD102 million
was up 7% from a year-ago. This was primarily due to additional investments from Jevco, a
portion of which included dividend paying common shares.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our market-based yield of 3.8% was up from 3.4% last quarter with the increase in yield
due to the drop in market value of our investments driven by higher bond yields and
weak Canadian equity markets. We expect the low interest rate environment to continue
to weigh on our results in the near-term. And we expect second half net investment
income to be similar to what we recorded in the ﬁrst half of the year. Our ﬁnancial position
remains solid at the end of Second Quarter with CAD486 million in excess capital and
book value per share 9% higher than a year-ago.
Our MCT decreased to 197% on the heels of the CAT losses, our share repurchases and
market driven changes in other comprehensive income. We intend to manage our MCT to
remain between 195% and 200% through the remainder of the year. Since introduction of
our NCIB last quarter, we have purchased 1.8 million shares at an average price of
CAD59.35. We will continue approach the NCIB opportunistically, dialing up or down,
depending upon opportunities in the market, volatility in the environment and capital
availability.
We continue to make good progress on both of our integrations. For AXA Canada system
shutdown is on schedule. We maintain our CAD100 million after-tax synergies target with
a run rate at quarter end of CAD87 million. Most of the remaining synergies will coincide
with ﬁnal system shutdowns in early 2014. The impact on growth from cross-selling the
Jevco product suite within our distribution platform remains better than expected, with
the Second Quarter traditionally the strongest for Jevco.
We have completed our review of the rates and segmentation for nonstandard auto and
motorcycles and are rewriting portions of the Jevco portfolio where required. Greater
than expected synergies, primarily from claims, will enable us to reach our initial CAD15
million after-tax synergy estimate by the end of this year, a year earlier than previously
expected. Our new after-tax Jevco synergy estimate is CAD23 million after-tax by the end
of 2014.
The storm season is not over as we can see from the three small CATs of the past two
weeks. And if necessary we will provide further guidance to the market later in the

quarter. However, in this environment, I am particularly proud to work for a company that
can respond so quickly when our clients need us most. Our people have responded
professionally and with empathy for our clients during what has been a diﬃcult summer
for thousands of our customers. These challenging times best illustrate the resilience of
our business, which along with our strong ﬁnancial position, will enable us to take
advantage of opportunities in the market and to bolster our long-term earnings potential.
Combined with our disciplined approach to the business, we have a strong foundation for
continued proﬁtable growth. With that I will turn the call back to Dennis.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Certainly. (Operator Instructions) Your ﬁrst question comes from the line of Jeﬀ Fenwick
from Cormark Securities. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jeﬀ Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to start oﬀ today with a further discussion on the coming
changes around the Ontario rate reductions. Charles, you gave a little color there about
the process and perhaps a rough idea of the timeline. Can just describe, maybe in a little
more color, what is it about the process here that's giving you some comfort that it's being
done in an orderly fashion. And how have they gone about consulting with the industry to
ensure that you really are going to get those cost reductions when they start to put
through those rate reductions. And do you have a sense of -- is it 15%, you said it might be
partially implemented the beginning of the year. So is there a timeline for rolling out the
rate decreases, as well.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. I think the government understands that this is a complex process, because you have
to make changes in the system and, as such, I think very responsibly, they said we'll aim at
15%. And that will take place over a number of years. The budget that will be translated
into regulations in early fall had a number of ingredients in there to tackle ﬁrst portion of
the rate reductions whether it's reinforcing the deﬁnition of minor injury, whether its
regulation of clinics, tow trucks and so on, or a number of measures in there, which are
really quite beneﬁcial, I think. And will likely translate into rate impact. We will see what
these regulations actually look like in the coming month or two. And following that we'll
reﬂect that in our rates so as to have a commensurate impact on premium with the costs
reduction measures that they're putting in place.
Now, the fact that it is an environment that is evolving, the fact that it is a complex
environment really calls for a very tight cooperation between the industry and the
Page 6 of 21

government to ﬁnd measures that will be eﬀective at bringing aﬀordability in the market.
And there's been a lot of work between both parties. The Insurance Bureau of Canada has
been very active on that ﬁle with the government. And the nature of these interactions
and how constructive they've been gives me comfort that we're headed in the right
direction there. But I think this is not a walk in the park. 15%, we have said it all along, is a
big number and, therefore, that will take time to materialize. And I think we'll see a
portion of that, I suspect, a fraction of that materialize in the coming year. But process so
far has been good. I don't know, Martin, if you want to add to this.

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

No. I think this is right in line with what I see in the relationship with FSCO and with the
Ministry of Finance, where I think they want to do things right. They are expecting that
within the next couple of months the process will be better deﬁned. And that the rate
reductions would start ﬂowing. Not the 15%. But the Q1 of 2014 or so, that the market
should start seeing rate reductions to reﬂect the costs.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. We'll see what's in there. I think -- I mean these guys are smart and responsible in my
view. And they understand the industry operates at the breakeven, at the moment. And
they know that if costs reductions don't come along there will be an availability problem.
And this is not an empty threat. I mean it happened eight years ago. They completely
understand that. And I think they want to avoid that because that would be a much worse
outcome for Ontarians. So I have great conﬁdence in their leadership on that front.

Q - Jeﬀ Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

Okay. Then maybe just a follow-up on that in terms of the where we are today and the
Ontario market. And we saw TD, yesterday, take some additional strengthening and
charge there mentioning some more recent developments in Ontario Auto. Is this
something that is speciﬁc to TD. And do you feel like the strengthening you took last year
is adjusting for, I guess, what perhaps they're seeing today?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

You know, these guys are smart, they're disciplined. I think they're very good and when
they notice or when they talk, I certainly pay attention. And I tried to see if there are
parallels in our business. It's tough, though, from the outside to know exactly what they
are talking about. I can tell you that we have been following the reforms that were
eﬀective in September 2010. We knew that bodily injury costs would increase by close to
25%. That's something we've talked about for two, three years now. And we, in
September of 2010, increased our pricing, or certainly reﬂected that in our pricing
assumptions, reﬂected that in our reserving assumptions. And as a result increased our
reserves gradually over the past three years to reﬂect that assumption.
So it's very hard for me to judge but these guys are smart, they're disciplined and I pay
attention to what they say. So we're pretty conﬁdent with what we have done. And, quite
frankly, we have not noticed on the bodily injury front meaningful changes in the
environment. We have seen an increase in litigation over time. Maybe not yet at the level
Page 7 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2013-07-31

of what we expected and what we're reserving for. But it is early and, therefore, we remain
cautious on that front, both in pricing and in reserving.

Q - Jeﬀ Fenwick

Okay. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Holden from CBIC. Your line is open.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Good morning, Paul.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Within your results you mentioned on the personal auto side, that the core loss ratio
picked up year-over-year. And that was due to an increase in severity, which I think you
quantiﬁed at 6% year-over-year. So curious what's driving that severity if it's not BI.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Want to take that, Martin?

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

Well when we look at the severity in the quarter, it's increasing 6% versus last year. We
don't see any trends in litigation or in patterns that would lead us to believe that there is a
trend there. When we look at the last three or four years, we noticed that this is a fairly
stable severity level. We had a small adjustment last year that decreased somewhat the
severity in that quarter so this is -- we're not concerned by what we're seeing in this
particular quarter.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. I think current accident year deteriorated by a couple of points, driven by severity
increase. And we have seen that in a number of jurisdictions here. You know, Alberta was
up a bit, Ontario was up a bit and as Martin said, the denominator might have been a bit
understated. So not an area of concern. And Paul given the noise in the environment I can
tell you that Mathieu and myself have spent time with people in the ﬁeld to make sure that
we were not missing anything from a trend point of view either in AB, either in BI Ontario,
either in BI Alberta. So there is activity but not -- not much diﬀerent from what we
anticipated. I don't know, Mathieu, if there is anything you want to add there.

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}
Page 8 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

No. I think in Q2 our view remains unchanged on the beneﬁt of the reform in BI and in AB.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. So if I'm understanding the answer correctly, then, we should not expect to see that
same type of 6% cost inﬂation in future quarters? Is that the correct way to interpret that?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. I think that's that is the right way to interpret that. You know, I think we talked about
6%. We probably should talk about the fact that there's drift that's oﬀsetting that, as well.
And that's in part why the current accident year is not up 6%. It's actually up 1.5% or 1.6%.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. Then in terms of Alberta, the Rate Board approved the 5% increase for mandatory
coverage, eﬀective, I guess, in November of this year. Would you anticipate that you will
be taking all ﬁve points of that?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Yes. Okay. Then in that case do you anticipate that that 5 point increase is suﬃcient to
oﬀset cost inﬂation, or is there other actions you might have to take with optional
coverage?

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

Well the 5% on the mandatory coverages was against the -- an indication by both the
board actuary and the IBC actuary of low teens. So we don't see this as being the full
remedy to rates--

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Or the industry.

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

-- or the industry. So there will be activity, also, on the optional side of the product where,
as you know, the rate approval process is not that stringent.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Great. And ﬁnal question is with respect to reinstatement premiums. There was a fairly
meaningful number in Q2 and anticipate there will be something in Q3, as well. Any way
you can quantify what the number may be in Q3 for us. And remind us if there's any kind
of limit on the number of times you can reinstate your reinsurance coverage in a given
year.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. So the premium -- there's actual a separate premium for each layer of coverage. And
since the event in Q2 was larger than the individual events in Q3, the reinstatement eﬀect
will be smaller. We're maybe looking at sort of half the level in Q3. So far assuming there's
not another major event as what we looked at in Q2.

Q - Paul Holden

Okay. That's all the questions I had.

Your next question comes from line of Doug Young from TD Securities. Your line is now
open.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Good morning.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Morning, Doug.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

First question just -- Charles, in your descriptions of the ﬁrst question, the question around
the Ontario Auto. And how you see it unfolding. It sounded like. And correct me if I'm
wrong, you think that the costs mitigation items will be determined ﬁrst and adopted ﬁrst
and then the rate reductions will take place. Is that how you see it unfolding? Did I hear
that properly?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. I think the framework for the cost reduction will, I suspect, will be laid out in the
regulations and I haven't seen the regulations yet. I'm speculating to a certain extent. But
that's the objective of translating the budget in regulations. And once we see that we will
reﬂect that in pricing. I think the pricing exercise will likely be an exercise, as well, of
making sure that the assumptions we're making about the impact of the reforms of
September of 2010 are in line with the reality, as we see it today. You know, that's the
other element that I think will be part of that process. But, indeed, as I've said before, I
think the costs reductions are a critical part of how one gets to premium reductions.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Okay. And just wanted to go in a diﬀerent direction away from auto. I'm sure you'll get lots
more questions. But on the commercial P&C side there was an increase in the number of
Page 10 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2013-07-31

large losses. And I just want to dig in a little bit further in what you're seeing, because this
isn't the First Quarter where you have had an increase in large losses. And just can you
give us a little more color on that?

FINAL

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Okay. Well if you look at the large losses, we ﬁrst of all, I would say we're not seeing rights
now any trend. And I can look at, let's say, the last six quarters as an example. Q1 and Q4
of 2012, we had higher large losses than on average. Q2 and Q3 were very weak in terms
of large losses. And this year Q1 was below average slightly. And Q2 was slightly above
average. And on top of that the kind of losses we're seeing in the Second Quarter are
coming from marine business, or a little bit of surety business, which is diﬀerent than what
we have experienced in the past in 2012. So basically, there's no trends. There's a lot of
ﬂuctuation. But the level we are seeing, right now, on a direct basis is still within expected
normal variation in terms of large losses.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

But I will tell you, Doug, even though Alain does not necessarily see a pattern, we're
looking at these losses, one by one, to see if there's anything in our risk selection process,
in our pricing process. And so on, that needs to be tightened trying to learn as much as
we can out of that. So we don't take these lightly even though they're not a trend as far as
Alain is concerned.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Okay. And I just wanted to go. And I know I've asked this question before and it sounds
like the way you described the personal property changes, there's been a lot of changes
to the product over the last few years. Sounds like you're going to lean further into the
product, make substantial changes in that product. And you've had many discussions with
the government around, obviously, the issues that have materialized for the industry. Has
there been -- have you been approached, at all, or has there been any discussion with the
government or the regulator about more tightly regulating this product?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I would say that our interactions with the government -- we often have been the ones
approaching the government to let them know of the evolution we saw in the weather
patterns. And the implications this had on availability and potentially aﬀordability, more so
than the government is coming to us and saying "we intend to do something there." I
think we want to make sure they understand sort of costs pressure that took place over
time. There's been, in particular in Alberta, ongoing dialogue with the superintendent on
the home insurance front, as they understand that Alberta is the province that has been
the most impacted on home insurance in the past few years with natural occurrences. I
don't think it is the intention of regulators to own that problem at this stage. But there's
certainly a dialogue there, even though this product is not regulated.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Okay. It doesn't seem like there's any additional further push at this point.

FINAL

No. I think the thing will need to be very careful about this that if the reaction to these
storms is too abrupt. And you end up with meaningful availability issues in a number
much markets, well, then you you call to a certain extent for greater supervision and I trust
my competitors to understand that. But overall, there's no sense that I have that there's an
intention to regulate that product at this stage. Deﬁnitely the intention is to cooperate and
make sure the awareness is pretty high across the country.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Okay. Then just, Mark, I just want to clarify. You talk about the MCT being negatively
impacted by six point from CAT. But yet I mean you were proﬁtable in the quarter. I'm just
trying to understand how the CATs -- was there a change in your reserve requirements as
a result of the CATs?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure. Okay. So I think on the slide we talked about seven points of MCT due to elevated
CAT losses. What that consists of, if you take the net costs of the CATs in the quarter, net
of tax which is CAD123 million. And just reduce the available capital by the CAD123
million that costs six points of MCT. Now we also had to set up those reserves. And so
then we have to hold capital on the reserves. That is how you get the extra point. So the
six is just mathematically the costs the MCT, cash out the door, the extra 1% is capital we
have to hold on the reserves. That's how you get to the seven. You are correct. We are
earning other underwriting income. And we are paying dividends and we are doing other
normal things.
So I think if you look on Slide 13, in the deck where we do the sort of abbreviated
reconciliation, the intent here was just to show the unusual items in the quarter. So the
unusual items being the CAT losses, the share repurchase and the movement in the OCI.
The normal stuﬀ, like the normal underwriting income and dividends and stuﬀ, we didn't
include that.

Good morning, Tom.

FINAL

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

I've got a couple questions. The ﬁrst one is when you pre-announced. And I got on the
call late so you might -- maybe I missed this, when you pre-announced, I think you had
CAD0.92 in terms of --

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

What I would call CAT hits. And then there's CAD0.79 in the quarter. So what's the
diﬀerence in there?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

CAD0.79 is Calgary only. CAD0.92 is Calgary plus the other CATs in the quarter.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. But I think the CATs in the quarter, don't they just sum up to the -- the CATs that you
noted in the quarter were they -- did they all sum up just to the CAD0.79, or did they sum
to the CAD0.92, or is there something diﬀerent in tax rates? I can take this oﬄine but --

A - Dennis Westfall

{BIO 15155973 <GO>}

I can quickly walk you through. The CAD136 million is the current year CAT level. You add
to that the CAD31 million reinstatement premiums that we talked about earlier gets you to
CAD167 million, about a 26 and a half point tax rate. And there's a 133 million shares in the
quarter gets you to the CAD0.92. Calgary was CAD105 million after-tax which is CAD0.79
a share.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Yes, I think it's the reinstatement premium.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. That's probably it, then. Okay. Great. Okay. Thanks. Now, the second was have you
quantiﬁed, maybe I missed this. Did you quantify the -- some of the action you're going to
be taking in terms of tightening terms and price hikes with respect to personal property?
Did you -- are you able to quantify what the improvement would be to the combined ratio
in this. And over what time we might be able to get it?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Ten points.

Okay. Then over what time we'd be able to get that?

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Look, we're taking actions will start in the coming weeks taking eﬀect this fall. As you
know, the renewal process, you need 60 days, really, to put that in the machine and send
the renewals out. So that will start -- when we think about our action planning, there's two
phases. There's an immediate phase that will start this fall. And then there's a broader
product and oﬀer phase. So to speak, that will start in Q1-2014. These are meant to take
eﬀect in the coming 12 to 24 months.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. And this would all be on ex-prior year and year ex-CAT basis, ten points.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well no, not ex CAT. I think that's the key.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Well assuming you had a normal level of CATs. But I guess we just -- the issue is we don't
know what a normal level of CATs is.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Tom, if you look at the past three years the non-CAT combined ratio was improved
dramatically. I would say 15 points, in fact, steady. Very clear. So what we're after now. And
what we've been after in the past 12 to 18 is to tame the consequences of CAT, the levels
of CATs. And the volatility that this creates so that our ability to run the business at 95% is
not hampered by CATs every three years, basically.
And so we're taking an action on, a number of actions on a number of fronts to achieve
that. The diﬀerence between this time and previous action plan is we're going coast-tocoast with these actions. You know, our approach has perils-driven depending on the
province in the past. You know, focus on hail in Alberta. And so on. Now, we're saying,
"You know what? Who knows where hail will happen next? Who knows where a ﬂood will
happen next?" We're going coast-to-coast with deep changes in our oﬀer, as well as
pricing. And that's starting this fall. .

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. I guess I could paraphrase that, that if you like to think of these events as being
sporadic. And I don't know, one in a hundred, or ten in a thousand; however, you want to
look at them do we actually you're going to limit some of the variants. But if of you have
what would be a normal level of CATs. And that's really hard to deﬁne, then you would
probably ﬁnd your accident year ex-CAT loss ratio improve. Am safe in saying that?

FINAL

That may be. I think if we say this year for instance is a freak year, because things came at
us from everywhere at the same time. One should not expect to see that every year. First
thing we're saying is that we're trying to protect our oﬀer in every region, in every
business, to mitigate the impact of those sort of events. Now, when that doesn't happen,
or when you have a normal level of CAT, in theory, your results should be better, because
you're protecting yourself against events that will materialize once in a while.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

And given that the personal property, this is all just in personal property. And I guess
given that it's about 25% of the business, we should probably see a two to three point -that would translates just into a two to three point improvement over the Company,
overall, I guess.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think that's a fair statement. Then I think you need to ask yourself do I think that the CAT
levels, going forward, will be higher than they've been in the past given what we've seen
this summer, you know. And I think it's early for us to make a call there. But it's not early
for us to protect our business in that regards.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Appreciate that and I think that's being proactive. With respect to commercial, I think I'm
seeing ﬁrming in 25% of the industry. Can you elaborate that? Is that certain parts that
you're seeing it in. And how are you positioned in those segments. Then you did talk
about taking some action in terms of commercial and product oﬀerings. If you can
elaborate a little bit on that and want -- how that might improve your accident ratios, exCAT, for the commercial lines.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I'll ask Alain take this one, because it's focused on that.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much, Charles. So just rephrasing what we're seeing is we expect
the market to ﬁrm up on what we see as being 25% of the market, which is the worst part
of the market, underperforming. And that's coming from discussion and everything that
those classes are underperforming all over the market. If I talk, speciﬁcally, about what we
did at Intact, we did in the Second Quarter increase. And I would say mid-teen -- by midteen digit, you know. Those classes of business, that 25%. So we did increase the new
business. But what we saw at the same time on this was a drop in our closing ratio. The
closing ratio is how often when we get a quote are we successful.
So basically, like a mid-teen increase over that 25% of the book translated in like 2.0-3.5%
increase on new business. And we saw the closing ratio drop by 2%. So that tells us that
currently there's still, at that point, there was still a very competitive market. There was still
plentiful capacity. So we're not seeing it turn immediately. What we're going to be
Page 15 of 21

FINAL

starting. And what we're starting in August, is to do similar situation on our renewal book
of business. So starting to push signiﬁcant increase or important increase on the same
classes of business.
We'll have a better view with what's happening at the end of the Third Quarter. We'll have
a better view on how successful we were, what will be the -- what will that happen on the
retention ratio. But at the same time, what we saw with the catastrophe or the events in
the last few weeks, either Calgary or Toronto, these are additional, I would say, pressure
point on the industry to a little bit sober up the level of competition. And re-question the
underwriting and the situation on those line of business. And that builds against the
conﬁdence that we will see in the next, probably, quarter the market start to turn but it's
diﬃcult to predict exactly when.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So bottom-line, Alain, is that we're pushing on a quarter of the portfolio double-digit rate
increases.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

We'll -- we did that at new business; now we'll do that at renewal. You know that we're
getting a couple of points of rate increases, already, in our portfolio. So what is happening
in the market with these changes should help that situation. But I think the point that Alain
is making is that we've seen some compression in our closing ratio by taking those bold
moves on the quarter. So there's change. We expect the environment will bring additional
change and we're pretty focused at the moment.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay . Thanks for that color. Then one ﬁnal one for Mark. I'm trying to look at how much
the MCT would go up, quarter over quarter, on a -- if everything was kind of normal and
you didn't have any AOCI noise, quarter over quarter. Obviously, that quarter will never
happen. But what would be the normal run-rate of the MCT? I assume it would have to go
up a little bit.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Yes I would say if there was no noise. And it was a typical quarter, maybe a couple -- one
or two points up, something like that.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

One or two points up, quarter-over-quarter.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Page 16 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

But obviously, there would be seasonality. We would pay out more cash in Q1. So there's
kind of more of a drop from Q1 to Q2.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

It varies from quarter to quarter. But if you looked at it over the course of the year it might
be six points or something like that.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

That's great. Thank you.

(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Mario Mendonca from
Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Good morning.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Good morning, Mario.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

A quick question. Charles, you referred to not really seeing any trends in personal in
current year claims ratios or that core claim ratios. But over the last four quarters we have
seen a year-over-year increase in that core claims ratio. So what I'm trying to understand
here is with four consecutive quarters under your belt of an increase, what gives you
conﬁdence in saying that there isn't some sort of trend emerging here?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

When you look at -- so we're talking personal auto?

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Right.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

When you look at ﬁrst six months of 2013 versus ﬁrst six months of 2012, you're seeing
very mild frequency increase, a little more than a point. You're seeing mild severity
increase of a couple of points, which is not too far from the drift in the value of the insured
car pool.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Yes.

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think the other thing that one needs to take into account is the areas where we have
seen movement, we're pricing for it. So I think what we're seeing is -- we're not seeing
anything new or anything that was not anticipated emerging in the market at the moment.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Okay. So if this were to persist, if the core claims ratio were to increase year-over-year for
another say 12 months, what would that then indicate? That there -- pricing increases
would be necessary or you need to do more on the costs front? Because, presumably, this
can't go on for too much longer before it becomes a problem.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No. Fair enough. I think that's exactly what this would mean, that one would need to
reﬂect that trend in pricing so as to insure that, once you know it is a trend, that you're
actually pricing for it.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

But you just -- I guess, you're saying you're just not there yet.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well I think, Mario, if we look at the areas that we have talked about in the past six to nine
months. Alberta was one of the areas where we said, "You know what? We are seeing
things that are diﬀerent than what we anticipated as a result of number of court decisions.
And so on on the BI front." We did reserve adjustment in Q4 and we have taken rate and
we will take rate the second time as a result. So you know there are a number of areas
where rate actions are being taken, number of areas where costs actions are being taken,
to react to the things that we have observed in the past 12 months.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Another question then. The mediation cases are down, signiﬁcantly and obviously,
arbitration is up. Have you learned anything from the mediation, or early arbitration, that
tells you, that informs your call on reserve development? Have you learned anything new?

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

Not learned anything new. I would say it sort of declines or removes some uncertainty the
fact that the backlog is down. But I think it's largely unfold as we were expecting.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay that's important. Then ﬁnally, for Mark, on buybacks. The MCT, below 200, you're
giving us some comfort here that it will be between 195% and 200% what I'm not sure
about is has the Company repurchased stock in the past when the MCT is below 200%?
Would that be and unusual thing.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

So we -- I would say it wouldn't be unusual if we buy it below 200%. I think what we
intend to do is manage the MCT level between the 195% and 200% range. And share
buyback is sort of one of the variables in that determination.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

So does that necessarily mean that buybacks have to sort of cool it for a little while,
because the buybacks in this quarter would have taken the, I think the -- in your
presentation I think you said it's ﬁve points.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Correct.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Does that necessarily. And if you're adding, as you described to Tom in answering his
question, you're adding say two a quarter, doesn't that necessarily mean the buyback has
to be a fair bit smaller or not at all in the near-term?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

I think there's a lot of variables in a lot of levels including to what happens to OCI; what
happens to underwriting some other levels there. You know, one of the levers is what we
do with the buyback.

Your ﬁnal question comes from the line of Bryan Brown from Macquarie Capital. Your line
is now open.

Q - Bryan Brown

{BIO 16358540 <GO>}

Thanks. Just two quick questions. The ﬁrst one for investment income. I saw that
increased, sequentially, by about 6%, while the market-based yield declined by about 20
basis points. Could you explain the decrease, or the increase, sorry, in the investment
income?

Page 19 of 21

FINAL

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Sure. So I think the market-based yield was up. If you look -- I think the best way to look at
that is quarter-over-quarter. So it was 3.4 last quarters and 3.8 last quarter. The -- and so -and that's a bit of an odd calculation because it's our -- what we -- the income we earn
divided by the market value of the asset. So the reason for that increase, that it went from
3.4 to 3.8 is the market value of the assets went down due to the increase in interest rates
and the decline in market value of the share portfolio. I think the best way to look at this is,
in my comments I gave the advice that we expect investment income to remain relatively
the same the second half of the year as the ﬁrst half the year. I think, because as the
market values go up and down, it's going to impact the market-based yield but not really
so much impact the investment income.

Q - Bryan Brown

{BIO 16358540 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. And just one last one. In personal auto, for the last two quarters we have
seen some pretty large prior claims development. And if you could explain what's driving
that.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

You want to take this Mark or --

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

You know, we've seen about 5.5% favorable development in our relationship with
premium anyways. And the -- in the Second Quarter. A little more than that year-to-date.
And we've seen favorable development in automobile insurance across many of the
jurisdictions in which we operate would be my ﬁrst sort of perspective. We have seen
some of it in Ontario automobile. I think that I've mentioned before that in Ontario
automobile, we're seeing probably more development in the ﬁeld, favorable
development in the ﬁeld, than what we let ﬂow through, because we want to be
conservative here. It's still early in the game. There's still uncertainty and so we are seeing
that across jurisdiction. Clearly, we're seeing some in Ontario. But I do believe that we
remain conservative despite the fact that there is favorable development in that province.
