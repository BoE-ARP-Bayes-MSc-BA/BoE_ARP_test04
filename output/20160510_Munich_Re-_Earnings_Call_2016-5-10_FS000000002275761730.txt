MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to the Munich Re Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference
is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. BeckerHussong. Please go ahead.

Christian Becker-Hussong

{BIO 19080254 <GO>}

Yeah, thank you. Good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to our call on Munich Re's first
quarter results. Today's format is quite straightforward. After this short introduction, I'll
hand it over back to you in order to kickoff the Q&A session.
Jörg Schneider, our CFO, is today's speaker. I would kindly like to ask you to limit the
number of your questions to a maximum of two per person. So far from my side, we're
happy to take the first question right now.

We'll now take our first question from Xinmei Wang from Morgan Stanley. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Xinmei Wang

{BIO 17860767 <GO>}

Hi, thanks. It's Xinmei Wang from Morgan Stanley. Two questions, please. First is on the
outlook. At the AGM, you mentioned €2.3 billion to €2.8 billion range, which didn't include
the ERGO restructuring costs. And today, we have a number €2.3 billion, which does
include the ERGO restructuring costs. I'm just wondering what change in those two, if you
would be able to give a more definitive number, given that we haven't had the full details
of the ERGO strategy there yet, and I'm wondering where that €2.3 billion could still move.
And second question is on reserve releases, you lifted your expectations for the full year
to 6% from 4%, is that something we can expect for future years as well, given the
strength of the reserve buffer and I guess we're still seeing low inflation, somewhat lower
large losses, and should we be using the 6% to normalize for the combined ratio? Thank
you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jörg Schneider
Thank you. Hello, Xinmei. Thank you for these questions. First, on the outlook, so our
original prognosis was 2.3% to 2.8% and, during the AGM, we repeated this as kind of
code, but said at the same time that the first quarter has brought up probably relatively
moderate to bad results, and then we decided to take into account the expenses for the
ERGO strategy program. So, nothing changed between end of April and now. It was just
kind of announcement that we are looking – are going to revisit that target.
The situation at ERGO, the project are underway and it has become obvious that there will
be some burden on the results of ERGO and that it is no longer probable that ERGO will
show a positive result and, therefore, we decided to take it unlike in March into our
prognosis for the year and ended up with €2.3 billion. I think it will not move from here,
provided that major losses and the development of the capital markets stays within
reasonable range. So I'm confident that we can keep that €2.3 billion going forward.
With regards to our guidance on reserve releases, it has become obvious for us that,
again, we show a substantial difference between actually reported losses and the
expected level, and therefore, that it wouldn't have been – it would have been no longer
realistic to stick with the 4% assumption for this year. Therefore, we realistically increased
it to 6%. On an ongoing basis, I don't know more at the moment. If and – you would have
to book it immediately, but my best guess is that the level could be higher than 4%. For
our internal plans, we stick with the 4% 2017 and going forward, especially, because we do
not know what inflation will do.

Q - Xinmei Wang

{BIO 17860767 <GO>}

We will now take our next question from Kamran Hossain from RBC. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi. Afternoon, everyone. Got two questions. The first one is on the ERGO program costs.
Could you maybe give us a little bit of color on whether – I know you don't want to give
the actual cost number, but whether we should expect the program costs to be
outweighed by, I guess, cost savings in the future? And the second question, could you
just remind us what the impact of any kind of program costs might be on the German
HGB earnings? Thank you.

A - Jörg Schneider

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Kamran. And with regards to the costs of the program, it is premature,
because currently the talks with the representatives of the staff are ongoing and we
would like to wait until they're done and there will be meeting of the supervisory board
and then the publication of one-time expenses, ongoing expenses, but also of ongoing
cost savings and earnings impact here. And if we were not convinced that it is worth
investing here then wouldn't do it. Therefore, you can rely on the program having a very
positive impact on the future on expenses and earnings and profits.
With regard to German GAAP, it's a bit too early before having talked about the numbers
to make adjustment on whether ERGO will be able to finance it itself or whether it needs
a contribution from the mother. And for the time being, it is our assumption that we do
not have to do more depreciations on the stock price of ERGO – not stock price – on the
book value of ERGO and as long as that holds true, there is no impact on the German
GAAP earnings.
And what I can also say, having seen the numbers for the first quarter, our revised
prognosis for the full year, it hasn't been negatively impacted by what we show here as a
lower basis for our IFRS earnings, that means the HGB German GAAP earnings seem to
be in very good shape. And as you know, they are also supported by the equalization
reserve, which protects us against negative surprises from the underwriting side.
Therefore, I'm pretty confident that the German GAAP earnings as our basis for dividends
and for future share buybacks will be in very good shape also at the end of 2016. Does
this answer your question, Kamran?

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Yeah. That certainly does (07:47).

We will now take our next question from In-Yong Hwang from Goldman Sachs. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Hello. Two questions from me as well. Firstly on the ERGO International combined ratio
93% seems significantly the way you were expecting. It seems to be some reserve
releases there and kind of see an one-off, so I was just wondering what you see as a
sustainable basis to start from before you do the restructuring in ERGO?
And my second question is on the big growth that we saw in April (08:28) is one very kind
of large transaction, there's few kind of all the large transaction, so I'm not sure how much
you can say in terms of what business lines or what geography it might be in, but just any
details on where you saw the growth would be helpful. Thank you.

A - Jörg Schneider

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, In-Yong. With regard to ERGO International, it's much too early to declare
victory here. So one quarter with 93% combined ratio is fine, but this is not a good
indicator for an ongoing combined ratio and profitability. So we rather stick to the 99%
prospect, which we have given you in mid-March. But at least I'm pleased that there
seems to be some stabilization.
With regard to ERGO strategy program, it's all about Germany at the moment. So we
would talk a little bit about ERGO International, but that hasn't been the focus yet. This is
the next step to expand the restructuring and to expand the fitness program, let me say,
to the international organization.
With regard to the April renewal and the impact from the big transactions that especially
one which stands out is MGA business, but we know the business quite well. This really is
not exposed to the reinsurance pricing cycle. It's a mixture of various specialty – various
niche business, personnel line businesses, well-diversified in itself, short scale only with a
product split of property insurance 20%, a little bit of travel, miscellaneous, financial and
special risk deposits, something like 70%, 75%. And due to its very low volatility, this
business would usually not to be reinsured in the broad market.
For us, it's attractive; it comes with a high commission ratio that means it comes with low
volatility and decent profitability. So we are very pleased with having acquired this
business. There are a couple of major contracts and it's no longer the April renewal, like
we show it today, has nothing to do with that of five, six, seven years ago, where it was all
about Korea and Japan. It's rather a mixture with some 20% from Japan and the rest from
all over the world and especially and more and more transaction of (11:25) business.

We'll now take our next question from Frank Kopfinger from Deutsche Bank. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. I've two questions on the investment income. First
question is on the impact on equity derivatives. Typically, I would have expected a positive
contribution if you use these derivatives, equities as a hedge and we had negative
equities performance in Q1. However, the performance of the equities performance –
derivatives was not positive. This was negative. Can you comment this? What has
changed in your derivative strategy in respect to equities?
And secondly, my question is on your regular income. When I look into the reinsurance
segment, both P&C and life re, the regular income component is significantly down from
the previous quarters. And even if I adjust for the Q2 effect from the previous year, it
seems to be in the order of 15% to 20% below of what we saw last year. Is there anything
that has changed on this end?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jörg Schneider
No, Frank. Thank you. And let me start with your second question, regular income in
reinsurance really substantially down. You can see that on slide 32 of the presentation.
There are two reasons; one is the normal attrition of the running yield, which makes up for
something up to almost – in property-casualty alone almost €50 million. So this is really
substantial, because the duration has been relatively low as you can imagine in this line of
business. Second, there's a special effect from the valuation of our associated company,
which was very positive last year and rather negative this year.
The associated company has taken into account of our consolidated numbers here with
our share in the equity and, therefore, it's different from dividend income also, and it's
somewhat volatile. And basically, it comes from our infrastructure and renewable energy
investments; nothing to worry about, so we are rather pleased with these investments.
And it's more of a one-off effect than an ongoing decline here, which we can expect.
Also for investment life, we should mention that the income from deposit account went
down due to the decline of the major quota share treaties. This was the driver for the
decline in regular income reinsurance life. On your first question, I was also surprised to
see that our equity derivatives were negative. The reason is simple. We do not only use
puts but also forwards to take long positions in equities and these positions went into a
loss and this overcompensated the positive impact from the put option. That's it.

We'll now take our next question from Michael Huttner from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Fantastic. I had – I suppose one simple question is when you're going to stop adjusting
your guidance and it's not – I suppose it must be complicated that originally started the
year with a range of €2.5 billion to €3 billion, then at the AGM we had €2.3 billion to €2.8
billion, now we have a spot estimate of €2.3 billion. And in terms of combined ratio, I see
so many figures I'm not really sure which one I should use. We have 99%, 98%, 95%, and
then we have somewhere in the reconciliation today, 100%. So, I just wonder, which is the
right figure. What is it all – it gives the impression that's Munich Re is a bit unsteady is I
suppose how I put it. But that would be really the main question.

Bloomberg Transcript

The other is again on investment income; did you have a big hedge fund position? That's
the only way I can explain this big impairment relative to your normal run rate or gains. If I
back somebody and they make a mistake and these things can happen. Anyway, those
are my two questions. Thank you. Did I lose them? I lost them. There's nothing.

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, please standby, as we're experiencing a momentary interruption
in today's conference. Thank you for your patience. Please continue to hold.
Please go ahead. And caller, if you could please, Michael Huttner from JPMorgan, if you
can repeat your question. Thank you very much.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Yeah, so my two questions. First one is when can we expect the earnings guidance for the
year to stabilize, as we had three different numbers so far this year or three different
names ranges, I don't know how to look at it. And also, on the combined ratio, which are
the numbers I see and which are cited in various parts of the reporting is a reliable kind of
base number I can use going forward? I can see 99% from the start of the year, 98% the
corrected, I suppose AGM figure, 95% which is the figure kind of as guidance today and
the 100%, which is the underlying today and, of course, the wonderful 88%. Thank you.

A - Jörg Schneider
Yeah. Thank you, Mike. First of all, I want to apologize to all our listeners. Suddenly the line
broke down while Michael asked the question, so we weren't – not shocked about the
Page 6 of 18

question, but there seems to have been a technical problem.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

FINAL

Just so you know I hear lots of comments from my competitors saying my questions are
too tough. But any way, thank you.

A - Jörg Schneider
Exactly.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Sorry about that.

A - Jörg Schneider
Okay. First, you're absolutely right. Originally, we came from 2.5% to 3% (20:16), then we
were a bit more cautious during the analyst conference mid-March, having seen the
decline of the equity markets especially and having been worried also about the interest
rate level.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, we again go down from the range to the lower point, and I'm pretty confident that
we can stay there, because also we have a lot of room to also influence our earnings and
we wouldn't let it fall endlessly. And by the way, also from an economic point of view, we
do not fall so dramatically. There are a couple of one-offs which made the Q1 results
decline to the extended date.
And second question on the combined ratio, we started from 99%. In March, we gave
98% because we already knew that major losses were low in January and February and
our philosophy is, let's put it this way, the second quarter doesn't know whether there
were many losses in the first quarter, so we immediately translate the experience of the
past month into our prognosis for the full year. And therefore, we went down to 98% and
now we take another point off to 97% for the reason that also from mid-March to end of
April, there were very low major losses, seems to change in May, by the way. Plus, second
effect is that we are confident that we can release more reserves at the end of the year
and that 6% is more realistic than 4% that makes up for the other 2 percentage points.
When we normalize the number for the first quarter then, we come to 100% and the
simple reason is that we do not adjust for seasonal effects. That means we always expect
12% loss ratio points, major losses in each quarter, although, in the first quarter, we
wouldn't expect so many. So on a realistic basis of normalization, the number would be
below 100% and 99% would be more realistic. But, we do not want to make it so
complicated after I had listened to the Swiss Re conference call. They did the right thing
to give the seasonal breakup, but it was so difficult to understand and to explain that we
decided to stick with our simple version.

We will now take our next question from James Shuck from UBS. Please go ahead, your
line is open.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, Jörg. Good afternoon, everybody. I had three questions from my side, please. Firstly,
just on the outlook around for the growth in P&C re. 60% volume growth at the April
renewals and you've explained that there's a couple of large treaties in particular that had
driven that growth. I just want to understand your kind of outlook for growth in P&C re,
because relative to some of your peers, you've taken a much more measured approach
to growing in certain lines and certain territories. And it seems to me as if there might be
a subtle kind of shift in what you're indicating about the future growth outlook in P&C re.
That's my first question.
Secondly, the reserve releases point, so 6 points of releases in the current year is what
you're expecting. If I look at the last kind of three or four years, you seem to be running
consistently above the 4 points that you guide to. I think I'm correct in saying that you
haven't relaxed the reserving conservatism and, therefore, my question is really shouldn't
you start doing that, because you're still releasing above that guided level and it seems
as if you're baking in more conservatism than you really need to, so when will we see that
conservatism be taken down?
And then, finally, just a quick one on ERGO International. It's an interesting businesses and
interesting kind of niche positions, if you like. But I guess my question is why you're really
bothering with it? Are any of the territories that really you're operating in, do they really
have the potential to become a meaningful earnings engine for the group as a whole or is
this something really that is just distracting from management focus? Thank you.

A - Jörg Schneider
Yeah. Thank you, James. Let's start with the April renewals and the growth we show here,
the impressive growth compared to the more measured approach, which we typically use
when talking about markets and growth opportunities at the moment. It had just to do
with the transaction type of that business. So, we still stick with our general impression
that it wouldn't be wise to aggressively grow on a broad basis here in business and this
does not only refer to Property XL business in exposed areas with sharp decline of terms,
but also for causality business, where we have a more tempered approach here. We are
active in the market. We have always been active in the market, but not growth at any
price.

FINAL

When there are good opportunities coming more from our good client (26:22) and from
the consultancy intensive, know-how intensive transaction business, then we happily take
it up and this was the case on April 1 for the business I described before. We could see
more of that. I'm quite confident that we will, because we are putting a lot of effort here.
We are investing very much in that kind of business, but it's not a given. It can come or it
will not come. And therefore, our outlook for growth is somewhat difficult, because it's
somewhat volatile here.
Second, on the reverse releases, 6% more realistic than full, yes, and even with 6%, I
assume that we still stick to our reverse conservatism. But we shy away from aggressively
taking it down, because it's so much driven by the low inflation. And therefore, perhaps it
has also to do with my personal history and that of this board of management, because
we experienced years with very adverse developments with our claims reserves.

Bloomberg Transcript

And therefore, we decided never again and perhaps, this message was somewhat over
interpreted within the company that conservatism is a value as such. I'm always concerned
that we leave business on the table from overestimating the losses here, the future
losses. But, to some extent, this concern is moderated by the fact that our pricing
assumptions are somewhat distracted from the reserving assumptions, which tend to be
more conservative here.
And so, from my point of view, no major change foreseeable. What I would like to
subscribe is that, we can avoid negative surprises on the investment side on the basis of
our very strong basis here. Your third question was about ERGO International, is it worth
bothering with that type of niche business, which is too small in many areas. To some
extent, I agree, but we have very promising market positions, which shouldn't be
underestimated.
Take Poland for example where we are one of the biggest companies of the country, of a
country with still low insurance penetration and with very strong economic growth
potential. Then there is promising initiatives in Asia, joint ventures in India for example. So,
there's a long list of interesting businesses. And overall, I think it is worth following that
route also taking into account that the growth potential in the German market seems to
have been moderate, perhaps it's improving due also to the immigration in the long run,
but who knows. At least it's an additional option for the Munich Re Group. Thank you,
James. Bye.

We will now take our next question from Thomas Fossard from HSBC. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. I've got two questions. The first one would be related to the life
reinsurance portfolio. Obviously, it's now a couple of quarters we've got, I would say, a
pretty significant volatility on the net income contribution of the division. Would you be
able to help us to understand what could be a normalized quarterly run rate in terms of
Page 9 of 18



Company N ame: M uenchener Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG in M uenchen
Company Ticker: M UV2 GR Equity
Date: 2016-05-10

FINAL

life reinsurance contribution to the group earnings providing that the experience is in line
with expectations and, obviously, you don't have any negative on the investment side?
And also the other question, the second question will be, could you update us on the
status of the underwriting profitability of the book both P&C and life re in Q2. So, life re
will be any big – additional single cases to be expected again in Q2? And on the P&C side,
could you update us on the May big losses just to have a feel on where you stand
currently? Thank you.

A - Jörg Schneider
Thank you, Thomas. Significant volatility in life; let me start with your second question on
that. We do not see anything for the second quarter at the moment. So, no spectacular
single losses (31:47) at the moment. This volatility in second half of last year and in the first
quarter really comes from a random accumulation of major losses. We have been in these
single risks already for seven or eight years without having seen this outlier losses and
now random accumulation, nothing more. Therefore, we stick to our guidance that a
normalized run rate would be an underwriting result of €100 million per quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

It's ambitious, also taking into account unavoidable volatility from the investment side,
which is indirect here because investments can have an impact on the valuation of the
reserve. But, overall, we are confident that we can run that business within that range.
Second, your question on the Q2 performance of property-casualty, now the phase of a
lack of major losses seems to be over. We saw the Ecuador earthquake, in spite of the
human tragedy, it shouldn't be a major insurance event here because the region is not
highly industrialized.
We had the Japanese earthquake. Here, unlike in Ecuador, production facilities are
affected. There will be business interruption losses. We expect mid-double-digit loss with
high uncertainty, because business interruption is still ongoing. The same number could
show up for the Alberta wildfires. Then we had Texas floods. So, it's quite substantial
number of midsize major losses which happened, if I may add perhaps, this is also
somewhat healthy for the industry in order not to become too much accustomed to this
close to zero major loss appearance. Thank you, Thomas.

Operator
We will take now our next question from Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hello. Hi, there. Just wanted to follow-up on the recurring income in reinsurance, both life
and non-life. I was a bit confused by your earlier comment saying – you were saying there
was sort of effectively, other than mark-to-market of alternatives, in that regular income,
could you tell us what effect that was and what is the actual underlying running yield
currently in P&C and life? How quickly is it declining? Because I'm guessing also, I think, you
were suggesting the underlying running yield is also falling a bit quicker than maybe you
would have expected.

FINAL

Linked to that, the asset base in life reinsurance is falling quite a lot. You say that's
because of some large contracts running off. Are we now in a point where the portfolio of
life re is shrinking or you expect it (35:15) to grow again? And then the final question is, I'm
not sure, maybe I missed it earlier in the call. Did you provide any details as to exactly
what went on in ERGO Germany P&C in the first quarter? I wasn't quite sure why there
was such a big miss versus what you're targeting?

A - Jörg Schneider
Thank you, Andrew. First, on the investment income in reinsurance life and propertycasualty, the mark-to-market, you called it alternative investments, this is at equity
valuation, which means these are not quoted instruments, but typically it's participations
of between 20% and 50% in the respective companies, special purpose vehicles, who run
windmills, motorways, airports, it's a broad mixture of investments and the diversity as
such is a big plus. And therefore...

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Sorry. Is that coming through the regular income line? So if I look at P&C, it was €388
million, what was the effect of that?

A - Jörg Schneider

Bloomberg Transcript

The revaluation of investments – I can give you the number without indicating that this is
an ongoing number here. Last year, in 2015, it was a plus €29 million and this year it was a
minus €5 million, but it is random fluctuations. So, I frankly admit it's also new territory to
us; nothing to worry. So the investments are running pretty well.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

So what you think the running yield is in P&C re?

A - Jörg Schneider
The running yield decline in P&C re makes up for close to €80 million minus in P&C re.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Jörg Schneider
And of which these alternative investments had an impact of close to €35 million.

FINAL

So substantial, yeah. And the attrition of the regular income was close to €50 million. Then
second question, life re – yeah, the major contract running, yes. Life re always promised or
promise is the wrong word here. We always made it clear that these major contracts had
duration of typically somewhat like five years or so. And then, there is a recapture option
of the client, which is sometimes used, sometimes not used. At least there's typically a
renegotiation which happens and here it ended up in the continuation of some of these
contracts, but with lower volumes. That is the reason.
On the other hand, there are areas with strong growth potential like our business in Asia,
like our business with asset protection, like major capital relief contracts for Solvency II
affected companies. So, it could well be that we can replace part of these major contracts
going forward and we should rather talk about profit potential than volume, because
volume can be very high with low profitability and vice versa. But, overall life, re is a
promising area for us, especially in a world with ever increasing regulatory requirements,
which are always good for the life reinsurer.
Lastly, in ERGO property-causality Germany, it is really a miss of our target of 95%, we
achieved 98.6%. It has to do with some random losses, especially liability losses from prior
years. Part of this losses are reinsured with the mother. That means for IFRS consolidated
account, they stick with ERGO. In reality, they are absorbed by the reinsurer because
ERGO has been running only very limited self retention. So, therefore, on the single
company accounts, they have lower impact here. Hence, going forward, we do not expect
them to be an ongoing phenomenon. So, we still stick to our target of 95%.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

So ex the liability reserve change, it would have been 95%, is it?

A - Jörg Schneider
Not really. They make up for 1.5 points or so something like that here. We also have a
negative impact from what is called title insurance, which is written through our UK branch
and booked under P-C Germany. A small business with very high expense ratio, you may
know it from your home country. And this is something which, I would call at the moment,
accounting noise. So it should flatten over time.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Hello. This is Thomas Seidl from Bernstein. Three questions, two on life re again. Number
one, I'm not sure I see how we get to a sustainable margin of 100%. When I look at the
income statement, you see basically that the benefit ratio is better than last year at 103%,
so the two claims have not really impacted or resulted in a higher benefit ratio. The main
impact is, what you call, technical interest which is the risk-free yield. So in order to get to
100%, you need to get back to €160 million technical interest, how realistic is that is my
first question.
Secondly, you say life re is a promising segment, but in different and contrasting your
peers, you're shrinking organically, so if that's due to enormous competition for the few
large transactions around or why do we see here less growth compared to the rest of the
market?
And thirdly, I go back to your video message this morning. You basically say that the HGB
balance sheet continues to provide headroom to pay out the dividend and the buyback
even if you would hit the €2.3 billion net income. But I also remember that at the analyst
conference, you mentioned that the investment income headwind is the major risk here
on this headroom. And so I wonder what you reported today, has that already started to
eat into this headroom?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jörg Schneider
Thank you, Thomas. On your first question, the benefit ratio is effective from the large
transactions. So you can't take it as a very good measure at the moment here. And also
with the technical interest, we're still confident that this 100% is realistic. It's a stretch, but
it is realistic.
A promising segment, it is a promising segment. Perhaps one reason why we grow less
than some competitors is that we have a different view on specific risks here. For
example, the recapture risk, the less risk from major contract. You can take a more
aggressive or less aggressive stance. I don't know anything about our competitors, but
very often when we talked about business opportunities, I heard from our colleagues that
they do a very complex calculation, valuing in these optionalities very high, which is not a
given, but which is kind of conservative approach here. But there are really many areas of
potential growth, especially, from this transaction business, which we foresee will have a
strong focus on Asia. But, also, United States and Canada are still promising markets, and
Europe.
On dividend and buyback finance by the local GAAP balance sheet, the investment
income is still in good shape. Our prognosis for the full year does not show a decline here.
The equalization reserve protects our underwriting result. So, therefore, that seems to be
in quite safe territory with the typical (44:57) that impairments can happen, impairments
on subsidiary like ERGO can happen, and see the probability at the moment is relatively
low, plus a potential positive impact as of 2017 for our equalization reserve.

Maybe one follow up on the life re side if I may. Can you talk about let's say the pipeline?
I'm hearing also a lot about there's only two transactions coming up more, is that all that
visible in move over coming quarters?

FINAL

A - Jörg Schneider
Yeah, there is some transactions in the pipeline, but sometimes you work three to five
months on the transaction and the outcome is zero. That happens. But we are confident
that a lot will be put in place in the end.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hey, Jörg. Thanks very much. I missed the very beginning of the call, so just tell me if
you've already answered this, but back on the derivatives question, this is another quarter
when you've had difficulty presenting numbers because of what could just be accounting
mark-to-market noise and it clearly hurts your cost of capital. First off all, is there any way
you can demonstrate simply that your investment policy that seems to differ from
everybody else's is actually producing a good cost benefit? And then, related to that
point, given that you continue to have these difficult presentational issues, are you
thinking about changing what you're doing economically or finding a better way of
accounting for this noise? Thank you.

A - Jörg Schneider
Difficult questions, William. Thank you. Yeah. I can assure you that CFO is not happy seeing
this volatility. And we've had numerous discussions here about whether we should change
it, whether we should use less derivatives, but typically, they come along with a higher
volatility of our economic situation. And for us, as you know, we are ayatollahs of
economic steering. And we rather like to have an accounting volatility than a major
economic mismatch.
And for us, the usage of derivative is a very effective way of dealing with our asset liability
management. The account – and what you can also see as an outcome is a relatively high
stability of our economic solvency number, which went down by 20 percentage points to
30 percentage points. Sounds high, but is driven by dividend and share buybacks, which
are fully taking into account into the first quarter.

Therefore, the numbers are pretty stable on the economic side. And also sitting on €32
billion of unrealized gains on the investment side should provide us with plenty of
opportunities to deal with serious accounting problems. Serious would mean those which
jeopardize our dividend or share buyback capability. Therefore, I understand your concern
and I understand also the criticism and I take it – I take the blame to some extent. On the
other hand, I think our shareholders are well off with us, because we provide them with a
very stable payout here, and that we cannot legally guarantee, but at least, as long as I
can foresee it, that should be in very safe territory.

We will now take our next question from Michael Haid from Commonwealth Bank (sic)
[Commerzbank] (49:28). Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Thank you very much, sir. Good afternoon. I just have to come back to the normalization of
the combined ratio. If I understand correctly, you expect 6% reserve releases in this year
instead of 4%, but how sustainable is the 6% going beyond 2016 in the current low
inflation environment? There is also – one can also make a mistake being too conservative
and if you normalize the combined ratio at 6%, then your normalized combined ratio
would rather be 98% than 100%, and is the 98% rather the right figure at the moment?

A - Jörg Schneider
Michael, it depends on the question how much conservatism there is in the current
reserve setting. If there were 6% included in each reserve setting for new claims, then you
were right. Then it would really be 98% on a normalized basis. But, for that, we do not
have enough evidence. Also, what I want to add here is, the reserving is based on very
conservative approach, but a stable approach, so we are not piling up from one quarter
to the next.
The ratio between actually reported losses for early accident years and the expected
level is stable, so it's not increasing. That means we do not release the existing
conservatism, but it's on a stable basis and it's not accumulated more and more. We don't
know how inflation would work. So, for example, let's assume that a loss inflation,
especially, medical inflation would substantially go up, we would still be on the safe side.
But I think that redundancy would be reduced to a large extent in such a situation.
Therefore, I can only offer and propose to our investors to take this as a very strong basis,
which we do not intentionally exaggerate, but which gives you sleep-easy cover on that
front.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

But, sorry, I'm still a little confused. Is it the right assumption then for us, as outsiders, you
reserve the initial business with basically broad-based 4% and the outgoing reserve
releases is then 6% or is it now 6%, 6% or what is it economically?

FINAL

A - Jörg Schneider
Yeah. I can't give you a reliable number, Michael, because we can't measure what is
conservatism in the current losses. We reserve them on the high-end of the best estimate
range. There is a lot of room for estimation and we use it perhaps in a little bit of a careful
way.
Up to now, we think that is a good judgment that there might be conservatism for loss
ratio points involved, whether it's higher or not, we don't know. If we release 6% for 2016
and include 4% in our new losses, then the level of conservatism would go down. I can't
give you a precise answer. With the 6% for 2016, we just respond to indications we get
very clearly from the observation of our losses, but please have in mind how low inflation
is at the moment.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And have you (53:34) incoming business reserving for the low inflation that we currently
see or is it still – is your – the reserving of the incoming business still based on that
expectations of inflation, like 2% or whatever?

A - Jörg Schneider
In theory, they always include the best judgment also on claims inflation. In reality, there's
always a bias, I would say. But even our reserving actuaries noticed how low inflation is, so
I assume and I know that they take into account the current very low level of inflation, but
they don't take it as being there forever.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you. Two questions from my side. First is just on this April
renewals, this very large PT which Jörg, you've mentioned very rarely this kind of portfolio
comes to the market. And it seems like, it's like the risk solutions business that usually

gets you a 90% combined, if I remember right, from previous guidance. Is this a similar
90% kind of profitability? And is this why you probably offered some incentives to this
client to bring this business to the market? So that's really the question on the profitability
of this new very rare block that you managed to acquire.
And second thing is just on a normalized net income thinking, I can imagine that if it was
just below €600 million for the quarter and that ties in with the €2.3 billion next year if we
think the reserve releases are 2% and not – sorry, if you think reserve releases are 6% and
not 4%, then we can sort of see what the market is thinking. But how would you like us to
think about it? Particularly, if ERGO does take a lot of restructuring charge now or this year,
would you expect improvement next year itself or would you think it takes longer? What
are you thinking on that? Thank you.

A - Jörg Schneider
Yeah. Fair questions. Hello, Vinit, Thank you.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jörg Schneider
April, this big business here is – it doesn't come at a 90% combined ratio. It's a big block
of business, which will typically perform around 100%, because it's shorter business, and it
doesn't have a lot of investment income involved. And as I said before, commissions are
structured in a way that there is relatively low volatility. The risk solution business, which
you correctly quoted as being very low combined ratio business, that is that what we
produce ourselves with Hartford Steam Boiler, AMIC and in other areas, so this one is
rather reinsurance transaction business in the MGA form.
Then your second question on profit going forward, about the reserves, I can't say more
than that we expect for the time being, the 6% reserve release. I'm very grateful that we
do not have to worry about reserves and that we do not have to show nasty volatility from
quarter-to-quarter here, but I can promise the 6% for 2016.
For ERGO, I dare to promise an improvement for 2017, but it will be a slow improvement.
Typically, in these kind of restructuring situations, you have a phase of transition before
profits really go up sustainably. And therefore, overall, yes, I expect an improvement; I
expect a stabilization of our earnings and also, please do not forget the various innovation
initiatives and the enormous amount of under-insured business, where we do the utmost,
where we really fight for expanding the barriers of insurability, some things will fail here.
Our basis for calculating the expected losses and for the premiums is not similar to that of
the well-established natural catastrophe business. But, on the other hand, margins are
quite high here. So, therefore, I'm really confident that innovation will bring us very good
additional profits going forward, which can more than compensate for the loss in
profitability, which we see due to current market structures. So, overall, from my side, a lot
of optimism if I may call it when I talk optimism, at least relative to how I saw the future

over time again. Thank you.
