FINAL

Distinguished shareholders and others who may be watching our webcast, the year 2020
was a lot more surprising and turbulent than we anticipated and this applies to the world
and to Sampo. The markets, at the beginning of the year in March, decreased quite
radically due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and actually the pandemic created a huge
question mark, which meant that we were waiting for answers for a month or two months.
And then for the rest of the year, we have been looking for better answers, more speciﬁc
answers.
The most surprising element in this reaction and in the market environment in 2020 was
how quickly the markets recovered after the dip or dive they took in March and April. And
actually the year ended in record high numbers and they have kept that level this year as
well. At the background of this phenomenon, there are many facts that apply to the
economy -- many changes that apply to the economy and the most important one is that
interest rates are still very, very low. In euro, interest rates are negative. Now inﬂation rates
have started to accelerate and it seems that real interest rates remain negative as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

Another important question has been technology. If you look at indices, even quickly, you
can see that the biggest increases have been seen in technology companies, companies
that have beneﬁted from the COVID-19 crisis and technology companies are among the
companies that are expected to beneﬁt from the change in consumer behavior that was
caused or accelerated by the pandemic.
The third factor that has supported this increase at a later stage was the huge public
deﬁcits. They are surprisingly big. They have surprised markets and you can say that
spending discipline has been thrown out. And the surprise to the markets, especially in
the short-term has been positive.
So these three factors have caused the markets to recover very quickly and markets are in
overdrive even, but that doesn't mean that COVID-19 had not hurt our economies
permanently or at least, it has caused permanent changes. I have mentioned one of these
changes and it is that digitalization took a huge leap forward. Many have even talked
about how something happened now in months that was expected to take years. So
consumer behavior has changed radically in many, many ﬁelds, in retailing, in restaurant -in the restaurant business and there are countless others as well.
Of course, there are negative eﬀects as well. They are still being talked oﬀ and we don't
have any real information on them. I assume that business travel, downtown real estate,
the hospitality industry, hotels, restaurants, they will experience the negative impact for a
while yet. So this has been the environment. Some could call it, exciting, others
challenging. This was the environment in which Sampo was forced to operate in 2020.
And in hindsight, I could say that we fared pretty well.
In ﬁnancial terms, one of the factors behind our performance was that the epidemic has
impacted P&C insurance business all over the world and it has had a positive impact,
because the damages have been below normal level. And of course, in the motor
insurance business, for example, that has really driven the earnings formation in that ﬁeld,
but it's not dramatically important element in our ﬁgures. Actually, our P&C business is

FINAL

doing great and that of course entails a lot of other things besides motor insurance. So,
we are glad to see this development and we can be quite conﬁdent about it.
For us, 2020 was a year of change, not just due to the turbulence on the markets. We got
a new President and CEO to the Group. Of course, he had been practicing to take on that
role for about a year as the CEO of Nordea and he had other jobs or tasks in the Group as
well. And that is why Torbjorn was able to get a ﬂying start and start with great
conﬁdence. And you can ask your questions to him directly after my presentation. And I
am excited to be working with him, to be going through this change with him.
Torbjorn and his team launched a new strategy or a framework of a strategy for the
Sampo Board. And now in February, Sampo Board adopted it and it was introduced to
our investors and our shareholders during our Strategy Day or Capital Markets Day. And I
think it has been received, I would say, surprisingly well, because we clearly said that we
would be focusing on the insurance business and P&C insurances. In particular, the
reactions were very, very positive.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our leadership team at Sampo has been doing that job for 20 years, now -- more than 20
years now and investors response was very clear that this strategy is a good one. And due
to that, we have taken certain decisions. One of the most visible ones was that we have
started on a new market geographically. In the UK, we purchased the company called
Hastings. We started with it quite calmly, but our idea is to build an even better oﬀering in
P&C insurance through Hastings on that market.
At the same time, we made public our initial outlook on decreasing the Group's
dependence on banks and banking. The wave of regulation that has swept over Europe
will mean that the banking business in the future will be in its nature quite diﬀerent to
what it was a few years back at least. And in that sense, although, we strongly believe that
banking and the valuation levels of banks will increase in the future. We didn't think that
we could achieve the kind of ﬁgures we were looking for in terms of return. So in the
medium term, we will be exiting that business and in -- our investments in that business.
The year 2021 has started in positive terms. I think many of you have seen our Q1 report. It
speaks for itself. We have a very conﬁdent outlook towards the current market situation,
both in terms of our business areas and the investment market in general. And in that
sense, it is easy to support the future outlook in our interim report. In Sampo, they remain
pretty stable and that is our way of saying that we try to generate excellent, but stable
return on investors' money.
How about the future? We have now identiﬁed the key factors, the framework that we will
be working in the few coming years. Our strategy is in place. We will be focusing on
insurance. We will be expanding in P&C insurance in Northern Europe and now the UK
market is attached to that as well and we will be progressing in all that. And as I just said,
we have decided to decrease and ﬁnally, exit our holdings in Nordea and I think we will
be quite lucky in that because the situation is quite clearly that investors seem to have
understood that the bogeyman that is in the investment market, i.e., inﬂation is in banking
quite positive in fact.

Inﬂation produces two good things for banks. It increases valuation when credits are
nominal, but then guarantees are inﬂation-linked. And then on the other hand inﬂation
expectations and inﬂation itself produce slowly a positive curve on yields, interest rates
turn from negative to positive and when interest rate return to a sensible level into
positive, a little or even little more above zero and the yield the banks get from taking in
people's deposits will improve signiﬁcantly. And this means that in the medium term, the
outlook for banks in Europe and in Northern Europe, especially where we don't have to
worry about the solvency of banks, this is a good time to let that investment go to exited,
because as we have seen, investors on the market price Nordea on a diﬀerent level than
they did only six months ago.
Sampo already during this year has gone through a signiﬁcant change. We will continue
with that. We have a new team which is getting new members all the time. It's a very
streamlined lined team and we are very conﬁdent about the future and we hope that this
year will again become a great year for this Group in its history and I hope that you will
still join us during that journey.
Now, I would be happy to take your questions.

Questions And Answers
A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. Let's move over to the questions in the order we have received them.
Could Sampo remain a Nordea owner because the banking business is in better shape
now that the interest rates are normalizing?

A - Bjorn Wahlroos

{BIO 1763401 <GO>}

Well, that's what I tried to say at the end of my speech that the prerequisites for banking
have improved, but partially it has been capitalized in banking share prices and therefore
the proﬁt in our banking business is much better now than six months ago.

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

We have one interesting question to ponder, related to our Nordea ownership.

A - Bjorn Wahlroos

{BIO 1763401 <GO>}

In Finland, we have quite special tax regulation. If you have a 10% ownership in a
company, the -- selling it oﬀ will be tax-free. So, if we reduce our ownership to under 10%,
we are now owning 15.9%, so 10% is not so far oﬀ. So it would be better to sell it oﬀ
completely because according to the Finnish tax regulation, in the share taxation, you
value it in order where the latter part of the proﬁt is biggest and this means that if we go
under 10% ownership, we have 12 months to sell oﬀ the total last part and the tax saving of
that is signiﬁcant because the proﬁts for the latter part, because we used to buy Nordea
shares EUR2 per share at the time, so the tax eﬀect would be great. So the answer is that
Nordea is a very interesting target for investments in the short term, although it has been
Page 4 of 20

Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2021-05-19

that for six months now, but the tax scheme is supposed to leave to the situation where in
the short or the medium term we have to sell. It's completely independent on what kind
of an investment we would see Nordea as.

FINAL

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Thank you. We have several similar questions. So the quarterly dividends. How do you see
that? Could Sampo consider paying out dividend per quarter?

A - Bjorn Wahlroos

{BIO 1763401 <GO>}

Well, the short summary is that, of course, we can consider it. I personally have always
been somewhat skeptical to those who said that this would have a great signiﬁcance in
the share price formulation. I'm sure that this won't happen because our ﬁnancial markets
function do well that if someone has a great liquidity -- liquidation problem per quarter,
they can correct it by the ﬁnancial markets. But on the other hand, when these
mechanisms and the IT systems function well, there aren't so many counter arguments. So
therefore, we will ponder this issue and you will continue keeping it up as shareholders.
And we take this question somewhat positively and we will see whether it will become a
custom or not, but I don't see any great obstacle to it.

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good. Next question then on your -- the purchase of own shares. Can Sampo consider
this, if the share price is low enough?

A - Bjorn Wahlroos

{BIO 1763401 <GO>}

Well, of course, we can consider it. That's why we are trying to get an appointment from
the shareholders to this during this AGM as well. But the stakes are high, because our
CFO, for example, or the one who would present this would have to present a signiﬁcant
under evaluation before we would take up such action of repurchasing shares. So during
my time in this company, I think that only on three occasions and only once in a signiﬁcant
amount have we repurchased own shares. But I have to say that in the past six months, we
have been discussing this and with the leadership team, we have been considering it
whether it would be the right time now. When the share price was quite low at one point,
one central argument then was that, in the banking sector, the ECB has set quite tight
restrictions on capital distribution, actually a prohibition, a ban on dividends and
purchasing of own shares. So I think that this might be quite diﬃcult regarding the
authorities if we would put on a signiﬁcant repurchase of own shares. But my answer is
clear. Of course, we can consider this. And I could say that this scheme in Finland has in
the withholding tax issue caused with foreign investors who are not British, it would be
quite natural to repurchase our own shares, because for many shareholders the tax
treatment is not so nice.

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Then several questions on Mandatum, whether leasing of Mandatum is on the schedule
and the timetable.

Date: 2021-05-19

FINAL

A - Bjorn Wahlroos

{BIO 1763401 <GO>}

Well, the answer is no. At this point, we have considered and we still consider that
Mandatum is a core part of the Sampo Group. We discussed the role of Mandatum when
we looked at the new strategy of Sampo and we have deﬁned Mandatum as a strategic
part of this group and therefore -- you looked at me so that I thought that I was answering
in a wrong manner or something like that. Well -- and with this deﬁnition, we mean that
Mandatum stays with us. But of course, nothing is permanent in business. So currently we
do not have any need to divest some of our parts. Mandatum actually releases capital
because its capital absorbing life insurance business is already 20 years old and it has
been under ramp down for some time now. So when we look into the future, Mandatum
doesn't actually bind lots of our capital in the group. So the justiﬁcation should be
something else, but Mandatum now plays an important role in the total asset
management and their balance sheet is used for the group capital position formulation.
Therefore, it is an fundamental part of our group.

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

How do you see -- what are the biggest risks in business, for example, and what kind of
measures or actions have you taken to counter these risks?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Bjorn Wahlroos

{BIO 1763401 <GO>}

Well, ﬁrst of all, I'd like to say that we -- I would say that the risks, I see them smaller now
than I would have said two, three years ago and this is because our share in the banking
business is smaller than it used to be and the regulation tsunami I referred to in my
presentation is calming down, so that the rules of the game seem to be ﬁxed now with
one big exception and that is the ban on dividends, which should be lifted by the ECB this
autumn. But the games of the -- the rules of the game being now stabilizing from ECB and
other authorities. So the regulatory risk, so the surprising authorities actions, that risk has
been decreasing. And at the same time, Nordea during a time when I have had to work a
lot with Nordea, I invested a lot of personal resources and money for them to correct their
organization and activities. For example, in anti-money laundering and I was able to
prevent signiﬁcant negative impacts not -- or unlike to other Nordic banks, who suﬀered a
lot.
But our business environment now is less risky than I would have estimated two, three
years ago. But on the other hand, if we've learned something from the pandemic, we
have learned that in this modern world anything can happen at least from the investors
point of view. So there are only few people who understand how brilliant the US former
defense secretary -- Donald Trump felt was, when you say that there are three unknown
factors, the third being the unknown unknowns. So those unknown factors, which we
cannot even imagine, those are the worst unknowns. And after the pandemic, one could
say that our business environment, the business environment of all companies, one thing
is that we have used a lot of time to ﬁgure out these unknown risks and still we cannot
cover these risk 100%. But we're doing quite well.

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Where do you see Sampo within 10 years?

A - Bjorn Wahlroos

{BIO 1763401 <GO>}

FINAL

That's not my task. That's the easy answer, that's for someone else to decide. But I will stay
on constructing the future of Sampo. Very brieﬂy, I see, ﬁrst of all, the -- currently big
massive proﬁtable technologically advanced pioneer PC insurance group ahead of me
which will become one of the best and highest value insurer in the north of Europe.

A - Jarmo Salonen

That was a good segue into our next question or questions. How do you see your own
future in Sampo? How long will you remain the Chairman of the Board at Sampo?

A - Bjorn Wahlroos

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

{BIO 1763401 <GO>}

Well, I have gone through the decisions of this new type of Annual General Meeting. I
understand that, I have been re-elected to the Sampo Board and the Board has elected
me to be the Chairman. So, I have promised to stay on for one year. So maybe, I can
promise that I can maybe give you another year after that, if you insist. But after that, I
think we're close to the limit. Thank you. Then ﬁnally, how about the increase in interest
rates and inﬂation? What is the impact to Sampo business? That's a good question. I
already answered that partly when I talked about banking and said that inﬂation, when it is
as low as it is now, it's almost exclusively positive for banking. It's very good for our
valuation and for deposits. Inﬂation can be a bit more worrying in P&C business. But in
our actual business, I think it's 50-50. So repair costs will go up, but so will insurance
costs, the insurance premiums. So I think what is crucial here is, our balance sheet, if we
take a look at Sampo's balance sheet, we noticed one interesting detail. Sampo is almost
the only signiﬁcant insurer in Europe who hasn't matched its receivables to debt. So in a
normal language that means that in our balance sheet, we do not have a great number of
debt with long maturities and we don't have government bonds with long maturities. So
the small amounts that we do have or have their maturities have been shortened by using
derivatives and that means that Sampo will not be facing setbacks, if interest rates
increase. So rising interest rates is an opportunity for us, not a threat.

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Thank you for these answers. I think we will have to close this session here.

A - Bjorn Wahlroos

{BIO 1763401 <GO>}

Thank you. Thanks a lot and have a good rest of the webcast. Although, this is not, if I
understand correctly, an oﬃcial part of the Annual General Meeting. Well, anyway I will let
you take over and Knut Arne and Torbjorn also.

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Yes. Distinguished shareholders, we will be moving to Stockholm through a short video.
And after that, Mr. Magnusson's presentation. [Video Presentation]

FINAL

Dear shareholders, I am pleased that I'm able to meet with you at least this way in
conjunction with Sampo's virtual AGM this year. I will, by way of introduction, give some
words on Sampo's strategy with couple of slides from our Capital Markets Day in February
and then it felt natural also to have a slide on our ﬁrst quarter results we have passed of
course to the ﬁrst quarter of the year.
So starting here with our strategy, we are pursuing a path towards a pure-play insurance
company. We have three property and casualty insurance assets. We have If P&C, we have
Topdanmark, and we have Hastings Group. The track records of those assets are second
to absolutely none and they all hold leading positions in their markets and their
segments. We will invest and we will develop those companies without any limit to the
timeframe.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second group of assets we manage for value. This includes Nordea. Bjorn discussed
this. We are pleased with the much improved development of the company in the past, so
let's say, 18 months, two years and then they are now following it -- a path towards their
2022 targets. But we have decided to reduce the holding materially within 18 months from
the Capital Markets Day in February this year. This group also includes a number of small
investments sized EUR100 million to EUR300 million which we have done with our
partners. Many of these are private equity ﬁrms, where we have a smaller ownership than
our partner. They are likely to run the, let's call, it PE natural lifespan and they have been a
very good and proﬁtable group of investments.
Finally, this group also includes Mandatum Life, which is a Finnish life insurance company
in great shape, performing well also during the pandemic. To maximize the value there,
we will focus on extracting a strong dividend stream from the run-oﬀ book and secondly
to develop capital-light products for the present ﬁnancial environment.
My second slide today depicts the new ﬁnancial targets that we announced in February
this year. They reﬂect the strategy I just described. We have set targets for the combined
ratios, for our P&C operations. They are ambitious multi-year targets that reﬂect both our
strong abilities and the state of our markets. We have also set a balance sheet framework,
where the ranges for solvency and leverage that are optimal for the operations that we
have. Finally, we have reiterated the fact that we know dividends are important to you, our
shareholders. And we keep our previous policy supplemented by the dividend from the
fact that the dividend from the insurance operations should be an increasing one.
Turning then ﬁnally to our ﬁrst quarter results, they show considerable strength in almost
every way that you can think of. Proﬁts are up from all segments both from operational
results as well as the investment returns. But most importantly, the underwriting result, the
core of our sustainable development for the Group was up signiﬁcantly. The important
combined ratio targets that I just mentioned were met by a wide margin, even if you
correct them for the beneﬁcial COVID eﬀects that also Bjorn mentioned.
Thus, it was a pleasure to present our Q1 results to the market as it is a pleasure to share
them again with you. And with that, Jarmo, I think we open up for questions.

Thank you, Torbjorn. Mirko Hurmerinta has joined me at -- and again I made the wrong
language choice. (Foreign Language) Yes, I was meant to speak Finnish. Mirko is here with
me to ask questions to Torbjorn and Knut Arne. Mirko, maybe you could ask the ﬁrst
question.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

Thank you, Jarmo. The ﬁrst question goes to Torbjorn. What are the growth opportunities
for Sampo in the current markets in the Nordic countries, both organically and through
M&A?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

These are limited. And we have limited them to bolt-ons, i.e., things that add to the
operations that we already have and can be integrated with them, et cetera. But on the
other hand, I think that the opportunities to grow for us with a leading digital ability in
these markets where customers gradually move over through to digital channels is one
that has been there for a number of years and that is increasing in importance every year
as we go along.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. Next one is for Knut Arne. How about the rising interest rates? How will that
impact the solvency of Sampo if the interest rates there reach the level of 2% for example?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Rising interest rate is positive for the solvency of Sampo, basically meaning that we will
have a higher value coming from the liability side of our balance sheet. And in solvency
ratio terms a 1% increased interest rate is roughly EUR500 million more in solvency
capital, meaning that 2% would be roughly EUR1 billion more in solvency capital.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

Thank you. Why didn't Sampo acquire even more Topdanmark last spring when the
markets crashed due to COVID?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

If we would have wanted to do that -- I think the Topdanmark share price fell for about two
weeks and actually, the turnover of Topdanmark shares every day is really very, very small.
So that chance was too limited and too brief, even if we have would have wanted.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

Then a more broad question to Torbjorn. What kind of competitive edge just If have on
the Northern markets?

Well, I think that If has proved in several ways with its long track record, two things. One,
and most importantly, that the customer focus that that company has is really
extraordinary and the services and the products that are now available on the web and
with car dealers and in telephone services are absolutely superb and we have shown
good growth over quite a long time period for the company. But also of course If P&C
was founded on the idea of Nordic synergies and those will and are realized more than
anything else in IT. And if you look at If P&C's development in the cost ratio, that reﬂects
those synergies. I think it's probably the longest track record in the world of reducing cost
ratio. It's more than a decade long by now. Every year consistently less IT cost, less cost in
general and more synergies and reducing cost ratios for the beneﬁt of the customers, of
course.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

Then on investments to Knut Arne. At Group level, Sampo's level is at 14% -- has -- all
equity exposure is 14%. Why is it so low, should it be higher?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

It's 14%. 14% did represent the fact that we primarily have the balance sheet consisting of
P&C insurance liabilities, which funds our asset mix and investment portfolio and we need
to have an investment perspective that basically takes the cash ﬂows, the liabilities we
have into perspective. And we feel with 14% or there about, that's a good mix in terms of
getting return, of course, attractive return on our assets and also taking the structure of
our balance sheet into account.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

At this point, I'd like to encourage you to send in more questions. A question that has
been presented on several occasions is related to the COVID-19 impact on PC insurance.
Once we've gotten rid of the virus, do you see some kind of a permanent impact or
impact on our proﬁtability generally speaking?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

We are expecting in the outlook for this year that the COVID eﬀects will gradually fade,
disappear in the quarter that we're in now, in the second quarter. And we operate in very
rational Nordic markets. That's where the dominant part of our business is. And the
Nordic markets have all the time in the past decade been rational to when prerequisite
circumstances have changed in the market. So, no, I really don't see a permanent eﬀect
on the proﬁtability. We will act rationally and change rates according to the environment
that we're in all the time. And at the moment, there is no part segment of the business,
where we do not see the rate changes that are the right ones, the correct ones coming
through in our business.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

Elliott, who has said that he owns 3% of Sampo has been quite silent in the past months,
do you have any comments on that?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Not really. We've had a good dialog with Elliott over the last year and sometimes they
have been vocal in the market than they have recently, but it's been a good dialog, as we
have with many owners.

Related to the UK insurance market, how do you see the price comparison websites' role
changes in market development generally?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Well, of course, it's an exciting market, the UK market where the price comparison sites,
also called aggregators came to the markets, that's a couple of decades ago now and
gradually took over quite a large market share in not only P&C insurance but also in P&C
insurance. And the incumbents, the old insurance companies have struggled to ﬁnd a way
to be successful in those -- on those sites. However, there are a number of new insurance
companies in the UK market that are grown up together with these price comparison sites
and in one case, they even -- they are even co-owned or owned one of the aggregators.
So that's a very close collaboration in a way and Hastings that we have acquired 70% of is
one of the companies that has grown up in this environment and has been very successful
every year in -- on the price comparison sites.

Sampo has given a very speciﬁc timetable regarding Nordea reducing ownership in the
coming 18 months. What about the other ﬁnancial investments?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

As I mentioned in my introduction, we don't drive the smaller investments that we have in
Saxo, Nets and Nordax and a few more. So we are quite dependent on PE ﬁrms or others
for the timetable of those developments. But I think there is a natural time limit for those
investments that varies from investment to investment.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

Sampo's share is a little bit over EUR40 -- EUR41 in share price, are you considering share
splitting?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

I think that any change to the share construction is something that the Board will, of
course, deliberate on regularly. However, my primary purpose is, of course, to increase
the share price and that is more important to me than the exact construct of the share at
the moment.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

Sampo's target is to keep gearing under 30%. What signiﬁcance does leverage have
when you have cheap debt to be purchased on the markets?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Leverage is a good tool to ﬁnance parts of our business naturally and as an insurance
group, we use leverage also for solvency capital purposes. Some parts of the debt can
also be used for that speciﬁc purpose. Then of course, we want to have a balance sheet
which gives us some ﬂexibility also for the future. And with the target we've set -- the
leverage target we've set, we felt that ﬂexibility is created as long as the current leverage
ratio is below 30%. So that's what we stick to going forward. Obviously, if there is a certain
opportunity that arises, a good business opportunity for a bolt-on acquisition, leverage
could, of course, be slightly above 30% for a period of time, particularly, with the current
interest rate environment naturally. But currently and over time, we will stick to a leverage
target of below 30%.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

I'll now combine a couple of questions. One question, is related to what kind of a threat
do you see technology companies outside your business or that, for example, automobile
companies would oﬀer insurances from their business point of view?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

This is a wide question, of course, very broad. Let me say a few words about it. First of all,
that I'm almost proud to work in the Nordic P&C markets, because the Nordic P&C
markets have met technological advances by adapting them, by developing them since
30 years back and that way, the insurance companies, not only If P&C, has been able to
lead development and we have seen no inﬂux of other global insurers to the Nordics
because we have been more eﬃcient here. So that's one point. Another is that we via If
P&C have a closer relationship with the car industry than almost any other insurer I know
at least in Europe, which means that the developments in the car industry is something
that they do together with us to a large degree. And of course, we've been extraordinarily
successful in creating long-term relationships with the car manufacturers and also
distributors. So I think we're in good shape for meeting also new advances in technology.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

How about Sampo's own M&A capability? Could Sampo be a target for a bigger operator
to purchasing, Alianz for example?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Few companies around the globe that are in such good shape that they could acquire
Sampo. Sampo is a big entity and we've had no such plans or advances made towards us.
So, no.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

A diﬀerent perspective next, how important is it to Sampo to be a diverse company to
have diversity, to have inclusion, and its own activity and in its investment companies as
well?

As to exactly what that question entails, we are specializing the company when we're
saying that we are pursuing a path towards pure-play insurer of course and we are
divesting a banking entity. But on the other hand, we have a lot of diversiﬁcation because
we operate already today in several diﬀerent markets. We've added Hastings, which is the
eighth market and that gives a lot of diversiﬁcation also to our capital requirements. So it
is important for us where diversiﬁcation gives us an advantage when it comes to capital,
when it comes to sharing investments, the one technology that we just discussed. On the
other hand, we are specializing into what we do best. So insurance business and that is an
advantage in itself.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

If I may continue, I think this referred more to what is the role of women in top
management?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

There is a -- it is unfortunate that we and the rest of the world have not been able to
advance more women into our leadership teams, but that will come gradually and we
have a large number of the women that are developing upwards towards the ranks of the
top management team over time.

Often, we have said that Topdanmark is too expensive for Sampo to buy at current prices,
but how about selling it, if it's so expensive?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

I think we have a wide range of possibilities here and things don't -- maybe don't change
over time, but they are modiﬁed over time. The actual share price of Topdanmark, how I
see that, depends on what the market price is at the moment. It depends on the
development of the company in every quarter, of course, and also the way that they -- the
Danish market, where they operate, how digitalized that one is and how they invest in that
digitalization. So there's a large number of factors and potentials for us going forward.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

In banking, we have seen a lot more regulation. How about P&C? Is there a risk for such
an increase in regulation?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

I think both banking and P&C insurance over the past -- it's more than ﬁve years now. I
would say, it's almost a dozen years to have seen a gradual increase of regulations and
regular requirements on capital, but also on the way that you operate and reduce risk in
the companies. So that is something that's been going on in parallel between insurance
and banking all the time.

A question on Nordea. Do you think there is a risk that ECB will continue its dividend ban
after September?

FINAL

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

I think that it would be natural for the ECB going forward to stick to the regulations that
have been there. When we didn't have the pandemic, if the pandemic leaves, that would
be a logical progression, wouldn't it? But let's see, where we're with COVID after the
summer and then it's going to be easier for both the ECB and me I think to answer such a
question.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

What is your understanding of European insurance companies interest towards the
Nordic market?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Really in the -- mainly in insurance business and I've got a lot of contacts in the European
insurance market and the European Insurance companies now and then I discuss the
Nordics with other colleagues than from the European insurance market. There is almost
always a great fascination and interest in the technology that we're developing here and
people want to observe and try develop similar things. But so far that's the extent of that
interest I think that I've seen. And in addition, it is diﬃcult to see how you could come to
the Nordics and be more eﬃcient than the Nordic insurance companies are if you are
from Germany or France or Italy as the cost levels that we have here are way below what
they are used to. It is such eﬃcient markets.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

How would you estimate the climate change and factors related to it will impact Sampo's
business and P&C, in particular?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

...insurance is diﬀerent than life insurance, of course, in that it is one-year agreements
almost exclusively. So we will see how climate change develops and we will work against
it, of course, as a company, try to contribute with the knowledge that we built up, but we
will also have the opportunity to change our terms and conditions every year as also the
price is possible to change every year in case we see eﬀects of climate change. For
instance, if we have houses close to rivers and shore or similar things.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

To Knut Arne, could you maybe give us a summary of what was said in CMD on the return
of excess capital, the amounts and the ways of doing it, the return to shareholders, that is?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Sure. At the CMD we presented our new capital management framework which says that
we will operate with a solvency ratio within 170% to 190%. So that's capital over the
Page 14 of 20



Company Name: Sampo Oyj

Date: 2021-05-19

FINAL

solvency -- capital requirement. We are currently in the upper end of that range, within the
range, though. If we exceed the 190% level on a sustainable basis, we would deﬁne that
as excess capital in our capital management framework. And obviously, the Board would
consider how to deploy that excess capital given our M&A appetite or return it to
shareholders.
You heard (inaudible) talk about the share buyback considerations or views on that and
obviously to return capital as dividend is already something we do in our regular dividend
policy and that could of course be complemented with the special dividend if we have
excess capital according to our capital framework and the Board decides to do so. In
terms of the amounts, what we talked about at the CMD was that if we were to exit all of
Nordea and the investments, we would have excess capital to the tune of EUR5 to EUR6
per Sampo shares. That has obviously increased a little, given the positive development
primarily in the Nordea share price. And I mentioned at our Q1 call that it's increased by
shy of EUR2.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

Follow-up to Knut Arne. Would it be possible to distribute Nordea ownership as
dividends to shareholders as we did a few years back and what are the factors that would
impact this?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

It would be possible. And in terms of legal requirements, then just if we think about what
we did back in 2019, we distributed a very small part of our Nordea shareholding at that
point in time. To distribute Nordea shares, this dividend in kind is of course giving that
value to our shareholders, but it also gives our shareholder a tax bill, because it is
considered to be dividend for tax purposes. And it is a dividend without any cash
component. So to -- everything else equal to fund that tax bill, our shareholders would
either need to have other source of liquidity or sell that -- sell Nordea shares when the tax
bill come in the mail. And that would be one consideration which the Board and we will
take seriously meaning that, that is currently something at least for a large part of our
Nordea shareholding something which is not our ﬁrst choice in terms of materially
reducing our Nordea shareholding from the current level.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

Next question to Knut Arne. Regarding Sampo's share weighting, do we have an interest
to increase share weighting if share prices start decreasing?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Sure. That could, of course, be an opportunity to buy into cheaper assets in our
investment portfolio. Then, if share price decreases, that in itself is of course, reducing the
weighting of equities in our total portfolio. So to say that we would sort of increase our
percentage term -- in percentage term, which was one of the earlier questions I got, I
couldn't say that that necessarily would happen. But, of course, if -- with the strong
balance sheet that we have and to ﬁnd good investment opportunities to buy into
cheaper assets, it's always a good opportunity for an investor.

Will Sampo proﬁle itself as a dividend company in the future as well?

FINAL

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Well, I think we've made very clear that we believe a dividend is important as I mentioned
previously for our shareholders and ourselves. And we made also a clear statement that
we keep the -- in excess of 70% dividend policy in addition to promising to have an
increasing insurance dividend from the core operations.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

A question relating to, if Nordic competitors do you (inaudible) that they would be
operatively ahead of If?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

I wouldn't say that we can say that, but we can say that there is rational competition out
there. And they are perfectly competent competitors to us. And they have also been able
to grow their businesses a bit. But I think the important thing is that the Nordic markets
are dominated by a small number of large insurers. The number of small insurers has
actually come down in the past few years and we have a very rational competition that
seem to change the rates according to claims inﬂation in a good way for the market to
keep up its proﬁtability.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

Torbjorn, could you tell us three reasons why a webcast watching us should consider
investing in Sampo?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Well, I think it's quite easy. We have, as the ﬁrst reason, the clarity that we now have given
on our strategy. We have deﬁned what we want to do and we are going there in a very -in a way that is easy to understand. Secondly, our track record. We have a long track
record of succeeding in P&C insurance, which is now the focus area. And thirdly, I would
say, look at the recent results as well. The Q1 numbers that we published is of course a
pointer that we are in no way getting weaker as a company, but stronger by the day.
There you have three reasons.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

A continuation to a previous question relating to motor insurances. In Germany, some
insurers pay automobile manufacturers for getting information from them. Is this
something that If could consider doing?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Would you mind repeating the question? I don't think I got all of it.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

Yes. So according to the one who questions, in Germany, some insurers purchase
information from car manufacturers and then they use this. Could If consider doing this?

FINAL

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Well, we could consider doing it were it not for the fact that we have such a close
collaboration with the car industry. So they are actually acquired -- they are actually
buying information from us in some cases and we are sharing information with each other,
developing the best possible products for our clients and it's one of our strongest
distribution channels. So it's not a current topic, even though sometime in the distant
future, it's not out of question, of course.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

Would it be possible that Sampo would repurchase own shares from one single
shareholder such as Solidium, for example?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

There are no such plans or discussions at the moment.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Related to own share purchases and Nordea ownership, if Nordea would not be in your
ownership, would that impact somehow to Sampo's purchase of its own shares from the
regulatory point of view or legislative point of view?

A - Bjorn Wahlroos

{BIO 1763401 <GO>}

No, there is no necessarily direct link between the ECB ban on dividends for banks. And
what local regulators and EIOPA have for the insurance sector. Obviously, the reason for
being careful in capital distribution in terms of the uncertainty related to COVID is the
same. But we need to consider what our regulator, how insurance regulator thinks about
us as an insurance company. Whatever assets we have on our balance sheet. So that in
itself wouldn't change our possibility for capital action. Obviously if we had the situation
where we have materially reduced our shareholding in Nordea and as Knut touched
upon, exited Nordea in a way that left us with signiﬁcant proceeds. We would have such a
strong balance sheet and high solvency ratio. That, of course, that discussion with our
regulator in terms of possibility to return capital, if that's what the Board wanted should
be an easy one.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

Then I'd like to encourage the shareholders to send in more questions. A question related
to the competitive environment in the Nordic countries regarding If. The competitive

Maybe to avoid going through a very long journey through all the countries. Let me ﬁrst
say that, in most countries, the same parent companies, same groups dominate in total in
the Nordics. So as you all know, If P&C is present with a strong presence in all Nordic
countries. Tryg P&C are present with the exception of Finland. Gjensidige has a very
strong base in Norway, but also presence in Denmark and to some degree Sweden. So
the reactions to changes in the market are discussed in relatively few places, if I put it that
way. Then the history is that, mainly in Norway, we saw a number of new entrants. It's
probably like ﬁve years ago now and they enter the market without any strong
competitive advantage just thinking that it would be possible to take part in what they saw
was good proﬁt and then they discovered that entering P&C insurance without any
statistical basis, without knowing anything about customer behavior, without having the
systems, the technology in place, it was quite diﬃcult and over time they disappeared.
That's what's happened in Norway.
Sweden has been more stable. Denmark has seen a few mergers or acquisitions that has
consolidated that market a bit in the past few years and Finland has also been stable now
for a period of years. So, yeah -- and in the meantime, I think that we have all, the large
companies developed our technology, our call centers, or our Internet oﬀerings and
those are areas where being big and being able to share costs across the Nordics is an
advantage and has beneﬁted certainly If P&C, but also to some degree the other large
insurers in the Nordics.

A - Mirko Hurmerinta

{BIO 20441689 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

In Sweden and in Finland, motor insurance debt is discounted. So therefore that would be
good for If. How do you see the inﬂationary risk as regards If?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

That's very true. In terms of the motor insurance technical reserves and also workers'
compensation reserves, I should add, in Finland is discounted. And if the question is what
is the impact, similar to the previous question on that -- on increasing rates -- nominal
rates on that reserve mass, if I take all of the discounted reserves in If and if interest rate
increase by 1%, there would be an increase in -- one-time increase in proﬁt of around
EUR400 million. Of course, in such an environment, there will be an oﬀsetting factor by a
mark-to-market negative development on the asset side, but the net would be clearly
positive.
So in terms of gearing for increased rates, we discounted reserves. We are of course very
much geared towards increasing interest rate environment like we needed to take the
negative hit of decreasing rates over a decade in our combined ratio. So the results that
we have produced in If over the last 10, 13 years, the combined ratios, the strong
combined ratio, they still include signiﬁcant run-oﬀ losses, so strengthening due to
decreasing rates. And if we have an upward ticking rate path, some of that would of
course come back as proﬁts in such a scenario.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

We saw Hastings as a unique opportunity. We had followed the company for a long, long
time. They operate in one segment, in a segment that they know really well and in a
segment where there is natural growth that they can take part in. We have no intent going
on a spending spree in all of the UK, which is quite competitive insurance market or all of
Northern Europe where we've limited knowledge. So this was a unique opportunity. We
had followed the company for a long time. And what we could imagine is, of course, if
there was a small portfolio that could be in addition to Hastings in the same segment, the
digital distribution segment that they operate. So very limited and bolt-on focused
possibilities.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

My experience is such that if you try to predict things over 10 years in business, you are
invariably quite wrong. So -- and you are deﬁnitely also quoted on it 10 years later. So I'm
not going to try to do that. We have a strategy, a very clear strategy. We published it in
every detail in February. We have reported for the ﬁrst quarter towards that strategy and
all the KPIs that we promise that we would deliver on and report on we have done and
that is a commitment over a three year period with three year targets. That's quite enough
