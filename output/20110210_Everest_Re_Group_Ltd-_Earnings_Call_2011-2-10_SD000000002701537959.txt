Bloomberg Transcript

Good day, everyone, welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited Fourth Quarter 2010
earnings release call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening
remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice
President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Beth Farrell

{BIO 19732216 <GO>}

Thank you, Artebia. Good morning. Welcome to Everest Re Group's Fourth Quarter and
full-year 2010 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Taranto, the Company's
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dom Addesso, our Chief Financial Officer.
Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include
extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note
that statements made during today's call which are forward-looking in nature such as
statements about projections, estimates, expectations, and the like, are subject to various
risks.
As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations.
Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection
with such statements. Now let me turn the call over to Joe.

Joseph Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

Thanks, Beth. Good morning. We are pleased to have achieved an annualized ROE of 18%
in the Fourth Quarter on $258 million of operating earnings. These strong results were
enhanced by excellent investment income returns and a tax benefit from prior years.

FINAL

Despite a challenging marketplace, and a significant number of global (inaudible) our
operating ROE was 9%, and we grew book value per share by 12%.
We finished the year with $6.3 billion of capital, an increase of $182 million from where we
started, a testimony to the strength of our core earnings when you consider that we had
$571 million of cat losses, $400 million of share repurchases, and $108 million of dividend
payments. Our year-end reserve studies essentially confirmed last year's estimates as
there was modest favorable development for the year. We have booked accident year
2010 at solid estimates, fully reflective of market changes, looking to maintain sound
estimates overall. Dom will provide more details on the financials momentarily.

Bloomberg Transcript

January renewals did not provide any great surprises. Property catastrophe and retro
rates were off 5%-ish but generally continued to rate adequately. Reinsurance rates,
terms and conditions remained stable on most property and casualty cash treaties unless
prior losses required a correction, as was the case with Chile, Australian cat business as
well as the energy space for BP losses. We continued to concentrate our support in the
casualty reinsurance market on core clients.
We also continued to benefit internationally from our strong ratings, solid reputation and
long-established presence. Underlying insurance rates both casualty and property
continued to slowly decline both in the US and abroad. As rates decline, we will reduce
our proportional treaties if we cannot make the appropriate returns. Looking forward,
barring favorable market changes, I do not see 2011 as a year where we expect top line
growth. We will continue to plant seeds for the future, as we have in the recent past in our
expansion into Brazil and China, or most recently in our expansion into the insurance
market in Canada and we will selectively move into spaces that we believe have very
favorable short-term and long-term prospects as is the case for our recent acquisition of
Heartland.
If the market doesn't improve, our mandate will be to underwrite, don't overreach and
grow selectively. Whereas I don't expect top line growth, I am hopeful that Everest will
have 2011 earnings that surpass 2010. I am hopeful for an improved underwriting
performance both for our insurance and reinsurance operations, as well as continued
strong investment returns which will be helped by the very strong cash flow we
experienced in 2010. I expect all of this will be enhanced by continued stock buyback.
Let me provide some details on why I expect these improvements. First, our insurance
operation. Although it had a poor 2010, I believe we can achieve an underwriting profit in
2011. This operation is undergoing a significant transformation. An important part of this
transformation is our acquisition of Heartland. We are exceedingly pleased to have Mike
Miller and his team become part of the Everest Group.
Mike has done an outstanding job of growing his operation, which wrote roughly $300
million of crop business. It is our belief that together we can continue to profitably grow
the business into the future. It is also our belief that we can right this business to a doubledigit underwriting profit through the course of the future. Heartland will convert to using
our paper in July, between reinsurance and insurance we expect about $175 million worth

FINAL

of business in 2011. Led by Heartland, roughly 40% of Everest National's book will be
short-tail business in 2011.
This includes our California and Florida property operation, as well as our Brownstone and
non-standard auto book. It is my belief that this 40% of our insurance book will run to a
meaningful underwriting profit. Roughly another 25% of our 2011 insurance writings will be
California workers comp. In 2010, we achieved nearly 9% in rate increases. We are looking
to continue to raise rates by double-digits in 2011.
I believe the market, which has been hurt by recent results, will allow us to achieve our
goals. It is our belief that these increases will allow us to achieve an underwriting profit in
this sector in 2011. Roughly 15% of our insurance business in 2011 will be produced by our
New York direct operation which writes D&O and E&O products mostly for financial
institutions. This operation has been quite profitable and I believe it will continue to be so
in 2011. Putting these three pieces together, we have 80% of the book which is expected
to perform well.

Bloomberg Transcript

The other 20% is mainly general liability where market competition remains strong. This
sector will be much smaller for us in 2011, as we phase out our C.V. Starr business from our
paper to Starr's paper. Starr's been a great partner and we will continue to support them
as a reinsurer in 2011. We will continue to press for rate increases in this class but if the
market does not follow, this sector will remain difficult. Nonetheless, I expect our overall
book to do well.
On the reinsurance side, our operation will undergo a little change. But it's my hope we
will experience less catastrophes, despite the fact that the industry has started the year
with the Australian floods. Last year, as the third largest reinsurer in Latin America we
experienced substantial losses in Chile. In response, we have lowered our aggregates
both in Chile and other peak zones. In summary, despite challenging conditions, we will
look to develop our business for the long term, while achieving quality results short term
and long term. Dom?

Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Thank you, Joe. And good morning. As noted, operating earnings for the quarter were
$4.70 per diluted share. When combined with net realized capital gains, it resulted in net
income of $5.51 per diluted share. Net after-tax realized gains, which totaled $44.7 million
or $0.81 per diluted share, were the result of $30.8 million of after-tax fair value
adjustments on the portfolio, and $13.9 million of after-tax gains resulting from sales of
securities.
Securities sales were in part driven by tax strategies and the sale of $480 million of tax
exempt bonds. Operating income for the quarter was $258 million, and was comprised of
a pre-tax underwriting gain of $14 million, pre-tax investment income of $185 million, pretax other income of $21 million, and a one-time tax benefit of $50 million. These income
items were offset by interest expense and other corporate expenses pre-tax of $16
million.

FINAL

First, let me address the federal income tax benefit in the quarter. The Company had
appealed the examination results of certain tax years, primarily related to the gain on
inter-Company asset sales. Due to the uncertainty of the outcome, the Company had
accrued contingency reserves in the event of an adverse ruling. Ultimately our position
was upheld which resulted in a tax refund plus interest, the reversal of the reserve, and
other miscellaneous adjustments, all of which totaled approximately $50 million or $0.90
per diluted share.
Absent this benefit, operating earnings per share were $3.80. On a year-to-date basis,
the effective tax rate on operating income without the one-time tax benefit was 4.2%.
This was lower than prior quarters in part due to year-end reserve adjustments impacting
mostly taxable entities. Turning to the underwriting accounts, premiums earned for the
quarter and year-to-date were relatively flat over prior periods. This, of course, varies by
segment.

Bloomberg Transcript

Insurance is down, reflecting termination of certain programs and audit premium
adjustments. On the reinsurance side, there were no material movements one period
versus the other. This is generally reflecting a relatively soft market resulting in nonrenewals in some cases, offset by only a modest amount of new business in this market
and also some rate increases in our international book as a result of recent cat events.
The details on the underwriting results for the quarter are as follows. A 70.6% loss ratio,
and a 28.1% expense ratio, resulting in a combined ratio of 98.7%. The expense ratio is
generally consistent with other periods, and on a year-to-date basis it is down slightly. The
loss ratio has three components. The current year attritional result was at 63.6% for the
quarter and 60.8% on a year-to-date basis.
For the quarter, the increase over prior periods is a result of higher accident year selected
loss ratios in most lines which reflects a continued soft market, with the result in the
quarter for the current accident year also reflects our year-end reserve study. For the
year-to-date, the attrition was also up over prior year periods in all segments, again, as a
consequence of softer market conditions. The attritional combined ratio was,
nevertheless, still very positive at an 88.7 combined ratio. The second largest component
of the overall loss ratio was cat losses. This was 5.6 points in the quarter, and 14.5 points
in the year-to-date results.
In the Fourth Quarter, there were $57 million in cat losses, $31million for New Zealand and
Chile earthquakes, and $25 million reserved for the Australian floods which occurred
during the last days of the year and continued into 2011. It is expected that these floods
will be deemed to be at least two events, and, therefore, this required an estimated
allocation between 2010 and 2011. Our method assumed a market loss of $4 billion, and a
market share of approximately 1.75%. Roughly one-third of this amount, $25 million, was
allocated to 2010. This leaves an expected 2011 charge of $45 million.
While a reasonable estimate, it is still very early in the loss adjustment process and,
therefore, these estimates are subject to revisions in either direction. It should be noted
that while multiple events could have a more beneficial impact to reinsurers, since primary

Date: 2011-02-10

FINAL

companies are then subject to multiple retentions, this was not factored into the
estimates at this time. The final item impacting losses is adjustments to prior year
reserves. In the quarter, there was a charge of $14 million, or 1.4 loss ratio points, for prior
year development. However, for the year, there was a benefit or redundancy of $15 million
or 0.4 loss ratio points.
Prior year development for the quarter and year-to-date is primarily from casualty classes
in both the insurance and US reinsurance segments. Casualty development for the most
part is stemming from discontinued business in both insurance and facultative reinsurance.
Positive developments were noted in Bermuda casualty and international property lines.
Investment income for the quarter was quite strong at $185 million compared to $146
million one year ago. The majority of this increase is income from limited partnerships at
$40 million in the most recent quarter, compared to $10 million in last year's quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

As mentioned on the Third Quarter call, it was anticipated that strong Third Quarter equity
markets would be reflected in the valuations of these investments in the Fourth Quarter.
All other categories are up in investment income reflecting for the most part increased
investment assets. Dividend income is higher as a result of increasing our equity exposure
with an emphasis on dividend yield. The income also reflects an allocation to high yield
bonds, floating rate bank loans, and emerging market debt. These strategies are
intended to help preserve yield while also reducing the sensitivity of the portfolio to
increases in interest rates.
These allocations, currently at 6% of the total portfolio, have not had a material impact on
the overall credit quality of the portfolio which remains at AA. As mentioned previously,
there were sales of tax exempt holdings during the quarter as we seek to decrease our
exposure to this sector. While we have a well-positioned, high quality portfolio, there are
many reasons to be more cautious in this space and redeploy assets into sectors that will
likely outperform in the near; to mid-term. Nevertheless, with nearly 81% of this portfolio
rated AA and better, including almost 30% in pre-refunded bonds, we can work through
our portfolio in a diligent manner to further reduce any excessive credit risk over time
without reacting inappropriately to headline risk.
Our portfolio is well-diversified, with limited concentrations in individual issues and while
market values will likely be volatile for a while, the portfolio is expected to have minimal
credit risk. Other income for the quarter amounted to $21 million, compared to a loss of
$3 million one year ago. This increase was primarily due to income from the equity index
put contracts, which carry higher valuations primarily due to rising equity markets and
rising interest rates. On a year-to-date basis, the positive swing of $35 million was due to
foreign currency gains of $18 million versus a loss of $22 million in 2009.
Other comprehensive income for the quarter was a loss of $227 million, due to unrealized
losses on the bond portfolio of $251 million after-tax, primarily due to rising interest rates.
On a year-to-date basis, other comprehensive income of $60 million was driven by an
increase in unrealized gains for the year. Overall, the total bond portfolio stands at a pretax unrealized gain position of $439 million. Total comprehensive income for the year was
$671 million, and when combined with dividends of $108 million and share repurchases of
$399 million, resulted in total book value of $6.3 billion or $115.45 per share.

This represents an increase for the year of $12.58 or 12.2%. This represents a solid return
for shareholders for the year and leaves us in a strong position for growth and continued
share repurchases. With that, I'll turn it back to Beth for Q&A. Thank you.

Yes, Artebia, that concludes our prepared remarks.

Questions And Answers
Operator
The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions)
We'll take our first question from Brian Meredith with UBS.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. A couple questions here. First, could you give us some explanation
behind what happened with the insurance business attritional loss ratio in the quarter. Was
there any current year development in that number?

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Brian, what do you mean by current year development?

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Meaning development, meaning from like first or Second Quarter 2010, because it was a
92.1 attritional loss ratio.

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Yes, as a result of our year end reserve studies, and this is true for both the insurance and
the reinsurance, any time we do a reserve study we're obviously doing not only prior year
but assessing the current year. So that's just a natural course of events. So, yes, we did
have some movement in some loss ratios in the current year.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Do we know how much that is? Just trying to get a sense for what the kind of good run
rate attritional loss ratio in that business is?

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, I think if you look at the -- it's hard to look at the quarter, obviously.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Sure.

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

FINAL

Because the attritional current year ran at a 92. And that's exactly to your point, reflected
current year adjustments. So the current year attritional at a 78.3 for the full year is how
we've pegged 2010. Now, having said that, as Joe mentioned earlier, we're anticipating
rate increases on workers compensation which will serve to temper that number down
slightly.

A - Joseph Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

Yes, Brian, I was trying to give you some help for 2011.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Joseph Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We see it for the insurance book as a very, very different picture than 2010. Certainly, part
of it is Heartland and the short-tail business which is new for us, and some of it is what's
going out, we'll be doing much less in the excess and GL space which is mainly driven by
Starr, and the change on that book. But both of those make for significant change.
And then if you take the comp business and the other business where we are achieving
good rate increases, we did in 2010, I think we got something like 13% in January on the
comp business. So we believe it's going to be a very different answer in 2011 and that's
really to help you formulate that. That's why I wanted to go through that segment of our
book for 2011 in detail.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. And then just quickly on property reinsurance, property cat reinsurance, your kind
of assessment of 2011 renewals and then what impact you think the changes in RMS
model may have on mid-year renewals?

A - Joseph Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

We haven't really seen much impact so far from any model changes. I'm sorry to say.
Whether they're up or down to a degree, as it just seems as if there is more capacity and
relative to the demand. And so that really is more dictating the flow and that's why rates
are generally speaking coming down 5%-ish and I don't really see that trend being
changed by model changes. So I think, again, as we proceed into the year, you'll continue
to see that taking place.
Now, everyone, be it RMS or AIR or whatever other model they're using, are still satisfying
themselves that the ROEs on the cat business and the retro business is more than
sufficient. It's not what it was. It's not as high as they'd like it to be, but it's still in the main
high enough for them to continue to write the business. So I think you'll see that trend,
barring major catastrophes, to continue to be the case.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. And then last question. Buyback was down in the quarter versus Third Quarter. I
guess, question will be, one, excess capital position right now, any thoughts on why it was
down and what we could look for potentially going forward?

FINAL

A - Joseph Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

Sure. We continue not to want to forecast that.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Right.

A - Joseph Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

But at the same time, we're major advocates of buying back. We think it's a great way for
us to increase shareholder value. We bought $400 million on the year, which is certainly a
very good number. In the Fourth Quarter, well, we had the Heartland going on. We had the
muni world being a bit unstable and that certainly colored our thinking as well in doing a
bit less there, but we remain bullish on buyback. I'll let Dom speak to the excess capital
position.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Our excess capital position really hasn't changed dramatically, of course, since we've
added earnings and our total shareholders equity is up and premiums being relatively flat.
So we're still in a very strong excess capital position and, as Joe said, that means that
we're still bullish on the stock. We also had during the Fourth Quarter a lot of additional cat
events that were occurring, as well as some noise around New Zealand estimates which
ultimately for us did not really turn out to be that bad of a situation.
But, nevertheless, there was a lot of noise around cat events, both current and prior,
which were also driving part of our decision in terms of limiting our ability. And then, of
course, when those things did become clearer, meaning that it was not going to be as
significant an event for us, that's when we got into the Heartland situation, so we were
really basically in a blackout relative to that.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. Thank you.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Good, good. Going through each of the segments, I was wondering if we can talk about -a little about the specifics of the reserve moves, the extent to which the changes are
attritional and finally what the sense of the reserve position is going forward?

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, sure. What would you like to talk about relative to each of those? I'll just give a
summary and then maybe you might want to have a follow-up.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

I'm talking about in general going through each of the individual segments would be
helpful.

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, first of all, again, I think it's worth reminding all of us that for the year we had positive
development of $15 million. So it essentially validates the position we had a year ago. In
addition, we continue to generally be more conservative around our current year pick,
and, in fact, in many cases we are selecting current year picks which are slightly in excess
of what our reserve study is suggesting. Again, reflecting some uncertainty in the market
relative to pricing.
Just an overall conservative view of the current period. That generally is affecting all of our
lines of business and we are not doing any one less than the other. It's across the board.
What we did find, of course, in the current period, most of the impact was for prior year
as it relates to insurance. And I think that's probably what you're referencing, or most
concerned about, Josh.
And, again, this is part of a $9.3 billion reserve position that we have and there are things
that move around from time to time. I think what our first order of business is to ensure
that $9.3 billion overall is adequate and obviously we feel it is adequate, and it developed
off positively as I mentioned in the year. The reserve development as it relates to
insurance and, quite frankly, in US reinsurance is all from discontinued business,
discontinued program business. We re-examine that book of business each and every
year and that reserve study indicated a higher number. I'm not sure that -- at least I hope
that helps as a start.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

If we take that -- were there attritional reserve benefits that were offsetting run-off
reserve deficiencies?

A - Dominic Addesso

Are you talking current year? Prior year?

FINAL

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

I'm talking about current year, let's just take insurance, $30 million in net reserve
deficiencies, were the prior year run-off businesses actually more deficient than that,
offset by some attritional reserve releases, or were there reserves for ongoing
operations dead-on and that's merely sort of a deficiency to cover some losses that
emerged?

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I'll try again. I'm not sure I understood that question. The process, whether it's around
insurance or reinsurance, we do our year-end reserve study. By the way, I should add that
we continue to make improvements in our process there, but one notable improvement
is that we are now doing our reserve studies with more current data. We've improved our
system to the point where we can -- our reserve studies are either on a quarter or sixmonth lag to the valuation date.
So that's very helpful in terms of assessing your overall reserve position. But when we do
our reserve study it's around both current and prior year. It causes you to reflect changes
to the current year pick as well as to the prior year pick. And there were changes to our
current year pick in both insurance and the reinsurance lines, and I'm not sure if that's
answering your question, but that is something that occurred in the Fourth Quarter and
which is really what Brian was getting at earlier, which is why the Fourth Quarter current
year attritional number was higher than the other quarters, was to basically bring the year
in line to what we felt that accident year should be.
Now, naturally, there are lines of business in both -- or segments of our business in both
current year, in both the attritional and in both insurance and reinsurance, where there are
pluses and minuses to that current year pick and the same thing would be true to our
prior year loss picture. There are pluses and minuses relative to each of these portfolios.
We have approximately 200 different reserve buckets that we examine to determine our
reserve adequacy and naturally you're going to find that when you start looking at things
at that level of detail, that there's going to be pluses and minuses and that you have the
benefit of the overall portfolio to help smooth out those answers. And clearly, that's what
did happen this year which then resulted in a positive development of $15 million.

A - Joseph Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

I'll just add to that. As Dom noted, you have different buckets. When you put it all together
it did kind of even itself out. Whatever adjustments you make, you end up making them in
the Fourth Quarter so it certainly gives you a lumpiness in the Fourth Quarter. It's better off
if you look at the year.
But as part of that study, as Dom noted, and as we kind of replied to Brian, when it did
come to making a selection for 2010 we decided to essentially make a selection higher
than what we had been selecting for the first nine months of the year. Once again, that
Page 10 of 13



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2011-02-10

gives you some lumpiness in that bucket as well. But when you put it all together, on a
Company-wide basis, all it did was reconfirm the estimates that we started with at the
end of 2009. And give us numbers for 2010 that we feel good about.

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

FINAL

And with an attritional current year combined ratio of 88.7.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

That's helpful. And additionally, if we can review the type of reserves that are housed in
the Bermuda segment as opposed to those in international and US. I realize it's probably
a very generalizing type of question but maybe we can clarify that a little bit?

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

The positive development we had in Bermuda related to older accident years. It's mostly
excess casualty, 2007 and prior. And some of it goes back to 2001, 2002, 2006 was
actually the largest year of benefit and it's excess casualty. It takes a while to develop and
before we feel comfortable as to how those years are going to end up. And our detailed
valuation this year revealed that those years were running off very, very well.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And that's continuing operations for the most part?

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Correct.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, very much.

Operator
We'll take our next question from Vinay Misquith with Credit Suisse.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Just a clarification on the Bermuda segment, the attritional loss ratio
once again ticked up this quarter versus prior quarters. Was wondering whether there was
some prior period adverse developments, prior quarter adverse developments there,
and a little bit surprised because you had favorable prior year development yet the
attritional ticked up this quarter.

A - Dominic Addesso

Vinay, I didn't necessarily understand the second part of your question, but as it relates to
the current year, with respect to Bermuda, as Joe indicated earlier, as well as myself, the
current year just reflects a level of conservatism that we've built into the book. There's

really no difference in particular in the operation. Certainly, it's reflective of all the reserve
study work that we do, but also just a conservative pick as we're in this phase of the cycle.

Was it some prior quarter development in this quarter?

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, I don't like to think of what's happening in the current year as prior development, if in
fact we're just truing up the current year accident ratio. I'm not sure I would characterize it
that way, but certainly to the extent that the Fourth Quarter is higher than the previous
quarters, then, yes, there's a little bit of -- certainly you could suggest that it's catch-up
relative to the other quarters. But it's just getting that accident year in line with what we
think the full year should be.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Fair enough. And the second question was on the reserves. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I
think you said that now you'll be reviewing it every three or six months versus, I think,
normally you have a full in-depth review once a year?

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

No, no, Vinay, that's not what I was saying. What I was saying is that previously when we
did our reserve reviews, for example, if we did our reserve review in the Fourth Quarter
we were working with data with respect to those reserve buckets that was from the
previous year-end. Now, depending on the line of business, it could be data that's as of
more current, meaning it's losses up through June of that year and/or September of that
year.
So what I'm getting at is the quality of the data that we're using relative to evaluating our
reserves is better because it's more current. It's not that we're undertaking reserve
studies, full reserve studies more than once a year. We do, however, review our reserves
through other methods during each of the quarters during the year.
