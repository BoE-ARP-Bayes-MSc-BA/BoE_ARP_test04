Presentation
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I welcome you to today's Hannover Re international
conference call on the Q3 2020 results. For your information, this conference is being
recorded.
At this time, I would like to hand you over to our host today, Mr.Jean-Jacques Henchoz,
Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.

Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. Let me welcome you to this
conference call presenting our results for the first nine months of the year. As usual, I'll
start with an overview before our new Group CFO, Clemens Jungsthofel goes through
the financials in detail. And I will then comment on the outlook for the year later on. For the
Q&A, I'm additionally joined by my board colleagues, Klaus Miller, on the life side; and
Sven Althoff for P&C.
Looking at the results for the first nine months. The Hannover Re Group has again proven
its resilience, bearing in mind that we have absorbed a total pre-tax impact of around
EUR860 million from COVID-19 in our P&C and Life & Health business segment, the group
net income of EUR668 million and the return on equity of 8.3% are quite satisfactory.

FINAL

Additionally, the Solvency II ratio of 222% remains comfortably above our 200% threshold.
And with double-digit premium growth our new business production is fully intact in an
improving market environment. Overall, there is of course still an element of uncertainty
around the COVID-19 loss experience going forward. However, due to the provisions
made for expected COVID-19 related losses, we're now in a position to provide guidance
for the year-end results. As things currently stand, Hannover Re anticipates a group net
income of more than EUR800 million for the full year 2020.
Going into the details of the results of our P&C reinsurance business. The additional
EUR100 million related to COVID-19 claims in the third quarter are significantly lower than
what we booked in Q1 and Q2, bringing the total loss estimate to EUR700 million. The
major part 71% of the EUR700 million are still IBNR reserves. And the affected lines of
business are also largely the same as before, namely business interruption, credit and
surety and event cancellations.
Additionally, we have reserved for expected losses in some other lines as for instance
D&O. The COVID-19 losses, together with a NatCat and man-made large losses where
we observed increased activity in the third quarter, exceeded our budget for the first nine
months by EUR400 million, bringing the year-to-date combined ratio to 101.4%.

Bloomberg Transcript

In life and health reinsurance, the COVID-19 impact on the result was EUR160 million. The
main driver here is our US business. Against this backdrop, the EBIT of EUR315 million is
strong, also stripping out a positive one-off effect of EUR55 million within the investment
income. Financial solutions continues to perform superbly. And the US mortality
experience excluding the COVID-19 effect was in line with our expectations.
Finally, at 2.8% or 2.7% adjusted for the one-off effect in life and health, the return on
investment is satisfactory and in line with our initial and now reconfirmed new target for
2020. The profitable premium growth in the first nine months is the main reason for the
very positive operating cash flow of EUR2.6 billion in the first three quarters of 2020,
which is already higher than full year figures for the previous year.
The strong cash flow in turn is fueling the growth in assets under management shown on
the right side of the slide, which is particularly important in the current low yield
environment, because the growing asset base is helping us to mitigate the impact from
low reinvestment yields.
Looking at the details of the invested assets. The positive change in valuation reserves
only partly offset the negative effects from currency translation resulting from the
devaluation of the U.S. dollar. Altogether, assets under own management stood at about
EUR49 billion at the end of the third quarter.
Looking at our capital position. Shareholders' equity increased by 2.8%. As you can see,
the net income for the first nine months was sufficient to fully cover the dividend payment
in Q2, which is even more pleasing, bearing in mind that the group absorbed a negative
net COVID-19 impact of EUR860 million.

Within the OCI, the positive impact from the decrease in interest rates is more than
compensating for negative effects from currency translation. On the left side of the slide,
you can see that the capital composition is more or less unchanged. You might remember
that we issued EUR500 million in hybrid capital in July. However, we also had a EUR500
million hybrid bonds with the first call date in September. And as we exercise the call
option as planned, there is no visible effect on the total hybrid position. By the way, the
same is also true of our Solvency II balance sheet, which means that we have also
maintained a high degree of flexibility around our hybrid capacity.
On that note, I would like to hand over to Clemens, our CFO who will explain the figures
in more detail.

Clemens Jungsthof el

{BIO 20496428 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, and thank you, Jean-Jacques. It's a pleasure for me to present the
financials of the Hannover Re Group for the first time. So moving directly on to the
segmental reporting.

Bloomberg Transcript

I will start with the development of our property and casualty business group on Slide 7.
Gross written premium grew by 16% adjusted for currency effects. The growth is highly
diversified, which is pleasing with particularly strong contributions from North America and
the APAC region. Overall the development was driven more by property than casualty
business.
Looking at the large loss situation for Hannover Re. The loss activity from natural
catastrophes and man-made losses has clearly increased significantly compared to the
first half year, almost exhausting the Q3 standalone budget of EUR336 million. On the
other hand, the additional net impact from COVID-19 at EUR100 million was materially
below the numbers we saw in Q1 or Q2. Overall, 71% of the estimated EUR700 million of
total impact still consist of IBNR reserves.
As Jean-Jacques explained, there remains of course an elevated level of uncertainty
around the further loss experience. However, the high level of IBNR also provides
significant headroom for actual claims to be reported and we do feel comfortable with
our reserving position as of today.
As a result of the reserving for COVID-19-related claims expectations, the large loss
budget for the first nine months of 2020 was exceeded by EUR400 million, accounting
for roughly 3.8 combined ratio points. Adjusting the reported combined ratio of 101.4 for
this budget over run, the figure would have been close to our 97% target for 2020.
In terms of the runoff of our reserves, it's fair to say that in the nine-months 2020, our
runoff result was positive and overall in line with our expectation. Altogether, I would
guess the confidence level should not have changed materially since year-end 2019. But I
would at least not assume that we added anything to our reserve buffer.

FINAL

On the investment side, net investment income decreased by around EUR100 million with
lower contributions mainly from private equity, from real estate and from our inflationlinked bonds within the ordinary return. Compared to the second quarter, impairments
were modest in the third quarter and on a nine-month basis offset by an increase in
realized gains. Other income and expenses were positive by EUR67 million mainly driven
by positive currency effects. Altogether, the EBIT margin decreased to 5.6%, mainly due
to the weaker underwriting result.
On Slide 8, total net large losses including COVID-19-related claims accounted for
EUR1.149 million in the first nine months of 2020, exceeding the budget of EUR749 million
by EUR400 million. Compared to the first half year, the difference between the gross and
net loss, as you can see on the slide has increased. This is because the high NatCat
activity in Q3 triggered our retro program. And additionally, a part of our COVID losses
are covered by our retro as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

Overall, the EUR1.14 billion net loss already exceeds our full year budget by EUR175 million.
This means that 2020 will be the fourth consecutive year with large losses above the
expectation, which of course is not only true for Hannover Re, but it also applies to the
industry as a whole. And that should trigger even more positive pricing moments going
forward.
On Slide 9, you can see our large loss list. It reflects the increased loss activity as
mentioned earlier in the third quarter. Largest loss on the NatCat side, as you can see
here, what's the so-called (the record) storm event in the US, followed by Hurricane Laura.
On the man-made side, the port explosion in Beirut accounted for EUR67 million on a net
basis. Due to the very benign first half year, total large losses would still have been below
budget excluding COVID-19. Looking at the numbers for COVID-19. In Q3, the gross loss
increased by EUR264 million to EUR873 million.
In comparison, the net development of EUR100 million was significantly lower. The reason
for this is that we receive more and more information from our clients enabling us to
allocate IBNR reserves to individual treaties. And we also take into consideration, of
course, our retrocession protection. This was not possible with the IBNR booked in the
first half year.
You will remember that where we had reported a gros loss very close to the net, even
though the underlying assumption for the gross loss was already higher. In the event of
further increases in the gross position, it's fair to say in the fourth quarter, we can at least
partly expect corresponding relief from our retrocessions, which will then limit the impact
of course on our net position.
On Slide 10, that shows the profitability of our P&C portfolio by line of business. Overall,
COVID-19 affected several regions and lines of business, as you can see here. But Europe
and credit and surety were the most severely impacted ones. The weaker technical
profitability in the Americas was mainly the result of the mentioned weather-related U.S.
losses in the third quarter. Agricultural business was mainly affected by the Bushfires in
Australia and some COVID effects.

FINAL

On the positive side, the technical profitability of our facultative business as well as our
aviation and marine business was very favorable. Altogether, combined ratio was at 101.4.
On Slide 12, looking at the development of our life and health business group. Growth was
mainly driven by a large financing treaty. You will remember that probably from last year
from earlier calls that we wrote in Q4 2019 in Australia. However, this was partly mitigated
by the expected reduction in premium volume due to the effect of recaptures in our U.S.
mortality portfolio, as a result of our management actions in the previous year.
Altogether, gross written premium in life and health increased by 5% adjusted for
currency effects. The impact from COVID-19 was EUR160 million in the first nine months,
of which 43% is booked as IBNR. The main driver was our US mortality book. But other
areas, like for example our Australian disability business are also affected.
Overall, we are still seeing significant differences between population mortality and the
effect on our portfolio, largely due to socioeconomic factors and a age structure. Apart
from COVID-19, the result of our life and health business group was quite favorable. The
legacy US mortality portfolio performed in line with our expectation. And the earnings
contribution from our financial solutions business in particular, continued to be excellent.

Bloomberg Transcript

On top of this, we recorded an extraordinary gain of EUR55 million from an equity
participation as part of our investment income. Adjusting for both the EUR160 million
COVID-19 impact and this positive one-off, the EBIT would have been very favorable at
around EUR420 million.
Looking at the individual third quarter. The normalized EBIT on the life and health side
would have been EUR143 million. The net investment income decreased mainly due to the
EUR100 million positive one-off effect recorded in 2019. You will remember that which was
only partly offset by the one-off effect in this year. Otherwise, the ordinary income was
favorably supported by an overall positive contribution from the change in fair value
through P&L, even though the impact from our ModCo derivative was negative by EUR9
million.
Other income and expenses primarily driven by further increase in the contributions from
our deposit accounted financial solutions business. Currency effects were slightly
negative. At 5.3%, the tax ratio is low, mainly due to good results from subsidiaries in
jurisdictions with a low tax rate and the tax reduced investment gains from the
aforementioned participation. In the third quarter standalone, we have seen the same
effects and in combination with losses at individual subsidiaries. The tax rate was even
negative.
On Slide 13, sort of as an additional information beyond the IFRS numbers. This slide
shows an overview of the new business written in the third quarter 2020 as well as
upcoming business opportunity on the life and health side. Both the new business and the
pipeline business are rather diversified by region and reporting category, but particularly
our financial solution business is an area where we continue to see very healthy demand.

FINAL

Just for the sake of completeness, since we've focused only on the most important deals
here in this overview. This, of course, does not mean that we don't see any opportunities
in markets or regions, not mentioned on this slide. Altogether, the value of new business
achieved in the first nine months already comfortably surpasses our full year target of at
least EUR220 million.
So moving on to our investments on Slide 15. I think it's pleasing to see that despite the
very challenging market environment on the capital markets, the return on investments of
2.8%, including ModCo and excluding ModCo actually, it's -- so the aforementioned
amount doesn't really contribute to that number. So 2.8% return on investment is still in
line with our initial full year target, even excluding the EUR55 million positive one-off effect
in life and health that I mentioned earlier, the ROI would still have been 2.7%.

Bloomberg Transcript

The decrease in ordinary investment income is driven on the one hand by lower
contribution from our inflation-linked bond portfolio. You know that we purchased that to
hedge our inflation risk. And there is some balancing effect, of course, on the underwriting
side as well. On the other hand, by the returns from private equity, which were also
weaker compared to our expectation in a normal market environment and compared to
the very high contributions in the last -- particularly the last two years.
Realized gains are on a similar level to last year, where we have benefited from the
restructuring of our participation in Viridium. This year, realizations are mainly coming from
our fixed income portfolio. And impairments and depreciations were higher than last year,
mainly due to the impairments for alternative investments in the second quarter.
Impairments recognized in the third quarter were fair to say very moderate. Unrealized
gains increased remarkably to EUR3.2 billion, driven by significantly lower interest rates
and further normalization of credit spreads due to the recovery of corporate bond
markets.
On the next slide, Slide 16, you can see that we have actually not changed too much in our
asset allocation. I think the slide is quite familiar to most of you. So we have not changed
the asset allocation and we do not intend to do so. You might remember, even before
the crisis started, we had begun to sort of scale back some of the proportion of bonds
attributable to our US SME portfolio. And we have used the price correction in the stock
market in March to carefully reenter the listed equities, buying around EUR250 million.
As mentioned in earlier quarterly results calls, we have been following a passive derisking
approach with new money being invested in high quality assets only. However, in the
meantime, this has come to an end. And we do carefully start back to normalize our credit
risk taking. Contribution, as you can see here, on the ordinary investment income is
diversified as usual, this time with a slightly lower share from private equity.
So this conclude my remarks. And I hand back to you Jean-Jacques.

FINAL

Thank you very much, Clemens. Let me now cover the outlook section on Slide 18. And
first, our updated guidance for 2020. Based on our assessment of the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic, we feel comfortable enough to provide guidance on our financial
results again, and expect group net income of more than EUR800 million for 2020.
You might ask why the Q4 performance needed to achieve. The EUR800 million looks
modest. But as you already heard, some negative effects are to be expected in life and
health as in previous quarters. And additionally, the investment return in our assumptions
is slightly lower than the 2.8% for the first nine months. For the full year, it should still be
around 2.7%.
Gross written premium for the group is expected to show high single-digit percentage
growth at constant exchange rates. Finally, we expect to pay an ordinary dividend of EUR4
per share for the year 2020, in line with the previous year. The payout of a special
dividend will be partially dependent on the growth opportunities that actually materialize
in the upcoming P&C renewals in January and the amount of capital tied up by this growth.

Bloomberg Transcript

Based on increasing demand for reinsurance and improving market conditions, it is
pleasing to see that many lines of business are growing. Even more importantly, we also
expect these trends to continue in the next renewal seasons for 2021. The profitability
outlook for the full year 2020 is more or less in line with the combined ratio overview
Clemens showed earlier, largely reflecting the COVID-19 impact.
In life and health, we can similarly see which lines of business are affected by the
pandemic, namely mortality and morbidity. On the positive side, as already stated, our
currently most important profit driver financial solutions continues to perform very well.
And the profitability of our longevity business is also strong.
Even if hardening market cycles are generally not a theme in life and health reinsurance,
we have seen earlier that our new business production is fully impact -- fully intact, sorry,
and that the pipeline looks quite healthy. Demand in financial solutions continues to be
favorable and is also visible this time in our premium development, due in particular to a
large financing deal in Australia. Additionally, we see promising growth potential in the
Asian market. And the growth of our mortality business is impacted by the effect of
recaptures in our U.S. mortality portfolio.
As usual, we also provide a first look at our expectations for the next financial year
together with the publication of our Q3 numbers, even though the market environment is
currently more dynamic than usual.
Gross written premium is expected to grow by around 5%. And you might be surprised
that the number is not higher in light of a hardening P&C market. But firstly, we didn't want
to put too much pressure on our underwriters by giving a higher volume target. As usual,
the focus is on the bottom line contribution. And secondly, I would point to the potential
negative impact the economic downturn might have on the primary insurance market and
indirectly also possibly on proportional reinsurance business.

FINAL

Of course, it's early days and we will review this target after the one-one renewals when
we have more transparency on their outcome. The return on investment is impacted by
the lower reinvestment yields. And additionally, we expect some lower contributions from
inflation-linked bonds with the resulting decline to 2.4% in the next year. Regarding the
inflation-linked bonds, please bear in mind that we buy those to hedge the inflation risk of
our P&C reserves. And therefore economically, there is an offset in our liabilities.
On the positive side, assets under management are expected to grow further due to the
positive cash flow helping to mitigate the impact on the absolute investment income.
Altogether, we anticipate group net income in the range of EUR1.15 billion to EUR1.25
billion, and therefore, on a similar level to the initial expectation for this year.
Looking at the components of this guidance. The contribution from our P&C business
should improve compared to our assumptions for the last year, whereas the investment
return is slightly under pressure in the low yield environment. The development of life and
health is expected to be more stable. In general, there is, of course, a higher degree of
uncertainty than usual. And various factors such as the availability of COVID-19 vaccines will
have an influence on the further course of the pandemic.

Bloomberg Transcript

Therefore our guidance is subject to the premise that we do not see a significant COVID19 impact on our life and health business, and as usual, that major loss expenditure
remains within the budgeted level and that there are no unforeseen distortions on capital
markets. The large loss budget for the next year will be increased to EUR1.1 billion, largely
driven by the growth of our business.
Finally, we will continue to adhere to our general dividend policy going forward, with a
payout ratio of 35% to 45% for the ordinary dividend and the addition of a special
dividend, if our performance is in line with expectations and the capitalization of the
company remains comfortable.
This concludes our remarks, and we would be happy to answer your questions. Thank you.

Questions And Answers

(Question And Answer)
We will now begin our question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first
question is from Emanuele Musio, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now
open.

Q - Emanuele Musio

{BIO 19781440 <GO>}

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Actually, I have two questions. Looking at
your guidance for 2021, I am quite surprised that you are aiming at earnings in line with
2019, basically. However, since then, the rate have gradually improved. The momentum
Page 8 of 20



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2020-11-04

FINAL

will start quite strongly in 2020, partly as a consequence of lower investment returns that
you mentioned already, right? And so, was just curious to know a bit more about your
assumption for 2021 maybe in terms of COVID-19 and loss expectation? Or maybe you
are implying that rate improvements are still not enough? Or maybe you are just setting
the bar low in view of uncertainties and maybe the idea is to gradually raise the bar as
clarity emerge? Any comment of this would be much appreciated.
And the second one is still on objectives. I mean it is, I think broadly shared view that 2021
will see further pricing improvements, although the improvement will learn through full in
2022. So as far as gross written premium growth in 2021 is concerned, you aim at just 5%.
So I struggle to understand because it might be argued that lower top-line growth in a
hardening market should go to the benefit of profitability, but this is not reflected in your
net income guidance.
So what is the missing link here? You said, you don't want to put pressure on underwriters,
but arguably rates have gone up by more than 5%. So even if you renew your existing
book at better rates, shouldn't you see more than that, more than 5%? I mean, what is
the average rate improvement across your book to-date? So if you can please help me
understand a little bit more about these two elements.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you very much. So maybe just a couple of general comments, and I'll pass on to my
colleagues just to go into the specifics.
I think we're faced with a situation, which of course, is rather uncertain. And it's much
harder this year to anticipate the development in '21. So the range is a little bit -- the
range of outcome is a bit wider. But nevertheless, we felt sufficiently confident to affirm
range in terms of net income and growth. I think in terms of growth, the biggest challenge
we're facing is the uncertainty on the economic outlook. So this is very hard to quantify.
And we felt this would of course have a bearing on the eventual growth outlook therefore
5%, which might come a bit more modest than anticipated.
So maybe both P&C and life and health, I'll ask Sven to start with P&C with the
assumptions, expectations for '21 and then Klaus on the life and health outlook.

A - Sven Althoff

{BIO 19104724 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Jean-Jacques.
When it comes to the profitability, our expectation is that we will have substantial rate
increases at set to 1:1 and later renewals. But as I already explained during our Investors
Day, this will not directly translate 1:1 into an improved combined ratio. It will to some
degree, but the features, which will eat part of the rate increase, which will be achieved as
our view on risk. That has naturally changed, where we had losses and where those model
-- losses go into our models. And therefore, our view on risk for some classes of risk lines
of business have increased, requiring part of the rate increases we will achieve.

Page 9 of 20

Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity

FINAL

And secondly, as you know, we are buying significant amount of retrocessional coverage.
Whilst we are confident that we will achieve pricing, which is risk-adjusted similar to the
pricing we have in 2020, the underlying business has grown as you can see looking at our
Q3 premium figures. So therefore the premium for those covers will increase in line with
exposure growth also eating part of our gross rate increases that we are going to
achieve.
On the growth side, in addition to what Jean-Jacques has already explained, I can offer
two additional comments. One is that rate increases does not necessarily always translate
into premium increases. There are lines of business, which are driven by turnover or other
classes of business, which have a link to the underlying pricing of, for example, the
commodity. And in a situation of a severe economic downturn, therefore the underlying
premium or exposure basis is somewhat erod. D and therefore rate increases do not
necessarily mean premium increases on a one-to-one basis. And secondly, you know that
the business is not only re-rated at the reinsurance level, but also at the insurance level.
So therefore, for certain covers, the confidence of our ceding companies will be
increased so they may retain a little more of the business net.
And secondly, the re-rating of the reinsurance may lead to restructuring of programs also
meaning that ceding companies may take higher net positions at the more frequency part
of their programs. So that would be my explanations on the P&C side.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Klaus Miller

{BIO 16886879 <GO>}

Okay. On the life side, we basically have to look at the U.S. and the performance there.
The claims Jean-Jacques mentioned the EUR160 million are more than two-thirds from
the U.S. And I would expect that to be the case also next year. All the other countries do
not contribute significantly to any COVID claims so far. And in the U.S., we have certainly
an expectation that for Q1, Q2 in 2021, we will still see losses of the same magnitude as
we have seen in the last two quarters. This might and probably will be compensated to a
large extent by new business. We see a huge demand on financial solutions side.
And if you look at the Page 13 of the presentation, where you see the value of new
business and you just do a simple calculation, you probably have to use your ruler to
figure out the value of your business, because we didn't put the number on the page. But
it's about EUR 380 million. And if you deduct the EUR 160 million COVID claims, then you
end up exactly with the planned value of new business. So on the lifestyle, it looks like we
are fulfilling our plans completely and this should continue and might be evne more
favorable in 2021. But we will definitely see COVID claims. It all depends on the fact when
the U.S. starts managing the pandemic.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Maybe just one last piece of information on '21. Overall, we have the 5% growth. This is a
bit of a mixed bag. The P&C growth is expected to be beyond that while life and health
will be slightly below in the short term. So this shows a little bit of differentiation with the
hardening market reflected in the numbers and the importance of financial solutions in life
and health, which doesn't have such a strong impact on top line.

Our next question is from Kamran Hossain, RBC. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is now
open.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, everyone. First question is based on the dividend, how to think about
that? I guess the regular parts of the dividend is very clear. So a discussion there. But what
are the key trigger points to think about on capital position versus the special cost of the
dividend or one that you have paid in recent years. Is this S&P capital-linked? Or was there
some other trigger? And if you were to hit your plan that you have at the moment for the
renewals, given it sounds like you're being relatively conservative on kind of what you're
assuming there. Does that mean you've got enough capital to pay that special part of the
dividend or not? And the second question is looking at next year, your cat budget's
increased, I think, 13% year-on-year well ahead of the premium growth you're suggesting.
Is this mix change at some assumption change or bits of both? Any thoughts on that
would be helpful. Thank you.

Thank you. Clemens will respond on the dividend and capital management and Sven on
that net cat.

A - Clemens Jungsthof el

{BIO 20496428 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. Well, Kamran, on the dividend. Well, you can see that in our Solvency II
number, which is very stable at 222% as of Q3. So in all regimes and of course as you
rightly mentioned, we do have the rating agency models, et cetera. We've always had
good buffers both -- in both regimes, I would say. And we do, at the moment still have
sufficient water under the keel in terms of our capitalization.
However, I think it's fair to say that -- and you've seen that in 2020, our business has
grown at a stronger pace than our capital in all regimes. And if the opportunities appear
as we do expect them, particularly on the P&C side, they will absorb further capital. And
we really -- that's why we put it slightly cautious like that on the special dividend side. I
mean we really want to be in the best possible position to take full advantage of the
improving market conditions. So we really do not want to limit attractive growth
opportunities by any capital needs. So we will have a probably better position at the end
of the year, our Q4 position. But that's the reason why we have been careful in wording
our guidance in terms of the special dividend really to be able to make a better call, when
we see the Q4 numbers and when we are through the renewals particularly on the P&C
side.

As regard to your question on the major loss budget, could you please repeat your
question? I didn't fully understand parts of your question.

FINAL

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Yes. Sure. The -- I guess, the large loss budget seems to have grown -- or for next year
seems to have grown 13%. You're implying 13 -- sorry, 13% versus 5% premium growth. So
I was just trying to understand is this a mix change in business? Or are you rising kind of
more cat business? Or is this an assumption change given the last four years have been
running ahead of budget, I guess, not just for you, but for the industry as well?

A - Klaus Miller

{BIO 16886879 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. The answer to that question is that it's a mix between our
over achievement in 2020. As you know, when we started the year, we didn't expect a
double-digit premium growth on the P&C side. And of course the EUR975 million, we had
written down in 2019 already. So therefore, a part of the adjustment is growth related in
2020. And the second part, of course, is then growth related as an expectation into 2021.

Bloomberg Transcript

When it comes to mix of business, we are not expecting any fundamental changes as far
as the mix of business is concerned. But what can be said is that we have made a little
more room in our internal model for writing natural catastrophe-exposed business given
the re-rating we are expecting. So we have adjusted our risk appetite from somewhere in
the 16% range to 18% of economic capital according to Solvency II. So there is a little
higher risk appetite, but not substantially.

Our next question is from Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca. Please go ahead sir. Your line is
now open.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

So the question -- the first one is on the gross loss on COVID in third quarter of EUR264
million. I just wanted to better understand is the allocation to the IBNRs and is the
allocation to the individual treaties, is that something that is just the mechanical
procedure? Or is that being actively driven in other words? And also is this gross-to-net

already in 3Q a bit faster than we expected -- or you expected? And just some
commentary on that would be interesting.
And second thing is just on the life mortality, the recent headline figures in the U.S. Is the
population and the portfolio, the difference -- I think in an earlier call, Klaus, you might
have mentioned, 20% population and 5% for Hannover's own book. Is the recent -- more
recent trend still in line with the earlier kind of relationship? Or is it that there is a bit of
more divergence between the population and what you would expect from Hannover Re
portfolio. And I'm more referring to even a qualitative comment from the more recent
data, not just 3Q, please. Thank you very much.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Thank you. So the gross-to-net situation COVID will be answered by Sven and U.S.
mortality by Klaus.

A - Sven Althoff

{BIO 19104724 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. For the P&C COVID side, we had seen more loss reserves advised by our ceding
companies in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. The IBNR setting is not a
mechanical exercise. It's to a large degree a management decision. But as Jean-Jacques
mentioned, we have kept the overall level of IBNR at 71%, still relatively close to the 80%
we were showing in the second quarter. So it was important for us given the ongoing
uncertainty to keep the IBNR level at a relatively similar level compared to the second
quarter.
Given that we have a little more clarity, talking to our ceding companies from where we
can expect those losses, it was easier for us in the third quarter to book some of the IBNR
against individual contracts. And to the extent we have done that certain retention levels
are satisfied on the retrocessional side. That piece of the equation is more mechanical
than at that stage. And the same goes for our K-securitization. Once a business qualifies
for session under K, we have a full follow fortunes principle. And therefore to the extent
we are booking -- specific IBNRs on those contracts, this would filter through to our K
transaction. And lastly in Q3, we have started to already -- to also see a lot advisers under
our ILS fronting activities. And they are, of course, directly channeled to the investor base
for which we are doing the fronting.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

And so even for the fourth quarter, you still think you're still very comfortable with the
situation on COVID P&C, Sven?

A - Sven Althoff

{BIO 19104724 <GO>}

We are comfortable. I wouldn't say very. I mean, the pandemic is ongoing. We have the
second wave of partial lockdown mechanisms. You and I, we have both no idea whether
that's a November topic or whether this will lead well into 2021. So from that point of view,
we feel that we are well reserved, that we have good cushions on the IBNR side. But
there's still significant uncertainty as far as the extent and the duration of the lockdown is
concerned, and the economic consequences coming with that.

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

Yes.

A - Klaus Miller

{BIO 16886879 <GO>}

Yes. On the life side, I might have to disappoint you. My former answers are still valid. We
don't have much new information. The second and third quarters of the U.S. Population
mortality has been as you mentioned, at 20% higher than expected. About 70% of that is
explained by the COVID claims directly. That means that's the death certificate same
COVID. The rest is first of all variations in the classification of COVID claims at the state
level. Reporting is not that great. Then also significant impact might come from fewer
people seeking medical treatment for serious medical issues because of a fear of COVID,
so they don't go to the hospital. And there is also very likely we would call it deaths of
despair like suicide, opioids, things like that. This translates into a portfolio death rate of
perhaps less than 5% because of the age distribution. The average age of COVID deaths,
I guess in the U.S. and this is the market we track closely, because most of our claims
come from there, is the age is still about 68. It's significantly higher in other countries like,
Germany. We have 80 to 82 and basically no claims in our portfolio. In the U.S., you have
permanent business. In the UK, you have a little bit of what you call all of life business. But
this is relatively negligible for our portfolio at least in the UK.
Then the claims we see are significantly lower than the average plan, what we have. We
have only seen eight claims above $1 million so far. And that is significantly lower than we
would usually expect. So this explains the big difference, but it all depends on the age
distribution in your portfolio. And as you might remember, we have been able to get rid of
a lot of this in the last two years by recaptured. I hope that answers your question, but I'm
sure you will ask it again in three months' time. And then I might have another answer.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

Right. We'll look forward to that. Thank you very much.

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, everyone. I've got two questions. The first one would be related to
the special dividend again. Sorry about that. Understand your remark regarding still a

FINAL

question mark on how strong the one-one renewals could be. But if I remember well, you
issued a EUR500 million subordinated bond in Q2, if I'm right. And that was not for, I
would say, clear refinancing purposes. I see that at that time, you indicated that you raised
a bond in order to have some additional flexibility if business opportunities were stronger
than expected. So could you maybe rephrase your special divi comment, taking into
consideration the EUR500 million hybrid bond?
And my second question will be related to COVID-19 additional reserves, you booked in
Q3 on credit and surety and also in the other lines. That's where obviously the increase
has been. But clearly we have not seen yet any substantive news flows on these two lines.
So maybe you could shed some light on what has driven the increase in those two lines in
terms of additional reserves? Thank you.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Clemens, special dividend first.

A - Clemens Jungsthof el

{BIO 20496428 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Thomas, happy to clarify to add some information to the hybrid situation and the
special dividend. In general, yes, it's -- you're perfectly right. We did raise a hybrid bond in
the second quarter. However, and I probably have not been so clear on that earlier. I
apologize. So I think we -- that was only, one, to refinance the early call bond that we
called in the third quarter. So that was actually a refinancing act, which we always knew
that wouldn't really add capital to our position.
As you know, yes, there is headroom for further financing activities. Of course, we will look
into that. But again, that's the reason why we've been cautious in terms of the special
dividend. And of course, please bear in mind that when you look at our guidance for
2020, the more than EUR800 million already translate to roughly 60% payout ratio for the
basis dividend, of course. So that's something that we kept in mind as well. But again, we
will revisit that position earlier in 2021.
I hope, Thomas, that answers the question to some extent on the hybrid front.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes, thank you.

A - Sven Althoff

{BIO 19104724 <GO>}

When it comes to the COVID losses, let me start with the credit side. Yes, you're right. We
have a relatively little news as far as individual insolvencies is concerned. Here, the various
state stimulus programs for the economy are doing their job. So we have strong stimulus
packages. We have rules in place, lifting the requirements for declaring insolvencies. So
therefore this problem not gone away, but it's pushed us into the future. Let me put it this
way. So from a pure accident year point of view, there would be very little need to do any
reserving on the credit and surety as regards COVID this year. So you have to see the
EUR180 million we have booked here as a precaution for future insolvencies, which most
Page 15 of 20

FINAL

likely will not happen 2020, but in later years. The exact timing, of course, is unknown. The
reason for the increase from Q2 to Q3 has to be understood in the context that of
course, we have earned additional premium in the third quarter. So therefore, we have
booked some additional IBNRs on that additionally earned premium adding to the
precaution we had taken in Q2.
When it comes to business interruption, we have more advances from our ceding
companies from a variety of regions. I guess the best publicized situation in the last
couple of weeks has been the UK with the FCA test case and the outcome of first ruling.
Ceding companies, of course, have translated that ruling into losses as far as their
portfolio is concerned have advised those losses to us. And we have booked them
accordingly. And as I've mentioned before, we have taken this as, yes, a requirement to
proportionately build additional IBNRs on top of that in order to stay at a comfortable level
when it comes to actually advice claims to IBNRs and the overall reserve situation.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

So thank you. Maybe one word, if you could on the other lines, so maybe the financials
and D&O lines where things have increased as well?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Sven Althoff

{BIO 19104724 <GO>}

Yes. There was a relatively proportionate increase in all lines of business. If you look at Q2
where we had booked EUR600 million and Q3 the EUR873 million, which we have booked
on a gross basis, we have added to our Q2 results in all those lines of business. But
depending on the news we received from the ceding companies to a varying extent, the
largest increase we have certainly shown is on the property business interruption side. But
there were also additional ins against lines of business like D&O.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Sven.

Operator
Our next question is from Paris Hadjiantonis, Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Your
line is now open.

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

Yes. Hi from my side as well. I hope everybody's doing well. The first question will be on
Solvency II. And what is assumed currently in terms of COVID-19 losses going forward? I
think Klaus implied earlier that some low triple digit million for higher mortality claims from
the U.S. is already assumed, but can you please give us an idea both on Life Re and I don't
know whether there's anything on the P&C side as well?
I mean relating to that question, since you are assuming some losses from mortality and
looking at your guidance for 2021. I know you're trying to provide a normalized basis. But

Page 16 of 20



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2020-11-04

can you be a bit more clear on whether or not these assumed losses on Life Re are
already included in the guidance you have given for 2021?

FINAL

And then a small one, again on the Life Re side. Looking at your appendix, Slide 23, about
one-third of the life and health losses are coming from non-mortality, so morbidity and
other. Can you just give us some light on what exactly is driving this morbidity and other
losses? Thank you.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Thank you. So Clemens will comment on what's baked into the Solvency II numbers, and
then Klaus will take the other questions then.

A - Clemens Jungsthof el

{BIO 20496428 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Paris, exactly as you assume, there's a different picture on P&C and life and health
both under IFRS and Solvency II regime under P&C, I think, it's fair to say what we show in
our IFRS numbers is reflected in our Solvency II numbers already. So that really translates
sort of into each other. On the life and health side, I would probably make some general
remarks and then hand over to Klaus to add a bit more specifics on the numbers
probably. But in general, I think in IFRS, it's pretty much the same as on the P&C side
unless you do see future losses that don't want to be too technical, but that do not
surpass the loss recognition test. So then you are able to account for future losses under
IFRS regime other than that. And our current numbers do not reflect that. But Klaus will
shed some light particularly on the Australian business.
In -- on Solvency II, I think it's fair to say we haven't really adjusted our long-term
assumptions both for mortality and morbidity. That is not reflected in Solvency II. However,
on the short term, let's say probably the next quarter and probably somewhat into 2021 is
reflected in Solvency II reserves already. But Klaus, you might be able to shed some more
light on that.

A - Klaus Miller

{BIO 16886879 <GO>}

Yes. Let's start with the Solvency II numbers. I have just the numbers for the U.S., and this
is about EUR100 million for the fourth quarter and 2021. About EUR30 million is for the
fourth quarter and the rest for the year 2021 under Solvency II. There is no loss recognition
in the U.S., because the buffers are high under IFRS. So you won't see that in the same
cushion or buffer you won't see under IFRS.
And the other thing, Clemens already mentioned. In Australia the disability business was
loss making the last couple of years and this has been a significant problem for us in the
past. And we had loss recognition under IFRS 4. So that any changes we make to our IFRS
numbers would go straight to the bottom line. And here we expect some economic
downturn in 2021, which usually leads to higher disability claims in the sense that
reactivation probabilities will go down. This could happen for various reasons, but
definitely it will happen for COVID-19 reasons. There will be an economic downturn. That's
what we expect for 2021. And we have about, I guess, EUR44 million in additional reserves
put aside for the economic downturn-related lower reactivation rates in 2021. So this is a
Page 17 of 20



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2020-11-04

cushion for next year. But this is only possible under IFRS 4, because we are already in loss
recognition for the disability business in Australia.

FINAL

A - Clemens Jungsthof el

{BIO 20496428 <GO>}

So Paris, to be clear that is really what you see under both regimes, right, under Solvency
II. And IFRS as Klaus mentioned, something that we don't see in 2020, but we expect in
2021. However, we have taken care of that already as a sort of a second order effect
related to COVID, to some extent, already in our 2020 numbers.

A - Klaus Miller

{BIO 16886879 <GO>}

According to my definition, this is even a third order effect. The first order is COVID claims
-- named COVID claims. The second is the claims I mentioned earlier from death of
despair few sites -- or fewer people seeking medical treatment and die of a heart attack,
because they don't go to hospital. The third order effect -- impact would be an economic
downturn, which across the world has an impact on our disability claims. Does that answer
your question?

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, thank you. Just to come back to the guidance, Klaus, you are saying that in the U.S.
mortality, you're talking about EUR17 million impact in 2021 and then also some on the
morbidity side in Australia. Are these already reflected in your guidance for 2021 in terms
of IFRS profits?

Yes.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi there. Just a very quick question. I'm assuming your willingness to talk about the
dividend means that you're assuming the regulator in Germany, BaFin, will be as
pragmatic year-end dividend discussions as they were with the FY '19. Is that your working
assumption? Have you been given any indications so far on that?

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

So we didn't have a direct discussion yet on this, but we expect based on the dialogue
we've had in the past months to have a pragmatic perspective from the regulator in
Germany. That's the assumption. I feel optimistic that this will be confirmed as we start the

performance and the strong reserving position and the business outlook that BaFin would
confirm the dividend.

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, thank you very much for taking part of this call and for the questions. So we wanted
to convey the message that our year-to-date figures are now solid enough to provide
guidance. Of course, some moving parts and some potential for changes in the fourth
quarter. There is some NatCat activity, in particular, but we feel confident in the EUR800
million are stated with a high confidence level.
We have robust reserving with COVID-19. The impact is yet to be confirmed, but I think
there's more solidity in the numbers. And we understand more and more where we are.
The primary wordings are changing, the reinsurance wordings will be changing. So the
exposure will be reduced quite significantly. And on the guidance 2021, clearly lots of
uncertainties. We took account of the economic outlook, which might not be very, very
positive. But we see increasing momentum in P&C. We expect the hardening of the
market and that's the main opportunity for us in 2021. And once we have this highlighted
and more visibility on how we fare, I think we can confirm the dividend assumptions for
the next year. So we'll have an opportunity in the New Year to comment on the renewals.
Of course, we will give you an update on the outlook on '21 and obviously, the dividend
decisions, which as always is being taken in the New Year.
Thank you very much for your attention, and have a good day.
