With us to discuss today's results are Kevin O'Donnell, President and Chief Executive
Officer; and Bob Qutub, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?

Kevin J. O'Donnell
Thanks, Peter. Good morning and thanks for joining today's call. I'll open with an overview
of our performance for the quarter, and we'll give some color on what happened and how
we think about it. Bob will then go over the financial results and I'll come back on to speak
a little bit more about each of our segments.

Bloomberg Transcript

Last night we released our first quarter earnings. For the quarter, we reported growth in
book value of 0.8% and growth in tangible book value per share plus accumulated
dividends of 1.2%. We also reported an annualized ROE of 8.3% and an annualized
operating ROE of 4.4%, against the backdrop of a market that continues to be
challenging, as well as some specific developments that impacted our performance this
quarter.
Negative impacts included the Ogden rate change and weaker than anticipated results in
our Casualty and Specialty book. On the positive side, we had strong investment results,
proactive capital management, and growth in targeted lines of business, all of which Bob
will discuss in greater detail. I am pleased that we maintained our leadership position in
the property cap market. We had solid renewals at both January 1 and April 1, and are
heading into the June and July renewals with a clear strategy. I'm confident that we've
constructed and will maintain an industry-leading portfolio that can generate shareholder
value over the long-term.
The standout driver of results for the quarter was the Ogden rate change, which drove
our prior year development for the quarter. Usually, we would not preannounce a loss of
this size, but given the unique circumstances of Ogden, we thought it would be
appropriate. Later in the call, Bob will discuss the impact of the Ogden rate change on our
numbers in greater detail.
I'd like to take a minute to describe how I think about our underwriting results for the first
quarter, which had a $63 million variance to the comparative quarter. Roughly half of this
variance was due to the Ogden rate change. The remaining half was more or less evenly
split between Property and Casualty and Specialty.
In Property, the first quarter was an active one for natural catastrophes and resulted in
some losses. The remainder of the variance was in Casualty and Specialty, and was
divided fairly evenly between large Specialty events and attritional losses. So a number of

FINAL

uncorrelated events aligned this quarter and affected our underwriting results. But
stepping back and taking a broader view, we remain comfortable with our underwriting
portfolio and how it's performing.
Our current accident year Casualty and Specialty results had a 13 point negative variance
to the comparative quarter last year. While the Ogden rate change was primarily a prior
accident year issue, the remaining negative variance in our Casualty and Specialty
segment was from an increase in reported claims in the current accident year.
With Casualty, we learned more about the performance of the book as it ages, so this
early reporting does not provide much insight into the health of the book. While we do
not anticipate that the Casualty and Specialty segment will have the same level of volatility
as our property cat business, it will still have good quarters and bad quarters. In Casualty
and Specialty, it is important to separate the short-term noise from the long-term signal.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our conclusion for this quarter is that we are seeing more timing than trend, and we
remain comfortable with the development of our Casualty and Specialty segment. That
said, we will continue to watch individual business lines in this segment closely to ensure
we are ahead of any developing negative trends. I believe that if you wait for definitive
confirmation of a trend, in either direction, it is probably too late to benefit from the
insight. We've made a lot of money reacting early to trends and we are watching this
market carefully.
Our investments portfolio and capital management were both bright spots for the
quarter. Bob will discuss these in greater detail, but our investment returns were strong,
given both the interest rate environment and short duration of our portfolio. We also
purchased approximately $103 million of shares since January 1.
I'll provide more details on the opportunities we're seeing later in the call, but first let me
turn it over to Bob to talk about our financials.

Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Today I'd like to first give you a few overall
themes for the quarter, then provide some detail on our consolidated segment financial
results, and conclude with investments and capital activities. As Kevin pointed out in his
opening remarks, the impact of the decrease in the Ogden rate was a standout driver of
our results for the quarter, driving all of the prior year development in our Casualty and
Specialty segment.
We also experienced an uptick in current accident year losses in our Casualty and
Specialty segments. Having said that, we reported a strong performance from our
investment portfolio and our ventures unit continues to provide meaningful contributions
to our bottom-line and overall strategy. I continue to be confident in our strategy and
proud of the work our team did during the January 1 and April 1 renewals.

FINAL

The first quarter sees a significant portion of our book renew, most notably in our Property
segment, where almost half of our annual premiums incept during the quarter. We saw
pockets of attractive business and we're able to grow the top-line in our Property
segment, while continuing to maintain our underwriting discipline and execute our grossto-net strategy.
Impacting our consolidated and Casualty and Specialty segment underwriting the results
during the quarter was the announcement that the discount rate used to calculate lump
sum awards in UK bodily injury cases, known as the Ogden rate, changed from 2.5% to
negative 0.75%, a decrease of 325 basis points. This is an industry-wide issue and not
unique to us. We were primarily exposed to the Ogden rate change through a limited
number of UK med mal contracts, with an impact on our first quarter consolidated
combined ratio of about 9 points. This was all contained within prior accident years in our
Casualty and Specialty segment, increasing that segment's combined ratio to nearly 19
points. Our Casualty and Specialty segment also experienced an increase in the current
accident year claims, which I'll discuss a little later on.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now moving on to our consolidated financial results. For the first quarter of March 31, 2017,
we reported net income of $92 million, or $2.25 per diluted common share, and operating
income of $49 million, or $1.18 per diluted common share. We generated an annualized
ROE for the quarter of 8.3% and annualized operating ROE of 4.4%. Our book value per
share increased 0.8% and our tangible book value per share, including accumulated
dividends, increased by 1.2%. Underwriting income was $42 million and we reported a
combined ratio of 88%.
Let me now shift to our segment results, beginning with the Property segment, followed
by Casualty and Specialty. During the first quarter, our Property segment gross premiums
written were up 17% relative to the first quarter of 2016, with our other property class of
business up 48% and our catastrophe class of business up 11%.
For the first quarter, the Property segment generated underwriting income of $91 million
and a combined ratio of 51% compared to underwriting income of $105 million and a
combined ratio of 40% in the comparative quarter. As noted, we grew the top-line in this
segment, most notably in the other property class of business. This business tends to be
more proportional and delegated authority in nature, and carries with it a higher expected
combined ratio than our traditional excess of loss catastrophe business.
As Kevin noted in his remarks, the first quarter was an active one for catastrophe events,
although no single event was noteworthy from our perspective. We did have a number of
current accident year claims from smaller events in our catastrophe class of business. In
other property, our current accident year ratio was down over 5 points. However, we did
experience some adverse development on prior accident years due to attritional claims
coming in slightly higher than expected.
As a result of the increase in proportional business in our Property segment, we saw our
acquisition expense ratio tick up during the quarter, partially offset by a modest decrease

Page 4 of 24



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2017-05-03

in the operational expense ratio, as we continue to focus on leveraging our expense base
across our underwriting platforms.

FINAL

Moving on to our Causality and Specialty segment, where in the first quarter of 2017 gross
premiums written were down 4% relative to the first quarter of 2016. Recall that during
the first quarter of 2016, we wrote a large multi-year mortgage reinsurance contract,
resulting in a one-off impact to our top-line.
With the exception of this contract, our financial lines gross premium written were also up
modestly in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. In addition, we
experienced growth in certain of our casualty lines of business during the quarter. Gross
premiums written in the mortgage business and certain other specialty lines can be quite
lumpy, and often times characterized by a few relatively large transactions. As we have
mentioned in past calls, we did expect the rate of growth in mortgage to begin to
moderate.

Bloomberg Transcript

The Casualty and Specialty segment incurred an underwriting loss of $49 million and a
combined ratio of 128% in the first quarter. Driving the underwriting result was the impact
of the decrease in the Ogden rate, which added nearly 19 points to the Casualty and
Specialty segment's combined ratio and prior accident year claim ratio. Absent the impact
of Ogden, our Casualty and Specialty segment would have experienced modest
favorable development on prior accident years.
Our Casualty and Specialty segment experienced an increase in the current accident year
claims ratio of 13 points in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016.
There were a few specific specialty events during the first quarter of 2017 that accounted
for about $10 million or over 5 points on the claims ratio, and additionally, we experienced
around $13 million, or 8 points, of higher attritional losses spread across a number of
casualty lines of business. As with each quarter, we evaluate our reserves for developing
trends and remain comfortable with our process and reserve adequacy.
The Casualty and Specialty segment's underwriting expense ratio was relatively flat in the
first quarter 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. Underlying this, we experienced
an increase in the acquisition expense ratio driven by our growing proportional book,
which tends to have a relatively higher acquisition ratio than non-proportional business.
And our operational expense ratio decreased as we continue to focus on expense
management and leveraging our existing expense base across our global underwriting
platforms.
Now turning to investments. In the first quarter, we reported net investment income of
$54 million, comprised mainly of $43 million of interest income from fixed maturity
securities and $11 million of net investment income from our alternative investments
portfolio. Net realized and unrealized gains on investments was $43 million, for a total
investment result of $98 million, resulting in an annualized total return on our overall
investment portfolio of 4.1%.

FINAL

Our equity portfolio continued to perform well and interest income from our fixed
maturity investment portfolio benefited from higher average invested assets. Partially
offsetting this was lower overall returns from fixed maturities due to yield increases at the
frontend of the curve.
Our investment portfolio remains conservative with respect to interest rate, credit, and
duration risk, with 89% allocated to fixed maturity and short-term investments with a high
degree of liquidity and modest credit exposure. The duration of our investment portfolio
remained relatively short at 2.6 years, which is slightly higher than in recent quarters. The
yield to maturity on fixed income and short-term investments was 2.3% at March 31,
compared to 2.1% at December 31. Our strategic investment portfolio, managed by our
ventures unit, recorded gains and we continue to be satisfied with the long-term
fundamentals of the companies we own.

Bloomberg Transcript

During the quarter, we repurchased $80 million of our common shares. Subsequent to
March 31 and through last Friday, we repurchased an additional $23 million of our common
shares. Share buybacks continue to be our preferred method of returning capital to our
shareholders. As we look forward, any decision relating to share repurchases will, as
always, depend on our view of the business opportunities, the profile of our risk portfolio,
and a number of other financial metrics, none of which should be taken in isolation.
In other capital management activities, we anticipate repaying the full $250 million of our
7.5% senior notes that come due on June 1 with existing cash on hand and do not plan on
refinancing the notes. Our balance sheet remains highly liquid. Our capital position
remains very strong. We had efficient access to capital through multiple sources to take
advantage of underwriting and business opportunities, strategic investments, and capital
management activities as they may arise. Our ventures team continues to actively build
relationships with high quality, long-term investors, as well as looking for new strategic
transactions that can enhance our underwriting franchise.
Our capital management actions reflect a quickly evolving market, and we believe we
have developed a unique agility to deploy capital where it is needed most through our
own underwriting platforms or through our managed balance sheets, and remove it from
areas where it is not earning a suitable return.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back to Kevin.

Kevin J. O'Donnell
Thanks, Bob. I will start my comments with Property, and then I'll move on to Casualty and
Specialty. As Bob mentioned, we grew the Property segment by 17% over the comparable
quarter last year. In property cat, we saw some good opportunities to increase on a few
large property cat programs and had strong top-line growth in other property.
The growth in the Property segment was higher than expected and we do not anticipate
that premium growth will continue at this pace in either property cat or other property.
The combined ratio for the Property segment was up over the comparable quarter last
Page 6 of 24

FINAL

year, primarily due to a mix of current year and prior year losses. To put this in
perspective, however, consider that the first quarter is well above average for U.S.
property losses.
As we discussed on the last call, the challenges of 2016 have continued into 2017. The
pricing in our market continues to be pressured by capital supply increasing at a faster
rate than demand for reinsurance. Rates in Property continued to decline, although at a
slower pace relative to prior renewals. Generally, terms and conditions remained stable.
The market continued to look for the bottom, as rate reductions were broadly in line with
underwriter expectations at April 1. This is consistent with the trends we saw at the
January 1 renewal.
The April 1 renewal proceeded in an orderly fashion, with rates flat to slightly down. This
renewal is dominated by Japanese risk and accounts for approximately one-third of our
assumed international property cat portfolio. We mostly maintained our lines and were
essentially flat from a premium perspective.

Bloomberg Transcript

Looking forward to the June renewal in Florida, we continue to expect pricing pressure
due to abundant supply of capital relative to market demand. Demand in the market is
likely to be roughly flat and we don't anticipate significant premium growth in our Florida
book. The Florida market remains challenged by issues, such as assignment of benefits.
Because of this, the underlying results of many Florida homeowner writers continues to
deteriorate. The majority of our Florida exposure, however, remains on an excess of loss
basis, which has limited the direct impact to us from these issues, although it has the
potential to increase losses from a large event.
Although we still believe opportunities to construct a market-leading portfolio in Florida
exist, our Property portfolio is less reliant on Florida-only business. This is due to our
strategic growth and diversification in the U.S. and other property, which continues to
create opportunities.
Our Casualty and Specialty segment was down slightly at 01/01, but in line with overall
expectations. We continue to expect moderate premium growth from this segment over
the course of the year. Our team executed well through a difficult market. We've built an
industry-leading Casualty and Specialty business, both organically and with the acquisition
of Platinum.
Casualty and Specialty is core to our business and we continue to demonstrate leadership
in several lines. As we discussed earlier, the market condition in our Casualty and Specialty
segment is difficult, but reasonably stable from last year. I feel that we are managing our
book effectively and skillfully navigating the market. With that market commentary as a
backdrop, our quarter has several items affecting our results.
The important drivers are; first, the Ogden rates change, which we previously discussed;
two, several event specific losses in Specialty, that I view more as timing differences
against our curve; and third, as I mentioned earlier, some increases in reported claims in

Page 7 of 24

FINAL

the current accident year, which does not provide much information as the book is too
green.
The results for this quarter do not alter our positive perception of this business with a
correctness of our overall strategy. The 04/01 Casualty and Specialty renewal is much
smaller than the 01/01 renewal, and it was largely in line with expectations with relatively
flat pricing and stable terms on most deals. Overall, even with relatively flat renewal, the
market remains competitive and we are carefully monitoring the underlying books that we
are assuming for rate computation.
We continue to be a first call for new opportunities with key clients. While it is often
difficult to pick up additional participations on existing programs, we have seen more
opportunities when panels are consolidated or when multiple treaties are combined. We
continue to execute our gross-to-net strategy, ceding over 40% of our gross premiums.
Breaking this down by segment, we see it over one-third of our Casualty and Specialty
and, after adjusting for retro purchase and the use of joint venture vehicles, retain roughly
half of our gross written premium in the Property segment. There are multiple benefits to
our gross-to-net strategy.

Bloomberg Transcript

First, we're able to continue to write large lines for our best clients using the most
efficient capital available. Second, it enables us to manage our net retained risk and
transform risk income into fee income, both important outcomes in a soft market. And
third, by applying the gross-to-net skills we originally developed in property cat, our
Casualty and Specialty portfolio has a better risk adjusted return profile than it otherwise
would on a gross basis.
Our ceded program is a key differentiator from our competitors, both in terms of size, but
also in terms of sophistication. The benefits of ceding a large portion of our gross
premiums may not always be apparent, but on an expected basis, we believe it makes
sense. It makes us a much more efficient company, as well as a much more resilient
company. Our goal is to create the most efficient portfolio of risks we can and our grossto-net strategy is a key driver to that efficiency.
I want to spend a few minutes on our ventures unit, which continues to produce excellent
results and advance our underwriting franchise. In our joint venture business, we continue
to work with capital partners to provide cedents with effective, unique, and one-stop risk
solution. In addition to DaVinci, Top Layer, Upsilon, and Medici, we added Fibonacci this
year, all of which afford us a unique access to a diverse array of capital providers. We also
continue to look for opportunities to add to our portfolio of strategic investments, which
have produced excellent economic returns and enhanced our client connectivity and
created new business opportunities. We always look forward to working on new
opportunities that bring together our investment and underwriting capabilities in a unique
way.
I am confident as ever in our future and our ability to build a market-leading portfolio of
desirable risk. I continue to be pleased with the strong execution of our strategy and
remain confident that we have the right tools, people, and platforms in place to drive

Page 8 of 24



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td

Date: 2017-05-03

success over the longer-term. Our flexible platform and expanded underwriting
capabilities will continue to enable us to respond quickly and effectively through emerging
market challenges and new client demands. As always, we will focus relentlessly on our
three superiors, superior capital management, superior customer relationships, and
superior risk selection.

FINAL

Thanks. And with that, I'll turn it over to questions.

Peter Hill

{BIO 15385944 <GO>}

Operator, will you please give the instructions?

Q&A
Operator
Your first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan at Wells Fargo. Your line is
open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. So if we look at the ROE, you guys reported in the quarter a little bit
over 4%. And so if I just make some adjustments for the Ogden charge, and then some
of the higher specialty losses, I think you called out a combined $23 million in the quarter, I
would adjust to about an ROE just over 9%. I know you also said there were some cat
losses that aren't included in that number. I'm just trying to see what do you view kind of
as the run rate ROE. I mean, I know we – the overall low cat quarter, and I think there some
expectations might have been that you return would have been higher.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Thanks, Elyse. It certainly is a lot going on this quarter, so I appreciate you taking the time
to kind of bring things back to a normalized level. I think at the highest level, looking at
2017, we see some of the trends continuing, but it's really not much different in 2017 than
what we saw in 2016. So with that, it's a good framing for how to think about what the
macro environment is in which we're operating.
Breaking that down is really three things to talk about with regard to our performance in
our ROE. So results are driven by investments, underwriting, and capital management. So
within investments, I think there is some green shoots, where we're seeing some
opportunity for an improved investment environment in 2017 compared to 2016.
In underwriting, from a reinsurance perspective, within Casualty and Specialty, we're
seeing reasonably stable reinsurance terms. The issues that we're monitoring are really
two-fold. One is, what is going on with the underlying rates, which in most classes are
behaving pretty well, and then where are we seeing some increased frequency on
inflationary trends and which we continue to monitor. All in all, that book is behaving
reasonably consistently with last year. In Property, little bit of an uptick in the first quarter,
Page 9 of 24



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2017-05-03

but our Property book at 01/01, as we discussed, had low single digit rate changes, so
again that book looks reasonably similar.

FINAL

From a capital management perspective, we had good capital management activity last
year and in the first quarter. We do have excess capital, which has an effect on ROE, but
it's something that we know how to manage it, and we'll remain diligent and consistent in
our efforts to continue to deploy it or return it.
Looking at our strategy over the last several years, we really focused on two things to
help combat the headwinds that we see in the market. One is to increase our capital
leverage, which I think we've done reasonably well. The easiest manifestation of that to
investors is seeing the diversification we've achieved on our balance sheet. That
diversification has added a lot of efficiency to the capital that's deployed. And then from
an operating leverage, we held our fixed expenses roughly flat over the last couple of
years and increased our top-line premium by about 50%, so we feel like we're making
good strides there.
So in sum, I would say that rates are down a little bit compared to last year. Casualty and
Specialty renewals have been reasonably flat. There are some trends to watch on the
underlying, but my expectations for return in 2017 are not materially different than what
they were in 2016.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. That's great. And then in terms of the reserve releases, we saw a slowdown in the
Q1. I think in the commentary you guys did point to some prior year adverse development
in the other property book. But historically if I go back the past couple of years, Q1 has
actually been when you've seen the lowest level of favorable reserve development. Can
you just remind us, is there seasonality to the review of your reserves and why has Q1
historically, I guess, been lower and how we can think about favorable reserve
development for the balance of 2017?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I think that's a good observation to look at. We don't think of our reserves on a quarterly
basis. We look at our reserves as being our best estimate over the longer term. With that,
we do report on a quarterly basis and those quarterly reports often reflect when we
receive information from our customers. Typically, the fourth quarter is a lot of information
conveyed, both because our customers are closing their books of business in many cases
and, secondly, we're renewing a lot of business. So to the extent there is any seasonality,
it could be in response to just the normal financial calendar that our seasons have and the
fact that we do often receive more details and additional information as we're renewing.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then in terms of the Ogden loss that you guys disclose, so you guys had
pointed to this coming from your med mal exposure, so two questions there. It seems like
from some of the discourse on the Lloyd's book that this stemmed from, I think, both
Lloyd's and Platinum business. Is that correct? And then also, most of the players in the
Page 10 of 24



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2017-05-03

space that have disclosed Ogden losses have pointed to that coming from UK motor
business. Can you just provide just a little bit more commentary on where rent (30:05)
exposures come? Because I really can't – I can't recall other companies highlighting
exposure related to med mal with this loss?

FINAL

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Absolutely. I think you're absolutely right that most of the other announcements regarding
Ogden are around auto. As you know, or as we've disclosed, we're not a very large auto
writer. The Ogden rate actually affects any bodily injury claim in the UK. So looking through
our book of business, we saw that it was largely concentrated within a single account that
was written in both our syndicate and in the legacy book, and which we purchased from
Platinum.
It is something that – there are exposures that can come through in other lines of business
for bodily injury. But for us, it was really focused on the med mal. It's something that – from
a going-forward basis, it's not something we anticipate for it to continue to develop for
us, because, as I said, it's a single account and we are in negotiations with full information
on Ogden as to how to think about (31:19).

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, great. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Sure.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you and good morning. So just want to be clear on the sort of Elyse's question on
Ogden rates. So, this impact is only impact the past reserve, not your ongoing business
going forward?
Right. It's only in the prior years, Kai.
Okay. That's clear. And then on the mortgage re gross and seems like it moderated a
little bit. We have heard a lot of competitors are actually ramping up on the mortgage
(32:01) sort of premiums. I just wonder, what do you see the market dynamics there? Are
you losing the competition or you feel the return is less attractive than it was before?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
So, as Bob disclosed, we had a large transaction in the mortgage market last year, which
was a one-off transaction. Obviously, we earn it over many years. But with that, we are still
Page 11 of 24



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2017-05-03

FINAL

seeing mortgage opportunities in 2017. I don't think there's any mortgage business that
we're not seeing. So it's a result of us seeing some unique opportunities in 2016. Those
unique opportunities were mostly in the PMI books of business, and it was with regard to
older vintages that we thought were particularly attractive.
What we expect to see this year is more current vintages. We believe that there'll be a full
spectrum of what's attractive and what is less attractive. Overall, 2017 will be less
attractive than 2016 for mortgage business, but we believe that the mortgage business
will still be attractive. We anticipate that we will grow, but we probably will grow at a lesser
rate than we grew from 2016 to 2015.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. So the return of the mortgage re you think is still probably better than the other
lines business you're having right now?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I think there's two answers to that. One is on a standalone basis, and one is on a marginal
basis for our portfolio. So on a standalone basis, we still see good margins in much of the
mortgage business. And I think from a marginal basis, so the effect on our portfolio, it's
still pretty efficient to us to add it, particularly on a reinsurance basis.

Okay. Lastly, just follow up your commentary on the – you're monitoring inflation trend.
Some of your peers talking more about this – see some signs writing inflation in
commercial auto, as well as in the professional lines. Could you talk little bit more about
where do you see potential inflation trends in your lines of business?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Okay. Auto certainly has been a big topic around the industry, but again, we're not a big
auto writer, so I don't see that as particularly concerning to us. I think within professional
liability, there has been a lot of discussion about an increased frequency really of class
action suits. I would say a lot of that is around kind of merger objection claims.
Our observation of that is we are still seeing reasonably high dismissal rates, and a lot of
the claims inflation that we're seeing there is really the loss adjustment expense
associated with defending those and a lot of that is contained within the primary. We are
more of an excess player within the D&O market, so it's something that we absolutely are
watching carefully. At this point in time it's not driving our results, but to the extent these
sorts of claims begin to get traction, it could begin to move up into more awards that
affect the excess layers, and then we would be more impacted.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Good morning.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 16979665 <GO>}

Firstly, just going back to the Casualty and Specialty discussion, when you talked about
timing versus trend, we've seen some noise sort of lingering in this segment quarter-toquarter. I'm curious why shouldn't we think about this as maybe some sort of a problem
with the business that is being sourced, or maybe just talk about any changes you've
made in how this business is being sourced now versus the past, so that it sort of
reassures us that you're on top of this issue.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Okay. If you go back to first quarter last year, we talked about some event losses that
came in. That occurred again this quarter within our Specialty lines. So the way I think
about those is, when something in one of our Specialty lines happens, it tends to be a
large event, we have a bias to think of it as an event. We post the reserve and then over
time the curve should catch up to the reserve that we post in the quarter. I think within the
Specialty lines, one of the things to look at is, we're not changing our ultimate expected
losses. So I just think of this as perhaps the curve is, we need to think about the timing of
the curve or we just have to accept that our losses will come in a little bit more lumpy than
what a traditional curve would do.
Within Casualty, I think we have a little bit more of a traditional thought process around
reserving, and what we're seeing in the current accident year is really where I focus,
because all the prior year development is Ogden. So on the current accident year, it's just
we've seen a few more – a bit of an uptick in reported claims coming in. It's not within any
one line of business. It's not thematically tied together, so we're looking at it. We decided
to add it to our discussion points for the quarter, but again, it's something that, if we're
correct, our ultimates will remain consistent and this will pan out over time as our curves
mature.

Got it. The other question I have is, you spent some time talking about the reinsurance
strategy and you've talked about the retro strategy in detail over the past several
quarters. I'm curious how has that evolved, let's say, over the past – I don't know – eight
quarters or so. And has that shifted in terms of how it protects the tail versus the middle
piece? Maybe just add some color on that front, so that we have some confidence in
terms of the volatility of the numbers. Thanks.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Okay. Just to clarify. You're asking about our ceded strategy, is that right?

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 16979665 <GO>}

Yes. Yes. Exactly.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Okay. I'll start with Property, which I think we – it's probably a little bit more understood and
we've been doing it for longer, and then I'll move over to Casualty. So within Property, we
have what I talk about is the fact that we keep about 50% of our gross premiums. So
included in that is our use of third party capital through all the vehicles that I listed in my
comments. Additionally, we have a series of quota share like protections, so those will
participate in a proportional basis on the losses throughout our property book, including
other property. The rest of it is more of a excess of loss, which will protect different
components of the book at different return periods, traditionally more remote written
periods, certainly more remote written periods than what we've experienced over the last
several years.
Moving to Casualty and Specialty, we have a similar philosophy in thinking about how to
protect the book, where we are looking at substantial quota share protections for several
of our lines of business. When we think about purchasing those quota shares, the
fundamental, the most basic analysis we're doing is what percent of the expected profit
are we keeping for full session of loss. That is the driver for us to think about constructing
the portfolio on a net basis.
Additionally, we're increasingly finding opportunities to buy either per occurrence or per
risk protections within our Casualty book, which will serve us to protect us from either a
single shock loss or from adverse aggregate performance across the portfolios. In
observing those, what I am talking about is the economic framework with a capital model
in which we're making our decisions. The observed GAAP impact is less than the
observed economic impact, meaning that we've seen within property cat loss is smaller
than would recognize the full benefit of the ceded portfolio that we've purchased. And
within Specialty, we see the effect of the quota share, which will emerge over time, but
more specifically, the specific excess covers have not been utilized to the degree that
they are appearing in our GAAP statements.
So very consistent across both segments. We believe, it's the right thing to do to position
us for long-term success. And to the extent we're correct on the expected modeling of
Page 14 of 24

our portfolios, these will be accretive over time.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 16979665 <GO>}

FINAL

And then just final just sort of related to that, when you say long term, can you define long
term?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Well, within property cat, it's when – the long term could be tomorrow, just whatever an
event happens. What I mean by that is just something that's a little bit further out in the
tail than what we've experienced. For Casualty, this is as the books mature, I think you'll
continue to see the increased sessions in the more recent books soaking up some of the
losses as they come through.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 16979665 <GO>}

Got it. And I'll stop here and let others ask. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America. Your line is
open.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yes, thank you. A couple of questions. In the other property segment, the acquisition
expense ratio was higher. Obviously, a shift towards quota share business would do that.
Is that a number that we should think about going forward over the next couple of
quarters or for some reason was that inflated in this particular quarter?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

No. Jay, I think you're right. It's related to our growth in proportional and delegated
authority. You saw that we had a lot of growth and you can see that the growth in the
acquisition really parallel what we saw in the net earned premium. So as that business
continues to grow, you'll see that growth what you would normally see with the
proportional business.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

And does that business have a lower loss ratio than your other business?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I would divide it into two pieces. Other property is not necessarily cat-focused business,
but there is a cat component in it. The volatility and the attritional stuff is lower than the
Page 15 of 24



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2017-05-03

cat piece, so it has a higher loss ratio. So we look to write the property, the cat
component of that at a similar loss ratios of property cat. The attritional will have a higher
loss ratio, which is normal in any proportional book. It's more of an insurance property set
of economics than of reinsurance.

Got it. That's helpful.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

And then secondly, in the Specialty business, these kind of losses that you talked about in
the quarter, can you talk about what lines – I mean, what kind of losses we're talking
about?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Sure. There are some losses – actually I'm going to give a specific example. One of them
is, we decided to book – there was some press recently about the Mozambique bond. We
decided to go out ahead of the Mozambique transaction and to book that, so that's kind
of a clear example. We see that as an event and added. Ultimately the curve will catch up.
Rest of the market may treat it differently. We had a surety event, which was similar,
couple of things like that, but there is not – it's not one line of business. It's things of large
size that we are treating more as an event and bringing it through our reserves that way.
Ultimately the curve I think will catch up.

Good morning, Josh.

FINAL

Q - Joshua D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

I want to know how to think about excess capital as you write proportional business versus
excess loss business. And where you sort of look in terms of the extent to which you're
maximizing what you think is sort of the right amount of capital at this point in the market
versus giving that back to shareholders?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Okay. I'm going to – I think I hear two questions there. The first is how do we think about
allocating capital in lines of business, including other property, and then secondly excess
capital. So firstly, all of our risk is managed in REMS, and within that we have two sets of
analysis which we talked to you about before, one is the standalone, the other is the
marginal.

Bloomberg Transcript

The marginal is the way in which we allocate capital to risk on an economic basis and it
(45:46) informs how much GAAP capital is required. So thinking about other property
specifically, the cat component will add required capital to our portfolio. The attritional
loss, which tends to be more individual law stuff, is less capital consumptive and won't add
nearly as much capital. So thinking about the premium change within other property, it's a
much lower additional requirement than it would be within property cat, because property
cat still drives the tail of our distributions.
With regard to how to think about that between deploying capital and share repurchases
or returning capital. So our first objective is always to look for accretive ways to deploy
capital into our business. And if we can't, then we'll look for ways to return it. Once we
have the information as to what the return is on required capital with any line of business,
it makes the return decision as to whether – makes the decision as to whether return on
capital is pretty easy, you just compare one to the other.
So for us, internally it's reasonably transparent, lots of sophisticated kind of analysis
behind it, but it's what we do everyday regardless of whether it's other property, surety,
or another property cat line.

Q - Joshua D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

What about making investments in non-core related businesses? I think at some points in
your history you guys have been a total return company and there has been – and,
obviously, you do have some investments out there. Instead of returning the capital,
instead of deploying the capital, how actively are you looking to maybe buy something?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Sure. So a lot of the – I think what you're talking about is some of the venture capital
investments that we make...

Could be. I mean, ChannelRe, Japan yen, I mean, all sorts of.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell

FINAL

Yeah.

Q - Joshua D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Over the years some have worked out, some haven't.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. So, the way we look at that is, we will – we do a normal private equity analysis. There
is two – let me divide the venture portfolio from an investment perspective into two
things. One is, underwriter supported investment, so we own – component of owning
Tower Hill is the information that we learn about what's going on in the Florida primary
market, as well as our access to their risk as a preferred reinsurer. So that's one set of
investments that we make.
The other set of investments is, things that we think will enhance our franchise and further
our strategy, but maybe one step further removed. Trupanion is probably a little bit closer
to that, where Trupanion we think is an excellent company. We see it as an area where
potentially we can learn how to think about small premium processing and in a growing
market. So we'll make an investment potentially there looking to expand the franchise a
little bit more than something like Tower Hill. All of them are made independently to make
sure that we are seeing an IRR that we believe to be accretive to the firm over time.

Q - Joshua D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And as you weigh that against, I guess, is returning capital viewed as an accretive – I
mean, the balance between those two things, to return the capital, I guess, is accretive
through a buyback at a certain price versus a dividend which is probably not accretive. I
guess, how does that fit into – when you're presenting to the board, well, should we really
be buying back stock? Should we really be giving a dividend? What about – how
aggressively, I guess, should we be looking for third-party type investments?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Sure. So one of the high bars we place for ourselves is, we should not be doing for
investors what they can do for themselves. Things I like about several of our ventures'
investments is that they provide long-term income opportunities where share buybacks,
we're looking to be accretive over a much shorter period of time.
I think with regard to special dividends, dividends, share buybacks, we look at each of
those each quarter and make a determination as to what we think is most beneficial to
shareholders. Historically, as you know, share buybacks has been the winning strategy for
us to return capital. But again, if we can find an opportunity that we think will provide longterm benefits to shareholders through investment, we'll absolutely make it.

Tower Hill loss in the quarter, is that kind of an unusual situation? What was that all about?

A - Robert Qutub

Tower Hill did take – we take an equity method on that, Brian, and it was down in the

And your last question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. Your line is

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Thank you. First of all, FYI, Brian was referring to page 15, because I was going to ask the
same thing, but I'll get to that in a minute.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Okay.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

My sort of big picture question might be that (52:25), one observation I had looking at the
results was, your underwriting income for the quarter pretty much all came from DaVinci. I
think there was about $1 million if I backed out the DaVinci that came from the Ren
balance sheet. Just how should – that just kind of caught me off guard. I mean, how should
Page 20 of 24



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2017-05-03

I think about that? Is there anything to read into that, that DaVinci generated the most
profit this quarter?

FINAL

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Actually it's an interesting way to think about it. I hadn't focused on kind of dividing it
between RenRe and DaVinci. DaVinci is really a quota share of our property cat book, at
the simplest level. So I think of it as mimicking – what you see in DaVinci is an
unadulterated performance of what you're seeing at RenRe Limited. I think, if I were to
break it out, it's some of the other components that we were talking about. The uptick in
Specialty, Casualty losses, and then the Ogden rate change, which didn't affect DaVinci.
So all the other components that we're seeing within Casualty and Specialty are not
resident within DaVinci and what you're seeing is just the pure property cat performance
coming out of DaVinci.

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Right. (53:35)

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

question about the Casualty book, maybe just ask a little bit differently.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Sure.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

The thing I notice is the last three quarters on an accident year basis it's been running at
about a 110 (53:52). And I know there's been sort of issues that have come up each
quarter that I wouldn't want to call that a run rate. But then again three quarters in a row,
you start to scratch your head and say, well, maybe is my run rate higher than I used to
think it was, right?
So, I mean, can you help us try to think of how often we should have quarters that look like
a 110 (54:12)? I mean, is it once every three years and you just happen to have three in a
row or is it normal now probably over 100, and is just – is it a combination of it's not as
good as we used to have and bad luck? Like, how should we think about normal?

FINAL

Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2017-05-03

So, I think there's two components that are driving the loss ratio within that. One is prior
year development and the other is the current accident year. So, I think, as the book
grows, I have – actuaries tend to be the glass half full, so they'll be more interested in
recognizing increased frequency or severity than something that is looking more like
favorable – favorable frequency or severity. So as a book grows, you're going to have a
bias to have a little bit more of a negative skew into your loss ratio. I think the prior year
development, we do the best we can to estimate it. We look at it each quarter and
there's going to be some natural volatility there.
From a run rate perspective, I don't have a return period to think about what a 105 is or a
95 (55:31), but I would expect that – we believe the book could be profitable. It may be a
little bit of a lumpy ride to get there, but as the book matures we should see more
stability in the results.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Do you think it would be profitable – on an accident year basis, profitable this year?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Looking at the expected value of the portfolio, the answer is yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Okay, good. Okay. And then the other sort of subcomponent of that I've been trying to
figure out is can you give us a ballpark sense of how much of the earned premium at this
point is from mortgage? And again in rough view, where that books? I would have thought
that would have been well below 100, and that what would have been helping the mix/

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

We don't – I mean, in terms of looking at the combined ratio for mortgage, we don't really
show that, but what we do show is the amount of gross written premium in our financial
line sector...

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Right.

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

That's about 60% of the total, the gross written premium in the first quarter. Now that's
down significantly from the prior year on the comparative basis, which have the larger
deals. So when you factor that out, there was some growth, but it runs about 60% of what
the total financial lines was for the first quarter this year.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

But it earns much slower, right? So if I looked at that $179 million of earned, I would guess
mortgages – I don't know – 20%, 30% – I mean, it's not certainly as much as the gross
would imply.

FINAL

The earn-out will be over a period of 7 to 10 years, and that earn-out period is going to be
reflective of the risk and the degree of risk over the life of that contract. So it's not a linear
earn-out. It's more reflective of the risk over the 7 to 10 years, probably little bit more in
the frontend and longer tail to backend.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Okay, got it. And then just one last one for me is on the investment income, the fixed
income has been sort of a run rate in the high 30s for a while and it bumped up to 43 this
quarter. I think you mentioned higher invested assets. But was there anything unusual this
quarter? Is this a new run rate up in the 40s?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

No, we had some higher invested assets that came in. We had a slight uptick in the rates
this quarter, overall 2.1 to 2.3, and we did a little bit of rebalancing with little bit more
closure on the credit side, but nothing significant, just modest changes to it, but we were
able to benefit from those changes in our structure, as well as in the market.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Thank you. Brian, let me go back to your question. It really relates to a few deals that we
carry at fair value, given the way GAAP makes us count for them. And so we have to
account for them on a fair value basis, so you get some volatility, but it's a very small
number and you'll see some up and down on it, but there is no trends there.
Thanks. Any other questions for today.
