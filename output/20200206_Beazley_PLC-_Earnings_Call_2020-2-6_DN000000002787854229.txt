{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

Good morning. Good morning everybody, and welcome to our Results Presentation for
2019. For many of you, who read our full set of report and accounts, which happen to be
on the website this morning, you'll have seen on the front page it's talking about
navigating change and it -- within it three areas of change, a reasonable management
changes, and we're going to see Sally's First Annual Presentation. Appointed CFO in May
last year. Having been with the company since 2006 and Adrian having had a first full year
of Chief Underwriting Officer shortly, so we'll see that. But we also talk about the market
changing, and we'll be discussing the market changes and finally, how the market needs
to change and its use of data and technology, and we'll touch on that as we go through
the presentation.
So I'm going to give an overview, and then going to hand over to Sally, who is going to go
through the financials, and then to Adrian who will give you an overview of how the
underwriting is going, and I'll come back for the outlook of 2020.
So if we just look at the numbers briefly. Profit before tax of 268 mainly an investment
story. So we had great investment income this year driven by yields coming down or rates
coming down, credit spreads narrowing, the equity markets having a good year, capital
growth assets doing well. So the perfect investment environment for making a good
return.

Small underwriting profit combined ratio of a rounding to 100%. Why is that? We flagged
last year that with fewer reserve releases because of the catastrophe claims in 2019,
2018. We also saw some catastrophe creep in some of those claims, which we talked
about at the half year. We're opening slightly higher, as we see claims inflation come
through areas of our liability book, particularly D&O, employment practice liability and the
healthcare book. So we're being reasonably conservative in our opening reserve position,
and all of that has led to the combined ratio of 100%. Because of the claims environment,
the rates are up by 6%. So profitability in the claims environment has driven rates up by
6% and because of that we've seen good top line growth of 15%. Couple of points to
that, the facilities we are writing for third-party capital and they get reinsured out of that
gross premiums written.
Prior year reserve releases, as we flagged, we're going to be lower, driven by a number
of things, I just talked about. And in usual fashion, the dividend growth between 5% and
10%, so the dividend is up 5% over last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

So a brief business update. It was great to hit $3 billion of premium, not that we're
targeting anything, so we want profitable growth. But on the back of the growth, we
managed to achieve our 3 billion of gross premiums written during the year. And the
couple of bullet points down, you can see that we have growing our non-US premiums at
Continental Europe, where we've been putting a lot of effort in growing our offices in
Continental Europe specifically in Spain, France and Germany, up 17%, the US from a much
larger base growing at respectable 13%.
Small more management changes, so Anthony Hobkinson actually retired at the end of
January and Beth Diamond, who has been heading our third-party claims for a number of
years, who joined us in 2006 based in New York has taken on Anthony's role. Some
confusion this morning between Anthony's initials and mine, AH and someone asked me,
where am I going. And I point out, I'm not actually going anywhere. It's Anthony rather than
myself.
Strategic initiatives -- Mike Donovan -- sorry retiring in June 2020. So Mike has built a
fantastic cyber business over the years. He joined us in 2004 and he's going to retire in
June 2020. The expectation is we will be announcing an internal appointment before the
half year to take over from Mike.
Strategic initiatives just touching on two of the four key initiatives that we're focusing on
how we use technology and data better. So Beazley digital run by James Eaton and
Andrew Pryde looking at how do we actually do small risk better, and we're giving you
some pointers here about having quoted 75,000 risks in 2019 on our e-trading platforms.
And looking at these technology connections to brokers, which are becoming more and
more to the fore and the brokers are asking to connect with their systems more and
more.
And then the faster smarter underwriting that Ian Fantozzi and Adrian Cox lead looking at
how do we actually do our large complex risk better by looking at sources of data and use

Page 2 of 19

FINAL

of technology. And we're partnering with four companies that have specific data that is
useful to us to hope -- to help us make underwriting decisions better.
Tailwinds, we believe going to continue into next year, and we've seen that in the first
month of 2020. So the rate environment is still positive into 2020. It's quite hard to tell
where it's going to go into 2021. I was asked the question earlier on today. I think we just
focus on sort of a one-year outlook. We'll have a better view of 2021 when we hit the
interims later this year.
Looking at the chart over the past five years, a good steady premium growth, a bit better
over the past couple of years, mainly driven by prices going down, profitability issues,
rating environment being better. Right hand side combined ratio with 100. Catastrophe
was impacted '17 and '18, a combination of factors in 2018. Good expense controls. We
have been focusing on our expenses. So we are getting the expense ratio down. There is
more to be done on the expense ratio, as we look into the future.

Bloomberg Transcript

Bottom left say, the interim and second dividend, total dividends is going at 5% per
annum, which is great. And return on capital is respectable 15% post tax, having have low
returns over the past couple of years.
We have a long-term incentive plan, which has been in place since 2009, and the aim is to
achieve if it tops out at 15%, plus risk free rate growth in net asset value, which is the gray
triangle is the top of the -- where the LTIPs kick in and the bottom of the gray triangle is
where -- sorry, the bottom is where the LTIPs kick in and the top is where the LTIPs top out.
The diamond is what we've actually achieved. So we've achieved very close over a 10 year
run, 15% plus risk free rate growth in net asset value. And our belief is we do that there
will be good total shareholder return, which is the more volatile line above it. But good
returns of 23% over the past 10 years for shareholders.
I'll now hand over to Sally to go through the financials.

Sally Lake

{BIO 20925273 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. So to reinforce what Andrew just said, we've got a really
encouraging story this year, with strong growth continuing, along with a really impressive
investment return. We'll come on to the fact that the reserving picture has definitely
improved, and we end the year in a good position from a capital perspective.
So just quickly before I go into the usual trio, we'll talk about a few KPIs. So we've talked
about the gross written premium growing at 15% slightly lower from a net perspective and
that's for two main reasons. Firstly, the market facilities business that goes into 5623,
which is backed by third-party capital initially comes into our core syndicates, and so that
impacts the gross growth, but the majority is reinsured out, so that has a different effect
on the net growth.
Secondly, we've talked about US trucking at the half year. In the second half of the year,
we've chosen to reinsure the back book of that sector out and that has also had an
Page 3 of 19



Company N ame: Beaz ley PL C
Company Ticker: BEZ L N Equity
Date: 2020-02-06

FINAL

impact on the net premium as well, so they are the main differences for the gross to net
relationship.
Just a quick mention of expenses that Andrew has already said, there is a slight
improvement here. I would -- I would not claim victory here at all. We're in a good position
from a growth perspective, so we should be getting better. And secondly, the sterling
versus US dollar position is also really helping us on that. So definitely more work to do
there.
And finally on the claims ratio welcome to the reserve releases, that's really had an impact
on the increase in the claims ratio over the year, and we'll come on to that.
So firstly onto investments, Stuart's in the back, so this is definitely his year. So big picture
let's look at the portfolio. Generally speaking, the two donors that we look at haven't
changed significantly over the last 12 months. We have 85% [ph] of our portfolio in fixed
income investments with around 15% focused on capital growth assets.

Bloomberg Transcript

One thing to note, as Stuart has been working very hard on for a number of years is that
our cash position is improving year-on-year, as we aim to put the money that we have to
work as much as possible and get the returns -- the returns working for the money that
we have.
So during the year, Stuart chooses to make decisions around increasing or decreasing
certain asset allocations depending on what's happening in markets at the time. And I
think we'll all agree that he has made some really good ones this year. So what has that
meant we needed a bigger axis on the Y -- on the Y axis this year, and we can see that
the overall return is 4.8%.
The main driver of this is that we have some movement in our core portfolio of the
interest rates reducing from 3.3 at the end of 2018 down to just over 2% at the end of
2019, as we mark-to-market that comes through as a capital gain for the year. But the
thing to note that is whilst it's a good thing for this year. It does change our expectation of
future returns going forward, as the yield on our -- on the majority of our investments is at
lower position.
Now on to reserving. So the main reason that we have a difference in our combined ratio
this year is that we didn't release a great deal of reserves this year and it's definitely
lower than we would normally see from an average year at Beazley. Firstly, if I look at the
positives, we had positive releases on our PAC division, along with positive albeit lower
than average releases on specialty lines and cyber and executive risk. The reasons for
that we've discussed at length already, where certain books within these areas have seen
continuing claims activity especially in D&O, employment practice and healthcare. These
positive releases have been almost entirely offset by strengthening on our some of our
short tail books. So firstly our reinsurance book saw some loss creep from Jebi, as well as
some performance and some areas of the book in addition to that.

Page 4 of 19



Company N ame: Beaz ley PL C
Company Ticker: BEZ L N Equity
Date: 2020-02-06

FINAL

Our marine book has seen some strengthening mainly caused by US trucking that we
talked about at the half year. And finally, our property book in the second half of the year
also saw some loss creep mainly driven by Irma. And also there was some strengthening
required in our construction and engineering book, which we no longer write. Overall
that's led to a small positive release for the year.
So that's the position looking back how do we look going forward, so on Sally's favorite
graph. So as you can see, we are seeing an improving picture from a reserving
perspective. To remind everyone what this graph is doing is looking at what we are
holding in terms of reserves and comparing that to a bottom of actuarial estimate, which
in itself has some prudence and is done consistently year-over-year.
And we aim to hold between 5% to 10% above the actuarial estimate. So it's pleasing to
see that this picture is improving, and the reasons for that is that we've been taking action
on our opening position in many areas, especially in specialty lines and CyEx for two years
now and that's beginning to pay off. Now whilst this is an encouraging picture, we're not
expecting the average reserve releases to go back to a more normalized position over
the next 12 months.

Bloomberg Transcript

And the reason for that is because whilst we will see some benefit from the improving
market in the short tail business, the longer tail business takes longer to crystallize and we
don't reserve -- release our reserves in those businesses until three years have passed
from writing. So this is an encouraging picture, but we're not expecting normal service to
resume immediately.
And then finally on the capital. So in very simple terms as we grow, so does our capital
requirement and so as on -- net premium increases, so do the requirements that various
people required us. The Lloyd's economic capital requirement is a thing that we tend to
talk about. And to remind everyone this requirement is based on a slightly different view
to what a lot of people are familiar with in Solvency II. It looks at ultimate position rather
than a one year. So it's higher from that perspective and also Lloyd's have an uplift of 35%
that they apply.
Now. we target internally 15% to 25% surplus over and above this number and that's an
internal target that we look to be in. And at the end of this year, price dividend were at
22% and then after dividend we expect to be at 90%. So remaining right in the middle of
that target range.
To remind everyone what we did in the second half of the year, we raised $300 million of
Tier-2 debts and that was for two reasons, one to pay off a retail bond that became due
at the end of September, which was done. But secondly we are in a significant period of
growth, and we wanted to increase our capital position from that perspective.
It's also worth noting that we still have undrawn banking facility of $225 million, which we
have not used yet, but it remains there should we need it. So Adrian is now going to give
underwriting perspective?

Adrian Cox

{BIO 16257010 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. Okay. (inaudible) So an underwriting profit last year of $4
million just under, which was slightly less than our business plan, and slightly below the
standards that we set ourselves. But as the slide mentions this is against the backdrop of
claims activity that's been higher post 2017 than we enjoyed before that. That is the claims
environment that we expect it to continue going forward, and our underwriting strategy
reflects that.
Whilst we've grown across much of the business, all of the divisions have elements within
them that are both growing and where we're very, very defensive and we expect that to
continue also. And whilst our treaty team for example, grew this year they wrote
significantly less than the original business plan because the marketplace disappointed us
a little bit last year. That's sort of action isn't new for us. We've been talking about and
dealing with cycle management and a change in claims environment for a long time now.

Bloomberg Transcript

The good news I think though is that the mood music has changed considerably over the
last 12 months. I've said this time last year that we expected to be able to beat the rate
change plan that we had for 2019, which we did, and the market has indeed evolved quite
a lot since then. Amongst carriers, brokers and customers alike, I think there is now a
shared view and understanding of the issues that we'll face and then need to do
something about it.
So we finished last year with a rate change of 6% on average that single number covers
quite a lot of variation at the one end, our terrorism book lost another 6 points of rates
and minus 6. But on the other hand, we had 31% on our D&O book, 7% on our aviation
book, so there is quite a spread of rate change across the portfolio. And I think that really
reflects the relative loss activity in those books. So again, we would like to reiterate, this is
not a hard market in the traditional sense, but it is one that's reacting relatively
proportionately to loss -- to loss activity. But this combined with the underwriting actions
we've taken over the last few years they give us the confidence to grow, and all teams
and all platforms did so encouragingly and both growth in dollar cents came on our
London platform for the first time in a while, where we had a number of tailwinds.
We had a changing marketplace. We had an increase in demand. So we saw an increased
submission flow onto our London platform last year and we saw a slight contraction in
supply as businesses and teams either withdrew from activity or shrank slightly or stopped
altogether, either voluntary or through regulatory action. And that combination of tailwinds
contributed to some good growth on our London platform.
The increase in reserve strength, I think is also a positive, and as a result of a number of
factors as well. The underwriting actions we've taken rate, increase in loss picks, limited
prior exposure and so on and so forth. And our expectations for next year are for the
market to continue where it left off this year.
If we look at the rate change, this is the combined actions since 2015. You can see once
again the benefit of our diversified portfolio. I think the thing to take from this is that we

Page 6 of 19



Company N ame: Beaz ley PL C
Company Ticker: BEZ L N Equity
Date: 2020-02-06

are above where we were in 2015 in aggregate, which is encouraging, led by property,
and which in itself was led by the D&F books at a large open market business is leading
the rate change there.

FINAL

PAC at the bottom has flattened out, again the terrorism rate change has been
depressing that, despite significant activity in Chile and the like that market remains quite
competitive.
So we do expect the tailwinds that we've talked about to continue this year and hopefully
longer, but we'll see which does give opportunity for more double-digit growth. I think
both here in London internationally and onshore in the US. But many of our lines and
teams have significantly increased underwriting controls in place and oversight to continue
to ensure that we evaluate and act appropriately to contain and manage the existing
issues and new ones that will undoubtedly emerge.

Bloomberg Transcript

We've been in a period of heightened underwriting action for the last few years and that
remediation has revised in -- has resulted in revised risk selection pricing business mix and
unfortunately from time to time, the closure of some businesses. So since 2018 we've
exited from construction and engineering, last year we exited trucking in the US and
earlier this year, we announced the closure of our UK marine regional book. We do use
other tools to manage volatility so Sally mentioned earlier we reinsured out our trucking
book, once we decided to put it into run off. It makes sense to cauterize that wound so
we contain the tail by reinsuring it and we also passed over the management of the
claims to the reinsurer, which saves us from management distraction over the next few
years.
Again as Sally mentioned, we expect, reserve releases to be slightly below average this
year. The difference in reserve release patents between our short and our long tail
business. It means that they will take longer to reach our average again.
So all-in-all, I think we need to be -- continue to be disciplined and prudent, but there is
some opportunity for sustainable profitable growth across all our platforms, which is a
better position I think then we found ourselves in this time last year. Got a question earlier
about the coronavirus, so to anticipate that might be useful to share some of that. We've
done some investigating across our portfolio. I think our main exposure to this is in our
contingency book where we write a number -- where we wrote some event cancellation
some conference cancellation.
And pandemic cover is not given as standard rate in contingency, it's something you have
to buy back, especially, and we have a limited aggregate capacity for that. It's a coverage
that is -- it's a class that's covered by our casualty catastrophe reinsurance. So if we do
have a number of losses coming from the corona virus. It does stack into a single loss with
an attachment point of $25 million. So it's relatively contained. When we look at the
number of events we're exposed over the next 6 months, we don't expect that much
activity.

Page 7 of 19



Company N ame: Beaz ley PL C
Company Ticker: BEZ L N Equity
Date: 2020-02-06

There may come a time if this pandemic gets worse, that people will begin to sue each
other for not behaving or acting appropriately and which will give us other exposures but
we can't really identify them yet. So as we look at it now the coronavirus has some fairly
limited impact.

FINAL

Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

Thanks for that Adrian. So let's just have a look at the overall outlook for the year, because
we've been preparing for Brexit for a number of years now and it is going to happen at
some point. So we feel we are fully prepared with our European insurance company out
of Dublin. And we are keen to grow European business. So it's important to us and of
course we're using Lloyd's Brussels. So the combination of the platform in Dublin and
Lloyd's Brussels means we can continue to grow in Europe, which is important to us as we
talked about growth earlier on in Europe.

Bloomberg Transcript

We continue to invest in technology, which is quite key. So looking at our initiatives Beazley
Digital, and Faster, Smarter Underwriting and then linking that to the future at Lloyd's. So
those two initiatives link very closely with the complex underwriting and the risk exchange
which Lloyd's looking at and they're going to announce I think sometime this month, what
the details behind what they want to do. We are big supporters of what they're trying to
achieve, trying to get business placed more cheaply and more effectively into the London
market and thereby bring more business into London.
Adrian talked about some people withdrawing from areas and that's always a great
opportunity for an organic growth company to pick up some of their business and to pick
up some of their people. So we do see an opportunity in 2020 to continue to do that.
Sally mentioned the running yield is now 2.1%, which is lower than it was at the beginning
of last year. So that's what we expect plus whatever we get on the capital growth assets
in 2020.
And last topic, again, those people who managed to read the whole report and accounts
will have moved on to the Responsible Business Report, which is we've also issued this
morning, which is talking about some of the things we're doing around climate change.
We are recruiting a Sustainability Officer, who is going to be that focal point of the
opportunities around climate change, the threats of climate change, the things we should
be doing for our clients, as well as our own impact as a company and our strategy around
climate change. So there'll be more to come throughout 2020 on that.
We are now open to questions. There is a mic wandering around.

Questions And Answers
Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi, sir. Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. I have lots of questions. I'll try to restrict myself.
So for Sally, the specialty lines loss pick it's actually -- it's reduced on the opening for 2019,
I was [ph] looking at the triangles at the back. I think there's some commentary in the text
about this is mix. So maybe just give us the breakdown because presumably there is parts
Page 8 of 19



Company N ame: Beaz ley PL C
Company Ticker: BEZ L N Equity
Date: 2020-02-06

of that where the loss pick has gone up and there is parts where the loss pick has gone
down or there's a mix effect. So that would be the first question.

FINAL

Secondly, I had expected your capital surplus to go up a bit more with the benefit of the
debt issue. I appreciate that debt isn't, you can't count in Solvency II, but you can't count it
in your kind of ECR measure. So was there any sort of moving parts, look like the Solvency
II equity must have come down a bit in the second half.
The only other question, could you just clarify what the total sort of reserve adjustments
were for short tail in 2019, as in -- I'm describing as one-off, but the Jebi affect, the
trucking effect, I think it was more of a trucking effect also in the second half because of
the reinsurance you bought, I think it was an Irma effect. I can't remember if I'm missing
anything, but just the quantum of that sort of short tail negative would be useful? Thanks.

A - Sally Lake

{BIO 20925273 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. So the -- taking those in order, so the SL loss pick. So we are opening each line of
business that we write consistently year-on-year, but we hold different parts of Specialty
Lines and another areas at different levels each year. So the three things that are held
differently and the mix that's factored that is that we open our, what I call the medium tail
traditional business at the same loss ratio. We do have cyber in our Specialty Lines
division, as well as in the Cyber division, have to take another question on that. And then
we also have our market facilities in there as well as we -- I spoke about earlier on. So
those three things are being opened at a similar -- at a similar level between '18 and '19,
but the addition of them depends on how much premium is written. So that's the effect
that's happening.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Presumably the healthcare, D&O, EPL is higher loss picks?

A - Sally Lake

{BIO 20925273 <GO>}

Yes, and they're opening at the same level, but they are all grouped together with other
things bring a different premium feature.

A - Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

This was -- we already recognized that last year. (Multiple Speakers).

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

There's no additional raising versus what you raised two points, three points in aggregate
in '18.

A - Sally Lake

{BIO 20925273 <GO>}

The only change is mix.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Is mix. Okay. Great.

FINAL

A - Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

So the key issue for this year is, we're not taking the benefit of the rate increase on those
lines in the loss picks. We're continuing to hold them until we see where this claims
inflation goes.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Right. Okay.

A - Sally Lake

{BIO 20925273 <GO>}

And then on to the debt. So we raised debt in order to use it, and so we were planning to
grow, as we did. And so we've taken -- we've taken advantage of the market that we've
got, and we've remained in a good position in the range. We have to pay our dividend
and where we are is a strong position of capital going forward. So it's -- we were
expecting to use it when we did it. So generally speaking, the capital has grown up in line
with what we expect to grow our growth rate.

A - Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I guess the only issue there is the final business plan was probably slightly larger growth
than we originally thought back in June, July, when we were thinking about it and we
raised the debt. So the growth may be marginally higher.

A - Sally Lake

{BIO 20925273 <GO>}

Yeah. Possibly. Yes, good point. And then the last one?

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

All the short tail reserves prior year. I just want to know the quantum to sort of back that
out as you (Multiple Speakers).

A - Sally Lake

{BIO 20925273 <GO>}

I do need a ruler. It looks -- if I just look at page 13 below would looks about all those
aggregate looks about 60 million to me.

Basically all the (Multiple Speakers).

Thank you. Jonny Urwin, UBS. So just -- just back to the reserving buffers, surprise-surprise
just how should we think about the opening loss picks 2020. It sounds like you're going to
hold the line a bit and keep a bit of conservatism just to be sure, in which case would we
expect on your business plan further reserve buffers to grow again in a normalized claims
environment for 2020? It's basically the same question as last year?
And then just on 1 Jan pricing, what's -- what's your, I think what's your experience there.

A - Sally Lake

{BIO 20925273 <GO>}

So we haven't decided how we're opening 2020 yet. But I would probably think that at
the moment, we wouldn't have any reason to change as yet, depending on what happens
during the year. So if we're looking to start at the 10 hour [ph], I would probably say, it
would be in line with what we've done over the last couple of years unless my colleagues
disagree with make. And then in terms of the reserve buffer, I've spent 14 years, so I'm
basically not predicting what's going to happen over the year. So -- but if we're continuing
to do the right thing and opening a prudential margin, then we should remain in a good
place in the buffer. I'm not going to give you any more than that.

A - Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

The buffer has too many elements driving it because it's the end of a very detailed
process of looking at four to five different business lines across a number of underwriting
years. It's very difficult for Sally to predict and we don't predict. So we are going through a
very consistent process, and therefore, we expect the buffer to come somewhere
between 5% and 10% mainly because the process is consistent.
So we're not trying to target a certain number. It's the output of the process. We do know
it's lower in the past last couple of years mainly because of the catastrophe claims, where
we're holding no buffer from catastrophe losses, where the actuary in that business held
were the same by default. If you've got no buffer, you're going to lower the overall
average about that.

Is it fair to say that you're more comfortable like at 6.8%, i.e. would you say this is a
normal-ish point.

A - Sally Lake

We've been in a similar place in the past, which is what I'd say.

{BIO 16257010 <GO>}

Or you can say in the summer that we were going to -- we hope to end the year higher
than we started and we did.
January 1 prices, I think the marketplace start to work continued where it left off at the end
of the year. And so I don't the -- I don't think the mood has shifted at all in general. I think
is a continuation of what we've seen largely speaking what the market is doing is in sync
with what we wanted to do, So we're more -- we are more in sync with the market than
we were a couple of years ago. I think the only area, we're a little more disappointed was
on the catastrophe treaty side, where although there was some rate in the US and Europe
and the UK and that was still flat to down, which is not what we are looking for.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

All right. It's Kamran Hossain from RBC. I want to just ask about the -- in your statement, in
the Q&A, there is a discussion around the combined ratio, and what we should expect for
2020. I guess, we saw here this time last year and from memory, the number was
something like 93 for the year, with slightly lower reserve releases than we'd anticipate.
So we're now sitting here a year later, with six points of rate rise reserve releases to be
lower again this year. How we kind of square, you're starting at 93 last year, six points of
rate, a similar reserve release picture to mid 90s.

A - Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

Just at the starting point. We're just not taking the benefit of the rate through the
combined ratio. Yeah, that is reserving conservatively forward so that benefit is not really
feeding through into the combined ratio. Now we hope it will at some point. When Adrian
talked about the spread of rates, we're just not taking that benefit. I mean any other
comments on. I didn't hear.
Obviously since then we have seen some more claims inflation in some lines, which we
didn't recognized a year ago and have recognized this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Benjamin Cohen

{BIO 21227414 <GO>}

Thanks. Ben Cohen, Investec. I had two questions, firstly, just to follow-up, can you be
more explicit on those -- on the Speciality lines. The sort of the delta between the price
rises that you're seeing versus the loss cost inflation, that you're observing and any
forward-looking view that you'd like to give on that would also be helpful. And the second
question was, if you achieve the double-digit top line, I think that you were talking about,
would you expect your expense ratio to improve further this year.
Thank you.

A - Adrian Cox

{BIO 16257010 <GO>}

So the rate change that we show is a risk-adjusted rate change based upon the pricing
tools that we have, and all the pricing tools we have elements in them, which adjust for
inflation, then they do it in different ways according to what we think the exposure base is
or what's happening to the losses. But we do try to adjust for inflation in our pricing tools.
The inflation that we have reacts in different ways. So is it going to be exactly the same as
the inflation that we end up experiencing probably not. But we do try to think about
inflation as we do our pricing tools and we do think about inflation as we set our loss
reserves.
And so the 6% that you see, is a risk-adjusted rate change, might it be that the inflation
you are seeing particularly outweighs the long-term average, yes it can, from time to time.
And I think that's why we're seeing rate changes of 31 for example in D&O because
there's some catch-up to be done because inflation may have jumped a little bit.

On the expense ratio, I would definitely like to see the expense ratio improve. There are
things that are under our control, there are other thing as I've spoken about with the
Sterling that can go the other way against this. But yeah, we will definitely be looking to on
an annual basis, improve our expenses position.

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

Andreas van Embden, Peel Hunt. My first question is about specialty lines rate, rates
seemed flat in 2019 year-on-year. Just wondered why that was.

A - Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

That's a typo.

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

Oh, that's a typo. Oh, okay.

A - Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

So we inverted PAC and special lines.

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

I saw it was going up.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

So it's actually should be 5 in specialty lines and zero for PAC. So it was a good pick up.
We're hoping no one noticed that.

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

So the 5% you're happy with the 5%.

A - Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

As being the right number.

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

No, no, but (Multiple Speakers).

A - Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

So I know the right level. Being the right level of rate increases.

A - Adrian Cox

{BIO 16257010 <GO>}

I think broadly speaking, yes. I think it's more important is what it is can we maintain that
momentum this year. But yes, and I think we were happy with 5% last year.

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

And another question about specialty business, it seems that the architects and engineers
book seems to have deteriorated is this linked to what we're seeing in D&O and
employers' liability or is this something one-off completely different?

FINAL

A - Sally Lake

{BIO 20925273 <GO>}

'18 strengthened a bit. No, it's a different thing. It was (inaudible) experience in one year.

A - Adrian Cox

{BIO 16257010 <GO>}

Yeah. We had a couple of big losses in one year that's all.

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

So it's not a spill over from social inflation onto other?

A - Adrian Cox

{BIO 16257010 <GO>}

No. I mean we do -- we have a large risk and e-book, where we cover some of the -some very large design professionals and contractors with some quite big events out
there, and they are involved in some quite big infrastructure projects, so we can get some
big losses from time to time. Last year we saw a couple.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

And my final question is about the adverse claims development in the US cover holder
book. Can you may be talk around that what are you seeing in that portfolio? Are you reunderwriting that? Is there any significant reserve addition --

A - Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

Yeah. We're taking quite a -- we're taking quite a lot of action on that covers book and on
property side since 2017, the reserve deterioration you've seen is a reflection of the
catastrophes that Sally was mentioning that deteriorated this year. Some of that came
through the covers book. That our cover holders as a -- the cover holder book in general
was slower to react than our open market book. And so we had to take some quite
severe underwriting action on that to pick the partners we could work with and to get the
underwriting remediation that we needed. So that book is quite a lot smaller than it used
to be because we needed to force some change, but the reserve deterioration you saw
was mostly related to the cat activity, and mostly Irma.

Q - Nick Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

Thank you. Nick Johnson from Numis. Just a question on, you say that you expect medium
term combined ratio to get back to -- into the low 90s. Is that based on the pricing you've
seen to-date. What does it include the outlook for 2020 if we see another year of rate
increases, is it plausible for us to expect the combined ratio to get below 90? Thank you.

A - Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}
Page 15 of 19

Below 90.

Q - Nick Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah.

A - Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

It has been below 90 obviously in history. So in theory, that is -- that is possible. I think
we're just looking at the underwriting now and compare it with other times and we'll feel
comfortable about the underwriting now based on the rate, we're getting and the change
in terms that we've seen. And therefore, we believe based on the balance, so we can get
back to where we've historically been in low 90s what we've averaged over a decade or
two. So I think that gives us a sensible place to be.

Q - Nick Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

So it does include what your expectations are for rate increases this year.

A - Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

Let's say looking at the -- now, so we got fantastic great rate increase this year and there
were claims didn't follow it, in theory we are better than that.

Q - Nick Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Yes, hi. Firstly on, I -- just management liability, D&O books, healthcare, we are seeing
quite pronounced rate increases there. I was just wondering how much of those
pronounced rate increases are driven by loss activity that we've seen recently versus your
initial expectations, so if look at the last three underwriting years, where do you stand
versus initial expectations. And I guess it's also driving force for the overall markets
whether or not you can comment or not, I would appreciate that.
And the second question would be on cyber, over the past half year we've seen quite a
lot of changes when it comes to your businesses. So we've seen cancellation of the
agreement and we've seen you coming out, we see new product, with rendering [ph].
Can you please give us an idea of the changes in that line of business and how it could
potentially impact growth going forward.

A - Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

If I start with the second one, because I can remember that, nothing really much has
happened to our Cyber plan. So we had a joint venture with Munich Re, called Vector
which was specifically targeting 14,514,000 business and trying to sell cyber insurance to
them in a different way. Because we felt that companies like that needed hundreds of
millions of dollars of cyber not 50 and we joined up immediately to be able to sell primary
cyber insurance in chunks that were big enough for them to go to build those towers. That
Page 16 of 19

FINAL

job is largely done and so we decided that we didn't need to be joined at the hip in the
way that we wanted to do that.
It was a very successful four years we had with them. And we still -- Munich Re are still a
very close trading partner with us, there was definitely no separation. We just decided to
go -- we decided to cease the joint venture and we're working with RenRe to make sure
that we still are in our appropriate line size for large risk business. But the story on cyber is
unchanged. Still a growth story in the US, all of the growth is starting to tail-off a bit as the
market begins to mature, but we're seeing some very exciting prospects internationally
as demand is beginning to take off. And so our plans for cyber are changed.
Looking back at the first question, healthcare, the rate changes are absolutely linked to
loss activity. I think the market has changed more than we had anticipated that it would do
this time last year, which is a positive. Do we need that rate change? Yes, we do. Have we
fundamentally changed our plans for those lines of business, which are the heart of the
claims inflation? No, we haven't not yet.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Just a follow-up on that. You think that the rate change you are getting now covers loss
cost inflation going forward from the way you see it today, I guess.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

Yes. So 31% rate change we got last year is definitely higher than trend and but there is
some catch up to be done, right because rate change took a while, it took a while to
come. As I've said that it is a risk-adjusted rate change, right. So within our D&O pricing,
there was an element of measuring inflation as well. And do I think that price will continue?
Our plan for 2020, is that, that momentum is increasing. Yes.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Hi. Just the first question is coming back to the combined ratio, which you see the
underlying margin for 2019, If I look at different moving parts. It feels like maybe there is a
point or two of margin build in reserves and maybe a little bit of excess catastrophe is
sort of mid-90s, fair is a starting point, there? And related to this in your reserve margin,
do you take credit for the pricing improvements in the actuarial best estimate, but not in
the, what you book. And so I guess, does the benefit come true, as an increase in the
actuarial -- in the margin over the actuarial best estimate?
Then the second question, just going back to cyber, how material is the agreement with
RenRe in terms of hedging, I guess accumulation process. And how far are you from a
point, where you would see that as a constraint on growth? Thank you.

A - Sally Lake

{BIO 20925273 <GO>}

So on the actuarial numbers, so to remind you the best estimates, the measure that we
look against is not our best estimate. It's got some prudence within it already. But that
said, we do make allowances for the rate change that we're getting, as well as making
Page 17 of 19



Company N ame: Beaz ley PL C
Company Ticker: BEZ L N Equity
Date: 2020-02-06

allowances for claims inflation. So we do take credit for some, but we also take -- we take
the rough with the smooth, as it were in the actuarial number, and always have done, and
we approach that consistently throughout the graph.

FINAL

In terms of combined ratio for this year, I think we've said that mid-90s is -- is a good
starting place for that. And then the -- did I miss the last -- did I miss one there.

A - Adrian Cox

{BIO 16257010 <GO>}

No. I think the last question is about -- was about sorry, but, I mean you raised a good
point. So we like to maintain a diversified business anyway. So we don't want to -- you can
have too much of a good thing. So we want to make sure that we don't write too much
cyber, just like we don't want to write too much of anything. Cyber does have systemic or
accumulation risk, and so we do need to make sure that we measure that as best we can
and we hedge against that, which we do. The RenRe agreement that you referenced
wasn't -- isn't driven by the need to shed aggregate or to hedge, we do that in different
ways but we do have a number of different ways that we both manage the total amount
of cyber that we write and that we manage the accumulation risk. And that's something
we take a great deal of care over because it's a meaningful book for us.

Q - Unidentified Participant
And at the moment do you still see significant headroom to where -- I guess the binding
constraint on that to be achieved.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Adrian Cox

{BIO 16257010 <GO>}

Yes, yes. No, we're still keen to take full advantage of the growth in the Southern market.
Absolutely.

Anything else.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Sorry, just on your own reinsurance purchase as an average reinsurance. Looking at the
PMLs, at the back, it looks like your PMLs gone down slightly for nat cats. And I think you
referenced the cyber PML is equal to the Northeast windstorm now so did you buy a bit
more reinsurance or is that just repositioning, and broadly just remind us is the casualty
clash cover. I think it's 35 access 150 [ph], is that still broadly the same or is there any
changes there.

A - Adrian Cox

{BIO 16257010 <GO>}

It's the cash to cash is broadly one 14x30 for combined syndicates I attachment point of
25 the Group roughly speaking. And our PMLs came down a little bit, mostly because what
we did on the growth side rather than buying more reinsurance per se.
