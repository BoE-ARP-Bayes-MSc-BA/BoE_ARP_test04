FINAL

Good morning, thank you. Welcome to the 2014 year-end conference call for the Markel
Corporation. My name is Tom Gayner and I'm joined by Anne Waleski, Mike Crowley and
Richie Whitt today. We've got some good and fun results to share with you this morning
and Anne will jump in with the numbers in just a second.
Before we get into the details, though, there is one thought I'd like to share with you,
mainly this. A year ago when we had this call, we and you would have been concerned
about competitive conditions in the insurance markets with new capital providers
continuing to enter the business. We would have all been concerned about interest rates
being low and the struggle to earn investment income, we would have been concerned
about the lack of premium leverage, we would have been concerned about an equity
market that was an all-time high and seemingly bereft of good values. We would have all
been concerned about the integration of the Alterra acquisition and we would have all
been concerned about global geopolitical issues. We probably would have had a similar
list the year before that and year before that and so on and so on. Sometimes it seems
like the issues we face at any given point in time sound like the long list of side effects
that you hear in the drug commercials on TV. There's always something to be concerned
about.
But some of those issues led folks to model an outcome that suggested that the Markel
Corporation had a tough time earning more than a single-digit return on equity on a
comprehensive basis. Despite what the models said, the very good news is that we are
reporting a double-digit return of 14% in our book value per share this year. Those results
came about because of the hard work, creativity and dedication of the people of Markel.
We'll also acknowledge and be grateful for the good luck involved in things like the major
catastrophes in 2014.
All of those concerns I just mentioned at the beginning were valid a year ago and most if
not all of them remain relevant today. When we look back at each year, there always
seems to be some reason why things are going to get worse. Fortunately, the people in
this organization always seem to find a way to meet the challenges and keep building the
value and values of this company. I expect that to continue to be the case over time.
With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anne Waleski
to review the numbers and then to Mike Crowley and Richie Whitt, who will give you some
commentary on our insurance operations. I will then return to briefly discuss Markel
Ventures and our investment operations. Then we will open the floor for Q&A. Anne?

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I too am happy to report that 2014 has
been both an exciting and profitable year here at Markel. We had an excellent finish to the
year, with our investing, underwriting, and Markel Ventures operations all contributing to
our success.

FINAL

Our total operating revenues grew 19%, eclipsing $5 billion for the first time, coming in at
$5.1 billion in 2014 from $4.3 billion in 2013. The most significant drivers of this increase
continue to be the inclusion of a full year of underwriting revenue from legacy Alterra
product offerings in 2014, higher revenue from the Hagerty business and higher
investment income due to our larger investment portfolio. Also contributing to the
increase other revenues were up 24% to $883 million from $711 million last year, primarily
due to revenue growth within Markel Ventures.
Moving into the underwriting results, in 2014, gross written premiums were $4.8 billion,
which is an increase of 23% compared to 2013. The increase was driven by the inclusion of
a full year premiums from legacy Alterra products in 2014 compared to eight months in
2013, which impacted all three of our ongoing underwriting segments. We also
experienced growth in our U.S. Insurance segment within the Wholesale division primarily
in our casualty product lines and in our Specialty division across various product lines.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net written premiums for 2014 were approximately $3.9 billion, up 21% from the prior year
for the same reasons I just discussed. Net retention of gross premium volume was 82%
for 2014 and 83% for 2013. The decrease in net retention was due to 12 months of
premium contributions from Alterra in 2014 compared to eight months in 2013. The slight
decrease which is in line with our expectations is primarily due to higher use of
reinsurance and certain insurance products previously underwritten by Alterra.
Earned premiums for 2014 increased 19% compared to 2013. The increase was primarily
driven by the increase in gross written premiums that I just mentioned. Also contributing
to the increase in earned premiums was higher earned premiums from our Hagerty
business, which we began writing in the first quarter of 2014.
The U.S. Insurance segment included $203 million of earned premium from Hagerty in
2014 compared to $98 million in 2013. The consolidated combined ratio was 95% in 2014
compared to 97% in 2013. In 2014, a lower expense ratio was partially offset by less
favorable prior accident year's loss ratio compared to 2013.
Underwriting acquisition and insurance expenses in 2013 included transaction and other
acquisition-related costs of $75 million attributable to the acquisition of Alterra or 2 points
on the combined ratio. Excluding transaction and other acquisition related costs in 2013,
the 2014 expense ratio was comparable to 2013. The 2014 combined ratio included $436
million of favorable development on prior year's loss reserves compared to $411 million in
2013. The benefit of the favorable development on prior year loss reserves had less of an
impact on the combined ratio in 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher earned premium
volume in 2014.
Now, we'll talk about the results of Markel Ventures. In 2014, revenue from Markel
Ventures were $838 million, compared to $686 million in 2013. Revenues from our Markel
Ventures operations increased in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the acquisition
of Cottrell in July 2014 and the acquisition of Eagle Construction in August 2013.

FINAL

We also experienced higher revenues in our manufacturing operations in 2014, primarily
driven by cyclical changes in industry demand for transportation equipment, partially offset
by lower revenues in our other manufacturing operations, due to fewer orders and
shipments in 2014 as compared to 2013.
Net income to shareholders from Markel Ventures was slightly less than $10 million in 2014
compared to $24 million in 2013. Net income from our Markel Ventures operations
decreased in 2014 as compared to 2013, due to less favorable results in our
manufacturing and non-manufacturing operations in 2014, which were partially offset by
net income attributable through acquisitions.
The decrease in net income in our manufacturing operations in 2014 was due in part to
the lower revenues I just mentioned. The decrease in net income in our nonmanufacturing operations was primarily attributable to less favorable results at Diamond
Healthcare driven by a $13.7 million goodwill impairment charge taken by Markel Ventures
in the fourth quarter of 2014. Markel Ventures' adjusted EBITDA, which excludes this
charge, was $95 million in 2014 compared to $84 million in 2013. The increase in adjusted
EBITDA in 2014 is due to acquisitions.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving onto our investment results. Net investment income for 2014 was $363 million
compared to $317 million in 2013. The increase in net investment income in 2014 is
primarily due to a larger investment portfolio in 2014 as a result of the acquisition of
Alterra in 2013. Net realized investment gains for 2014 were $46 million, compared to $63
million in 2013. Variability and the timing of realized and unrealized investment gains and
losses is to be expected.
Looking at our total results for the year, we reported net income to shareholders of $321
million compared to $281 million in 2013. The effective tax rate was 26% in 2014 compared
to an effective tax rate of 22% in 2013. The increase in the effective tax rate was driven by
higher earnings taxed at 35% in 2014 and a smaller benefit from our foreign operations in
2014, which are taxed at a lower rate.
Comprehensive income was $936 million for 2014. I think that's worth repeating.
Comprehensive income was $936 million for 2014. That compares to $459 million a year
ago. The increase is primarily attributed to net unrealized gains on our investments during
the period. As a result of our investing, underwriting and Markel Ventures operations,
book value per share increased approximately 14%, as Tom said, to $544 per share at
December 31, 2014 from $477 per share at the end of 2013.
Finally, I'll make a couple of comments on cash flows and the balance sheet. Net tax
provided by operating activities was $717 million for 2014 compared to $746 million for
2013. In 2014, we made higher payments for income taxes compared to 2013. These
payments were partially offset by higher cash flows from investment income during 2014,
primarily due to having a larger portfolio in 2014 as I previously mentioned. Invested
assets at the holding company were $1.5 billion at December 31, 2014, compared to $1.3
billion at the end of 2013. The increase in invested assets is primarily the result of

Page 4 of 20



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2015-02-12

dividends received from our subsidiaries and an increase in unrealized gains on our
investments.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike to discuss operations

F. Michael Crowley

{BIO 6836605 <GO>}

Thanks, Anne. Good morning. As stated in previous quarters, the U.S. Insurance segment
comprises all direct business written on our U.S. Insurance company and includes all of the
underwriting results of our Wholesale, Specialty divisions as well as certain products
written by our Global Insurance team.
For the fourth quarter, gross written premium was up 4% over the prior year. Year-to-date
gross written premiums have increased 11% over prior year. This increase was due in a
large part to the Alterra lines of business that are now included in this segment. Excluding
these lines, premium volume was up 6%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Keep in mind that we have been exiting or re-underwriting some lines in our Specialty,
Wholesale division and this has impacted growth. The U.S. Insurance segment combined
ratio for the quarter was 90% compared to 87% last year. The combined ratio for the year
was 95% compared to 92% in 2013. As discussed in previous quarters, the higher U.S.
Insurance segment combined ratio was driven by less favorable development of prior
year losses due in part to adverse development in the architects and engineers line of
business earlier in 2014.
While we continued to see favorable development on our casualty lines of business in
2014, these redundancies were less than in 2013. Partially offsetting this impact was a
lower year-over-year expense ratio. The improvement in the expense ratio was primarily
due to non-reoccurring transaction costs recorded in 2013 associated with the Alterra
acquisition.
The rate environment remained unchanged in the fourth quarter. We continue to achieve
modest single-digit rate increases on our small and medium-sized accounts, consistent
with previous quarters. The market for larger global accounts remained very competitive
and the rate for most lines remained under pressure.
During the fourth quarter of 2014, and the first part of 2015, we announced several
management promotions in the U.S. segment. Britt Glisson was appointed President of
Global Insurance. Britt has been with Markel since 1990 serving in a number of
management role, including President of Markel Insurance Company and most recently
Chief Administrative Officer of Markel, a position he retains along with his newly
delegated responsibilities. Britt has been working closely with the global team for the past
year having spent most of the year in Bermuda.
Steve Letak was named Chief Operating Officer for Global Insurance and Chief
Administrative Officer for Bermuda. Steve has been with Markel since 2010, joining us as
part of Markel's acquisition of FirstComp and was most recently Controller for the
Page 5 of 20

Specialty division. He has 30 years' experience in the industry and has both his CPA and
CPCU designations.

FINAL

Jim Arnold was appointed Chief Administrative Officer for the Wholesale division. Jim also
joined Markel in 2010. He has significant experience in strategic planning and business
analytics. Previously he served as Chief Administrative Officer of FirstComp, where he was
responsible for operations, customer service, legal and compliance teams.
When Markel acquired THOMCO in 2012, Greg Thompson who built and led THOMCO
for 33 years stayed with Markel and soon after the acquisition assumed the position of
President of the Specialty division. Greg did so with enthusiasm and a great sense of
urgency and commitment. Recently Greg expressed a desire to step down from his
position, but remained with Markel and focus his energy on building programs which is a
real passion of his.

Bloomberg Transcript

Effective April 1, 2015, Matt Parker will take over from Greg as President of the Specialty
division. Matt most recently served as Managing Executive, Markel FirstComp where he
and his team have consistently improved results every year. Matt has a very strong
management background having spent 15 years with Gillette and Procter & Gamble
managing businesses out of London and Germany. Since joining Markel, Matt's track
record is excellent and we look forward to his leadership of this division.
Chad Bertucci has been promoted to Managing Executive for Markel FirstComp effective
April 1, 2015 replacing Matt Parker. Chad joined FirstComp in 2006 and has served in
several capacities including Vice President, Strategic Planning; Vice President of
underwriting, loss control and audit.
At the beginning of the fourth quarter we announced the combining of Markel and Alterra
claims units into one organization for Markel North American and Bermuda. Nick Conca
was appointed Chief Claims Officer and will be responsible for the strategic vision and
performance of this department. Nick joined Markel with the Alterra acquisition and has
more than 25 years' experience in the insurance industry, including senior leadership
positions with several international brokerage, insurance and claims organizations.
All of these management promotions clearly illustrate the depth of talent that exists at
Markel. Our ability to attract, retain and promote top performer from within this
organization, supports our belief that we are well positioned for success in the future.
I'll now turn the call over to Richie Whitt.

Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Thanks, Mike. Good morning everybody. Today I will focus my comments on our 2014
underwriting results for both International Insurance and Reinsurance segment. You may
recall that last quarter, I used terms like solid and business as usual to describe the first
nine months of the year, there is word equally applied to our full year results for both
segments. We had a strong finish to 2014 in both the International Insurance and
Page 6 of 20



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2015-02-12

Reinsurance segments and reported improved 2014 combined ratios in both segments
compared to 2013.

FINAL

The International Insurance segment which includes direct business and facultative
placements written by our Markel International division as well as that written by our
Global Insurance division performed extremely well in 2014.
Gross written premiums in the International Insurance segment increased 9% to $1.2 billion
for the year. The combined ratio was 93% compared to 94% in the prior year. The
increase in premium writings in 2014 was primarily due to Global Insurance division, which
was created after the acquisition of Alterra on May 1, 2013. Consequently, it only
contributed eight months of business in 2013.
The lower segment combined ratio was driven by more favorable prior year takedowns,
that was partially offset by higher current accident year loss ratio. The increase in the
current accident year loss ratio was primarily driven by favorable development on prior
accident years for the Global Insurance division, which was included in the current accident
year for reporting purposes in 2013. I know that makes a lot of sense but Anne will explain
it if you need her to.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now I would like to discuss the 2014 results of the Reinsurance segment, which includes
reinsurance programs written by our Global Reinsurance division as well as those written
by the Markel International division.
Gross premiums written for this segment were $1.1 billion for 2014, up from $566 million a
year ago. The increase in premium writings was primarily due to including the full year
writings for products previously written by Alterra in 2014 compared to eight months of
writing in 2013, obviously, a much bigger difference than in the International Insurance
segment. Keep in mind, Reinsurance, big dates for renewals on Reinsurance are January 1
and April 1. So obviously those were not included in 2013.
The combined ratio for the Reinsurance segment was 96% compared to 109% last year.
The reduction in the 2014 combined ratio was driven by more favorable prior year
takedowns in the lower expense ratio. The lower expense ratio in 2014 is driven by Alterra
acquisition related cost included in 2013. Included in the 2013 current accident year loss
ratio was favorable movement on pre-acquisition accident years related to the Alterra
company. These takedowns totaled approximately $23 million. Excluding these takedowns
and about $25 million of cat losses in 2013, the current accident year loss ratio was flat
period-over-period.
As Mike said, market conditions remain competitive in the Reinsurance segment. We
continue to see rate pressure and saw rate decreases during the January 1 renewal
process. The International Insurance segment also continues to experience rate pressure
with property and marine and energy being the most heavily impacted at this point.
We've stated at many times, we're not going to chase premium when we feel rates are
inadequate. We continue to reinforce this message with our underwriters and
Page 7 of 20

FINAL

underwriting teams, everyday. As a result of current market conditions and our
underwriting discipline, organic growth in these segments will be challenging in 2015.
So to quickly sum it up and hand it over to Tom, 2014 was a great year for International
Insurance and Reinsurance segments. Given current marketing conditions, 2015 will be
challenging but sort of similar to Tom's earlier comments, when have we not said that
about markets. But we're very confident in our team's ability to navigate tough markets
and deliver solid results.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Tom to discuss investments and Markel Ventures. Thanks.

Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Richie. Well, everyone here is reported to you as Frank Sinatra might have sung
to you, it was a very good year. For Markel Ventures we grew in 2014 both organically and
by acquisition. Ventures total revenues grew 22% from $686 million to $838 million and
our adjusted EBITDA grew from $83.8 million to $95 million. The Ventures group includes
some businesses that are performing better than we expected and some that are not. I
think this will almost always be the case from a diverse group of companies. In aggregate,
I'm very pleased with the economic value being created from these operations, and I'm
optimistic about 2015 from the group. Several of our companies are cyclical and tied to
overall levels of economic activity. So far, our order books continue to look good and I
expect 2015 to be a good year for Markel Ventures.
In our equity portfolio, we earned 18.1% in 2014 compared to the 13.7% return of the S&P
500. I simply could not be happier with this. More important than the returns of anyone
here though is the fact that over the last 25 years we've earned over 200 basis points
more than the S&P 500. I would sign up for that sort of out performance for the next 25
years in a New York minute. Our commitment to equities has added immense value to
Markel over the decade. We'll do our best and continue to follow our time-tested
approach and try to keep that going into the future.
In our fixed income operations, we earned 6.5% and fulfilled our goals from fixed income
investing of earning a positive spread on the insurance funds we hold and protecting the
balance sheet against credit losses, as well as the possibility of rising interest rates. We
continue to keep our duration a bit shorter in our estimates of the duration of our
insurance liabilities. The actual foregone investment income from maintaining this
approach is small compared to the risk of what would happen if interest rates rose
dramatically. We will continue to be defensive as long as rates are low.
Again, thank you for your long-term interest in Markel. We love what we do here and we
love the people we get to work with. 2014 was an intense and fun year and we look
forward to meeting the challenges of 2015 and beyond.
And with that, we'd now love to take your questions. Thank you. If you could open it up for
questions, please.

Q - Vincent M. DeAugustino

{BIO 17976273 <GO>}

Just to start out with a question I guess for the team, no one in particular. But with Tom's
opening comment about just modeling out a tougher environment, and so here I'm
particularly thinking about the comments around Alterra. So, what I'm wondering is that
might imply that you might have baked in some additional margin of safety or excess
margin of safety beyond what was kind of needed. And if that implies that we might begin
to see some initial accident year PIKs coming in and then might also see some favorable
development on some of those kind of realignment actions that were kind of taken over
the last year.

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Vincent, this is Richie. I'll give it a shot. We're incredibly consistent in terms of our approach
of trying to build reserves that are more likely redundant and deficient in building a margin
of safety in our reserves. This is something we've done after every single one of our
historical acquisitions. And so I think this is a case where past history is probably pretty
good indicator of what future performance might look like. We're doing very consistent
with Alterra, as what we did with a Terra Nova or a FirstComp or any other acquisition,
building that margin of safety. And once we believe that margin of safety is established,
you'll have that ongoing roll on of safety in the first year and roll off of margin of safety in
the back years. I would hate to try to tell you when exactly I think that will happen. But I
think we're on track to accomplish that just like we've done in other acquisitions.

Q - Vincent M. DeAugustino

{BIO 17976273 <GO>}

Okay. Very good to hear. And then Tom, just on Diamond Healthcare, maybe not a good
assumption, but I guess I would have thought that just with the healthcare environment
Page 9 of 20



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2015-02-12

that that would have been a favorable kind of tailwind for Diamond. So maybe that's not
the case. Or I mean was there anything from a company standpoint that kind of, a) from a
revenue side that's impacting it? And then b) from the goodwill side that had an impact as
well?

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Right. I've alluded to some of the Markel Ventures companies are doing better than what
we had forecast; some are more challenged. In healthcare, the truth is we have not
covered ourselves in glory. That is a changing industry and while there are tailwinds and
you speak out from increasing demand, the change is just the swirl of regulation that's
caused challenges. Additionally, in our healthcare operations we're in a rapid growth
mode. So we're figuring things out. We are also conservative in our accounting from the
way that we would report and describe that to you. So we're hard at it and I look forward
to ultimately reporting better results to you some day on the healthcare arena, but we
don't have them for you right now.
And one thing, I want to tie into some of Mike's comments earlier when he mentioned the
list of people who received promotions and have grown within the organization, every
single one of those, I think except Britt were folks that joined Markel as a result of
acquisitions and every single one of those acquisitions that we spoke of had some J-curve
associated with it, where for the first quarter or two you might have been concerned that
why did we do that? But ultimately, the culture, the values, the system, the process that
we embrace here at Markel works. We think that works in healthcare, just like we think it
works in different forms of insurance and in different parts of the world. So, I look forward
to reporting better news in the future to you, but I don't know whether that will be in the
next quarter or two.

Q - Vincent M. DeAugustino

{BIO 17976273 <GO>}

Okay. Sounds like it's going back to the benefits of all the diversification there, so not too
concerned. So I guess the last question would be maybe on the workers comp side. So
this seems like we're hearing that we may be kind of nearing an inflection point where
rate increases are still available, but clearly it seems like things are getting a little bit more
competitive. And so I'm just curious if you're seeing some of that same type of activity
and if there is, I guess, the same comments on your small, mid versus large on the
accounts side also applies here. Thank you.

A - F. Michael Crowley

{BIO 6836605 <GO>}

Well, it's Mike. We only write small workers' comp in FirstComp, and the results of that
organization have improved every year since we acquired FirstComp in 2010 and that was
the case in 2014. They have changed their business, and I think I've talked about it on prior
calls. They have moved in and out of geographies depending on the advantage of being
in certain states and out of certain other states. They have dramatically re-underwritten
and changed their position in California, particularly in Southern California. And they have
tiered their business based on the quality of the business in terms of A, B and C type
accounts. So they have managed that book of business extremely well in what isn't a
necessarily a favorable workers' compensation environment. I don't see that changing

Page 10 of 20



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2015-02-12

going forward. I can't say anything other than they've just done an excellent job outperforming the overall workers' compensation market in the last few years.

All right. Thanks very much.

Our next question will come from John Fox of Fenimore Asset Management. Please go

Q - John D. Fox

{BIO 1796608 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, everyone. Realizing the overall results are terrific. Thank you for that. I
did have a question on an area where it wasn't terrific, which is the Alterra life and annuity.
And I'm doing this for memory. But I recall, when you closed the deal, you put up a rather
large, I guess, charge or reserve against that. I think it was $300 million, but I may not
remember that correctly. And it's continuing to be a drag of about $30 million a year
roughly. So is that something that we're going to live with going forward? Or is that – as
kind of Richie was commenting on building a margin on safety realizing it's a discontinued
business at this point?

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

You're going to continue to see that $30ish million or whatever the number is every year.
That's just simply the amortization of the discount on the reserves, because you
established those reserves at a discounted rate. What you're not seeing is the other side
which is what we're earning on the assets that we hold against those liabilities. You don't
see that because that's sitting in the investment portfolio. We're very comfortable with
where we are on the life and annuity reserves today. They're doing basically what we
expected. And the discount rate we used when we acquired Alterra to set that reserve up
was very conservative and even with the rather puny returns you can get right now in
terms of your investments on fixed income. So it's a little bit – and we can get on the
phone with you and talk about it. But you'll continue to see that number and what you're
not seeing is the return on the portfolio on the other side.

Q - John D. Fox

{BIO 1796608 <GO>}

Right. Of course, that's covered through investment income and unrealized gains and
realized gains, so.

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. And for Tom Gayner, I'm looking back, three years ago you had less than $2 billion in
equities and now it's $4 billion. And that, of course, has come from a terrific stock market
and additional investments that you've made over time. Going forward from here, the
market has done fantastically, valuations are higher than they were. What do you see
going forward, Tom? Do you continue to dollar cost average, do you take your foot off
the gas a little bit, what are your thoughts on equity investing going forward from here?

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

So really the same as it's always been and to your answer about dollar cost averaging,
that is one of the beauties of being part of Markel is that my insurance colleagues keep
making deposits into the account all the time, which facilitates that sort of approach and
they very kindly never ask for any money back, if they make an underwriting profit. So it
doesn't get any better than that. There's always uncertainty in the investment markets
and while we're talking about new highs, as an example, people in the oil patch might not
be feeling that way right now.
I mean that price has been cut in half and there's also just implications and things that fall
out from that in ways that people didn't foresee and I hope you don't hold me to a
forecast. I hope you don't hold anybody to a forecast because some things about the oil
market that has struck me is, I mean, this is the biggest, the most liquid, the most
important commodity that's traded in the world. And the fact that it could sell for over
$100 and then less than half that within six months tells me that nobody knows anything
about anything when it comes to the future. So that being said, that was the case three
years ago, the case 30 years ago, and it's fun to come to work every day because there's
something that you did not expect to happen that creates an opportunity.

Q - John D. Fox

{BIO 1796608 <GO>}

Right. Yeah. I'm certainly not asking for a forecast for the future, I guess. Just when you
look at your investment opportunities, the future returns on equities will not be what

FINAL

they've been over the last three years, although they're going to be – my prediction is
they're going to be better than fixed income. So, I was just curious, just for the
incremental dollar coming from your friends in the insurance business, is the same
proportion going into equities less, or it sounds like it's going to be the same going
forward if I hear you correctly?

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Yeah, and what has happened over the last three years is we've sort of incrementally
continued to invest in equities. And I've been inappropriately cautious about the equity
market. But quite frankly we satisfied returns, but we didn't optimize them. But that's okay
because that leaves us margin of safety, which is an important part of the culture here,
and we'll continue to just plot along as the markets sheer off perhaps some big reaction,
we have to drive power in the capital to invest more aggressively and we will.

Q - John D. Fox

The next question will come from David West of Davenport & Company. Please go ahead.

Q - David M. West

{BIO 1838548 <GO>}

Good morning.

A - Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Good morning.

Q - David M. West

{BIO 1838548 <GO>}

Mike, I guess, first a question for you on the more recent acquisition, Hagerty doubled
their own premium this year. Could you talk about that relationship and how you see – do
you expect it to continue to expand at a pretty healthy rate?

A - F. Michael Crowley

{BIO 6836605 <GO>}

Well, one, David, we didn't acquire Hagerty. We are simply the underwriter on their book
of business. They are a privately held independent agent and broker that specializes in
the collector car business. They grew significantly this year. That marketplace we were just
out with them recently. There's a big marketplace. They obviously are a dominant player
Page 13 of 20



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2015-02-12

and a highly recognized player in that marketplace. I certainly don't expect their premium
volume to double in 2015.

FINAL

I think they'll see steady growth as they have in the past. So, our relationship with them is
very good. We have a long-term focus with them, and I think that the relationship today is
about as solid as it could be.

Q - David M. West

{BIO 1838548 <GO>}

Okay, great. And just turning to the international side, Richie, maybe you have a quick
update on that, the Abbey Protection deal.

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Well, sure, Dave. Sorry, I didn't mention that. And some of it was probably because it's
sort of business as usual. That acquisition has settled down nicely, did exactly – pretty
much exactly what we wanted it to do this year in terms of premium volume and in terms
of the fee income that it generates.

Bloomberg Transcript

The things that we're working on right now with the Abbey folks and our UK retail folks,
it's how we can cross-sell some of that retail product. Abbey has got some really neat
products that we think we could sell alongside some of our other commercial products
both for the retail market, and that is what's been the focus over the last couple months is
really coming up with plans on how we're going to start to take advantage of that in 2015.
And so, hopefully I'll have more to say about that as we go through 2015, but things have
gone very well at Abbey in 2014.

Q - David M. West

{BIO 1838548 <GO>}

Great. Great. And then lastly for Tom, you just alluded to all the turmoil in the energy
sector, wonder could you comment on what kind of exposure you had to energy and the
fixed income portfolio.

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

I don't have any breakdowns, but nothing that concerns me. We have a policy of 90% of
our fixed income portfolio by mandate is a 8 or better and we always state the top tier
anything we would do, energy included.

Q - David M. West

FINAL

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning. Few questions. Let me start with – on the international book of
business in the fourth quarter, there's obviously some pretty significant reserve releases
in there. Adding those back into get an accident year combined ratio, it looks like the
accident year combined ratio year-over-year was a little bit higher. I was wondering if
there was anything unusual in there, or changing business mix. I realize, obviously, these
are always pretty conservatively stated, but I wouldn't have necessarily expected the
accident year number to go up.

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Mark, Ritchie. We're sort of looking at each other here and nothing in particular stands out
to us. Anne or Nora somebody can give you a call. But we'll look at it and let you know. But
I guess, I would say I don't know of anything in particular in the current accident year that's
a problem. I'm thinking it's probably more of a mix issue. But we'll take a look at that and
get back with you.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. Same question, also kind of related to combined ratios. It looked like, at least based
on my calculation, that the expense ratio for the fourth quarter was back at about 40%
relative to the kind of 37% to 38% you had been reporting. Was there anything that
contributed to that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Yeah, Mark, that's one of the good expense ratio issues. What contributed to that was
having so much in takedowns that increases our bonus accruals around Markel. So there's
a lot of happy people looking at the fourth quarter expense ratio at Markel. And it's what
you would expect. I mean, we really had a nice year in terms of the loss ratio. Some
portion of that comes back on the expense ratio side through bonus accruals.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Makes sense.

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

We fixed that.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Sure, enough. Last question I guess – well, next to last question. Any comments on the
January 1 reinsurance renewals? All the market commentary is that rates were fairly
substantially down. You guys have normally been very disciplined about as you say not
chasing those rates, anything that you can share as far as what to expect about the
January 1 renewal book?

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Page 15 of 20



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2015-02-12

FINAL

Sure, it's again, Richie, Mark. Yeah, it was tough. I mean January 1 was tough. I think
everybody expected it to be tough. We're still putting numbers together, but we'll
probably be down a little bit on our January 1 renewals just simply because of pricing and
the fact that, when that starts to happen, some accounts get too close to where we think
the line needs to be drawn, and we either have to reduce on them, or we have to come
off of them.
So, yeah, I would say that the news that you'd probably been hearing from other people
that 5% to 15% kind of on average is a pretty good number, and we'll wait and see what
happens the rest of the year in reinsurance. Part of the beauty of Markel, I love having
reinsurance as part of that business. I also love only having it as about 20% of our
business, because of that diversification, we can be a bit more cavalier in terms of our
approach to it and be more disciplined. So, we'll see how the rest of the year goes.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. And then the last question I have is – you guys have had a buyback authorization in
place for a little while now. You've not done a whole lot with it. And I know, historically,
Markel hasn't been overly aggressive in buybacks. But I look at the amount of capital that
you're generating, the prospects for growth as described and the valuation of your
shares, which is really not that distinct from a lot of peers. Kind of curious, Rich, how you're
thinking about buybacks and maybe why you're not being a little bit more aggressive at
this stage?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Sure. Well, thanks, Mark. This is Tom. As we've written for the last several years, the fourpart list in the triage of how we would think about capital that comes in the doors – and,
first off, let's not understate the importance of capital coming in the door, to start with.
This is a very high-class problem we're talking about here.
The first thing we'd like to do is fund organic growth. And the good news is that given the
size and scale of this organization and the talent we see in certain pockets, whether that's
insurance or non-insurance, people seem to be coming up with ideas to deploy capital in
a thoughtful way. And the best evidence you have that that works is the continuing sort of
compound annual growth rate and the book value that we continue to report to you. So if
we see opportunities to invest organically with people who are already part of this
organization and have done well, we're going to do that all day long. So, we don't think
we've exhausted that list at all.
The second thing we look at is acquisitions, both insurance and non-insurance entities
these days, and I think that about covers the possibility. So given the fact that we have
history and demonstrated ability to do that, it's a big world there and we continue to seek
deals and a lot of flow and a lot of conversations that I think will accrue to the long term
benefit to the Markel shareholders. The third thing we have the option of is publicly
traded investments and we look at them in the same way that we would look at any other
capital allocation opportunity. We've done pretty well on that over the years. So then
fourth and final, after we've exhausted these first three opportunities, if we still have
money left over and our stock is priced favorable, well, then, yes, we'll repurchase, but
Page 16 of 20



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2015-02-12

FINAL

the good news is that for as long as possible, to deploy capital offensively in these first
three categories, we've – all of us as Markel shareholders are better off, then we'll look to
do that as much as possible and share repurchases are our item number four. That being
said, we're very rational, we're Markel shareholders. This is a source of our own personal
net worth, and if it makes sense to being aggressive on that level, we will do so.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks for the update on that. I will drop off.

The next question will come from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Please go ahead.

Q - Adam Klauber

{BIO 1494359 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. A couple different questions. Number one, acquisitions you've
done some acquisitions in the last couple years, I guess. What's your appetite going
forward and particularly would you consider another large deal again in the next couple
years?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Adam, Ritchie and Tom might kick in on this one as well. You know, we did the Alterra
acquisition. It's coming up on almost two years ago now, which is – it's really kind of hard
to believe. But we're in a great position as a result of that. I mean the Alterra acquisition
has gone very well I think, and in terms of integration we really don't talk about it any
more. It's pretty much a done deal. So, short answer is we're kind of open for business
really in terms of looking at insurance acquisitions. In terms of size, we try not to get too
hung up on size. We try to think about strategic fit and the opportunity. And of course at
the end of the day, is there a market clearing price, we can get to. So there's – put it this
way, given where we are today, there is quite a large number of opportunities that we
could look at and potentially take advantage of. And then of course on Tom's side, lots of
opportunities there and I don't know if you want to talk about it.

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

I have nothing to add.

A - F. Michael Crowley

{BIO 6836605 <GO>}

Well, the other thing – this is Mike. The other thing I'll add to that is that I think, the culture
fit with the Alterra talent in Markel was very good. And I think that's the basis of why we
retained most of that talent. And while there are opportunities that will come up and there
have been opportunities that we've looked at, since the Alterra deal, of different sizes,
you know, you can't discount the fact that one of the important things we look at is the
culture fit which benefits us all for the long haul.

Q - Adam Klauber

Yes.

FINAL

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Yeah. And maybe just one last thought on it, Adam. There's been a ton of – a slew of
activity recently and not to pick on any of those deals, I'm sure all of them had their
reasons for moving forward. You know, strategic fit is critical. Culture is critical to us.
There's been some discussion that maybe some of the deals recently have been big to
get – bigger – big to get bigger. We're not interested in that. It's got to be a good
strategic fit. It's got to be a good cultural fit.

Q - Adam Klauber

{BIO 1494359 <GO>}

Okay, thanks. And then as far as the excess and surplus market, there's always the give
and take between the standard market and the E&S market. Which way is the pendulum
going now, it's been going towards the E&S market, is that continuing? Has that slowed
down at all?

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, looking back at 2014, all five of our regions in the E&S segment grew in 2015 (sic)
[2014]. And if we look at our top 10 or 15 relationships with the larger wholesale firms,
brokers, almost all of those grew in 2014. We just had our wholesale producer council
meeting in January down in Florida and the attitude with our customers was very upbeat.
And their attitude towards Markel was very upbeat. And we're doing some strategic
things there. So, right now I see 2015 as more of the same like 2014.

Q - Adam Klauber

{BIO 1494359 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And then last, more of a detail question. In U.S., this favorable
development, could you just give us, I guess some idea, which years most of the
development came from, is it more recent, more older, just any ballpark would be
helpful?

FINAL

Hi, good morning, again and thanks for taking my follow-up, just one. Tom, it's a bit of a
curve ball, but from your investment standpoint and going -turning to your point about
diving into what no one can possibly know here. I'm kind of curious, if you see any situation
where a strong dollar can create inflation outside of commodities and imports.
So really just U.S. services and domestic goods where that also simultaneously produces
pressure on treasury yields, as you have some of that foreign money coming here. Now,
the way I see that is, if that is a possibly, it'd be a negative for both the insurance industry
reserves and investment portfolio. I mean, can anyone have a sense of that or do you
have an opinion there?

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

I mean, I have an opinion that you should be thoughtful about exactly that sort of risk. So it
is in the mix of things that we think about. And we try consciously to make sure that no
matter what sort of curveballs are thrown at us from that standpoint, we can answer the
bell for the next round of the fight. And I'm confident that we have not locked ourselves
into inflexible positions. That is the key problem in being able to answer the bell for the
next round.
