Good day, and welcome to the Gjensidige Q3 2020 Results Presentation. Today's
conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to
Ms.Mitra Hagen Negaad, Head of IR. Please go ahead, ma'am.

Mitra Hagen Negaad

{BIO 3974076 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this third quarter presentation of
Gjensidige Forsikring. My name is Mitra Negard, and I'm Head of Investor Relations. As
always, we will start with our CEO, Helge Leiro Baastad, who will go through the highlights
of the quarter; before our CFO, Jostein Amdal, who will run through the numbers in
further detail. And we have plenty of time for Q&A at the end. Helge, please.

Thank you, Mitra. Good morning, and welcome, everyone. I hope you are healthy and
well. Since our last earnings call many countries, including the Nordics have experienced
new spikes of COVID-19 cases, forcing governments to reintroduce restrictions. It seems
like we must be prepared for new ways until an eﬀective vaccination has taken place.
Although, the pandemic has caused signiﬁcant economic hardship for many people and

FINAL

industries. The overall economic outlook in our region is encouraging, pointing towards a
gradual recovery. Gjensidige has continued to manage well through the pandemic.
Let's then turn to Page 2, for some comments on our very strong third quarter results. We
generated a proﬁt before tax of NOK2.048 billion, of which NOK1.512 billion in
underwriting results. This is the highest underwriting result we have ever delivered for a
quarter when adjusting for run-oﬀs. The record result reﬂects 10% increase in earned
premiums and a very healthy combined ratio of 78.2%. Large losses were low and run-oﬀ
gains were slightly higher than the planned releases. The underlying frequency loss ratio
at 66.4% was very good.
The pandemic had a slightly positive impact on our results this quarter, primarily due to
less travel activity. The general claims pattern apart from travel is back to a more normal
level in our markets, and our cost discipline remains strong. We generated a ﬁnancial
result of NOK551 million, reﬂecting continued recovery in the ﬁnancial markets. And
annualized return on equity year-to-date was 15.3%, reﬂecting the weak ﬁnancial result in
the ﬁrst quarter in combination with the very high solvency ratio.

Bloomberg Transcript

And I'm pleased that the clariﬁcation from the Norwegian Minister of Finance enabled us
to ﬁnally pay oﬀ the dividend for 2019. We paid a total of NOK6.125 billion, or NOK12.25 a
share, on the 30 of September to our shareholders. This is the same as our original
proposal in January, and after this we still have a very strong solvency position. Jostein
will afterwards revert with more detailed comments on the results for the quarter.
Then turning to Page 3. And our unique customer dividend model. Following of a
dividend payment, the Gjensidige Foundation has again passed on its share of the
regular dividend to our general insurance customers in Norway as it has done every year
since our listing in 2010. This year the dividend from the foundation amounted to almost
NOK2.3 billion, corresponding to 13.7% of the premiums paid in 2019. The payment to
800,000 customers started earlier this month. A positive contribution to many customers
in these extraordinary times. The foundation has paid more than NOK21 billion in
customer dividend since their inception in 2007. The model is highly valued by our
customers, and complements our strong brand and delivery of superior customer
experiences in building customer loyalty.
Then turning to Page 4, a few words about our operations. Starting with the macro view,
as for the rest of the world, the pandemic struck hard on the economies in our region too,
with sharp contraction in the beginning. But thanks to the enormous stimulus packages
and gradual easing of the toughest restrictions, we have seen a much swift rebound that
we dare to hope for just a few months ago.
We're still not out of the woods. However, the forecast for Norway is encouraging. Most
recently voiced by the Norwegian Ministry of Finance earlier this month with the mainland
GDP growth estimate of 4.4% next year. Unemployment has declined by close to 2/3
since its March peak and is forecast to decrease further in 2021 to 3.1%. We ﬁnd this
encouraging and see a lower risk of pressure on the insurance volumes in Norway than
we expected earlier this year. The recovery for the rest of the Nordics is also encouraging.

FINAL

Then back to the third quarter again. We continue to put through necessary price
increases in Norway for both segments. I'm very pleased to see that we have maintained
our superior market position despite tough competition. Thanks to our strong brand and
eﬀective sales eﬀorts. We have continued to gain business volumes in the third quarter,
alongside maintaining high retention levels for both over private and commercial
segments.
Renewals for our commercial segment are still strong without signs or contraction despite
the pandemic. We'll continue to put through price increases for both segments in Norway
going forward, for private in line with claims inﬂation, for all products except property
where we still see the need to price above this to reach satisfactory proﬁts. We also see
further need for price increases in the commercial segment, particularly for large
corporates. We continuously improve our analytical models and customer scoring models
to address the relevant products and segments.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our latest excellent ranking in Ipsos reputation survey is the pleasant reminder of how we
are dude among Norwegian customers. Once again, we ranked number one on overall
reputation in the Norwegian ﬁnance sector, and we ranked number six among over 100
companies in the survey independent of sector. We have climbed further in all
subcategories. And we are particularly pleased to see that we once again, we are voted
number one on social responsibility and morality in the ﬁnance sector.
Our operations outside Norway generated mixed results. We are pleased with the
underlying proﬁt development in Denmark. Thanks to a good development in premiums.
We are making progress in Sweden too, although at a slower pace. I'm very pleased to
see premium growth here. We need to improve proﬁtability further. We will seek to
transform our Swedish business into becoming a more digital insurance provider with a
high degree of automated internal processes.
Our results in the Baltics reﬂects the ﬁerce competition, which has resulted in top-line
contraction. Our planned measures are unchanged with the focus on optimizing multichannel distribution, improving data analytics and price optimization. We are also seeking
further eﬃciency in claims handling processes.
Then over to Slide 5. Innovation is key to maintaining of a strong position and growth
going forward. To that end, we have recently partnered with Norway's leading research
center on digital innovation for sustainable growth at the Norwegian School of
Economics. We have high expectation for this partnership, which includes a number of
large international corporations and research institutions. The aim is to increase the
eﬀectiveness of customer-oriented innovations, developed new business models and
adapt organizations to a digital everyday life.
We have recently launched several products oﬀerings, we are very proud of. Demand for
medical services is rising rapidly. Catering to our customers' needs and through to our
strategy of being a problem solver for the customers, we are now the ﬁrst insurance
company in Norway to provide free direct access to online medical consultation with the
doctor on a 24/7 basis.

FINAL

We also oﬀer a digital solution to ease of a customer's navigation in the public health
service domain. We are convinced that this is a valuable addition to our insurance
products further strengthening our ties with our customers. Sustainable solutions are a
prerequisite for long-term value creation. We aim to make our entire product line even
more sustainable, as an example, this quarter we have adjusted the terms in our home
content and travel insurance product for our young customers by adding climate
compensation for emissions related to the claims processes.
Catering to the social aspect of sustainability, we have recently launched a new service for
our commercial customers for a quick return of employees on sick leave. The assistance is
carried out together with medical and work coaching professionals. This is an important
damage prevention measure to avoid long-term disability, and yet an example of
delivering on our problem solver ambition.
With that, I will leave the word to Jostein, to present the third quarter results in more
detail.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Helge, and good morning, everybody.
I'll start on Page 7. We delivered a proﬁt before tax of NOK2.048 billion in the third
quarter, signiﬁcantly higher than the same quarter last year. Our underwriting result beat
the record we set in Q2, climbing to the highest level ever when adjusted for run-oﬀs. We
had no large losses this quarter, which of course contributed positively. However, the
main driver of the improved performance was continued high customer retention,
eﬀective pricing measures, higher business volumes and good cost control.
We also have a slightly positive impact from the pandemic situation. I will revert with more
detail on this in a moment. The ﬁnancial result on our investment portfolio was also up
year-on-year, reﬂecting the continued recovery in the ﬁnancial market. After two
consecutive record quarters, the underwriting result year-to-date is of course signiﬁcantly
above previous years results or any other year for that matter. The ﬁnancial result year-todate is however still signiﬁcantly below what we would normally expect due to the
negative returns in the ﬁrst quarter.
Turning to Page 8. Earned premiums are up 10% or 7.3% adjusted for currency eﬀects. In
the Private segment, earned premiums rose by 5.6% mainly due to price increases for
motor and property insurance as well as accident and health insurance. Adjusted for the
transfer of our portfolio to segment Denmark, the growth was 6.3%. Our competitiveness
remained strong through the quarter. We continue to attract more private customers
through the quarter, mainly driven by motor insurance, while the volumes on property
insurance were somewhat impacted by the signiﬁcant pricing measures we have and are
continuing to put through.
Earned premiums for the Commercial segment rose 9.4%, thanks to eﬀective pricing
measures, solid renewals and portfolio growth. All the main product lines recorded higher
Page 4 of 21

FINAL

earned premiums. As Helge mentioned, we will continue to implement necessary pricing
measures in Norway and given the economic outlook and our solid market standing, we
are comfortable that we will -- we'll be able to put this through without hurting volumes.
Earned premiums in Denmark were up 8.5% in local currency and 4.1% adjusted for the
discontinuation of a quota share reinsurance contract, and transfer of the portfolio from
Private segment. The increase was mainly due to portfolio growth in the commercial lines
partly oﬀset by lower premiums of travel insurance due to the travel restrictions.
Earned premiums for our Swedish operation were up 10.2% in local currency, reﬂecting
price and volume growth in the commercial lines, partly oﬀset by lower volumes in the
private lines. For the Baltics, we reported a decrease of 7.2% in local currency. This reﬂects
lower prices in the motor insurance line due to ﬁerce competition, in addition to lower
volume for travel insurance due to the COVID-19 situation.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning over to Page 9. The loss ratio for the third quarter declined 4.8 percentage points
to 64.3%. Large losses were somewhat down year-on-year and a nominal level of losses
was low compared to our expectations for a quarterly average. As a reminder, large losses
are random in nature. Run-oﬀ gains were in line with Q3 last year although slightly higher
than the planned release. The underlying frequency loss ratio improved by 4.4
percentage points to a very healthy 66.4%. This was due to our strong and robust
premium growth as well as favorable claims development, particularly for our property
insurance product in Norway.
Bear in mind, there are always randomizations in frequency developments from quarterto-quarter in insurance. The general claims pattern, apart from travel is back to a more
normal level in our markets. I'll be more speciﬁc about COVID-19 eﬀects shortly, but for
the third quarter according to our estimates, this amounted to approximately 0.6
percentage points on the loss ratio.
In terms of segments, I'm particularly pleased with improvement in Private this quarter as
well as the proﬁtability level for Private and Commercial. In Sweden, the underlying
treatments in loss ratio was slightly down compared to the same quarter last year. The
Baltics showed almost 9 percentage points increase in the underlying frequency loss ratio,
mainly due to pressure on motor insurance prices.
We will continue our eﬀorts on improving operations, particularly in Sweden and the
Baltics. As Helge mentioned, we intend to transform our Swedish business into becoming
a more digital insurance provider, combining this with automation of internal processes in
order to obtain higher cost eﬃciency. We have started downsizing our labor force in
Sweden and closed down our customer center and we will continue to identify further
cost cutting opportunities going forward. In the Baltics, the price competition, especially
within motor TPL is ﬁerce, but we have a clear priority of return to more proﬁtable level
and we will continue to focus hard on our operating expenses, where we see a signiﬁcant
potential for improvement.
A few more details on the COVID impact on Page 10. As you can see from the table here,
the impact for the quarter was limited and almost slightly positive on our claims.

FINAL

According to our estimates, it amounted to NOK41 million or 0.6 percentage points on
the loss ratio. We recorded gains related to cancellations on home transportation this
quarter too, mainly in the corporate center line. This was oﬀset primarily by less travel
activity for all segments, but also somewhat less driving in the Commercial and Danish
segments. In Sweden, we saw higher claims on payment protection insurance this quarter
as well.
In addition to the impact of claims, we saw negative impact on premium growth in
Denmark and the Baltics related to travel insurance. Going forward, we expect stable
activity in our markets and claims at more normal levels. However, with the ongoing travel
restrictions, we expect a lower level of claims for travel insurance in the near future.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's turn to Page 11. We recorded NOK969 million in operating expenses in the quarter,
corresponding to a cost ratio of 13.9% and 13.3%, excluding the Baltics. The cost ratio for
our combined Norwegian business was at a very good level, down 0.4 percentage points
to 11.1%. Denmark recorded a cost ratio of 14% with the increase compared to last year,
mainly due to changes in the reinsurance program. Progress on the new core insurance
system is good and we will sell the ﬁrst policies from new system before year-end, as
planned. The ﬁrst part of Denmark covered will be the Private segment, and thereafter
we'll start rolling it out to the Commercial segment. Our Swedish business has as
mentioned a potential for higher eﬃciency. The cost ratio came in at 17.4% this quarter,
more or less in line with the same quarter last year. The cost ratio in the Baltics continued
to come down and ended up 28.2% for the third quarter. It beneﬁted from lower sales
commissions as sales were impacted by the pandemic, but we also saw positive results
from our ongoing cost savings initiatives.
A few comments on our pension operation on Slide 12. The pre-tax proﬁt came to NOK41
million, down year-on-year due to higher operating expenses. A shortened depreciation
time frame for IT investments and higher headcount in response to the growth in business
volume drove the increase in operating expenses. Good returns on real estate
investments and the recovery of the ﬁnancial markets generated higher ﬁnancial income
on the pension portfolios.
Assets under management was NOK39 billion at the end of the quarter. Annualized return
on equity came to 11.7%. The solvency margin at the end of the third quarter was 154%. We
expect higher operating expenses in response to growth in addition to the market
dynamics in the wake of the implementation of some pension account to put some
pressure on proﬁtability in the short to medium term. The pension business is an
important complement to our general insurance business in Norway, particularly within
the SME part of our operation and generates cross-selling opportunities. As of the end of
the third quarter, 68% of the customers in our pension business were general insurance
customers as well.
Moving on to the investment portfolio on Page 13. The global ﬁnancial markets continued
to rebound through the third quarter. Interest rates and credit spreads came down and
equity and commodity markets were strong. The commercial real estate market in Norway
continued to hold up well. We continued to re-risk our portfolio in the third quarter.
However, in retrospect, we should have done so earlier. All asset classes, except private
Page 6 of 21

FINAL

equity, generated positive returns in the third quarter. Private equity funds with exposures
in the oil sector had a weak performance. Our exposure in general towards oil sector is
limited.
The total return amounted to NOK551 million, or 0.9%. At the end of the quarter, the total
investment portfolio amounted to NOK58 billion, reﬂecting market movements in
addition to the payment of the NOK6.1 billion in dividends at the end of the quarter. The
match portfolio yielded 0.7% return, excluding changes in the value of the portfolio value
at amortized costs. This portfolio amounted to NOK36.6 billion at the end of the quarter.
Bonds at amortized costs had a positive return of 0.9%. This portfolio's running yield at
the end of the quarter was 3.5%, while the reinvestment rate year-to-date was 3.3% and
unrealized excess value amounted to approximately NOK1.2 billion. The free portfolio
yielded a return of 1.1% in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, this portfolio amounted to
approximately NOK21.8 billion. The quality of assets in our portfolio is good. We have a
solid ﬁxed income portfolio with a large majority having an investment grade rating. We
have a good share of property investments, mainly in oﬃces in central business district of
Oslo and with very low vacancies in the portfolio.

Bloomberg Transcript

Looking at our capital position on Page 14. Our capital position is very strong with a
solvency ratio of 219% at the end of the quarter, down from 283% last quarter. The
reduction is mainly due to the dividend payment for 2019. The total Solvency II earnings
and return in the free portfolio contributed with NOK1.6 billion, but was reduced by a
formulaic dividend of 80% of the accounting results so far in 2020.
Without deducting this, the solvency margin would have been 242%. Eligible capital is
also reduced by the planned run-oﬀs of NOK250 million, this will continue through 2022.
The capital requirement is somewhat higher this quarter. Underwriting risk increased,
mainly due to growth in premium volumes and technical reserves. Market risk increased
due to higher exposure to equities and convertible bonds.
Our appeal on FSA's decision on the calibration of market risk has been partly approved.
The impact of the change is a reduction of market risk by approximately NOK0.2 billion.
We are very pleased with the partial approval, but we aim to have all of the diﬀerence,
including the other factors related to the store model and correlation eﬀect between
market and underwriting risk approved. We have an ongoing dialogue with FSA. Our own
partial internal model as at the end of the quarter showed a solvency margin of 274%.
Finally, a few words on the latest development of our operational targets on Slide 15. I'm
very pleased with the progress on the majority of the operational targets this quarter. By
delivering on these operational targets, we continue to improve our competitive position
and lay the ground for future proﬁtability. Both customer satisfaction and retention in
Norway remain very high. The retention level outside Norway is slightly down this quarter,
prolonging the tendency from the second quarter. This is primarily driven by the
temporary market contraction due to the pandemic in the Baltics.

FINAL

We have now reached our target on sales eﬀectiveness based on running 12 months at
10% compared with our baseline year 2017. The increase this quarter is mainly driven by
higher sales in the Private segment, but also in the other segments, we now see higher
sales levels compared to diﬃcult second quarter. There will still be some volatility in these
ﬁgures between quarters going forward.
The share of automated tariﬀs continued to increase. We currently stand at around 52%,
we will continue to include more product lines going forward, in addition to further
reﬁning tariﬀs already included. On the claims handling side, both digital claims reporting
and the share of claims handled fully automatically have been stable this quarter. We will
continue to develop these digital services further and I'm proud to announce that we
have reached a digital milestone regarding a fully automated motor claims process.
The ﬁrst phase in this development has been in single access and we continue to push
forward with new claims processes. We have reduced claims cost even further. Most
recently, reduction related to insurance fraud, process automation and procurement. We
are currently well positioned of reaching our target of reducing it by NOK500 million in
2022. And in terms of our CO2 intensity, we will continue to develop our framework and
to continuously reduce the carbon footprint of our claims process.
I will then hand the word back to Helge.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Jostein. To sum up then on Page 16. We have had two quarters in a row this
year with record underwriting results. This is to a large degree a result of our solid brand,
eﬃcient operations and dedicated employees who put strong eﬀorts in serving our
customers every day.
Our ﬁnancial targets remain unchanged. The pandemic is far from over, creating
uncertainty for large parts of the world. The outlook for the Nordics is encouraging. This
together with our strong market position, robust model and eﬃcient operations lays the
ground for continued strong results going forward. Our solvency position is very strong,
even after paying out the 2019 dividend.
Given the negative return on the investment portfolio for the ﬁrst quarter of 2020 and a
very high solvency ratio through the third quarter, the group's return on equity target is
not expected to be achieved for the 2020 ﬁscal year.
We continue to seek attractive M&A opportunities. And in terms of dividends, we maintain
our policy, targeting high and stable nominal dividends on a regular basis, reﬂecting the
group's underlying earnings capacity. This means we expect a continued steady and nice
regular dividend curve also from 2022 to 2023 and beyond, when run-oﬀ gains come
down. Special dividends have been and will still be used from time to time to calibrate
capital to meet our solvency target.
And with that, we will now open for the Q&A session.

Questions And Answers

FINAL

(Question And Answer)
(Operator Instructions) We will take our ﬁrst question from Jon Denham with Morgan
Stanley. Please go ahead.

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. And you've been
consistently operating below your 2022 target of a 90% to 93% combined ratio ex-run-oﬀ
gains even when stripping out COVID. Just wondering is the current level sustainable in
the medium term? I think you said you've been pricing in line or ahead of claims inﬂation
in the diﬀerent lines and other than a pickup in large claims, what could really go against
you? And then just secondly, thanks for the additional COVID disclosure, I was just
wondering how much uncertainty is there around the estimated 0.6 percentage points
beneﬁt from COVID in 3Q, i.e., what are the error bars around attributing frequency
beneﬁts to COVID versus underlying improvement? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Hi, Jon. I will -- on the ﬁrst one, I mean, we are in a very good position. I mean we're able - with the competitive position we have -- we are able to put through price increases,
especially in Norway to mitigate claims inversion and also somewhat above where we see
that the proﬁtability level is not right where it should be on us. And as we said, on the
Property segment of -- on the private property in the Private segment and certain parts of
the commercial book, we still see the need for repricing and we are pretty comfortable
that we will get that through. What that means is that the current level of proﬁtability is
fairly sustainable in the short to medium term. The main long-term risk is of course the
competitive dynamics in the market that someone -- somehow some of the major
competitors should start going for volume instead of proﬁtability, but we don't see any
signs of that happening at the moment at least, but that's something that's outside of our
reach. From where we see, this is fairly sustainable in the short to the medium term.
The uncertainty about the COVID-19 impact is -- it's a good question because this is really
an estimate as we try to underline. It's our best estimate of what the eﬀects have been. I
don't have a speciﬁc band around it how uncertain it is, but it -- there are uncertainties
related to this because there are a lot of other eﬀects, including weather and other
changes that could have aﬀected this strange from year-to-year. But it is our best eﬀort to
give you some numbers on the -- per segment on the COVID-19 eﬀects.

We will now take our next question from Blair Stewart with Bank of America. Please go
ahead.

FINAL

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, everyone. I've got three questions, please. You've just reported an
outstanding underwriting result, I think not for the ﬁrst time. I'm just wondering and
looking through the various segments, it's not obvious where there's a weakness, but you
are still talking about pushing through price increases and certain lines of proﬁtability is
not where you'd like it to be. Just -- I wonder if you could just give us a bit more color on
that because it's not obvious where that is given the kind of outstanding underwriting
results that you've been producing.
The second question is just on the reserve releases. Could you just remind us of the
expected pattern of those over the next few years? I think you talked, Helge about 2022,
'23 when you expect those to drop away, still being able to pay steady dividend. Just
really looking for an update on the expected progression of those reserve releases, if
there's any change to your previous expectations?

Bloomberg Transcript

And thirdly, I guess with a view to COVID and certainly what's happening in my part of the
world, hardly anyone is working in their oﬃces and there's some concern over the impact
that might have on real estate prices in some countries, that doesn't seem to be the case
in the Nordic region. Could you just give us some thoughts on that? Is -- are things really
back to normal? Everyone going back to the oﬃce in the Nordic countries, so therefore,
no pressure on the real estate market? Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thanks, Blair. In terms of weakness, I think we already in the previous question highlighted
that within the property product in the private book and in certain parts of the commercial
book, we still see the need for repricing and of course, it's not obvious from the overall
ﬁgures, but when we look at the need for proﬁtability measures, we much look, of course
much more granular and we see some areas where we see a need for more price
increases than the expected claims inﬂation. And then in other parts, the overall picture is
that we try to price in line with claims inﬂation.
Also outside of Norway, it's obviously that we're in -- the proﬁtability level this quarter in
the Baltics isn't good at all, and the volatility of the proﬁtability level in Sweden is too high
as -- we have a weak second quarter and then a fairly okay third quarter in Sweden. And I
think, I said on various occasions earlier that, we need to build a more robust proﬁtability
in the Swedish operations and we are working hard to achieve that. So there are
weaknesses and rooms for improvement in results and of course, you need to remember
that there are -- look through volatility in large losses, of course that is -- every quarter that
is -- that's the case.
On the reserve releases, we've been fairly clear that our kind of policy is to reserve every
new underwriting year at best estimate. And then we identiﬁed a bulk of run-oﬀ gains
stemming from winters 2014 and earlier, which has led to this NOK250 billion a quarter

Page 10 of 21

FINAL

run-oﬀ gains. But when calibrating our dividend proﬁle, the ordinary dividends, we have
been very eager to make sure that we can plan this, so if there is kind of no cliﬀ eﬀect
when we move from 2022 to 2023, we need to improve underlying proﬁtability and grow
the book of business, and I think we demonstrated that we are able to do that. Future
reserve releases after that, when we try to reserve at best estimate, it should be zero, and - but history shows results that on average, I think we have been slightly conservative in
the reserving, but the eﬀort is -- our best estimate is what we're aiming for.
Your third question was related to real estate prices. Our property investments are mainly
oﬃces in the Oslo area. There could of course be large changes in how that could aﬀect
the future, but so far real estate prices in Oslo have actually gone the other way during
the pandemic. So there are no signs of that happening at the moment that is then. As
what's happening in years ahead, I'm sure you are as a fortune teller as I am, Blair.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Just to add a comment on the ﬁrst question. We have, as you know Blair, I will say we have
a very unique position in Norway, both when it comes to Private business and Commercial
business. And you heard me also said that since 2010, the Foundation, they have paid out
NOK21 billion in customer dividends. So the combination of the business itself, our cost
position in Norway and the strong and unique customer dividend model, I will say that we
have a very unique and strong and robust model also for the coming years in Norway.

And we will now take our next question from Hakon Astrup with DNB Markets. Please go
ahead.

Q - Hakon Astrup

{BIO 18861149 <GO>}

Good morning. Two questions from me. The ﬁrst one is on growth. You have a strong
underlying growth in the quarter at 7.3%. Is it possible to say how much of that comes
from price increases and how much is market share in development? That was the ﬁrst
question. And the second question on the impact from COVID. So is it fair to expect some
positive COVID-19 impacts going forward as long as we have the current structure -restrictions in place? Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Hi, Hakon, it's -- I don't have a precise breakdown of the 7.3% overall growth in volume
and price, but if we look at it segment by segment, there is -- the majority is price, both in
Commercial and Private in Norway. But there is also positive volume eﬀects, I mean we've
gone through these price increases and still been able to have a high retention and
attract new business, especially within the motor business in the Private and in general in
the Commercial segment, I would say. In Denmark, we do also have volume growth in the
commercial part of the book and the same goes for Sweden. So it's a combination of
Page 11 of 21



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2020-10-20

volume and price in both Denmark and Sweden. I don't have the speciﬁc split there. And
of course, in the Baltics, we have negative growth and growth that's mainly volume. We try
to keep our stand in terms of pricing.

FINAL

Q - Hakon Astrup

{BIO 18861149 <GO>}

If I just -- my follow up on that. So in Norway, who are you taking market shares? Are they
from smaller players? Or are you taking market share from other incumbents?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I'm not sure if we are taking market share. I think it's quite stable, Hakon. The main
competitors when we discussed this with the distribution these days in the private line is -it's Tryg, If and Fremtind, so it's the three large competitors actually. And overall, I think
maybe the four signiﬁcant players in Norway maybe take some small shares together from
the small ones, but it's quite stable when it comes to market shares.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

So we take our share of the underlying volume growth.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

That's right, that's right, that's right.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Your second question on the forward kind of estimates on COVID-19 eﬀects going
forward. As we said, travel activity is very low. So there is some small positive eﬀects
probably from travel. Apart from that, I don't expect any signiﬁcant eﬀects really.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

But it's important when it comes to travel insurance, it's important to remember that this is
a 12 months product and Norway is a huge country, and it's lots of travel also in Norway.
So it's international travels where we have restrictions these days. So yes.

We will now take our next question from Jan Erik Gjerland with ABG. Please go ahead.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Good morning. Three questions from my side as well. First one is the fantastic
underwriting you have in Norway and having private at 55.6% claims ratio. How long is
really acceptable for you? Or what could customers really accept when it comes to these
levels? Is there any sort of lower level here on the proﬁtability at all? Or is it so that you
Page 12 of 21



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA

just repay over this fantastic returns should give back to your clients and they are sort of
pretty happy with it? That's my ﬁrst question.

FINAL

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Jan Erik, it's important to remember that when you're looking at the ﬁgures, you have to
adjust for run-oﬀ gains. You have to remember that we pay customer dividend. This year's
between 13% and 14% back to the consumers, and you have to -- you must also remember
the unique and low cost position and eﬃciency position. That's really important to bear in
mind when you're talking about proﬁtability and future. Jostein maybe commented that,
but we -- the growth in private lines in Norway, it's a combination of volume and price. It's
more price than volume, but still it's a combination. So -- and the competition is ﬁerce,
and ﬁnally, it's also important to remember that we in Norway with zero interest level, it's a
completely diﬀerent situation compared to only few years ago. So we think this is
sustainable, that's the summary actually.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. Perfect. And on the pricing and volume, you mentioned in the report that you see
some kind of rolling oﬀ in travel insurance, and you also have some payment protection
schemes in Sweden which sort of give you some headache. And if you can comment also
on how you will develop Sweden digital? And that will also be helpful.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yeah. I'll start on the ﬁrst part of the question, Jan Erik. The volume loss you're talking
about in travel is that the bulk of our travel insurance products are 12-month policies. So
you don't see an immediate reduction in premium on there, but we also have a part of the
travel insurance book that is more travel by travel insurance and sold through travel
agencies and so on. And that's more common in the Baltics and on the Gouda brand in
Denmark. So there we see a loss in travel business related to their travel restrictions from - stemming from COVID-19.
On the PPI, we have a small book of payment protection insurance in Sweden. It's not
enormous, but it -- yes, when there has been some increase in unemployment that is
typically when we do experience losses in that book, yes.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Sweden?

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

Yes, getting that. We do have of course trying to digitalize and automate most part of the
business. But we see the need to be -- to diﬀerentiate ourselves somewhat in Sweden,
given our relatively weak position there. So we decided to intensify our eﬀorts in Sweden
to digitalize all our customer oriented processes and automate as much as possible of the
-- of what's beneath the hood in internal processes. This should both give us the cost
reductions we need there, but also cater better to a more modern customer need there.
And also -- yes, so I think, we'll get back more with more details on the future Swedish
position at a later stage, but that's the headlines.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. So will it be on the restructuring cost or any lay-oﬀ which will make a signiﬁcant part
of it? Or how should we think about it? Should you run with zero people everything from
Norway? Or how should it really be played out?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yes, not quite. But it's too early to comment on any speciﬁc restructuring costs and so on,
but it will probably involve fewer people than today.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Finally, just comment on -- and a follow-up on Blair's question on run-oﬀ gains. You
have this run-oﬀ situation up to 2014, if I understood you correctly, six years apart from
since 2014, so is it so that we should expect more run-oﬀ to come as the sales
conservative provisioning levels going forward? Is that what you should prevent your cliﬀs
from coming? Is that sort of an indication?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

No, I think what we're trying to say is that we are intending to avoid that cliﬀ with just pure
underlying good proﬁts, growth and proﬁtability level. And our communication, as I
commented on Blair's question, remains the same. We reserve at each new underwriting
year at best estimate. We have a speciﬁc sort of pool of vintage run-oﬀ gains from workers
compensation and personal and individual motor stemming from 2014 and earlier and
we're taking that NOK250 million a quarter approximately. So I'll leave it at that.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks for your answers.

Thank you. Just one question from me. In your target to achieve NOK750 million of
underwriting results outside Norway, do you feel that you're running according to plan or

maybe a little bit above that?

FINAL

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I think it's fair to say that we -- if you look at the ﬁngers -- ﬁgures, we are ahead of the plan.
But what Jostein also said, it's volatile in Baltics, and it's volatile in Sweden and we are
going to implement a new legacy system in Denmark. So when we communicated that
target, we said that this would be volatile, but we are quite conﬁdent that we will reach the
target, Johan. I think that's important to remember, that we have a weak position in
Sweden and it's more vulnerable in the Baltics. And as I said during my presentation, we
are really pleased with the progression in Denmark and that's important.

We will now take our next question from Ulrik Zurcher with Nordea. Please go ahead.

Q - Ulrik Zurcher

{BIO 22026627 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I have two. I was wondering if you
could give a bit more color on why the property proﬁtability in Norway isn't exactly where
you want it and speciﬁc claims inﬂation so forth? And secondly, I think Jostein, you said
you have a reinvestment yield of 3.3%, which sounds a bit high when the Norwegian swap
is around 1%. So yeah, what's going on there? Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Inﬂation for property insurance in Norway.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

No, the -- why -- the ﬁrst one, why we're not happy with the product.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Okay, okay. Yes, it's -- when it comes to property, it's volatile and we also have this
problem with more water claims, more volatile weather. So when looking at the ﬁgures,
you have to remember that it has been lower large losses and lower medium size losses
in the quarter and in -- during 2020 as a whole also. And we haven't had any signiﬁcant
weather-related situations during this year.
So when we look underlying, we want to secure better, a stronger position to meet more
volatile weather situations going forward. It's ﬁrst and foremost related to water related
claims and weather-related claims, but we have improved our proﬁtability signiﬁcantly, I
would say since we started to implement lots of measures not only price measures one
year ago. But still we have to look at terms and our tariﬀs and price measures to secure

Page 15 of 21



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA

even stronger underlying proﬁtability for our property insurance in Norway, but we are
really on our way.

FINAL

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

And for your second question on the reinvestment yield. I mean these are the
reinvestments of what actually matured during the year so far and as you correctly point
out, if you look at the interest rate development throughout the year, it's been dropping
from the start of the year. So the bulk of the reinvestments we've done year-to-date
actually took place not in the third quarter, but in the two previous quarters when interest
rates were a bit higher. And there've been some issues with fairly okay yields for a good
investment credit, not the third quarter, but in the second quarter for instance. So we've
not increased our risk or reduced our credit requirements or anything like that to achieve
this, but going forward, we do expect reinvestment yields to continue to drop given
where we see interest rates curves are at the moment.

Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning. I was thinking about the maintained guiding of 86% to 89%
combined ratio with the 50% cost ratio, implying then 71% to 74% claims ratio. What would
that be for Q3? So what would you do with your current guiding, expects as a claim ratio
for Q3?

Please bear in mind that there is seasonality in the numbers, as you very well know. It's
second and third quarter are typically much better than the fourth and the ﬁrst quarter
due to just the weather in Scandinavia. So it's probably not so useful in looking at the
quarterly ﬁgures. We rather look at the 12-month rolling picture and kind of normalized for
said we have this NOK1 billion loss in run-oﬀ gains per year and normalized large losses,
we would now be at 83.9% on a 12-month rolling basis. That is comparable to the 86%
that we -- that we guide, that means that at the moment we are below that target there
and it's assumed, we say below 15% cost ratio. So if you say 15%, make it easy, that should
be almost 69% loss ratio on a 12-month rolling basis. Does that make sense to you?

Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

Yes, that makes sense. And also that's -- in the quarter, you have only 0.6% positive impact
from COVID-19. And in your pricing, you see some need to reprice in some areas, but our
pricing in line with inﬂation in other areas. So how are you going to get back to 86% to
89% level from the current signiﬁcantly lower (inaudible)?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

As I asked, I think was on the Jan's question, the ﬁrst one on the sustainability of 1993. We
do believe that at the moment, we will continue to deliver somewhat below. And the main
risks to that are of course the long-term competitive situation there and for everything that
we have under control, we are -- we have fairly good cost control. So we won't be that we
will break on the cost side, so be the loss ratio side. And given the current competitive
position in Norway, we are able to get through prices, as we've indicated. And we need to
improve the situation outside of Norway to get to the NOK750 million in 2022. So it's -- in
the short term, we probably deliver somewhat better, but this is a long-term target. It's not
year-by-year target.

{BIO 19956412 <GO>}

Hi, Helge. Hi, Jostein. Just a couple of questions left for me. Firstly, just on the dividend.
You sort of paid the ones relating to 2019, sort of as the coronavirus situation seemed to
have normalized to some degree. You mentioned sort of the emergence of a second
wave. Does that change your outlook on dividends at all similar to the fashion of the start
of the year? Or does the guidance from the Norwegian FSA annual capital position mean
that you're quite comfortable in paying a dividend if we were to see it worsen? And then
secondly, on the own model approval, is there any time line sort of approval of your own
model and that dialogue going forward?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

We saw a shift in regulatory stance after clariﬁcation from the Minister of Finance in
September and they were very clear that they saw diﬀerentiating between banks and
insurance companies. And it has been no change announced since that. So we are quite
comfortable that we will continue as we have been doing for many years with high and
stable and -- dividend and now and then, we also look at the total capital position. And as
I said, we -- now and then, we also pay out extraordinary dividends. So we are
comfortable with that.

A - Jostein Amdal

Related to the company.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yes, that was a clear signal from FSA and it's the Board's and then Gjensidige assembly to
decide that, not the FSA. On the own model time line, unfortunately, I'm not -- I don't
have a time line. It's -- it drags out, but we are working, as you see patiently to get our -the remaining parts approved at some time and we had a small victory this quarter.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Yes. Just on Vegard's questions as well. Why would you not sort of seek more growth or
proﬁt since you seems to have both available out there and grab some market share for
now and then get a better, even better position going forward?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Just to the DNA of the company, at least since I have been here for the last 20 years, Jan
Erik, has been to focus primarily on proﬁtable growth and that's still the overall target.
And as we communicated, now we have a combination of volume growth and premium
growth. So we are really pleased with the situation and the overall growth is really strong. I
think it's not right for me to change that in the organization and ask them for -- pushing
market shares. We have a strong distribution setup and they aim for growth where they
can secure growth in a proﬁtable way and that's the way we steer this company. So in
small segments, for some products in regions, of course we -- when it's possible, we will

Q - Thomas Svendsen

{BIO 6070863 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Two questions. First on premiums on the large corporates, you have
talked about for some time about increased prices there. Is it -- do you see it's more
diﬃcult to increase prices? Or is it easier to increase prices there? Or is it sort of a gradual
process of increasing prices in this segment?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

I think --

Q - Thomas Svendsen

That's the ﬁrst question. And the second question is --

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yes, come on, Thomas, yes.

Q - Thomas Svendsen

{BIO 6070863 <GO>}

Yeah. Just the second question on motor claims because we had this anecdotes here in
Norway, that traﬃc were up 30% some part of the country and you might expect some
more claims from that. Did you see any eﬀect from the increased traﬃc? Or was it natural
both? Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah. Large corporates, it's always tough discussions. But I would say that the situation is
unchanged since two years back and until now. So it has been easier for us to implement
price increases also for large corporates, both direct -- in the direct channel also through
the broker channel. So it's unchanged situation compared to what we saw one-year ago
and also two years ago, but we are soon reaching 1st of January renewals and that's
always tough discussions. But we are, I would say, quite conﬁdent that we will continue to
these renewals also in a very strong way.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yeah. I guess we'll have more to report on that in the third quarter -- fourth quarter report
again. And on the second part of the motor side, we -- I think that the claims pattern also
Page 19 of 21

in motor has returned to a fairly normal level after being somewhat lower in the ﬁrst, say

see anything particular within our claims numbers at least.

America. Please go ahead.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you. Just wanted to come back on the dividend question. You said that the -- your
ability to pay dividends will be related to your old solvency situation. But there seems to
be a change in the regulatory view compared to earlier this year where there was a
blanket ban on dividends. What do you think has prompted that change and what would
be the risk that the Norwegian FSA reverts back to that policy where there's a blanket
ban?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Regulation is always a risk, but I think when you read the clariﬁcation from the Ministry of
Finance in September, it's a very clear diﬀerentiation between banks and insurance
companies. So we think this will be the situation also going forward. When you look at the
solvency position of the companies and Gjensidige today, I do not think -- and also when
we commented that macro situation and the forecast for next year, I do not see a risk -- a
large risk at least or any changes in that there.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Was that a regulatory error earlier in the year then do you think?
