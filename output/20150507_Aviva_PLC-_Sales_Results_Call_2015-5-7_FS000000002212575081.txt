MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Aviva Plc's Q1 2015 Financial Results Conference Call.
Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mark Wilson, Aviva Group CEO.
Please go ahead, sir.

FINAL

Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone, and welcome, as usual, to our first –
this is our Q1 trading update. I do know it's a very busy day for all of us and indeed in the
UK and the rest of the country for that matter, so I'll try and keep my comments brief and
therefore give us plenty of time for Q&A.
With me in the room as usual are Tom Stoddard, our Group CFO; as well as I've got a
number of the senior members of my management team, particularly the main business
line heads, Maurice Tulloch from GI; Euan Munro, Asset Management; David McMillan, of
course the Rest of Europe and Health Insurance; and of course, Andy Briggs in his new
role as the CEO of UK Life; Chris Wei is also on the line from Singapore.
So if we step back and have a look, I guess I've got three key messages for you today.
First, I think this is a very satisfactory set of numbers for Q1. In particular, the
improvements in the UK. The UK despite all the regulatory change and all that continues
to be a pretty resilient market for us.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second, we now have completed as you know the Friends Life acquisition, and we've
started the integration of pace. We can cover more of that in some more detail, but our
plans were well advanced obviously before we got the final approval. So that is moving
fast. And third, we continue I think to demonstrate some pretty good financial resilience,
which is important when you look at markets and regulatory conditions globally.
Now let's turn to the numbers, and I should point out that all the numbers that I'm going
to talk about here and, indeed, as you see we've laid out in the packs, excludes Friends
Life, as of course they weren't with us in that quarter. But we'll cover Friends Life a little bit
separately later as well.
Value of new business, VNB, is up 14% to £247 million constant currency. Within this, UK
Life in France grew 15%, which I think is not too bad for developed markets, so-called
developed markets, while our ex-turnaround business of Italy was up 44%. I think I really
have to drop the turnaround tag for Italy as that business continues to improve. David is
shaking his head. He thinks if we don't drop the turnaround tag, it'll keep him under more
pressure for longer; and maybe that's accurate.
Poland grew 24% after stripping out the impact of pension changes in Lithuania. Turkey
was only up 4%. That was impacted by a reduction in our ownership, that's with a partial
IPO. And also, had quite a big impact from a higher assumed withholding tax. And so that
will normalize in the next quarter. Asia VNB was 16% higher. That's a little bit lower than
recent trends. So it was a bit of a quieter quarter for Asia.
In our German insurance business, the COR has improved to 96.4%, with a sub-90% COR
in our European businesses. The Canada COR of 98.1%, that still experienced higher than
normal claims frequency, albeit this is 4.6 percentage points better than last year. So
improvement in the right direction.
The UK general insurance appears to have turned the corner with premiums actually up
1%. And whilst this may not seem significant, remember this was a business that had nine

FINAL

consecutive quarters of year-on-year premium decline as we exited businesses and
exited segments from market we didn't like. And of course the third quarter, that business
had really started turning around.
Just to be clear though we do not focus and we don't award any of the senior
management on volume. But you do need scale to make general insurance work. And so
we've kicked up pricing discipline, because we've exited the businesses. Now we're
seeing that turnaround, and we believe that trend will at least continue.
In asset management we continue to focus on building our third-party franchise and in
particular there's a lot of work being done on integrating the Friends Life assets. The
infrastructure for the Virtus agreement, which is a large distribution agreement, should be
ready in the coming months. And at that stage AIMS will also have a 12-month track record
in July, which as you know is important for many of the employee benefit consultants.
We've already on-boarded the assets managed directly by Friends Life, which is about
£20 billion of funds under management. And we would expect more assets to come over
this year in due course.

Bloomberg Transcript

As we have said many times before though, and I keep on emphasizing this, the
turnaround in asset management will take some time. I'm delighted with the team we
have in place. I'm happy with the progress. And we're seeing some positive signs, but we
need to see the fund flows increase substantially.
Finally, onto the balance sheet and capital position, which is particularly important as we
transition to Solvency II. Our IFRS net per share is up £0.08 to £3.48 as profits and a small
gain in the pension surplus more than offset the negative impact from the foreign
exchange moves. And of course this is without Friends Life acquisition, which will add a
further £0.55 per share. So if you go back I mean our NAV is up about 20%-odd excluding
that over the last 12 months. So the NAV is certainly moving in the right direction.
Our economic surplus increased from £8 billion to £8.1 billion. That's despite the lower
interest rates and the adverse ForEx movements. Our coverage ratio is pretty stable at
177%. And to be clear this also excludes the Friends Life surplus.
Our external ratio is 40% of tangible equity on an IFRS basis and 28% on the S&P basis.
I've been clear for some time that S&P is the basis I'd like to use going forward. I
recognize there's no perfect basis for leverage, but at least this gives you something you
can compare versus peers. I should also add there that this basis isn't perfect in that we
don't deduct all this excess liquidity that we have at the group center, which is, what,
another £1.8 billion as well. So I guess really the results are slightly better than that.
Now after consolidating Friends Life we'd expect these debt ratios to drop to 36% and
27% respectively, which is well within our targeted range of being consistent with an S&P
AA rating. Of course as I said that's the glow stick, which excludes the liquidity at the
holding company.

FINAL

Now between Aviva and Friends Life we do have debt falling due or available for call in
the next two years. And when the markets are good we will take the opportunity to
structure our total debt to lower our cost of capital. Therefore also lowers our cash that
we spend up on that debt as well. So it's when the markets are good, we should take
those opportunities.
On Solvency II I'm just going to say that we continue to make progress in our discussions
with the regulator. We are due to submit our formal application for partial internal model
approval in June. And we will work hard to ensure a smooth transition to Solvency II.
Operating under an economic capital framework, as we have done for a number of years,
and we're being pretty transparent in all that, has positioned well. And we remain right in
the range I thought we'd be. In addition over the 2016 and 2017 years, we will see the
benefit as yet unquantified of Friends Life to improve our capital position further.
We also came into the Solvency II, and we have pretty good understanding of where we
were, because we had a lot of discussions with the regulator as we went through the
Friends Life transaction. So we understood where we were pretty early on.

Bloomberg Transcript

Nevertheless I should also be very clear we have much work to do before the end of the
year. And as we have signaled previously, unfortunately there is a high cost of Solvency II
implementation, just in terms of building the systems and getting ready as you saw in our
results last year.
Now a few words on Friends Life if I may. The planning was well advanced before closure,
which has allowed us to be quick out of the blocks on implementation. The level of
planning on this, and I've been involved in a lot of integrations over my career, the level of
detailed planning is more than I think we've done before. And that's why it's progressing
so far so good.
For example on completion day all the signage was changed on all of the Friends
buildings. So all the branding was already changed. A small thing, but quite symbolic.
We've already announced the closure of the Friends Life head office, one new change.
And also one of the sites next to those, we lower our overall property costs, non-people
costs, sort of a no-brainer.
And in addition we have already moved the first £20 billion of assets from Friends Life to
Aviva Investors, which is the first stage of the asset management transformation. And the
rest would happen over time. You should expect more of this by the end of this year. And
our asset management business is pretty busy at the moment just getting ready for what
are some fairly large chunks of assets.
As far as Friends Life results are concerned, it's much as really we anticipated. Value of
new business is £12 million lower, almost entirely due to lower annuities, which we had
assumed, but not material at the group level at all. Corporate benefits are showing some
good promise with assets under management or assets under administration, 7% higher,
and some good positive net inflows. And Andy and the team is as I said before
progressing the integration at pace.

So probably I think, operator, I'll stop there. And I've got my team with me here too, and
between us we can answer questions. So let's open up for questions and from people on
the call.

FINAL

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. And we will now take our first question from Jon Hocking from Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead, your line is open.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Good morning everybody. I've got three questions, please. Firstly, wondered when you're
going to be able to comment on the consolidated economic capital position for the two
businesses. And related to that, when are you going to be able to communicate
something more concrete on the capital synergies? That's the first question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second question, on the transitionals that you're going to use in the UK, I'm guessing it's
related to the annuity business. Could you just comment about the discussions with the
PRA there, and particularly how confident are you in terms of the ability to continue upstreaming cash? And then finally, just on the asset management business, I wonder if you
could talk about the ongoing plans there, in terms of the capability with the team,
products, et cetera? Is it just AIMS, or are there other products which are going to come
alongside that? Thank you.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Okay. So I'll get Tom take the first two, and then I'll get Euan to take the other. Just the
second part of your first question though. Jon, we're probably not going to actually
disclose at least in the near future the capital synergies because, as I said, they'll come
out over time. And we want to give those to you as they can. We'll just to stick to my
previous comment that they are significant, but they will come out over time. Tom, you
want to take the other two?

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

Yeah. I'll pick that up. So on the question of when we will report consolidated economic
capital, we'll do that at the half year; and I think about Mark's comment. Again, we're very
pleased with the Friends transaction. It gives us quite a lot more flexibility around our
capital and our capital position. So that continues to be a good thing that we're seeing
more and more. We do expect to realize significant capital synergies; and those will
emerge over time. But we'll give you a better sense of those as time goes on.
In terms of transitionals, yes, you're correct, those primarily relate to our UK annuity
business. And what I would say is that this is not a new issue. We've been aware of
transitionals for some time. And as we've been managing our economic capital and the
transition of Solvency II, we've been doing that with an eye on where we're likely to end

Page 5 of 29



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2015-05-07

up on a Solvency II basis. So the way we've been managing our capital position is very
consistent with that.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

FINAL

I mean, transitionals shouldn't be something that should keep you awake, I wouldn't have
thought, for us.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

And, Euan, on the asset management.

A - Euan G. Munro

{BIO 2307409 <GO>}

On the asset management side, we're talking about the transfer of assets on the (14:31).

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

Capabilities outside of AIMS.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Capabilities outside of AIMS.

A - Euan G. Munro

{BIO 2307409 <GO>}

I think on the capabilities outside AIMS, I think we've got some very strong suites in illiquid
lending, so we've obviously recently transferred from the UK Life business the real estate
lending origination capability; and that combined with our capabilities in infrastructure and
private replacement debt are of considerable interest to the pension fund community
who are looking to expand into that area, particularly with bond yields on high-quality debt
being so low and their ability to access a liquidity premium. So that's something that's very
strong.
We have established capabilities in real estate and global high yield, as well as our
recognized and attractive asset classes for specialist asset classes. So just in terms of our
generic abilities and I mentioned recently in a press call that 86% of our funds over three
years are exceeding the benchmarks that have been set. There is considerable
investment expertise across a wide range of capabilities in Aviva Investors.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Yeah. Jon, I've said for a long time now, the issue with Aviva Investors was never the fund
performance. The underlying fund performance has been fine. The issue was a lack of
strategy; a lack of our, say, core flagship products; and a lack of senior management. Now
we solved the senior management by basically replacing the entire executive team. But

Page 6 of 29



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2015-05-07

the underlying PMs which have been performing well, there's a lot of consistency there.
So we've got to deliver, but so far so good.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

FINAL

Just a quick follow-up. The AIMS flows you've seen so far, what types of channels are
those coming through?

A - Euan G. Munro

{BIO 2307409 <GO>}

A variety of channels. And so they're coming from wealth channels and some of the
established platforms, part of these lands down (16:38) core funds. These kinds of
channels are directing assets in our direction. And we're starting to see signs now that the
institutional channels are starting to work. So the major global consultants don't like us
telling externally whether they've got us on a buy rating or not, but we have got a number
of the global consultants of who've put the fund on the buy rating; and that is going to
start telling with substantial flows. But we've seen some small institutional flows.
And our internal sources, our internal platform, wealth platforms and institutional is just
really beginning. And what should start to come through in the second half of the year, as
Mark mentioned earlier, is the relationship with investors should start to flow. That one
isn't set up yet. It should be set up in around July. We'll be pre-selling very soon.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

I think we got some of the buyers a bit earlier than we talked. Because normally, as you
know, you don't really get the buyer until after 12 months performance, and clearly the
performance has been pretty good. I think the first nine months of the first fund is what,
9%?

A - Euan G. Munro

{BIO 2307409 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

And it's LIBOR plus 5 as a target. I do know that because I've invested in it personally. So
the 9%, so far so good, the performance is backing up more than what we said it would.
So...

A - Euan G. Munro

{BIO 2307409 <GO>}

If I can add one thing as well. AIMS is a suite of funds, there's the target income fund, as
well as the target return; and it's quite interesting the target income fund particularly
given that's a pressing client need to access diversified sources of income. That is actually
quite a unique offering in the marketplace, and it is seeing nice flows.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
So we will now take our next question from Chris Esson from Credit Suisse. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Chris J. Esson

{BIO 16208369 <GO>}

Thank you, and good morning, everyone. So three quick questions for me, please. Firstly
on UK P&C, it's only modestly better year-on-year, despite the weather being fairly
benign in the UK. Just wondered if you could comment on any sort of other drivers within
that result and how we should think about that in a full-year context?
Secondly, in terms of central liquidity. So given that you didn't manage to renew the DBS
deal, I just wondered if you could highlight what, roughly you'd earmarked for that in
terms of up-front costs? And how we should think about that in terms of your central
liquidity? And lastly, following on from that, on the DBS renewal. I know you've made
comments in the past about staying the course in Asia. I just wondered now that it is
official and you have not managed to renew the relationship, what is the strategy in the
region? Is it meaningful enough to continue to be part of the group? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Thanks, Chris. How about let's start with the P&C, Maurice, just want to comment and give
them a context?

A - Maurice Tulloch

{BIO 17683736 <GO>}

Yes. Morning, Chris. I mean, your question is really about the UK. So obviously we made
some progress. We did benefit from a more benign weather, but we also had less
favorable development than we did in the prior. Nothing material, still within our long term
trading range; and certainly not a new trend. But pleased that we made some moderate
progress, and also pleased that we've seen progress in our Canadian business against
the backdrop of another harsh winter, not as hard as 2014 when we had the polar vortex.
And also our European GI business was off to a moderately progressively good start as
well. So that's really the headline, Chris.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

On the DB, just a few comments and then I'll pass over to Chris as well. We said we're
going to be disciplined. And clearly as I said before, we were in a favored position. We
had a good relationship with them. But to be blunt, I would have been irritated if we had
sort of lost out on this by a small way, but we weren't – in the end the numbers that were
paid weren't remotely close to what we thought was economic. And just to be clear, that
wasn't because we wouldn't have been able to fund it because clearly we could have. But
it wasn't even remotely close. And the £1.2 billion of course which is just the upfront, non-

Page 8 of 29

Date: 2015-05-07

FINAL

contingent is only part of the payment you make. So it was a pretty easy decision in the
end.
And in terms of – Chris, where it sits, it's about 20% of our VNB in Singapore, just to be
clear. So it's only about 20% of our VNB in Asia or Singapore. And in terms of the profits in
the back book and everything else, we keep it. So we've got renewal lifes and all the stuff
we've got and includes all the credit and sharing some of the profitable stuff because we
renew that. It's wasn't just like your distribution agreement. Because, of course, about
eight years ago, whatever it was, we bought the business off them, so we had some
client marketing rights and ownership rights there as well. So we can still sell on the under
parts of that base which is quite helpful.
So in terms of profitability or the scale in Asia, it doesn't impact us a whole lot. We're
paying that sort of price. And maybe others can do it better than we can perhaps, but we
certainly couldn't get a return off it. So that's why we didn't chase it.

Bloomberg Transcript

Asian strategy, we still have the same businesses we had. It doesn't change the Asian
strategy a lot. But then China has been growing at 100% a year; and we'd expect
continued strong growth. We've got what we think is the best JV partner, with Jardines, or
the Astra Group, which is the largest conglomerate in Indonesia, of course. And the
business is still growing. We are looking at putting in a fair bit more money into things – a
lot more money into things like digital, which was on the horizon anyway, but we might
speed that up a bit.
I'll pass over to Chris Wei in a second to pass some comments. Just in terms of central
liquidity. Obviously, we have got a fair bit of central liquidity. We've still got to pay things
out like potentially the integration costs, and so we have got a fair bit of it and we've got
dividend, of course, to pay as well. So we had earmarked some money for it, but those
were the figures. We would have funded some of that by debt obviously as well if we
were going to do DBS. So it wouldn't have been that difficult to fund. But it wasn't a
funding issue. It was more a return issue that we're worried about. Chris, do you want
pass any comments on the Asian strategy? Hopefully you can...

A - Christopher B. Wei

{BIO 17014406 <GO>}

Sure. Thanks, Mark. And good morning, Chris. Just to remind everybody as well, I mean,
what Manulife paid was only for four markets, not for the full six that we were paying for.
So more to sort of stress the point around value. I just wanted to contextualize our
business in Singapore. As Mark would have said, of course, we would have liked to renew
it. But we actually had very strong positions in other bits of Singapore. We have a
diversified multi-distribution strategy.
We are strong in the IFA market. We're actually number one in protection via that channel.
We are a majority owner of an award-winning FA, which is PIAS. We were the first to go
digital direct in general insurance. We had the full range of licenses. In fact, we're the only
foreign player with a full range of CPF products, that's the Central Provident Fund
products which is government-run schemes. We're number one in group employee

benefits with hundreds of thousands of members; and that all sets up a great affinity play
for us.
And as Mark mentioned, we have fantastic joint venture partners in addition to Costco in
China, which has a few hundred million consumers as customers; Astra Group which is sort
of the dominant conglomerate in automotive and other industries in Indonesia. We also
have First Financial in Taiwan, we have VietinBank in Vietnam, et cetera. So there is
significant continued sort of organic growth that we can mine in Asia. And although a small
setback, nonetheless, I think our Asian strategy is still looking very positive.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Next. Thanks. Operator, next question?

Operator
We will now take the next question from Andrew Crean from Autonomous. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning, all. Three questions, please. Firstly, you gave us the NAV addition from
Friends Life of £0.55. Could you give us the impact of Friends Life on tangible IFRS equity
and on MCEV?
Secondly, you noted that the cash at center had gone up to £1.8 billion, because of the
Friends Life deal. That I assume is the liberation of the monies which were held at the Life
holding company. Does that mean that you've actually – that was one of the sort of capital
synergies, was liberating that money and bringing it up to the holding company. Has that
been done? And then the third question is on the fungibility issue on the Aviva annuities.
Does the use of transitionals mean that you cannot get dividends up from the annuity
company until the transitionals are over? And have you been taking dividends up from
Aviva annuities over past years?

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Well morning, Andrew. I'll hand those over to Tom I think.

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Andrew. That's a long list here. So on the tangible NAV, we will provide that
information to you at the half year. We're still working out the closing balance sheet right
now. As you know we closed the transaction on April 10, and so we're still working on the
acquisition balance sheet at this point. So we'll give you that detail with the half year
disclosures.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Tom, can I just say, do you not have it? Because you've given us the impact of the Friends
Life acquisition on the debt leverage relative to tangible book, so you must have worked
Page 10 of 29

it out already?

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

FINAL

We have that information, but again we're just not providing that at this point. So and
again we're still working out some of the details in the acquisition balance sheet, but
we're just not providing that disclosure at this time.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

Second question was on the liquidity. Effectively this is just combining the two companies.
This does not reflect the potential synergy benefit of extracting more cash from the
Friends Life subsidiary. So this is really just adding across.
And then your third question on fungibility, transitionals, I guess what I'd say is that we
don't expect the transitionals to restrict our ability to take dividends from our UK Life
operations. On the other hand our UK annuity business has not been providing a lot of
dividends to us over recent years. So again I think as you look at this overall in context,
we've been managing the business to provide cash and support our financing
requirements, again without relying on dividends from our UK annuity business.

Morning, gentlemen.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Morning, Greig.

Q - Greig N. Paterson

{BIO 6587493 <GO>}

Just at full year you were using a diversification credit on your economic capital of 37%.
And in the deal literature you mentioned that at least for interest rates the two groups
have opposite correlation, or opposite sensitivity to interest rate. I was wondering to what
extent that diversification credit will increase on an economic capital basis, once you
combine the two groups?

Page 11 of 29

FINAL

The second point is I noticed that the margins on Friends Life Group annuities collapsed.
They've halved from the final quarter last year to this quarter. I do appreciate volumes are
down, but I thought there was a GAO underpin. In other words they were sourcing a lot of
their business from their GAO book, and hence the margin was protected to some
extent. I was wondering if you could explain why that has dropped.
And the third thing is at least relative to my expectations, UK equity release, UK bulk,
Poland and Spain seemed a bit light. I wonder if you could possibly shed some light on the
reasons for that?

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Okay. Well morning, Greig. So first just on the diversification credit, yes, you're right. I've
got a ballpark that I'm not going to share, partly because we've still got to do – there's a
lot modeling work, as you'd appreciate, to do to get that exact. And we'll share that as it
comes through. But in terms of strategically or directionally, you're right, yes, there is
further diversification credit.

Yes. Yes. The answer is, yes, it is material.

Q - Greig N. Paterson

{BIO 6587493 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Secondly, on the margins, Andy, do you want to take it?

A - Andy D. Briggs

{BIO 4311809 <GO>}

Yeah, sure. So morning, Greig, it's Andy here. So we saw lots – far more customers
deferring their retirement decision, but not taking the money away. So the fund flows as
you can see are fine. It's they're deferring their retirement decision. We keep taking
annual management charge. So I'm not at all concerned.
The reason for the impact on margin is obviously we didn't have the revenue from the
sales on the one side, and yet we kept the staff on board. In fact we increased staff
numbers to get ready for the pension freedoms in April. So ordinarily if we'd seen
volumes go down, we'd have taken cost out. We didn't, because we wanted to retrain the
staff ready for pension freedoms, which is we've managed fine.
Just on your third question on UK equity release, we had an excellent first quarter, very...

We own all of it. And we had a good first quarter on equity release, very pleased and very
strong performance. Bulk annuities, my attitude to that is that if we can write business
profitably, we'll deploy capital and do so. In the first quarter of this year we had a very light
level of bulk annuities. We actually feel quite positive about the pipeline from here. But at
the end of the day we'll be disciplined and only deploy capital where we can get good
returns.

No, I'm impressed; I'm impressed. I assume he's telling the truth, which is good, yes.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

He has been absorbed. Poland and Spain, David, do you want to?

A - David McMillan

{BIO 17298829 <GO>}

Hi, Greg. David here. Just on Poland, last year, we had a fairly large one-off in Lithuania,
which of course is consolidated in the Polish numbers. That was about £9 million. Poland at
underlying level is tracking to similar levels of growth as we saw last year. So we're
expecting significant growth in the Polish business for the rest of the year as that one-off
first quarter benefit washes out the numbers.
Spain, we're actually starting to see the Spanish market pick up. Clearly at a macro level
GDP growth is quite strong in Spain. Our VNB growth last year was in the 20s% for Spain.
And this year for the first quarter we're at 14%, with a particularly strong performance in
protection, which was up in the high-40s%. So I'm kind of cautiously optimistic on
prospects of Spain for the rest of the year.

business going forward?

Certainly the big quarter for Spain is the fourth quarter where most of the pension

And we will now take our next question from Abid Hussain from Société Générale. Please
go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Abid Hussain

{BIO 17127644 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, all. Three questions, if I can? The first one on equity release. I was
wondering if you have ironed out what the PRA if the matching adjustment under Solvency
II can be applied to this product, and if you are confident of this application going
forward? That's the first question.
The second one is on Solvency II, what impact can we expect your balance sheet, if any,
should you risk-weight your sovereign bond holdings? And then the final question is on
your holding company liquidity. It's come in at £1.8 billion. And the first part of the question
is, it looks a little bit like – going through the Friends Life acquisition presentation. I
would've thought it'd be slightly higher than that. And the second part of that question is,
what is the minimum that you expect to hold for the enlarged group? I think previously
you've said around £1 billion for Aviva standalone. Thanks.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Okay. Just I'll take the third one and then give the other two to Tom. Just on the holding
company it's £1.8 billion, of course the dividend from Friend has been paid out. So that's
probably just to speak there's a difference in the calculation.

FINAL

Which I'd suspect. Tom, do you want to take the first one?

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

Sure. On equity release, that's still a work in progress, but we're confident that we'll get
matching adjustment for equity release. We're feeling quite good about that work stream
right now.
On Solvency II, let me come back to that. On the holding company liquidity, we have not
yet set sort of a new benchmark in terms of where we're going to try to manage that.
That's something we're still working out now as we pull the two companies together and
look at the pro forma balance sheets. And I'm sorry, the question on Solvency II again
was?

A - Euan G. Munro

{BIO 2307409 <GO>}

Own risk for sovereign bonds?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

Own risk for sovereign bonds. Yeah. That's something that we had already baked in
during the course of the year last year on our own as we were trying to anticipate where
things were going to go. So as we look at our economic capital ratios, the own risk for
sovereign bonds is already included in that.

Q - Abid Hussain

{BIO 17127644 <GO>}

Can I just come back on the equity release point? So you said that you feel confident that
the PRA is going to approve the matching adjustment. I mean you need to be fairly
confident I guess, because if this is a product that you're pushing into 2016, how confident
are you?

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Very.

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

We're very confident.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Maybe if I may add a little bit of color on that. Clearly, there's a funding gap in the UK,
because of that the government is very keen on equity release. I've said that before.
They're very keen. The regulator likes equity releases of product as well; and they've
been working well with us to get it through. So it's fair to say we are confident. Is that
helpful?

We will now take our next question from Gordon Aitken from RBC. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. Three questions, please. First on annuities, and these are off a lot,
perhaps we expected that. The pensions that was off an awful lot in both Aviva and
Friend's. I know consultants get particularly unsettled when there's any sort of corporate
activity. Just wondering to what extent do you think the business was affected during the
first quarter, and to what extent that's running on now?
And second question on the decline in volume in the guaranteed annuity option book that
would be great, on Q1 versus Q4. And the third question on cash. And so you've reported
£0.5 billion of OCG, and it's the same in the first quarter, that's the same as you reported
two years' ago. Just wondering why this number isn't progressing when various other
metrics of the group seem to be. And maybe you can in the answer to the question just
touch on the shape of the cash flows of the back book. Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Gordon, if I could just take the cash one for a second, just a couple of comments. I mean,
the annuities have had an impact on the OCG, but as I – bluntly on OCG, I would have
preferred not putting it out because I think the matrix becomes a bit irrelevant. I was
persuaded that by IR appropriately that if I didn't, you guys would think there was
something hidden on there, so we put out just to show there wasn't.
But the reality is OCG is becoming a bit of a meaningless metric as you move towards
Solvency II. And so I'd suggest that people focus on two things. The key thing is the actual
cash that comes up to group, OCG is a Pillar 1 metric that's a precursor to that. So I'd
focus on the cash coming up to group. The problem with that, of course, is you only really
get to see that figure once a year, and I agree with that.
And secondly, obviously, earnings. So it's the cash up to the group is the first focus, that's
key. That's what we pay dividends out of. And the earnings, but we don't have any
shortage of earnings anyway. So that's what I'd say on OCG. On the annuities point and
the pensions, let me pass it over to Andy.

A - Andy D. Briggs

{BIO 4311809 <GO>}

Sure, very happy to. Good morning, Gordon. I hope you're well. So on annuities, yes, we
are down significantly both on the heritage Aviva and heritage Friends side. But that
customer is deferring their retirement decision. So it's not that the money is going out the
door, and will continue given the scale of our book. And the fact we've got one in four

Page 16 of 29

FINAL

maturing pensions in the UK. We'll continue to take the annual management charges.
Actually, pensions businesses has performed very well on both sides of the house in the
first quarter. So we don't disclose individual product splits on the Aviva side of the house.
But we have said that although annuities are off 60%, the protection is broadly flat. The
two growth areas have been pensions and the equity release.
On the Friends of the house, although the VNB is down slightly, as I've long said to you
and I know you agree, VNB isn't the best measure on these product lines anyway. You
want to look at the cash generation and the net fund flows and we've had another quarter
of good positive net fund flows on the Friends side. So, all in all, consultants are very
comfortable with what we're doing; and I'm positive about the pipeline on the pensions'
book.
Specifically on the GAOs, yes, we have seen that fall off. But, again, it's customers
deferring their retirement decision. It's not that they're taking the money away from us.
So, again, we'll continue to take the annual management charges, and that bodes well in
terms of cash generation, which is our kind of primary focus.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

We have seen people in the first quarter, there's no doubt, defer decisions and we've
sort of assumed that was going to be the case. The other point that, Andy, that he said
this morning, of course, is that auto enrollment. Aviva hasn't really benefited from auto
enrolment yet because Aviva was very much the SMEs. Friends was the large scheme, so
now we've got both I guess. But the SMEs we haven't really benefited from that. As you
know, the auto enrolment happen to the large schemes and progressively gets down to
smaller schemes. So it's the next year or two that we will start benefiting from that. We
haven't yet; and that will be helpful, and that's a key focus for us.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Can I just follow up on the pensions question? I mean you're down quite a bit from Q4. I'm
just wondering what happened in Q4? I mean the seasonality used to always be round
about in your strong quarter in Q1. Obviously, we've got pensions freedoms, but what
happened in Q4 that hasn't happened in Q1?

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

Is this on the heritage Aviva or heritage Friends side, Gordon?

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Well, let's talk Aviva.

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

Yeah. So, I mean, you get kind of lumps and chunks on the pensions' market just generally.
I'm not at all concerned in terms of the trend at the time.

And we will now take our next question from Ming Zhu from Canaccord. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.

Q - Ming Zhu

{BIO 17001429 <GO>}

Hello. Good morning. Just three questions, please. First question on the – you've
mentioned after the pension reform you've seen quite a lot of customers deferring their
decisions. Could you just provide a bit more detailed color? And have you seen smaller
pots maybe cashing in?
And my second question is on asset management. There's a comment in the statement
that saying you are unprepared to receive Friends Life funds managed by external parties.
And are these external parties you're referring to Schroders and AXA? I thought for AXA
there was a break clause between Friends Life and AXA coming up some time in 2015.
Could you please clarify on that? And my third question is on the Canada GI. There's a
comment of higher claim frequency in Q1 than the long-term average. Could you please
provide a bit more color on that and what you've seen in terms of the ulterior motor rate
reform reduction, please? Thank you.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

FINAL

Sure. So the comment amount deferring decisions was very much geared around Q1, so
this is a Q1 trading update. Just to give you a bit of color what's happened since April 6.
So we have seen initially a big spike up in the level of calls in line with what we expected,
probably double the level of calls coming in; although, generally April is a busier time.
That's tailed back off again. But in terms of – those customers, they're choosing to take
action, tending to be the much smaller pots and taking the money, but it's not significant
in terms of the volumes involved. So all gone pretty much as we would have expected.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

And I am right in saying, I think, Andy, it's well less than 1% of those that are eligible, right?
It's not a material number at all yet, which is quite interesting. It could change throughout
the year though, of course. So it's a bit early to tell, but so far the number hasn't been
material and the calls have dropped off. So we'll give you an update as we give it maybe
at the half-year.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second question is on investments and if I can pass a comment and hand over to
Euan. And so what we've said, there's three pots – well, there's really four pots to money.
So step back, there's about £100 billion assets that Friends have. £30 billion of that was
client-directed and historically Friends didn't have the internal capability to get that. So we
will try and get that over time as well.
Then there's £70 billion that is really company-directed effectively. Of that, there was £20
billion, roughly £20 billion, that was managed by Friends. So we've already bought at a
cost. Then there's another £35 billion managed by AXA. And you're entirely right, there
was a break clause in September of this year and we have assumed – we have budgeted
for that break clause. There's a whole lot of process you need to go through and get
ready for it and stuff because £35 billion is a large sum of money and we are going
through that and we're entirely on track as we expected to be.
We've got good systems and things. So we're entirely on track with that. Then on the
Schroders piece, which is the last piece of that puzzle. We've said we're not going to do
that this year and we'll discuss that with Schroders next year as we progress. Euan, do you
want to add to all that?

A - Euan G. Munro

{BIO 2307409 <GO>}

Yeah. I am a bit disconcerted that the message has got out we're where unprepared. I
mean, I think what I did say was that we would not take assets that we were unprepared
to take; and nor would I expect some to be pushed in our direction. So I think we are
ready to take these assets. And we are essentially waiting on the decisions being made
to pass them in our direction.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

FINAL

Sure. Morning, Ming. I mean, the first thing I would say is the Canadian business is a
seasonal business. So if you look at last year at 102.7%, I just guided to where we ended
the year last year at 96.1%. So the comment that I talked about, frequency still above the
long-term average. We look at our business in terms of 15-year movements. But 98.1%
while significantly better than last year, it's still above our long-term average. And 2014
was the worst winter on record for the northeast in the U.S. and for most to Canada. 2015,
while better, was still worse than our long-term average.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

So it's what, it's 4 percentage points better, but the frequency is still high. Does that make

Your line is open.

Q - Alan G. Devlin

{BIO 5936254 <GO>}

Hi, guys. Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions. The first one on general
insurance. I wonder if you'd give us what the underlying combined ratio did. You
mentioned the impact of reserve releases, but I wonder if you'd give the movement in
the weather and impact of the weather over the quarter as well?
And then secondly on the economic capital, you mentioned interest rates and FX worked
against you. I was just wondering what the moving parts were which then worked in your
favor to offset both of them. And also, you mentioned the capital synergies emerge over
time. When do you expect to see the capital synergies starting to merge? Do you think
we'll see any movement over the course of this year or do we have to wait until
2016/2017? Thanks.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Good morning, Alan. I'll just take the third one. The other two on the capital synergies,
going to ask to emerge (47:06). I am not going to give that out. I know that's the key point
for modeling and everyone's – I mean, you guys have to take a position on that, I guess.
And partly it's because we just haven't finished the modeling, and there are some choices
we need to make where we want it to – when and where we want it to emerge as well.
On the first one on GI, Maurice, just want to talk about the underlying trend?

{BIO 17683736 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. I mean there's a number of moving parts, Alan. I mean, certainly in the UK, the
weather was certainly more benign than last year. So that was certainly a benefit. But the
other moving factor would have been prior developments. We were less favorable than
we were this time last year. We actually do note that we were at 0.7% overall favorable
development in our GI business as a whole, and last year it was 1.4%. So broadly the
underlying is broadly similar to what it was this time last year.

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

And then, Alan, I think Mark addressed some of the questions on economic capital. We
have been increasing our hedging activity over the course of the year to protect
ourselves. Some of the benefits that we've realized in the first quarter have been more
related to foreign exchange hedging than other kinds of hedging. And again in terms of
the capital synergies, we'll continue to update you on those as we realize those over
time, but we're not proving a lot of information on them in advance.

Q - Alan G. Devlin

{BIO 5936254 <GO>}

Cool. Thanks. And just a follow-up on the general insurance question. So ex weather and
ex the reserve releases, the underlying combined ratio was relatively flat, is that what
you're saying?

Q - Fahad U. Changazi

{BIO 15216120 <GO>}

Good morning guys. Just two questions. First, on the FL integration, it's good that you're
out of the blocks very quickly. You did have a 90-day detailed program. Are we at some
point going to get an update where you say, this was our detailed plan, this is what we
achieved, tick, tick, tick? Or do we have to wait till the H1 results for that?
And secondly, just trying to get head around the strong VNB performance. UK VNB's up
14%. And Q1 is supposed to be the worst quarter, given all that's happening with annuities.
So it should only get better from here. Is that right? Or is there something I'm missing?
And in France again very strong growth. It looks like it's primarily driven by the changes in
product mix. But could you perhaps split out the benefit of product mix versus what's
Page 21 of 29



Company N ame: Aviva PL C

happening elsewhere in terms of underlying growth? Thanks.

FINAL

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Hi, Fahad. The detailed plans, what we should do I think is we'll give you guys a detailed
look at that at the half-year, because we'll have a bit more time and then we're face-toface. So we can take you through that. Perhaps we can get Nick Amin up there as well, and
we can go through that.
I mean there's no particular sensitivity to it, except the big sense – no external sensitivity.
The big internal sensitivity is obviously people, and we got to go through consultations,
phases with the unions and that sort of stuff.
And so far I've got to say all the consultation bodies including the unions have been
unbelievably pragmatic and supportive, because they think it's the right thing to do. And
yeah. And we'll do the right thing by the people as well. So we'll aim to do that at half-year
if we can.
On the VNB will it only get better from here? Well I guess us all (50:49) would rather do,
rather than say. And so let's see in the next quarter and the third quarter how we do.

Bloomberg Transcript

But it's fair to say you've heard some of the boys so far today say that there has been
some good pipelines and things. We need to deliver those pipelines to reality, don't we?
So we'll see. On France, David, can you just add a bit of color on why it has improved so
much?

A - David McMillan

{BIO 17298829 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean I think I've said it before, our French business has really excellent distribution,
and we've been on the path for the last couple years of really trying to harness that
distribution to deliver a strong product mix. So if you look at the numbers, PVNBP in France
in local currency in euro is up 1%, but the VNB is up 15%. And that speaks to the fact that
we've actually been shifting product mix.
So if you look at underlying products, our protection business quarter-on-quarter – or
year-on-year rather is up 50%. Unit-linked continues to follow a strong trend. And our WIP
profits business is down, as we shift the focus of the business from lower margin WIP
profits to higher margin unit-linked. So largely this is a question of harnessing distribution
to improve product mix.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Just something if I can also just direct everyone on the call's minds a little bit. Under
Solvency II it changes the competitive dynamics of the market in Europe a lot. So the sort
of products – we've been operating under an economic capital basis for years. And there
has only been even a couple of people in the UK who've even been doing that. And so
what's going to happen under Solvency II is it does change the product mix. And all of a

Page 22 of 29



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2015-05-07

sudden in a lot of these markets we become more competitive, because everyone else
has to work under the same constraints that we have been working under.

FINAL

And that fundamentally changes our competitive position. It also changes it for things like
general insurance. We haven't been pass-porting out on general insurance to Gibraltar for
example. And so our competitive position improves there.
So that's why you're starting to see a bit of growth, because everyone else is coming into
line with what we've been doing. Then our brand works. I think that sort of makes sense.
So that's more the competition has come to us because of Solvency II rather than the
other way around.

And we will now take our next question from Blair Stewart from Bank of America. Please
go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thanks very much and good morning. It's still morning. Just three quick ones actually. On
Crédit du Nord SocGen buy in, could you just comment a little bit on that in terms of what
you expect to happen over the timeline?
Secondly on DBS, you talked earlier about your ability to continue to harvest the customer
base. So I just wonder pragmatically how you can do that? And is there a risk that DBS has
– or the new distribution partner has access to the customer base in some way? How do
you protect yourselves?
And then thirdly, just a clarification on your internal model with transitionals. Did you say
that you already assumed the transitionals in your internal model? Or do you get an uplift
if you get approval for those transitionals? Thank you.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Okay. Morning, Blair. So three questions. I'll take the first two. Tom will take the
transitionals. On the Crédit du Nord, so I've said now for, I don't know, I think 12 months
that we didn't know whether they would use their option or not. And it's about 7% of the
cash remittance. So it's – I mean it's I guess 7% is material, but not huge.

And I said I didn't really mind which way that went, either we kept it – and that being a
good partner, make no mistake, they've been a good partner, or we get paid a large sum
of money for it. Now they chose the second option, and that's okay. Now the process
from here is we have to go through and agree the price, but a lot of that's set down
contractually. There are still some things we need to agree around the edges. And then
it'll be paid, I think next year, is that right?

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

Yeah. It's a 24-month process. So it may play out till early 2017 and unless we end up
doing something sooner than that.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

And that's really up to them. And so, we're in discussions with them now, and that will be
what it will be. And so that one we're pretty relaxed about.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the DBS and the customers, yeah, there'll always be a bit of uncertainty. I have had
discussions with DBS since at the highest level, and they have absolutely committed to
honoring the agreement, and I think the agreements are pretty clear. I'm sure there'll be a
bit of stuff around the edges that we'll have to push on and agree and negotiate. And,
frankly, we own what we've got, and we can market it to parts of that base too. But to be
clear, you've got a partner, and other partners paid an enormous amount of money; and
I'm sure they will expect to get a lot of business out of their client base. And that's fine. As
long people live by terms of the agreements then that's fine.
Yeah. They obviously don't cover a couple of countries as well. So, for example, in India. In
India, these under the new regulation that you'll all be aware about – in India, you can't
have exclusive bank agreements; and this a trend that is going around Asia a bit at the
moment. And so, India, it's no longer an exclusive agreement with DBS because you can't
have exclusives agreements anymore. So I guess we will be in discussions with them
about which part of that business we'll get business out of as well. And the third one, the
transitionals comp.

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

In terms of the transitionals, the transitionals will make up part of our capital and part of
our internal model of approval process. So they will be a fraction of our capital, and
they're not sort of a separate add-on.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Sorry, I was just meaning, are they included within your economic capital numbers that you
published today, or does the approval of transitionals represent upside, or is it already in
there?

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

What I'd say is it's not apples-and-apples, so it's a different measure of comparison, and
we are transitioning from our economic capital to the Solvency II model. And so you'll see
Page 24 of 29

FINAL

as we say in our disclosure this year a different cover ratio, a different amount of capital,
and a different composition of capital. So I can't give you a direct translation. But
essentially what we are saying is that we're confident in our economic capital now and the
way we've been managing the company. We're going to have to describe you a different
geography when we get to Solvency II, but the basic message is that we're comfortable
with our capital position now.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Transitionals really take it out from one bucket of capital and put it into another. That's
probably the way of thinking about it, I think Blair. But different companies with different
product mixes will have different levels of transitionals. The regulator sees it as good
capital, and it is good capital, it's just capital on part of your back book really, but different
companies will have different amounts; and we're comfortable with where it's at.

And we will now take our next question from Ashik Musaddi from JPMorgan. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Good morning, Mark and Tom. Thanks for this. Just a couple of questions. Can you give us
some color about what proportion of the bulk annuity stock is deferred annuities? And
does the matching adjustment applies on that book or not?
And secondly is, any thoughts on bulk annuities? I mean it clearly looks like it is still one of
the very attractive business as per what other peers are saying. It still remains very
attractive business in terms of margins, in terms of outlook. So where are you where you
guys placed into that at the moment? Because clearly it looks like in first quarter you
haven't done a lot of bulk annuities, so any thought on that would be great. Thank you.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Hi, Ashik. The bulks – I'm going to pass most of that to Andy, but the bulks as I've said I
think I was probably the only one in the market 12 months ago who said that the bulks
were going to reduce the margin. That proved to be the case. We will plan that market
selectively and, I'll say, opportunistically only when the margin is right. And so you've seen
that come down a bit, but that's just fine. Andy, do you want to give some color?

A - Andy D. Briggs

{BIO 4311809 <GO>}

Yes. So in terms of bulks generally, exactly as Mark says, we'll play when we can do so
profitably. And as I said earlier on, that means in the first quarter modest volumes, but
actually feel reasonably positive about the pipeline from here. In terms of the capabilities
around that, we continue to do some good work on the Aviva Investors side and hence
Page 25 of 29



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2015-05-07

looking at different liquid asset classes and so on. I think we're well-placed and obviously
equity release plays well into this where we've got a very strong first quarter. Very small
proportion of our bulks is in deferred annuities. So it's a very small proportion, but we
would expect matching adjustment to apply on that not that it's relevant given its scale.

FINAL

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

We assess more, how big or small.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Thanks a lot.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Okay. So, listen, just to put some number on it, so it's less than 10% in deferred.

A - Andy D. Briggs

{BIO 4311809 <GO>}

Of the bulk annuities...

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

On the bulks, yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Andy D. Briggs

{BIO 4311809 <GO>}

...which is obviously only a proportion of the total annuities.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Yeah. So it's small, very small.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay.

And we will now take our last question from James Shuck from UBS. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Thank you for taking my question. I just squeezed in at the end. I have two questions,
please. One was just on the corporate benefit side that Friends Life give disclosure
around, in terms of net flows. Could you just give us the numbers for Aviva standalone
and comment on the net flows in the period? And then kind of more broadly, just give an
update on what your strategy is around corporate pensions in terms of which platforms
you're going to be using and what you're anticipating in terms of any business loss as you
combine the two businesses. That's my first question.
Page 26 of 29

Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity

And my second question, which I hope won't drag on for too long, but I just wanted to
understand a bit more about why you see operating cash generation as being completely
meaningless, because a lot of the kind of logic behind the acquisition and the outlook for
improving the dividend outlook has been on growing operating cash generation. I
appreciate that we're moving into a Solvency II world, but when we think about the life
operating cash generation, I mean I don't really see why that isn't a useful indication when,
really, what's driving cash emergence should be the free surplus emergence into cash
over time; and then you can take a different view on the level of capital that is released
and the level of capital that is required. But I don't see why the free surplus emergence
per se should change that much.
So when we think about as you move from OCG towards whatever metric it is, is there a
big divergence between where you think you're going to end up on any new metric? And
what are the implications for the over £800 million that you were targeting by 2016 for
standalone Aviva? Thank you.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi, James. That's a very long question for what's going to be a relatively short
answer. The OCG – just to be clear, OCG is a Pillar 1 metric. So the actual calculation of
that metric isn't relevant under Solvency II. That's really my key point. But cash generation
up to global cash payment of the group is directly relevant. Tom, do you want to?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

Yeah. I'll just comment on the OCG. And again, we've given you rounded figures here. But
if you dig into it, the OCG is actually up about 50% on the quarter-to-quarter comparison.
But while directionally OCG is helpful, it actually doesn't really get you directly to the cash
number that you're trying to get to which is why we're trying to get people to get off this.
So that final 10%, 20%, 30% difference between what OCG or the other metric maybe
actually is quite important terms of really analyzing our performance. So, again, it's helpful
to some extent, but really doesn't get you where you want to go. And so, we can followup with you on the OCG and sort of differences with Solvency II afterwards sort of offline.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. Just on corporate pensions when we actually announced
the deal, we were very clear because we had the employee benefit consultants all over
Friends to start with because they obviously like the Friends system. And you'll recall
we've looked at the same systems by FNZ which we believe is the best system in the
market. We've looked to that two years ago, but we couldn't justify it because we didn't
have the scale at the large-end of the market. The Friends platform is an outstanding
platform. And so that's our core platform that we've already confirmed to the market. And
so far, so good. Andy?

A - Andy D. Briggs

{BIO 4311809 <GO>}

So in terms of the corporate pension strategy, basically this is a market where we expect
assets to triple over the next decade. Scale is critical in this market. We're the number one
player. At year-end, we had £47 billion of combined assets. That's clearly grown with the
Page 27 of 29



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2015-05-07

FINAL

decent net fund flows on both sides of the house in the first quarter. The Friend assets we
specifically quoted 7% up. I think the number two player has got around £30 billion and
then the number three player is around the low to mid-teens the last time I looked, so a
huge scale advantage.
We're obviously playing in the mid to large end of the market with the heritage Friends
business and then the SME market through the heritage Aviva business. So we're covering
across both of those, but we'll move to a single platform infrastructure. And obviously we
see much of the benefit of auto enrolment on the larger end of the market, so still have
that to come over the next couple of years on the SME part of the market through the
sort of heritage Aviva business. So, all in all, I feel pretty positive in terms of the market
growth there. The scale and opportunity we have to compete and win and hence the
great prospect in that market for us.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

And, James, just maybe a follow-up as well just on the OCG point. Just to be clear,
investment thesis of cash flow plus growth does not change in that order. We're
committed to it. The Friends transaction certainly helps us in that. The key point, of course,
is getting the cash up to the group so that we can increase dividend. I mean that's part of
the key investment thesis; and that remains entirely consistent if that helps you. But we'll
follow-up on that outside and just give you – we can talk you through some of the
differences between OCG and Solvency II.
