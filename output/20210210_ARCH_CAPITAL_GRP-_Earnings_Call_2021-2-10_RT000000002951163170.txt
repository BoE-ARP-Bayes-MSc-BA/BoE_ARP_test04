Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Thank you, Liz. Good morning and welcome to our fourth-quarter earnings call. Overall,
we are pleased with the current market conditions and the opportunities available to Arch
as we close out 2020 and spring into 2021. One of our fundamental principles is that
achieving growth and book value per share above the cost of capital over the long run is
the best way to create and sustain shareholder value. We believe we delivered on that
front in 2020.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our discipline underwriting and diversified business model enabled Arch to grow its yearend book value per share by 5.4% over the third quarter and by 14.7% for the last 12
months. We responded to broadly hardening market conditions and as a result, all three
of our segments grew their premium writings in the quarter.
In particular, the hardening markets allowed for significant growth within our P&C units.
Increasing our net premium written for the P&C by 32% for the full-year. On the whole, for
2020, we achieved an operating profit of $557 million and grew book value to $30.31 per
share.
Now, as most of you know, cycle management is core to who we are. Arch leans strongly
into improving markets because history has shown that times like these are when superior
risk-adjusted returns gradually compound and accelerate book value growth. And Arch is
position to significantly expand as others de-risk, rethink their underwriting strategies or
even retrench.
As we look at the opportunities ahead for Arch, I'm reminded of a situation in hockey that
is exciting for any fan. In hockey, you get a one player advantage if the other team takes a
penalty, it's called a power play. When that happens, a few things need to be kept in mind
as you deploy your specialty power play unit to try and improve the odds of scoring. You
need to have a clear five-on-four strategy, you need to be defensively savvy enough to
not forget to protect your own zone and you need to have a sense of urgency because
the clock will tick down and you will soon be back to even strength. These are the few
moments that make a difference in a hockey game.
The advantageous position we find ourselves in is similar to that hockey power play where
the odds are in our favor. I'm proud of how our team performed last year during the
challenges of 2020. Now after spending a good portion of the last several years in a
defensive position, we're embracing a more offensive mindset.

FINAL

Here's what that looked like in the fourth quarter. Let's begin with our insurance
segments. Across our worldwide insurance group, renewal rate change has increased
approximately 12%, up 200 bps from the prior quarter's rate changes.
Our fourth-quarter growth occurred in many lines with D&O, property, energy and marine
all exhibiting strong advances. E&S casualty and our alternative markets business also
grew this quarter. We believe that rate momentum in these lines is healthy, and we also
see it building in other lines, albeit at a slower pace.
Increasing margins helped improve our insurance accident year ex-cat loss ratio which
decreased by 4.6 percentage points in the fourth quarter. As you may know, the full
effects of increased rate levels can take approximately five quarters to become fully
reflected in underwriting margins, so today, we are earning the higher rates from the past
year. In addition, our operating expense ratio has benefited from rising production this
past year.
We are pleased with the continuing progress achieved by our insurance group in the last
two years.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning next to our reinsurance segment. Underwriting results were significantly better
than the fourth quarter of 2019 despite the impact of $94 million worth of cat losses.
While market conditions are not uniformly strong in the reinsurance sector, this occasion
from other carriers that are reducing their positions is creating pockets with hardening
rates that Arch is well-positioned to capitalize on.
Reinsurance also benefits from the underlying insurance market rate increases through its
clients.
For 2020, we grew reinsurance net written premium by 53% with the two main areas of
growth being non-cat property and specialty.
At the January 2021 renewals, we saw continued rate increases in most areas, however,
we agree with the market consensus that property cat pricing moves were more subdued
than expected or hoped as capacity for that risk still remains strong.
Accordingly, we maintain a cautious approach to this business. Our mortgage segment
delivered good returns in both the fourth quarter and for the entire year despite the
economic headwinds. We are confident in the continued earnings strength of this
segment and frankly, the uncertainty we were facing during the early stages of COVID has
been largely mitigated. Both premium rates and the credit quality of the new insurance
written improved in 2020. And accordingly, the return on capital for our new U.S. MI
business is essentially back to 2018 level, which was a strong year.
Here's why MI has done this past year. First, housing markets have remained strong
despite the difficult economic conditions. Second, the government forbearance program
achieved largely what it was intended to do, which was to provide financial respite to
Page 3 of 22



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2021-02-10

many homeowners. And third, credit criteria in the mortgage sector tightened in 2020.
And as you know, credit quality is a critical factor in determining underwriting profitability.

FINAL

On a side note, just yesterday, the FHFA announced that the forbearance program has
been extended an additional three months which should help further mitigate the risk in
our delinquency inventory.
The delinquency rate of our portfolio decreased by 50 bps sequentially in the fourth
quarter. At year-end, roughly two-thirds of our delinquent loans were in the governmentsponsored forbearance program. We currently estimate that 89% of delinquent
borrowers in our portfolio at year-end have at least 10% equity in their homes. And as we
have discussed on prior calls, the amount of equity in a home is a single most important
factor in determining MI losses as it plays a significant role in mitigating claim activity.
We are cautiously optimistic that delinquencies will continue to cure as vaccines enable
the economies to reopen. Importantly, record home purchases in the U.S. in 2020
supported a 5% price appreciation nationwide, while historically low interest rates,
accelerated housing and refinance demand. This enabled Arch U.S. to report record NIW
of $30 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, up nearly 60% from the same period in 2019.
Our outlook for continued growth in 2021 remains positive.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning back to the current phase of the P&C cycle. There are three conditions that we
believe will persist and help sustain the improved underwriting environment. One, social
inflation and reserving problems are now starting to apply pressure for companies that
haven't been prudent enough.
Two, anemic investment yields require a sharper focus on underwriting profit. And three, a
return to the post-COVID world should accelerate economic activity and increase the
demand for insurance.
Each of these conditions would put pressure on results for the industry. Our conservative
approach to reserving over the past several years means that we are well-positioned to
drive results in P&C going forward since we expect our future returns to better reflect
current and forward pricing.
Finally, with better visibility into the overall economic conditions and with more clarity on
the mortgage and P&C prospects, along with our strong capital generation, we see a
compelling opportunity to invest in our shares at very attractive returns. Francois will talk to
it in a moment.
This recent share repurchase is a testament to our capital strategy and designed to
enhance shareholder value over the long term. We still have ample resources to deploy
towards new growth and feel confident in our team's ability to be creative in order to
capitalize on the opportunities before us.

This is a time in a game where our cycle management strategy allows us to play offense
and deploy capital dynamically to generate above average returns.
And now, I'll turn the game commentary over to Francois.

Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Thank you, Marc, and good morning to all. We at Arch hope that you are in good health
and the 2021 is off to a good start.
On to the fourth-quarter results. As a reminder, and consistent with prior practice, the
following comments are on a core basis, which corresponds to Arch's financial results,
excluding the other segments, i.e. the operations of Watford Holdings Limited. In our
filings, the term consolidated includes Watford.
After-tax operating income for the quarter was $230.4 million, which translates to an
annualized 7.7% operating return on average common equity and $0.56 per share. For the
year, our operating return on average common equity stood at 4.8%, while a return on
average common equity stood at 11.8%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Book value per share increased to $31 -- to $30.31 at December 31, up 5.4% from last
quarter and 14.7% from one year ago. Again, an excellent result despite the strong
headwinds from catastrophe losses this year, which is a testament to the resilience of our
operations and our superior diversification strategy.
Losses from 2020 catastrophic events in the quarter include -- including COVID-19, net of
reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement premiums stood at $156.4 million or 9.4
combined ratio points compared to 2.2 combined ratio points in the fourth quarter of
2019.
The losses impacted both our insurance and reinsurance segments, primarily as a result
of a series of natural catastrophes in the quarter, including Hurricanes Delta and Zeta and,
and other smaller events, as well as adjustments to our estimates for events that
occurred earlier in 2020.
Our best estimate of ultimate losses for COVID-19 for occurrences through December 31
remained essentially unchanged from prior estimates. As of December 31, the vast
majority of our COVID-19 claims are yet to be settled or paid with approximately twothirds of the inception to date incur loss amount recorded as incurred but not reported
IBNR reserves or as additional case reserves within our insurance and reinsurance
segments.
As regards the potential impact of COVID-19 on our mortgage segment, as Marc alluded
to, the delinquency rate at the end of the quarter was 4.19% down from 4.69% at
September 30. We are encouraged with a downward trend in delinquency rates over the
last few quarters, which continue to come and significantly better than our earlier forecast.

Our latest assessment of the situation assumes they progressively improving economy in
2021, which should bode well for the housing sector and the performance of our book as
we move forward.

FINAL

In the insurance segment, net written premium grew 21.6% over the same quarter one
year ago, 29.6% if we exclude the impact of the pandemic on our travel, accident and
health unit.
The insurance segment's accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats, was 93.6%,
lower by 800 basis points over the same period one year ago. Approximately 360 basis
points of the difference is due to our lower expense ratio, primarily from the growth in the
premium base from one year ago and continued lower levels of travel and entertainment
expenses.
The lower ex-cat accident quarter loss ratio reflects the benefits of rate increases
achieved over the last 12 months and changes in our mix of business. Prior period net loss
reserve development net of related adjustments was favorable at $1.2 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

As for our reinsurance operations, we had strong growth of 44.9% in net written
premiums on a year-over-year basis, which was observed across most of our lines and
includes a combination of new business opportunities, rate increases and the integration
of the Barbican reinsurance business.
The segment's accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats, stood at 82.1% compared
to 92.3% on the same basis one year ago. The year-over-year movement is primarily
driven by rate change activity over the last 12 months and a more normal level of large
attritional losses compared to a year ago.
Most of the remaining difference is explained by operating expense ratio improvements,
primarily resulting from the growth in earned premium. Favorable prior period net loss
reserve development, net of related adjustments was $40.5 million or 6.9 combined ratio
points compared to 4.9 combined ratio points in the fourth quarter of 2019. The
development was mostly in short-tail lines.
The mortgage industry had a second consecutive record-breaking quarter in terms of
mortgage originations, which allowed Arch MI to produce $38 billion of NIW in the fourth
quarter, a full 15.9% higher than our prior high watermark.
With refinance activity leveling off from prior peaks, we saw our insurance in force
increased by 2.5% across the mortgage segment. The combined ratio was 45.1%,
reflecting the lower level of new delinquencies reporting during the quarter. The expense
ratio was slightly lower over the same quarter over one year ago and prior period net loss
reserve development was favorable at $8.2 million this quarter, mostly from our second
lien run-off portfolios.

FINAL

Improving investor sentiment enabled Arch to issue two Bellemeade transactions during
the fourth quarter at terms that are getting closer to pre-pandemic levels. You will recall
that we discussed our 2020-3 transaction on the last call, an on-the-run deal covering our
production from June through August of 2020.
Our latest transaction, Bellemeade 2020-4 provides additional protection on mortgages
we insured in the second half of 2019 and already covered by our 2020-1 Bellemeade
transaction by effectively reducing the original retention from 7.5% to 1.85% of the risk in
force. At year-end, the Bellemeade structure has provided approximately $4 billion of
aggregate reinsurance coverage.
Total investment return for the quarter was positive 246 basis points on a U.S. dollar basis.
And we ended the year with our investment portfolio producing a 7.77% total return. While
our fixed income portfolio generated an excellent return of 188 bps in the quarter,
contributions from our equity and alternative investments were also significant and
represented approximately 40% of the total return for the quarter. The duration of our
investment portfolio decreased modestly to 3.01 years at year end, reflecting our
ongoing positioning of the portfolio towards shorter-term maturities.

Bloomberg Transcript

The effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 6.8% in the quarter, reflecting
changes in the full year estimated tax rate, the geographic mix of our pre-tax income and
a benefit from discrete tax items in the quarter. We currently estimate the full year tax
rate to be in the 10% to 12% range for 2021.
Turning briefly to risk management. Our natural cat PML on a net basis decreased slightly
to $860 million as of January 1, which at approximately 7.4% of tangible common equity
remains well below our internal limits at the single event one in-250 year return level.
The decrease in our peak zone PML this quarter is mostly attributable to our E&S property
unit within the insurance segment, where we reduced property aggregate in the Florida
Tri-County Peak zone and made selective additions to our reinsurance purchases.
Our balance sheet remains strong and our debt to plus preferred leverage ratio stood at
22.1% at year end, well within a reasonable range.
Finally, on the capital front. We repurchased approximately 251,000 shares at an
aggregate cost of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. It is worth noting that we have
since repurchased an additional 2.6 million shares at an aggregate cost of $83.6 million in
the first quarter of 2021 under a Rule 10b5 plan that we implemented during this quarter's
closed window period. Our remaining share purchase authorization currently stands at
$833 million.
With these introductory comments, we are now prepared to take your questions.

-- is on related to your returns. Marc, I think in the prepared remarks, you associated with
mortgage business going back to return on capital levels from 2018. And I'm hoping just
for all three businesses, insurance, reinsurance and mortgage, can you give us a sense of
the return profile of the business you're writing today versus what you would have said, if
I'd asked the same question 12 months ago?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yes. I think the -- well, nice to talking to you, Elyse. I think the high level 2018 sort of longterm expected return on the MI was roughly in the mid-teens. So we're going back to that
level, which is really good place for us to be.
On the insurance, I think that we had a bit of a decrease in expected returns, even
though. the combined ratio did not get that much better for the industry. But right now, if
you factor in all the rate changes and everything, we think we're in the double-digit in
insurance return. And we think that the reinsurance is a little bit in between those two. So
we have a really, really different risk, risk return -- risk-adjusted return profile in our
portfolio, it has improved and larger, as a result of the price increase, not certainly as a
result of the investment return as you know, Elyse.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Yes. And then my second question on, I think you alluded to this a little bit in your
prepared remarks, Marc, when you were mentioning on a few issues that would help from
the pricing momentum side, like persisting from here. A big question that I get is, does
this momentum persist through 2021 and perhaps beyond? And can you -- obviously,
different dynamics in the insurance and reinsurance P&C markets. But can you just give us
a sense based off of what you know today, do you think that the pricing momentum can
persist through 2021 in insurance and also reinsurance?

FINAL

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

We expect it to be the case, Elyse, because, of all the factors I've mentioned, the social
inflation, there's a lot of uncertainty in terms of loss ratio picks for years, specifically, 2015
through '19 as we all know. A sort of mix for correcting some of the ongoing pricing. So
that's definitely sustainable. We do not have as much protection from the investment
returns, so that really puts a lot of pressure on the returns for the industry. And
uncertainty, and lack of people covered and we also have fair amount of cat losses in the
last three or four years. So there's a lot going on, a lot more risk out there.
So I think overall, collectively, as an industry, we all collectively think and know and believe
that we need to get better rate and better pricing because, the risk is not being
rewarded accordingly. As in every hardening market, the lengths like how long is the piece
of string, but I think that our hardening market does not only last four or five quarters. I
think if you have this initial stages of the initial reaction of rate increases, then you get
momentum building in the underwriters mentality, the brokers are sort of accepting as
being sort of a new way to deal and do the business. And eventually that builds upon
itself. I would fully expect to be lasting to 2021 and into 2022, this is what we believe at
this point in time.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. And one last numbers question. You guys mentioned the PML going up a little bit,
but in terms of your cat load, I thing in the past, aren't used to talk to like a $40 million of
quarterly cat. Obviously, we've seen growth in cat reinsurance and in other property
related lines like you mentioned, how should we think about the cat load from here?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yes. I mean no question that we've written a lot more property premium in the last -- I
want to say four to six quarters, we really ramped up our property exposures, I mean,
there's a lot of -- in different areas, as you know, a different lines of business, U.S.,
international et cetera. Yes, so the can't load I think on a quarterly basis has definitely
gone up from what we were in the old days thinking about like $40 million a quarter. It's
still evolving but I'd say it's probably more in the $60 million to $70 million range right now.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.

FINAL

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Hey, good morning. Follow-up on mortgage insurance and Elyse's question, if you're
talking about kind of encouraged about the downward delinquency rates and assuming
the economy progressively improves, and you -- I think you mentioned mortgage biz can
draw up return similar to 2018 levels. Are you saying kind of directionally we should be
thinking about a combined ratio that continues to move south at kind of towards 2018
levels? Or have the capital assumptions changed since then?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Mike, in terms of combined ratio, the capital is a different story, because it's a bit of a
lagging indicator based on the delinquencies we have, but if you look at the combined
ratio, yes, we think that we're turning to go towards more, so the run rate that we had in
2018, I would just caveat that there was some prior development, favorable development
in 2018, so I would probably adjust for that. But certainly, the long-term range of 35% to
45% is not something that is out of the realm of -- no, real possibility if you look at 2018.
And I think depending on what, how the economy recovers, that could be in the lower end
of that, and it's a couple things still develop, in a different direction. It might be a bit on
the higher side, but you're right, it should be getting closer to where we were in 2018 in
terms of combined ratio.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. Switching gears to the non-MI insurance segments. You've been -the expense ratio has been better than expected for a number of quarters and you guys
have called out some items. Maybe you can kind of remind us and talk to kind of what's -what you think is kind of cyclical? And what's kind of structural in terms of the expense
ratio improvements?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Yes. I think this is more structural, I would say, Mike, because right now you have to factor
in the fact that our platform grew both sides, both in the sense of growing the top line for
in our organic lines of business and we will have the acquisition in London and really push
to be much more relevant and much more bigger in London. So our international
operations also gained scale.
So, if you now look at the overall structure, or the way that the company is laid out, in
terms of top line and the way the expenses is constructed between the unit. I think it's
much more of a structural change. I would say that it's probably 50-50, but the growth is
certainly something that's really important, in terms of helping that growth. So that could
also get presumably a bit better over time, but I would also tell you that the growth in our
operating expense on the insurance side has lagged the growth in our top line, which is
what we should expect right, because a lot of the increase is not more work, even
though, we are writing more business. A lot of the increase in premium is just rate in and
of itself. So I think that the company is flexing itself in terms of top line growth and

Page 10 of 22



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2021-02-10

expense deployment very, very nicely. So a bit more structural than I would have told you
probably two years ago.

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Good morning.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

I guess my first question revolves around MI. Do you have any comments or thoughts
around the potential changes, the FHA fees and its potential and would their potential
impact on the MI business?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yes. I can -- listen, it's still early on MI, and it's a new administration change as a couple of
things going on all over the place. Washington, I'm sure they're very busy right now trying
to changing things. What we -- we hear the same things that you guys hear about the 25
bps, potential price cut that the FHA could put in there. And as a reminder for everyone, if
you take a step back, that the FHA was a large market share provider of MI insurance and
in the years where the PMI, the product -- private mortgage insurers were not in that
great of a shape and frankly that was needed to fill the gap or fill the void if you will of the
need for the homeowners and the mortgage providers.
So this is changed, I think that the FHA also ultimate role and core role is to provide,
mortgage insurance for the one, those that are probably could be perceived a bit more
risky for the private sector. And so we've done the analysis of -- which means that if you
look at our portfolio, Yaron, and we're high FICO, very high quality, most of our -- the
borrowers that we have on our portfolio do not really need to consider FHA. So from our
perspective, we will react obviously to whatever is out there, but we believe that this, if it
comes to fruition at 25 bps rate cut in FHA won't help in the lower FICO and higher LTV
borrower which is really not the ones affecting and the ones that we are currently having
success with, because our pricing is actually better if you compare our pricing versus the

Page 11 of 22



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2021-02-10

FHA in that sector, our pricing is better or not, the execution is cheaper for the borrower,
so we're not losing sleep over that.

FINAL

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Got it. That's helpful. And then my second question, you previously talked I think about
shifting capital deployment from MI more into P&C. I think last call, you used more of a
basketball analogy that was easier for me to follow than hockey but thank you for
explaining. But I guess as market conditions kind of -- your views on market conditions
change a bit, it seems like reinsurance maybe a little less exciting than maybe a quarter or
two, the outlook was a quarter or two ago, and MI may be a little better than the outlook
was the quarter or two ago. Does your appetite for capital deployment between the
three segments, has that shifted or will it shift into 2021?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I wouldn't say it shifts in any major way. I think we see all three segments with very good
opportunities in front of them, and maybe we'd argue, some are overdo especially on the
P&C side. So we're bullish there. Mortgage has always been in basketball, our 6 or 7 foot
6 guy down low and -- and ready for dunks and that hasn't really changed in our view. So
yes, I mean we got, certainly, have more visibility into what the ultimate or what the
current market conditions are in -- especially in mortgage given what we owned -- the
second half of the year, how things progressed and that's good. I mean, that's something
that we take -- I think it works in our favor. So -- but in a big picture, we don't see major
changes and how we deploy capital.

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

And Yaron, one thing I would mention to you that -- it's always -- it's hard for people not to
see us being in Bermuda as being a property cat writer on the reinsurance side, but I
would argue that, yes, in the property cat side is not as good, and you heard it from other
people, and we certainly agree with that. But we're still growing in areas that are nonproperty cat, right, exposed. So we're seeing a lot of other lines to be honest between
United are actually better now or the prospects what we want better than they were in
2020. It's just that we're not growing necessarily in the one that get the better headline if
you will from your perspective, but by and large, I think there are prospectus that is very,
very good on our reinsurance side, very much so.

Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.

FINAL

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. I had a couple of questions. First, if you could just talk about your sort of
comfort level with your BI reserves given the developments in the U.S., seem to be
favoring the industry for the most part. So do you feel like you're overly conservative on
your reserves? And obviously internationally things haven't gone as well? And then I had a
-- another one as well.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. I think we're -- we never would say that we're overly conservative. We want to be
prudent and conservative for sure in how we set reserves. I'd say starting again with the
international, which maybe has gotten a bit more a headlight, made the headlines a bit
more, our position hasn't changed in the U.K., again, the book we have is a small regional
book, well protected by reinsurance protection. So we feel that the reserves we have
there, even after the call it slightly adverse rulings from the courts and in the U.K. were -aren't going to affect our bottom line. So we're -- no changes from our point of view
there.
And in the U.S. for the most part, as you said, all the rulings have kind of been in favor of in
the -- of the industry. A couple of places where there's maybe some that didn't go as
expected. But on those I think -- our view is that the policies that were being challenged
were manuscript policy. So not the standard ISO form that we typically use without
necessarily the strong wording around virus exclusions and property damage to trigger
coverage. So on both of those fronts we get, as we said before vast majority of our
policies well north of 90% across the book that has these both of these call it protections.
So we're very confident that our results are reserves at this point won't develop
adversely, and we're -- we will keep looking at it, but it's -- we're in a good spot.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

And I think you said about two-thirds or three-fourths were IBNR as of last quarter, what it
looks that number now?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Two-thirds. We're going down a little bit. So we fixed roughly from 75 to 67 roughly, I
mean it hasn't changed much and it's --. So -- and some of that is around, as you can
expect mostly on the reinsurance side right, where we do -- a lot of our reserves are still
in the reinsurance side with significant IBNR and ACRs on that book.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

And then on buyback, you did a decent amount in -- you've done a lot of this year. So
what's driving your sort of action there, is it the stock price, is it -- I'm assuming there's

Page 13 of 22



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2021-02-10

decent opportunity to deploy capital in your businesses given pricing, but what's -- what
drove the big uptick in buybacks versus what you've done in the last few quarters?

FINAL

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yes. Certainly, more visibility, right? I think that, we said that from the start, we -- at the
end of the first quarter last year, we said listen, we're going to take a little bit of a pause,
because we need to know where things are going to -- how things are play out and
mortgage being a major driver in that performance. You've seen the results, so we were
a lot more confident, where the economy is going, vaccines are rolling out. So there's a
lot of things that, yes, will take some time. But as we look forward, I think that gives us a
lot more comfort that. The worst is behind us, and that gives us a more clarity on how do
we deploy capital? We're still in -- and normally, we're fully capable of doing both. We
want to grow the book and also buy back shares. There's no reason why they have to be
exclusive. We think our growth is still very strong. We expect to keep growing in '21 and
across the book. But we also see a good opportunity at the current level, pricing levels for
the stock to buyback at this point.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

You're welcome. So before we go to the next one, I think I have to stop the broadcast. I
think I believe we have a breaking news, this is just hit the wire. So I think we have to go to
Francois for some commentary that you want to share with us. Francois?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Yes, that's long overdue Marc, but just wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to fill
everybody on the call on the latest developments with our proposed acquisition of a
29.5% ownership stake in Coface, the global trade credit insurer. To confirm what some of
you may have seen across the Business Wire over the last few minutes, if they weren't
paying attention to what we were saying, but we closed on this transaction with Natixis
earlier today. And the reason for the timing is that we have to wait for their markets to
close which they have, so the consideration paid by Arch was EUR9.95 per share for an
aggregate EUR453 million in aggregate including related fees.
In connection with our minority stake in the company, Arch, now has four representatives
on the Coface Board of Directors. As we stated before, we continue to view this
transaction as an investment, and we currently do not intend to increase our ownership
position in Coface. From a financial reporting perspective reporting perspective, you
should all expect us to include our proportionate share of Coface's results in our financials
starting next quarter. We intend to report the contribution in a new separate line titled,
Equity Method Earnings from Operating Affiliates, which will be included in our definition
of operating earnings. This line will also include the contributions from other nonconsolidated affiliates such as Premia Holdings. So that's the breaking news, Marc.

Geoff Dunn with Dowling & Partners. Your line is now open.

Q - Geoffrey Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning.

Q - Geoffrey Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

A couple questions on MI. First of all, what was the incidence assumption for the current
period provision as well as the average severity factor this quarter?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yes. So 9.4% for the new annuities in the quarter and the average reserve for DQ was a
little bit over 5,000, pretty much in line with the third quarter, Geoff, because the risk that
came in were little bit less coverage in this quarter. So that would explain the average
being a bit lower or a bit more in line.

Q - Geoffrey Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

Okay. And so as you think about '20 or the first part of '21, there -- to my knowledge, they
extended the forbearance period up to 15 months, but you can't enter new forbearance
activity. So what did your provision for non-forbearance loans? Or are your incidence
assumption for non-forbearance loans look like in the fourth quarter?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yes. I don't think we did not -- the way we reserve that we sort of trying to make an
overall all-encompassing assessment and put that in that numbers. So I think that -- that's
what you might have said, might have thought in the past that our number could have
been a bit higher. So we think that we have enough in the reserving in totality based on
the number of factors we've used.

Q - Geoffrey Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

Okay. But with forbearance options going away, fair to assume that, that incidence
assumption will probably climb in the first half ?

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

FINAL

Oh, yes. Geoff, we might, but we will have to evaluate when we get there, I think you're
right, I mean you have to till February 28 to actually ask for this -- beyond the forbearance
program, so we'll see how that develops. And we have a surge in a couple of weeks of
people asking for forbearance that might help again more, we'll have to readjust, Geoff,
as we see the quarter. We'll have another month of non-forbearance, effective new -- not
new forbearance, so we'll have to re-evaluate when we get there.

Q - Geoffrey Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

Okay. And then within the P&L, can you talk a little bit about what drove the pretty notable
sequential drop in earned premium as well as some of the movement on both the
expense lines? Was there any reallocation on the expense stuff ?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Specific to any segment or in -- I mean (Multiple Speakers).

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

General. All in MI. Right, Geoff ?

Q - Geoffrey Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

All MI, I think premium line was down $50 million sequentially and then you had some, just
it looks like a little bit of abnormal movement, particularly, in the acquisition expense line
relative to the third quarter, but just a little bit more volatility than where we tend to see?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yes. The first one I'd say, a, was a -- call it, a, and the accounting catch up or true up on
our Australian business how we on the written side, so that I'd say that's more of a oneoff kind of blip that we had to adjust for or actually it was present last quarter and wasn't
this quarter. So that's how we the -- that explains that movement. On the acquisition,
there's -- we entered into a quota share agreement starting last at the middle of the year,
covering our U.S. MI book and that actually gives us a benefit than in terms of the
acquisition, it's a reduction to the acquisition turning to the ceding commission. So that is
what is starting to flow through in our numbers.

Q - Geoffrey Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

Yes. All right. Great. Thank you.

Date: 2021-02-10

Q - Phil Stef ano

{BIO 18965951 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. Thanks. I -- just continuing the MI questions, I guess, so you had mentioned that
roughly two-thirds of the defaults are in forbearance. I was hoping you could give us a
flavor for how many people are nearing the end of their forbearance window? And how
many people in forbearance? Does it feel like are current on their mortgages?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Yes. So -- yes, the numbers we report to you are those are in forbearance and then I have
skipped two payments at least, so we have a few more as you could appreciate that are
in forbearance and are still current. The data is coming in very, very haphazardly. So it's
very -- I wish that, we are constantly asking and prodding for that kind of information. I
think that most of the forbearance that are still there are lower in the year, most of the
forbearance that were declared early in April, May, June. The vast majority of them have
cured by now. So it seems to be the pattern of going to forbearance and sort of staying in
there for four, five months, and then eventually things get back to normalcy. So that's what
we would expect it to be the case going forward. (Multiple Speakers) Yes, go ahead.

Q - Phil Stef ano

{BIO 18965951 <GO>}

No, no, no. That's -- so the -- I think the one question that we're trying to get to and I get
a lot of questions about is, you had mentioned 89% of the delinquents have at least 10%
in equity in the home.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Phil Stef ano

{BIO 18965951 <GO>}

And you had talked about visibility allowing you to repurchase shares. I mean at what point
do we get visibility that maybe the MI reserves are a little more redundant and we can
start to see a release there. I mean how do we think about what you're looking for in the
visibility to adjust that?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

So from your lips to God's ear, I hope you're right that it's  it's going to be redundant,
we'll see, only time will tell for us. I think the way we look at reserve, Phil, is very simple. It's
just -- we have to wait till we get the data that we feel confident that we're going to get
there. And as you know, you've seen us do the reserving on Mi and P&C for a long time.
You tell me when a forbearance program is done and when the unemployment rate goes
down to three or four, and the economy picks up again, then I'll have a better sense for
what it is. So we hope. But having said all this, I hope that by the summer, after the
vaccines have been ruled out that we'll have much, much, much better visibility as to what
if any the reserve needs to be released or is not necessary to pay claims.

Understood. Okay. And switching gears on the reinsurance business. I appreciate the
remarks you made in response to an earlier question. Is there any way you can help frame
for us, what the opportunity is for premium volume? So maybe -- how that one ones go
versus last year or how should we thinking about the growth potential in 2021?

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

I think the growth in 2021 should be more in line, at least with what we were doing last
year. I think the opportunities on the reinsurance side -- oh, we have an echo here. I think
the reinsurance opportunities are still very, very solid, very strong. They're not necessarily,
as I mentioned earlier, in the traditional property cat arena, but we're definitely, definitely
looking at a lot of transactions, and a lot of them will have to do with what you would
expect a reinsurance company to be providing which is capital, as we get into harder
market, right? And a lot of people are -- some of the clients are looking for capital or at
least looking for validation of their plan going forward and want to make sure that they
had the re-underwrite and we repurpose their book of business that we are there to help
them, and we're able in that case to help them get through that transition period.
So the opportunity in reinsurance is -- was great last year, and I think it's actually very, very
good again as we go this year, one interesting fact for every one that one of the key
leading indicator to us to me at least personally based on my history as to what is a
leading indicator of the treaty reinsurance conditions are the facultative industry is still
really, really strong, and it's typically -- you typically have a hard market or hardening
market for as long as the fact market goes, you'll have a treaty market, you'll staying
strong. Well beyond that the year to two years beyond that. So we expect that to be yet
again a strong leading indicator and we -- our facultative team is telling us that it's a really
good market for them at this point in time, which is encouraging.

Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Great. Thanks. So two questions on the P&C side. First, Arch's confidence in the pricing
cycle have clearly born itself out. But is it safe to say that maybe this is as good as it gets
on the property cat's eye, because there is this level of capital available. So that cycle
won't play out a long historical lines?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Page 18 of 22



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2021-02-10

FINAL

Yes. Well, I will tell you Meyer, as my experience, we do a lot of property cat writing in '01
or '02. And if you remember at Arch, we were not heavily focused on property cat excel
at the time, we were more on the liability side. And the market was going down in '04 and
well into '05, and we thought we had seen the last of the harder market for a little while,
and Katrina, Rita and when it happened, it changed the whole thing. So my question to
you -- my answer to you is I don't know, I don't know is the short answer.
I think that there's clearly a lot of capital that again found its way over the last four or five
years, and once the capital found its way into a niche, it's gets sticky, right, it wants to stay
there for a while, and we'll sort of justify itself for a while longer perhabs than it should.
But I think we're always on -- hopefully, it doesn't happen. But where -- we could be one
major event away from changing the perception of risk in that area and that I think will
mean actually probably a much harder market that you would expect, Meyer, because the
volatility and the knee-jerk reaction it would be like an elastic, right, when this happens. I
think you'll have a -- you may have a massive excess of capital out of the door and that
might create more opportunities for us. I'm not saying it will happen, Mayer, but I could
see scenario, where your premise does not actually hold true. So there's always a chance.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. No, just wanted to understand what you're thinking about it.

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure. Yes.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Second, you talked I think on the insurance segment about market dislocation. And I think
maybe the sense of that out there that that has been a major factor or was a major factor
in 2020, but now most companies are kind of settling down and are comfortable with
their books of business. Are you still feeling like today that level of market dislocation?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Dislocation is -- you're right, there's some realignment. There's a couple of people going
back to the market. This is truly happening, but it's not across the Board. And there are
still, we believe bad news that needs to come finance their way through the system, that
might make somewhat of a difference as we go forward. But again, if you had a 20% rate
increase on one transaction on the insurance side this year and you had -- this is on top of
a 10% last year.
If you get rate on rate on rate, perhaps, three times, it's not a bad place to be and plus, I
think what we hear, Meyer, for what it's worth and it's actually not insignificant, we're
hearing terms and conditions finally changing and moving in the right direction. So the race
will move first and terms and conditions sort of follow right behind, and we're hearing that
this is what's happening in the marketplace. So even though, we may not have a headline
growing as high in terms of rate change as much as it was over the last two, three years. I
think the underlying conditions in their policies, could actually help improve it way beyond
the number that we see on the headline number.

Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Hey, thanks. A couple of them for you here. The first one Marc first, I wonder if you could
just confirm, it used to be that your determination on whether you buy back your stock or
not is that if you could actually recoup the premium you paid relative to book value over a
three-year period. Is that still the case? And if it is, does that basically mean that you could
just continue to be pretty aggressive with your share buyback given where your stocks
trading right now?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yes. I think that rule of thumb is still in place. I mean, obviously, it's not a black-and-white, I
mean, there's always factors we consider around the blowing whether there's business
opportunities and et cetera. But yes, we still think in those terms of the buyback, the
premium we bake and that we want to earn it back over no more than three years. And
you're right, I mean, I think the fact that the price -- that the stock price is not as below
that level, suggest that maybe will be out there, buying more stock as we go through the
year. Well, we'll assess, obviously, as we do -- every day, every quarter, we will look at
what's in front of us, but for the time being I think we're -- certainly something we're
considering and we probably will do more of.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. And then just on that topic. So just maybe a little bit on usage of capital or cash
kind of here going forward for the next 12 months, it sounds like you've got $453 million
that's going out here. We've got Watford, but I think is yet to close. Is that it all going to be
constraining to your ability to actually buyback stock, given the also the capital and you
need to fund your growth in your business, and particularly, Marc, just on the reinsurance
business is going to be very capital kind of generated type of transactions?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

No. Because we -- I mean, we raised the $1 billion in capital as you know last summer it -we didn't deploy it fully until, right -- they was all part of that kind of one-one, looking
ahead as to, what the one-ones will do. We know these transactions were, on the horizon.
And we have a lot of faith in our ability to generate earnings moving forward on our -- I
mean so self-funding the growth, I think is something that is part of the plan. And, we
don't really have a whole lot of constraints other than that.
