Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we reported fourth quarter core operating
income of $3.17 per share, up about 16.5% from prior year. These results were impacted
positively by the U.S. tax reform law at the end of the year and negatively by the California
wildfires, which included the two largest fires in California history. Those items aside, our
company's results were highlighted by excellent underlying or ex-CAT underwriting
performance in every division and improving commercial P&C pricing conditions in a
number of our businesses globally, leading to what should be a more favorable
underwriting environment in 2018 for many of our businesses.
Our premium revenue growth for the quarter, excluding merger-related actions, was
3.7%. Headwinds to growth related to these actions are almost all behind us, about $150
million remains or less than 0.5% of annual net premiums. That, along with the strong
economy, both domestic and global, and with an improving pricing environment, makes us
quite optimistic about our growth prospects for the year ahead.
Tax reform will benefit our economy and our company will benefit from both a lower
corporate rate and additional exposure growth as the economy and, therefore, insurance
exposures grow. Our quarterly operating income included a onetime $450 million tax
benefit related to tax reform and we will benefit in the future from a lower overall
corporate rate. We chose to share a portion of the benefits of tax reform to make a
difference in society with a contribution to the Chubb Charitable Foundation of $50 million.
For the year, we produced $3.8 billion in core operating income, which was down 20%
from what we would have earned with a normalized level of CAT losses and without the
benefit from tax reform, or about $4.8 billion. Our results led to core operating ROEs of
12% for the quarter and nearly 8% for the year. For the year, we had strong book and
tangible book value per share growth of 6.5% and 8.6%, respectively.
In the quarter, the P&C combined ratio was 90.7% and for the year, it was 94.7% and
that's with $2.7 billion in catastrophe losses. That kind of combined ratio in the face of this

FINAL

level of CATs simply speaks to the quality of our underwriting and underlying book. And to
that point, on a current accident year basis, excluding CATs, the combined ratio for the
year was 87.6% compared with 89% in 2016, with the loss ratio up over just 0.5 point and
the expense ratio down over 2 points.
By the way, while it was a heavy year for CAT losses, on the other hand, we had an
outstanding year in our Agriculture business, another CAT-like business, which I'll touch on
later.
Net investment income for the quarter was $873 million, up 3.5% over prior year and a
good result that contributed to record net investment income for the year of $3.5 billion,
up over 6%.Considering the historically low interest rate environment, this was an
outstanding result. Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value, the
CATs and prior-period development.

Bloomberg Transcript

On our third quarter call, I reported that we began to see signs of a bit more stable
pricing environment for the business we wrote. In the fourth quarter, that positive rate
movement continued and, in fact, accelerated month-by-month as the quarter
progressed, with prices beginning to firm in a number of important classes, both property
and casualty related, and that trend has continued into January. I believe we're in a
transition market globally and rates should continue to firm as the year goes along,
although not all classes and not in all countries or territories.
The current trend in terms of rate change is the best we've seen in the last few years.
Renewal retention remained steady overall across the company and are quite good, but
they varied by line of business during the quarter. Some areas of our business paid a price
in terms of a modestly lower renewal retention level in order to maintain pricing discipline.
The same with new business â€“ some areas of our company were up, while others
suffered in terms of new business. Those areas where we suffered are what speaks to a
market in transition, some companies are pressing for rate and, in my judgment,
understand the need to improve rate to exposure, while other market participants have
yet to respond and are using this moment to grab underpriced share.
As I said at the beginning, P&C net premium revenue growth, excluding merger actions,
was 3.7% for the quarter, and that includes 1.2 points from foreign exchange. Now let me
give you some specifics around growth and rate change.
In our U. S. major account retail and E&S wholesale divisions, what we call Major Accounts
& Specialty, P&C net premiums, excluding merger-related actions, were down just over
3%. For major accounts, our renewal retention remained at historic highs of over 95%, due
in large part to our risk management portfolio where we are market leaders. For
wholesale E&S, there was a reduction in renewal retention of about 2 to 3 points to the
mid-70s.
New business in major accounts was up 3.5% while in E&S, it was down about 8%. The
change in price we achieved for both major accounts and E&S wholesale was the best
Page 3 of 22



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2018-01-31

FINAL

we've seen in a number of years and let me give you some examples of both rate and its
movement during the quarter.
Major accounts rates overall were up 1% for the quarter, improving to up 1.9% by
December and they are as strong or stronger in January depending on class. Property
rates were up over 7.5% in the quarter, improving to up 10% by December. Casualty rates
were essentially flat in the quarter, improving to up 1.5% in December. And public D&O
rates were up 2.5% for the quarter and up 6% for December, though overall professional
lines rates for major accounts was down 0.5 point in the quarter.
It was a similar story in E&S wholesale. Rates overall were up 2.7% for the quarter,
improving to 4.8% in December. And again, they were as strong in January. Property rates
were up 2.8% in the quarter, improving to up 6.3% in December. Casualty rates were up
3.8% in the quarter, improving to up 4.6% in December. And unlike in major accounts,
financial lines rates were up 2.3% in the quarter, improving to up 5% for December.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now let's turn to our middle market and small commercial division where net premiums,
excluding merger-related actions, were up 2% in the quarter. P&C lines were up 3.1%,
while financial lines were up 1.2%. Renewal retention was reasonably steady, down about 1
point to 86% and exposure growth added 0.3 point.
New business growth for our midmarket business was quite strong, up 10%, and the best
in a while and by the way, 50% of that growth came from cross-sell efforts. Rates
excluding comp were flat, which marks the first reversal in declining rates in three years.
Property rates were flat and rates for package were down about 1.5 points, while
exposure-related pricing for package was up almost 2 points. So there was a net positive
change to renewal price for package.
Casualty-related rates were flat and financial lines rates were up about 1 point. Comp
rates were down about 4 points, while comp pricing-related exposure was up over 2.So
net pricing for comp was down 2.
Pricing in January for middle market appears to have continued the trend and in some
classes firmed incrementally from the fourth quarter. For example, property is now up 2
points, while casualty continues to be flat. Commercial auto rates continue to accelerate,
but remember, we're not a huge commercial auto writer.
In our North America personal lines business, net premiums written were up almost 6% in
the quarter. Rates were up about 2% and exposure change added 3%. Retention
remained very strong at about 95% and new business was up 12% overall and up 16% for
our targeted premier and signature high net worth clients.
Turning to our Overseas General Insurance operations, net premiums written for our
international retail P&C business were up over 7%, excluding merger-related actions, or
over 4% in constant dollars. Latin America and Asia Pac led the way with growth of 11% and
9%, respectively, while Europe also had a good quarter with growth of 5%. The trend in

FINAL

pricing in the quarter was the best we have seen again in three years in both our
international retail and wholesale business.
First, in retail, financial lines rates were up 3%, property-related rates were up 2%, and
marine was up 2%. Both general and specialty casualty were down 1%. For our London
wholesale business, property rates were up 5% and by December, up 7%, marine was up
6% and financial lines were up 1%. In January, London wholesale property moved to
double-digit rate.
Our Agriculture business, where we are the clear market leader, had an excellent year,
highlighted by a combined ratio of 74% and over $390 million of underwriting income, up
15%. As I noted last year, this is a CAT-like business and, therefore, it has a certain volatility
to it by definition, is weather-exposed with weather impacting crop yields and commodity
prices.
We've experienced both sides of volatility, years with great growing seasons and others
with drought. This has been and continues to be a good business for Chubb. John Keogh,
John Lupica, Paul Krump and Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter and
year, including current market conditions and pricing trends.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the quarter, we announced a strategic cooperation agreement with PICC, Property &
Casualty Company of China, the country's largest P&C insurer. The agreement will
leverage Chubb's global capabilities and support the PICC customers and other Chinese
affiliated companies around the world in line with the Chinese government's drive to
promote the country's Going Out and One Belt One Road initiatives.
With this 10-year agreement, PICC has the ability to offer some of China's largest
enterprises, many of which have complex operations in multiple foreign jurisdictions,
access to Chubb's leading capabilities and countries beyond their home market.
I am both optimistic and confident about the year in front of us. We have positive,
synchronized economic growth globally as well as the benefits of tax reform, which should
produce exposure growth, which is good for insurance and good for Chubb. We have the
many investments we have been making to enhance our capabilities and growth
potential, like the PICC and recent DBS announcements. Our middle market and small
commercial business globally represents 30% of the company and we expect good
growth in this area globally. Our global A&H and personal lines businesses are 35% of the
company and we expect good growth this year.
We are seeing and are reasonably optimistic that we should continue to see positive
momentum building for commercial P& C pricing. We would like to see it spread to more
classes and more businesses that need rate and we will do our part as industry leaders to
drive that momentum. In sum, we are bullish that our growth will continue to accelerate
and 2018 will be quite strong.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil and then we'll be back to take your questions.

FINAL

Thank you, Evan. We completed the year in excellent financial condition. We have a strong
balance sheet with top financial strength ratings, excellent liquidity and significant capitalgenerating capability. Despite significant catastrophic loss payments, our operating cash
flow was quite strong at $1.1 billion for the quarter and $4.5 billion for the year.
As Evan noted, we grew tangible book value per share by 8.6% for the year. Originally,
down 29% at the merger closing, tangible book value per share has recovered over 20
points. We have total capital of $64 billion. During the quarter, we returned $453 million to
shareholders, including $330 million in dividends and $123 million in shares repurchased.
For the year, we returned over $2.1 billion, including $1.3 billion in dividends and $830
million in share repurchases.
In the quarter, investment income of $873 million was higher than our previously expected
range of $845 million to $855 million due to increased call activity on our corporate bond
portfolio and higher-than-projected private equity distributions. We now expect our
quarterly run rate to be in the range of $865 million to $875 million with an upward
trajectory as the year progresses.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net realized and unrealized losses for the quarter were $384 million after-tax and
included a $390 million loss from foreign currency movement, a $93 million loss from the
investment portfolio, primarily due to increased interest rates and a gain of $99 million
principally from positive asset returns on our retiree benefit plan portfolio.
Pre-tax catastrophe losses for the quarter were $447 million. The Northern California
wildfires and other catastrophe losses in the quarter were $320 million, as previously
announced. Additionally, there was a $157 million from the Southern California wildfires
and a favorable adjustment of $30 million from last quarter's catastrophe events.
Net loss reserves decreased $1 billion in the quarter on a constant dollar basis, primarily
reflecting catastrophe loss payments and crop payments, which are typically higher in the
fourth quarter. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 120% and was impacted by these payments
and by the favorable prior-period development in the quarter. Adjusting for these items,
the paid-to-incurred ratio was 91%.
We had positive prior-period development in the quarter of $158 million pre-tax, or $130
million after-tax. This included $138 million pre-tax of adverse development, principally
from our legacy asbestos exposures. The remaining favorable development of $296
million pre-tax was split about evenly between long-tail and short-tail lines. The long-tail is
primarily from accident years 2012 and prior.
The operating income tax rate for the quarter and for the year reflects the provisional
income tax benefit of $450 million relating to the 2017 Tax Reform Act. This benefit
comprises a $743 million benefit to book value relating to intangibles, reflecting the
favorable impact of the reduced U.S. corporate tax rate on our gross deferred tax liability
established at the time of the Chubb Corp acquisition and a charge of $293 million for

tangible book value, primarily reflecting a negative impact of the tax rate reduction on our
gross deferred tax asset balances.
We have previously announced an estimate that was in excess of $250 million. The
increase in our estimate reflects a more favorable impact with the newly established
excess foreign tax credit generated by the new deemed repatriation rules. We expect our
annual core operating effective tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 15% under the new
rules.
I'll turn the call back to Helen.

Thank you. At this point, we'll be happy to take your questions.

Q&A
Operator
And our first question will come from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. My first question, I appreciate all the disclosure in the market. Just
trying to gather your color, and I think there are some speculation out there that maybe
some of the tax reform benefit, at least in the U.S. to a certain degree, could get
competed away. Evan, when you think about the outlook on the market and some of your
commentary on the rating environment, how does that play into how you think about the
commercial lines environment on the pricing side playing out in 2018?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yeah. Look, Elyse, it's right now idle speculation and who knows, there is no certainty. I'd
make a few observations. Look at the P&C â€“ commercial P&C combined ratios, you got to
make profit to have something to compete away. So you can't. And if you take out CAT
premiums as well as CAT losses to look at ex-CAT accident year, so truly take out CAT,
the combined ratios of the industry, I mean, commercial P&C are very anemic, hovering
around 100%or over 100%.And so how are you going to compete away with a tax benefit
without profit â€“ without underwriting profit? Number one.
Number two â€“ the industry is heartily (21:56) running some brilliant ROE. It's mid single-digit
to low single-digit. And on a risk-adjusted basis, that's an anemic return. Number three,
the industry has operated at very low interest rate environment that has really pressured
investment income. The tax benefit starts, in my judgment, to give some amelioration to
that. And I think anyone who's kind of rational in thinking about this is a leader and
projecting ahead on this considering all these factors.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thank you. And then when you said, you pointed to some companies that are
looking to grab share in the market in under pricing business, is that specific to certain
lines or is that just something you're observing broadly throughout the commercial lines
market?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

It truly varies by line of business. There's a cohort that we can identify that is by line of
business and it's generally by territory or country that we note, that we have our eye on.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then one last question, if I may?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I'm not going to name and shame, Elyse.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Yeah. I figured. One last question. Can we just get a little bit of an update on where you
see loss cost broadly within your commercial lines book right now?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Loss costs have been and it varies by line of business. It has been pretty steady from what
I've said in prior quarters. You're looking at primary casualty, depending on the line of
business is running in that 3% to 5% range, excess is typically running in that 7% to 9%
range. We've seen a net in professional lines, particularly in D&O, new employment
practices. There has been an uptick in both frequency and severity trends over the last
two years, three years, and that is very troublesome because it's related generally in the
United States to merger-related objections and to securities class actions.
And by the way, I've noticed recently some public information release about D&O loss
ratios and they're pure loss ratios, they don't even have loss cost in it. And the interesting
part about loss cost and loss adjustment cost, when you add it all up, half the cost
insurance companies are paying out goes to the legal profession to either defend or it's
the trial bar settlements, hardly a benefit to corporate America or to shareholders who
are supposedly aggrieved. Pardon me for going beyond loss cost trends.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color.

And we will now hear from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.

Page 8 of 22



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2018-01-31

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you and good morning. My first question is that if you look back two years ago
when you first set up the goal for the merger, the twin drivers: one is expense savings,
which you have exceeded the original target; the other one is substantial revenue growth,
but the revenue growth in the past few year has been limited. So where are the revenue
opportunities and how do you think this will play out in the next three years?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yeah. Kai, very interesting. When we look at it, revenue growth, ex the merger-related
actions, which was planned and understood all along, we're actually very clear about it
upfront. So I'd take a little exception to how you're characterizing it. You take that out and
you look underneath it. When we look at the market conditions, the two companies
together are doing better in growth than these two companies would have done
standalone, and that is really clear to us.
Secondly, we said and we put a time horizon on the growth of between that three- and
five-year window because of the seeds we are planting and have been planting and I just
said that 30% of our business is small and middle market, and the growth in the small and
middle market globally is accelerating and, in fact, we had no small commercial globally
between the two companies until we brought them together and took capabilities that
both had and invested behind them and now have growing businesses, as an example. So
I'll stop right there.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

All right. And then on the sort of industry consolidation, recently we have seen some sort
of merger announcement and now you're two year into the merger integration, will you
be sort of a more outward looking and looking for potential growth opportunities through
acquisitions?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I know you didn't imagine I would answer that question for you. You're just trying me on
for size.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

All right. I tried.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Okay, Kai. Nice talking to you.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Yeah. Can I take on another question to replace that one, so on the foreign exchange? In
the past, you have said if U.S. dollar is strengthening that will be sort of hurting your book
value. But now fourth quarter after U.S. dollar have been sort of weakening, so why
there's a drag on your book value?

A - Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

FINAL

So the balance sheet FX impact in the quarter was a result of the U.S. dollar strengthening
against most major currencies from 9/30 to 12/31, notably, the Canadian dollar, the
Brazilian real, the Australian dollar. So, for the quarter, we had a book value loss of $390
million. For the year, though, the dollar has weakened and we've had a cumulative gain of
$512 million.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

It depends where it took place, Kai. So when you're looking at the dollar weakening as a
headline and how it impacts premium revenue growth on book value, it depends where
you have your asset.

A - Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

But it actually strengthened in the fourth quarter.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

If dollar stay the same, would that possibly impact for the full year results 2018?

A - Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

There'd be no change.

And our next participant is Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. On the revenues, now that the merger-related underwriting actions are
behind you, can you help us think about what sort of premium growth we should be
looking for, given your pricing actions, the economy and all these growth opportunities
that you're seeing?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

First, remember, I just gave you a number of $150 million remaining, so it's not zero. But
it's very modest now. Secondly, we don't guide revenue growth. I gave you as much color
around revenue growth as I'm going to provide.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

You're welcome.

FINAL

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

And then just on the pricing outlook, how high do you think you could raise prices if we
look out a year or two? Or maybe another way to think about it, how much rate do you
think you need across your book in the current environment?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I'm not going to speculate on that how much we could achieve. We're doing it in a
responsible way. We're only going for rate that is required to earn a reasonable riskadjusted return and it varies by line of business, by kind of customer cohort and by
country. So it's not a simplistic answer that way.

Bloomberg Transcript

What I would say is, unlike others, you look at our total portfolio and you look at the
combined ratio we put up and it's world-class. It's the best in the industry. But that does
vary by line and commercial P&C, particularly larger business and E&S business, it runs in
the 90s. We have other businesses that all together mix our portfolio down into the
80s.So it varies by area and we've had underwriting discipline. We are willing to trade and
we'll continue to trade market share and growth to maintain a reasonable underwriting
return.
And as the market responds to anemic returns and prices go up and as the market
responds to an understanding that loss cost trends are something that just continue to
grind away and put pressure on margins that the responsible thing to do is for both client
and for companies, so you avoid volatility in the future in pricing is to respond by raising
rates. And as that happens, that increases opportunity for us and increases growth. And
that's about as much as I'm going to say, Sarah.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

Okay. Great. Thank you for the answer.

And we will now go to Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, everybody. I had a question regarding the comments on the
acceleration of rate improvement over the course of the quarter and then for January. I
think looking at some of the comments made by brokers, I got almost the opposite
impression from them. So I was just curious to better understand why there may be a
Page 11 of 22



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2018-01-31

discrepancy between what we're hearing from brokers and what we're hearing from
some of the insurers?

FINAL

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Well, you're going to have to go to figure that out. I can't help you with that. I can only
relate to the data we see. So I know our information and if you're getting contrary
information â€“ and by the way, the brokers we talk to, what we see, what they see is
consistent. So I think you may be confused in some ways and not comparing apples-toapples of type of business, insurance versus reinsurance, London versus the United States
or whatever, but I can't help you with your â€“ you live in your hell, I live in mine.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Fair enough. And then with regards to major accounts, I guess, most of your competitors

management, that is proprietary. And, Phil, you want to...?

A - Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

I would have said the same thing. We've looked at, obviously, the change in the U.S. tax
rate as one of the most important drivers of the reduction in our tax rate. We've looked at
also rates around the world where we expect our income to emerge, and we've done it
all in light of our planned capital management. We operate in 54 jurisdictions. We're
constantly seeing changes in tax law and we've analyzed the new rules and we've thought
about modifying our capital management strategies and other border transactions â€“ other

And our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Thank you. My first question is on the California wildfires. Could you perhaps provide
some perspective on how large do you think the fourth quarter industry insured losses
were for the wildfires?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I don't have a great handle on it. The numbers bouncing around have been between sort
of that $9 billion and $12 billion, and I think that's probably a pretty good number, but I
don't know with certainty. But the size of both of these fires, when I said they were the
largest in history, not the insured loss, which obviously will be, but what I was really
referring to is the geography on the burn was greater than we've seen and has been
seen in recorded history. I'm sure you get back past recorded history and they were
probably bigger ones, but this is as big as you've seen, so they're massive.
We do know that â€“ so we think probably that $9 billion to $12 billion wouldn't surprise me if
it comes out there on the northern fires. Southern fires are much smaller. They did burn in
concentrations, greater affluence, though, they were smaller fires and they'll be a few
billion dollars anyway for the (36:45).

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Does that have implication in terms of how Chubb would position its homeowners
business in California going forward?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

The whole notion of non-modeled CAT and being able to model better is we're an
underwriting company and that is just such a part of our craft and I'm more enthusiastic
about that. That fascinates us. So the notion of how much concentration do you really
have to an event as you can define an event and what is your appetite for that, are you
getting paid adequately and how you protect yourself are all the questions we dwell on in
great detail as we expand our personal lines in smaller commercial portfolios.

FINAL

Flood and the ability to manage flood that way is further advanced than wildfire, and I'll
come back on wildfire. In flood, the tools we can now use, the mapping, the analytics of
portfolio and how to respond to various flood scenarios is getting better and better, and
it gives us much better confidence depending on the geography and the area that we're
looking at flood concentrations.
In wildfire, the tools have not been good, but they're improving and there are some new
tools that are out that give you a better way to imagine wildfire and the impact on the
concentrations of the portfolio. So we're all over that. The regulatory environment in
California in particular is you have to take it into consideration. It's difficult when it comes
to being able to get a proper price for the risk you're taking and that's not to California's
benefit, given the values of concentration there, they need to attract insurers. But we take
that into consideration when we think about our appetite in California.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Right, of course. One last sort of big picture one, if I could.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Does that help you?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Very much, thank you. There's an announcement yesterday regarding three major
companies in terms of trying to tackle their own employee health care costs. Do you have
any thoughts on that in terms of how perhaps Chubb could address that issue that's
affecting all companies?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yeah. I think it's â€“ look, I only know and read what you did. I think it's a very rational and I
think it's a very encouraging move they're making. First of all, between them, they have a
cohort of employees of 1 million. So that is a big enough group to truly make a difference
and to allow you to craft a more efficient healthcare delivery and they want to tackle the
structural questions of cost related to delivery. And I think that's â€“ I applaud what they're
doing. And we have 15,000 employees roughly in the U.S. We don't have anywhere near
what they have. And I think that they're going to start blazing that trail as great and there'll
be others who will follow and I'm sure in time, but I hope it starts the right kind of
movement. We need reform in healthcare. And the cost I think Mr. Buffett said it pretty
well, it's a tapeworm that's eating away the economy in the United States.

Q - Jon Paul Newsome

{BIO 3522950 <GO>}

Good morning. You mentioned the cross-sell efforts. Was wondering if you could give us
kind of an update of how those efforts are going and what you expect for the coming
year?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Well, I'm not going to tell you about the coming year because I don't guide on that. But
I'm going to let Paul Krump talk about and reflect on current cross-sell and then John
Lupica will add to that.

A - Paul J. Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Great. Thank you, Evan, and thank you, Paul. As Evan mentioned, in the middle market
space, we actually had 50% of our new business come from cross-sell, and so those are
existing customers where we're adding additional product to. What was so encouraging
to me in the fourth quarter was that about a third of that cross-sell came from clients who
were only purchasing professional liability lines from us and we cross-sold the package
comp and auto to them, and I haven't seen that happen in years and years to that extent.
So that was just incredibly encouraging.
On the small side, we are cross-selling all kinds of product to customers. That's being very
warmly received because there the bulk of our competitors really only sell a BOP product
comp and auto. We're out there selling professional liability alongside of that umbrella, et
cetera. We've been doing some cross-selling on the personal lines side where we're
selling small commercial business to people that have in-home businesses. So recently
had a big win on a very large personal lines client who got rejected in the marketplace
because one of the spouses was raising bees and selling honey at the local fair and
nobody else could handle it but Chubb's. So, pretty interesting little story.

Q - Jon Paul Newsome

{BIO 3522950 <GO>}

Second question...

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Lupica, you want...?

A - John Joseph Lupica

{BIO 4213297 <GO>}

Yeah. Let me just add a little more color, and Paul had given you a statistic on what we call
cross-sell. We also keep track of something very interesting called strength of the
organization where we brought the two organizations together, it gives us more
capabilities. And about 10% of our new business this quarter was a result of our two
organizations coming together. And we are two years in and our 48 branch offices really

Page 15 of 22

have a familiarity and a comfort level with one another and cross-selling and driving our
products and specialty services into that organization is as good as it's ever been and
we're very optimistic about it in the coming years.

FINAL

Q - Jon Paul Newsome

{BIO 3522950 <GO>}

Fantastic. Second question. A little bit of a follow-on from Jay's in terms of lessons learned
in the flood business. Do you think that Chubb and the industry can underwrite that if the
government went away? Are we as sophisticated enough now to be able to underwrite
flood?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yeah. I would say I'm going to give you an answer that â€“ it's something in between. I think
we clearly, the way the NFIP is crafted today, it discourages more private sector
participation and the private sector can do much more than it is doing in terms of taking
on flood risk. The government's role I would suggest would be in two areas, and one of
those areas may disappear over time, but in the short and medium term.

Bloomberg Transcript

Number one, for those who can't afford flood insurance protection, they can't afford to
pay for it, but they live in a flood-exposed area, subsidizing â€“ that's a social decision and
to subsidize those people because you can't charge an actuarially sound rate that I see as
a role for government. The industry should be charging actuarially sound pricing.
Number two, there is a tail on flood that goes for a while beyond the industry's
wherewithal or appetite. And I see the government like TRIA or like in crop insurance
playing a role. But I do think that over time, given the global balance sheet and both
traditional capital and alternative capital, that tail risk over time the private sector could
displace the federal role.

And we will now hear from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you. I guess, first, Evan, if I can ask about capital. If I take consensus, you're going
to earn in round numbers, $5 billion this year. You can certainly do a lot better than $100somethingmillion of repurchase if you wanted to. I know you're not going to talk directly
about M&A, but can you just give us some sort of sense of how to think about, how you
might deploy earnings over the next, say, two, three years as far as â€“ is there sort of a
target mix in your head or are we sort of back to pre-acquisition thinking on buyback, just
how should we think about all that?

Ian, we will build capital flexibility. That is a priority for this organization. And I think we can
generate greater returns to shareholders over time by retaining capital, building capital
flexibility and deploying it in various strategies and areas for growth. This is a growth
company. We measure growth primarily by growth in book value.
To the extent that we generate capital that is in excess of the capital flexibility, we need
to execute those strategies. We will do what we have a long history of doing. We will
return it to shareholders through dividends and other capital management strategies,
such as buybacks. That's about it. So I hope that gives you a sense of the sentiment, but
I'm not going to put any more specifics.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Fair enough. Maybe if I can ask it a slightly different way is â€“ and certainly before the
acquisition, there were a lot of questions about you having people wondering about you
guys having a sort of more than normal amount of excess capital. And clearly, after the
deal, you had been below your probably target for capital for a little while as you rebuild.
Are we sort of back to neutral now? Or do you think you're still sort of building back to the
cushion you would like to have? Or maybe we're over that cushion? Just some sort of
sense of where the starting point is.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Ian, we're building.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

little differently as well.

FINAL

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Well, I'll try. I guess, what surprised me about the 13% to 15% is I just sort of go around the
world in my head about which countries you're big in and I think most of those of having at
least a 20% tax rate other than Bermuda obviously and Switzerland, which I don't think you
write that much direct business anymore as a proportion anyway. So, I guess, I'm
struggling to figure out if it's harder to do intercompany quota shares why the tax rate
went down from tax reform? I understand the U.S. rate went down, but I would have
thought some of the intercompany stuff would have went out.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Ian, in the balance, the U.S. rate reduction, if you look at puts and calls, as you're
imagining, we're not going to give you the details at all of puts and calls. But if you look at
the puts and calls, the reduction in the U.S. tax rate more than offset the negatives of
reduction in affiliate rate.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Got it. Okay.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

A - Evan G. Greenberg

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the outlook in Mexico because we don't
talk about that one maybe as much as some of the other ones, but I know it's obviously
been a good business for you guys. And just sort of the outlook given, A, we have an
election that sounds like it might go in a way that's not market friendly and, B, if NAFTA
goes in a bad way, does that matter for the business or is it really much more oriented
towards domestic activity than trades? Just sort of what things matter in Mexico going
forward?

FINAL

The health of the Mexican economy, and that is able to continue to grow ex the energy
sector as it is and, in fact, accelerate. NAFTA has been a great contributor to that. And
Mexico is so integrated and dependent on the U.S. economy. So, on one hand, as the U.S.
economy improves, so does the Mexican economy because we are so intertwined that
way. On the other hand, the NAFTA â€“ and NAFTA has created an environment of certainty
and predictability that encourage greater investment cross-border.
The NAFTA negotiations going on today and the way they're occurring and how long
they're taking creates an environment of uncertainty, on the other hand. And that
potentially, it hasn't shown up yet, creates the risk of instability. You said it, on the political
end, there is the possibility of the elections results moving in a populist direction, that
could be more anti-foreign and that would be bad for Mexico, it would be bad for the
United States. It could damage the growth of the Mexican economy.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our business is very focused on the domestic and the growth of the domestic economy.
We insure consumers and small and midsized businesses and we insure large Mexican
corporations and multinationals doing business there, but the predominance of our
business is consumer and small business-oriented, which is very domestically focused.
And so the health of that business and the continued growth of it and we are growing
double-digit in Mexico and it is with very stable returns, and we are investing in Mexico
and we are bullish about the future of that country. And if there is, in any rational world,
NAFTA will be concluded and we will deepen the integration in North America and I hope
that kind of rational world prevails.

Thank you. Most of my questions were answered. Just one other topic I love you to
comment on. The investigations going on now into the brokerage business in the London
market, Evan, do you see a role for regulators to play in that market on the distribution
side?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

What do you mean by a role for the regulators to play? It is a regulated industry. And the
regulator always has a role to play in ensuring that regulation, both the weather and the
spirit of what it intends is properly adhered to. And I think that's what their investigation is
about. But I don't know a lot â€“ I got to be honest with you, I don't know a lot because it's
not focused on us and we're just not really involved in any material way.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

what's going on there and take maybe a slightly more heavy-handed approach given
some of the changes in that market?

FINAL

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I am more in favor, I'm always in favor of the private sector policing its own behavior and
to behave in what is the interest of a healthy marketplace and not over-relying on
regulators to perform that role. But we're market participants and the private sector fails
to address issues that may exist, and I'm just not going to sit here and speculate further
about that, but issues that may exist in practices, then it requires regulator to get involved.
Now do those exist or not, I can't really â€“ Jay, I'm not in a position to really say.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks. A couple questions here for you, Evan. The first one, just back on tax reform
and maybe implications on kind of lines of business. In the Agricultural business, would you
think that maybe there is some pressure on kind of A&O reimbursement rates and stuff
as a result of tax reform?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

God, I don't know. I'm not going to speculate about that. The only thing I know is crop
insurance is just so core to the U.S. farmers when they look at a farm bill, what's the most
important thing to them and it is the stability of crop insurance because what that does to
give them predictability and support as they do their business and face the vagaries of
weather, but I'm not going to speculate on that.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay. And then my second question, Evan, is it possible to give us broadly kind of what
the potential revenue opportunity is from the PICC relationship over the next five years? I
know it's a 10-year agreement. And also on that topic, what impact at all does it have on
your Huatai ownership?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

It has zero impact on our Huatai ownership or our 100% owned Chubb operations in
China. And as far as revenue goes, it depends on how we each execute and on how well
we execute and it requires both of us in that execution and to do it well. But I think the
revenue opportunity is reasonably significant. I don't want to put a dollar amount on it, but
Page 20 of 22

FINAL

it's significant when you start thinking about Chinese multinational exposure and how
that's growing and how it will continue to grow in the years to come and the need to
insure them. And when you think about PICC as an SOE, state-owned enterprise, and you
think about how many of their clients and how many of the Chinese multinationals to
begin with are SOEs and that is an ecosystem unto itself and this between us gives us
access and an ability to serve that ecosystem.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Just I wonder if you could add any color onto what we're
hearing about the winter wheat harvest. And then are these significant drought-like
conditions and what that means for the Agriculture business? And two, given the big
reserve release versus a intra-year reserve change in the fourth quarter in crop, is that a
behavior on how you reserve for the business? Should we expect you to be extremely
conservative in the first half of the year and then true it up in the back half of the year?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No. First of all, we're not in the winter wheat harvest season. We're in the...

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

It's the planting. It's the planting, I guess.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

We're not in the planting season either. We're in the growing season...

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yeah. Fair enough.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

...for winter wheat, so we'll start with that. Number two, and those are important
distinctions. Number two, the drought conditions, very spotty, there is nothing we see at
this moment that gives us concern with winter wheat. So I'll start with that.

FINAL

Number two, we have not changed any of our reserving practices around crop and we
use a historic loss ratio, as we have said in the past. We use a historic loss ratio when we
start a season. I have no idea how it's going to play out and you never know till the fall, so
you can't really move unless you have really some kind of early very clear data of
significance, you can't really move off of the average until you have real clear knowledge
of the present and that doesn't occur until the fourth quarter.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

fourth quarter in most years is going to look very different from the other three quarters?
