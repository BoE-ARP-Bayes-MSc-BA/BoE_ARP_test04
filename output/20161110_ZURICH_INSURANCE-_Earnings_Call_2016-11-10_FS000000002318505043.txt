MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning or good afternoon. Welcome to the Results for the
Nine Months to September 30, 2016 Conference Call. I'm Celina, the Chorus Call

George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Richard, and good morning or good afternoon to everyone on the call. Thank you
for joining us. So, before we start the Q&A, I'd like to make a few comments on the
results. I'm pleased to report that today's result show that the management actions that
we've taken today are leading to an improvement in the results with contributions coming
from all of our three main segments.

Bloomberg Transcript

The GI combined ratio continues to improve on a nine-month basis with the accident year
loss ratio ex-cat down roughly 2 percentage points compared to the full-year 2015 results.
The Q3 discrete ratio is slightly higher than expected, mainly driven by higher large loss
in the quarter. We continue with our re-underwriting actions, and we're satisﬁed that we're
delivering the expected underlying improvements with more to come.
For Q4, we expect the combined ratio to be in the range of 97%-98%, which means that
the full year 2016 combined ratio would be slightly above 98%. It's important to note that
the achievement of a 97%-98% combined ratio is not the limit of our ambition for the
combined ratio. The lower underwriting result was oﬀset by investment income, which is
up 3% in local currency compared to the prior year. And as in the second quarter, this
results from higher dividend income on equities and principally higher yields on inﬂationlinked bonds in Latin America that back our business in the region.
And I guess the point that I really want to make here that this has not been achieved by
taking on additional asset risk. The group's cap position is strong with the estimated ZECM ratio above the midpoint of target range at 113% as of the end of the third quarter.
Lastly, we're working hard to position Zurich for the future and to shape a clear and
simple group strategy for 2017 and beyond. We'll give you an update next week at our
Investor Day on November 17 in London with focus on the strategic direction, technical
excellence, ﬁnancial targets and dividend policy.
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll now start the Q&A.

FINAL

Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. Two points, two questions from my side. The ﬁrst one, just
on your last comment on the attritional loss ratio for 66.6% in Q3. So if you strip out the
RCIS impact and the large loss, so the two events in Germany and the UK, you'd probably
still slightly be above 65%. I mean, was this the level where you would expect the
attritional loss ratio to be? Or if not, I mean, what's the deviation? And do you plan some
additional corrective measure to take here?
And the second one, on the reserve situation, just a clariﬁcation. I mean, the 1.8% reserve
release, how is this split into the major segments? And related to that, Swiss Re (4:36)
mentioned that the claims frequency in the truck business or the commercial auto
business was somewhat higher than expected. Is that something that worries you?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Daniel. So, ﬁrst of all, on the attritional performance, so I mean if you look at
the overall results for the quarter, we're slightly higher than we expected to be. I think
we're happy, though, that the action that we've taken through the end of last year and the
steps that we've taken in the ﬁrst half of this year are having the impact that we expected. I
guess the challenge we've had this quarter, and you saw it in the opposite direction last
quarter, is that, unfortunately, the outcome has not been linear.
I mean, I think you could strip out a number of components to come back to a view that
we would have achieved something in the 97%-98% range. But I mean, for us, I mean
what's most important is where we're headed, what have we delivered. And if we looked
at the impact of the re-underwriting that we've done and the impact that that would have
had on the portfolio, I mean our conclusion is that we're achieving the goals that we set. I
mean, there will still be some volatility.
If we looked at Q2, we would have had an underlying combined ratio somewhere in the
96s. I mean, that was clearly partly due to good luck and we expressed that at the time. I
mean, this quarter we have loss volatility in the opposite side. We've looked in detail at
what drives that and we're satisﬁed that it's not driven by something that we haven't yet
tackled. We continue to work on re-underwriting. So, that's a process that will continue
through the course of this year and to next. There are certainly areas of the portfolio,
which are not yet achieving the proﬁtability that we want and you can see it particularly in
some areas of Global Corporate. And that means that this process for us will continue into
2017. But we're happy that the trends that we're seeing on the attritional are the ones that
we expected to see from a performance perspective.
On the commercial auto. So, I mean commercial auto generally continues to be a diﬃcult
market. I mean we are seeing, I mean, what at least on the surface appears to be
signiﬁcant rate. But the underlying loss cost inﬂation, I mean, driven by a combination of
frequency and severity is still higher, we believe, than the price action that we're seeing in
the market. So, that's a line that is not yet improving at the pace that we would like to see,
and from a capital allocation perspective, I mean, we are acting accordingly.

And your 1.8% reserve release is more or less evenly split through GC, NAC and Europe?

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So, there's a slide in the pack that breaks it out by the diﬀerent business. And if you look
at each of them, I mean some are slightly stronger, some slightly weaker. I mean, from a
line of business perspective, to go back to your earlier question, generally it's – the mix is
more positive coming from the shorter tail end of things. And to the extent that we have
any signiﬁcant negative, which of course are much smaller, I mean they tend to be in the
more long tail lines. I mean that's the general driver of the PYD in the quarter.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Excellent. Thank you.

The next question comes from Mrs. Nadine van der Meulen from Morgan Stanley. Please
go ahead.

Q - Nadine van der Meulen

{BIO 15200446 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I was wondering, with regard to the combined ratio
expectation for the full year, you said that it could come out slightly above 98%. Could
you give a split between the expected loss ratio there and the expense ratio given that
you have been guiding towards 31% for the expense ratio previously?
And the second question is on the sales volumes. They were a bit pressured, as expected
I suppose, but particularly in Global Corporate also NAC and EMEA. Could you comment
on how you see this develop for each region? And in light of that, also maybe comment
on the rate – expected rate developments in the diﬀerent regions? Thank you very much.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Nadine. So, on full-year expectations, I wouldn't change the guidance I gave you
earlier in the year. So, from an expense perspective, we expect to end the year broadly in
line with where we were last year and that will be a combination of an absolute expense
cut, which I think is visible in the nine-month ﬁnancial statement. So, we've made
signiﬁcant progress, but partly oﬀset by the impact of volumes, which I'm going to come
on to next. And from a loss perspective, again, no change to what we had expected to
see there, albeit with the qualiﬁcation I gave a second ago in the introduction.
On the sales volume side, in general, in the year-to-date, we're still seeing reductions in
GWP that are consistent with what we had anticipated would be needed to achieve the
proﬁtability that we had targeted for the year. From a rate perspective, if you look at the
diﬀerent markets and the information we disclosed today, what you'll see is that – I mean,
in general, we see pretty solid rate across all the markets. The one area that stands out as
being slightly weaker is Global Corporate. I mean, that's a very competitive market. And
in particular property in the U.S. is a market where pricing is very competitive.

FINAL

Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2016-11-10

I think from a trend or from an outlook view, sales volumes through Q4, I don't expect to
be very diﬀerent from the year-to-date. So, again, we'll continue the re-underwriting
process that we started. We'll focus on making sure that we achieve the required proﬁt.
And that should leave us with a reduction in GWP for the year ex the RCIS acquisition
that's still in that mid-single-digit range. From a rate outlook, I don't really expect the
trends that you see already in Q3 to change. My guess is that Global Corporate will
continue to be very competitive and will still achieve higher rate outcomes on the
remainder of the book. That would be, I think, better than the overall market performance
currently.

Q - Nadine van der Meulen

{BIO 15200446 <GO>}

Thank you very much.

The next question is from Dhruv Gahlaut from HSBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I've got two of them. Firstly, going back
to slide 7 where you've given the retention by tier. Could you quantify what percentage of
business is sitting in Tier 4 and what is the combined ratio of that business at the end of
nine months? Secondly, for the group as a whole, how does the claim inﬂation compare
with the rate you've put in of 2% at the nine-month stage? Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So, on the tiering picture (11:24), so Tier 4, it varies quarter-to-quarter. I think, in general,
the low end tends to be around the 10%, 12% and high end tends to be in the 17%, 18%
range. So, overall, for the year, something in the kind of a mid-teen-type level. Can you
remind me (11:44) what your second question was, Dhruv?

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

And also on – could you quantify what the combined ratio was for that Tier 4 at nine
months?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

No. I can't. I don't have that in front of me.

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

All right. Second was claim inﬂation versus price inﬂation on the order book.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So, I think, again it varies market by market. So, I think the claim inﬂation we would see in
the U.S. is running at a level that's pretty close to the rate that we're achieving. So, the
margin improvement is currently quite modest, particularly around the Global Corporate

FINAL

side of things. You see an outcome from a rate perspective is slightly positive, but claim
inﬂation is still currently probably slightly north of that. In the other markets, though, the
impact might be much (12:28) stronger, and claim inﬂation is not as strong. So, I mean,
across the portfolio, we're seeing much stronger impact of rate outside of North America.
For the portfolio overall, we still see a positive impact between the rate that we achieve
and the claim inﬂation that (12:46).

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

Perfect. Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thank you.

The next question comes from Mr. Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. I wanted to come back on the premium growth, ﬁrst of all. I know you were
sort of saying that was in line with expectations, but I guess I was quite surprised by the
big fall that we saw in Q3 and the sort of swing. I mean, I appreciate you saying you exited
the Australian business, et cetera, but even in NAC, we've seen a huge swing from sort of
plus 7% in Q2 to a minus 4% in Q3. So, I was wondering if you could just talk about the
sort of historic developments.
And the second question, I was wondering if you could talk about the moving parts in the
SST ratio? Appreciate you giving us a Q3 ﬁgure, but I was again, I guess, a little bit
surprised by the extent of the fall from the full year. And I was just wondering if you could
split out some of the moving parts or maybe give us a Q2 number in terms of timing.
Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So, on the ﬁrst one, Peter, on premium growth, you need to be a bit careful with NAC,
because NAC has quite a bit of captive business. And that's what drove some of the
increase that you saw in Q2. So, I think, actually, the year-to-date view is a better indicator
of where we stand from an overall GWP impact. I mean, Australia has a relatively small
eﬀect, but I think NAC is the biggest distorting factor between Q2 and Q3. And a large
part of that is explained by a captive timing between Q2 and Q3. Overall, year-to-date,
premium growth is roughly where we expect, mid-single-digit level. And again, no reason
to expect we're going to see a signiﬁcant deviation from that.
On the SST, the main reason for the higher sensitivity is the way that SST treats interest
rates, both from a discount rate perspective, but particularly from a market value margin
calculation perspective. SST adds it to the target capital requirement. And of course, that
makes it much, much more sensitive to interest rates. I mean, there are other smaller

Page 6 of 22

Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2016-11-10

diﬀerences, but that explains the vast majority of the diﬀerence between the two
numbers.

FINAL

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. If I could just follow up on that last point, I guess we're going to see that
change now. It's going to be moved from the capital requirement to the available new
capital. So, I don't know if you – are you able to give us any sort of sensitivity of how big
that positive impact will be?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

If you bear with me, Peter, and come back for the Investor Day next week, I'd do more on
SST and Z-ECM and Solvency II generally. So, we'll include a section there that addresses
that particular issue and a few more that are relevant for comparing SST and Z-ECM to
other capital measures.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks a lot.

The next question is from Mr. Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon, George. Just on the Global Corporate, I mean I'm looking at slide
10, and obviously thanks for this additional disclosure today. But there's been a lot of
volume cut for three quarters now. I think it's not minus at least, it's okay, zero, one (16:16),
I mean. I mean, what do you think needs to be done, or maybe we wait for Investor Day,
but what do you think is – is it just random large losses? What do you think is driving such
a high 84% kind of AY LR in this segment? And what do you think needs to be done? So
that's the ﬁrst question.
And second question is – again, we might discuss it next week, but the interest rate
sensitivity for Z-ECM has increased a lot compared to the previous disclosure. Is there
some model (16:54) changes that we should be wary of? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Vinit. So, ﬁrst of all, on Global Corporate, so if you drill into the quarter – I
think there are two big scenes. One is, the market in general is very competitive. So, it's
been much harder, despite the reduction that we've pushed through on the volume side,
to achieve quite the rate outcomes that we were looking for. And the Global Corporate, of
course, is particularly exposed to one of the markets that's particularly soft, which is U.S.
property. And I think if look at O-U.S. (17:29) property book and our planning for next year,
it's a diﬃcult line of business to underwrite a proﬁt currently. I mean, you need to take
relatively ambitious assumptions around nat cat incidents to really feel happy about North
American property exposure currently.
Page 7 of 22



FINAL

Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2016-11-10

So, Global Corporate has same issues of the market there. I mean, we have some issues in
our portfolio, in general. The steps that we took at the beginning of the year around reunderwriting, around the use of reinsurance, I mean that will start to have a bigger impact
on the business as we move on. Global Corporate has a particular chance in the quarter,
though. So, they have two areas which are European that have been slightly problematic
for them. So, one was med mal in Spain and the other is ﬁnancial lines in Europe. And on
both of those, we've moved loss picks for the year, and that's why you see this very high
combined ratio for Global Corporate for the quarter.
I mean, having said all of that, though, I think we're doing all of the things that we
expected to do. We're not looking for volume outcomes. We're looking for proﬁtability.
That's what the team continue to do. And in fact, if I look at all the diﬀerent parts of the
portfolio, I mean Global Corporate and, in fact, commercial and its new organizational
structure, is one of the areas that will clearly need much more attention and reunderwriting as we go through 2017.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

And just pardon me, the almost $1.2 billion in NEP, is there a disclosure on how much is
U.S. property, any guesstimate or – in Global Corporate, sorry?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So, Global Corporate's North American property book after reinsurance is, I think,
between $300 million and $400 million. We'll check and come back afterwards, but it's
that type of order.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

In the quarter?

A - George Quinn

No, in the year.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

In the year. Okay.

A - George Quinn

signiﬁcant quota share contract in place at the end of last year.

FINAL

On interest rate sensitivity, I mean we changed the disclosures earlier in the year to try
and bring in the non-ﬁnancial market element. So before – certainly up to the end of last
year, our interest rate sensitivities were typically parallel shift and focused more on interest
rate-driven impacts on AFR. And what we tried to do going through this year is to update
that for the second order eﬀect that we've signed and typically (20:00) on the liability side
to make the disclosure more meaningful. It doesn't change actual sensitivity. But I think it's
a fair disclosure. So, we've tried to improve it.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

The next question is from Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi there. I just wondered if you could come back on reinsurance. I recall there was a
purchase speciﬁcally to do with large losses last year, you bought at the end of last year,
and you were running up to the aggregate deductible on that. I think you were below that
at the end of Q2. I mean, maybe remind us where you are. I'm struggling to see the
beneﬁt so far of what you've done given we've had another quarter now impacted by
large losses. So, is there now more beneﬁt because of where you are? Is there a
consideration that maybe you still need to think again about how much you buy? Just
remind us that if there is a beneﬁt, what it is? And what your results would look like
without that?
And then the second question is just following up. It sounds like then there was an
element of loss pick true-up in Global Corporate. I mean, that's unfortunate because we
saw that several times last year. Was it just on those lines you've identiﬁed; med mal in
Spain, ﬁnancial lines in Europe? There was no true-up in commercial auto? And what was
the impact of that true-up on the loss ratio in Global Corporate? Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So, on the reinsurance side of things, I mean, just to recap the changes that we made to
reinsurance at the end of last year. The two most signiﬁcant things we've done is, we have
an annual aggregate in place across the entire group to cover large loss. And we also
have a number of quota share programs in place, in particular one that covers North
American corporate business. I mean, we have had beneﬁts from some of the quota share
that we've put in place. Doesn't change the ratios, but it certainly has impacted some of
the individual line-size exposures that we would have had, had we gone without it.
On the large loss side, I mean, the challenge in the large loss side is that the second
quarter was relatively strong from a large loss perspective. So, that means we haven't
attached that contract. From what we would see through the end of the year, I still would
not expect us to attach the contract, and it would require a really poor quarter for that to
be the case. So, at this stage – I mean, I'll repeat something I think I said earlier in the year.
Page 9 of 22



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2016-11-10

We think that steps that we've taken from an underwriting perspective will address the
large loss issue and, in fact, have to some degree already this year. I wouldn't want to
hope for a large loss experience in Q4 that would be signiﬁcant enough to attach the
reinsurance program. I think there, our underwriting should take care of it.

FINAL

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

And then no other earn through beneﬁts from the insurance program to date?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Well, I mean, other than the various programs we've put in place, not just across property
in North America, but against various sub-lines in the book, where we have had beneﬁts,
the annual aggregate itself hasn't delivered beneﬁts because we have a much better
performance on large loss.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

On the loss pick true-ups, I only highlighted that to explain the level of combined ratio for
Global Corporate for the quarter. I mean, I don't think it's particularly signiﬁcant in the
scheme of the group. And of course, I haven't highlighted the loss pick adjustments in
other lines that would have gone in the opposite direction. I was really trying to pick out
what the challenges were for Global Corporate.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

And just to conﬁrm on commercial auto, which obviously was the big true-up last year,
that you haven't had to true that up this year?

A - George Quinn

Global Corporate and the construction liability line, that was a source of the Q3 problem,

We have a question from Mr. Paul De'Ath from RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Yeah. Hi there. A couple of questions, please, and I'll move slightly away from the
standard lines of the P&C business. Firstly, just on Farmers, looking at the underwriting
performance there is still obviously struggling slightly in motor, how do you see that
Page 10 of 22



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2016-11-10

impacting the growth trajectory of the top line in Farmers and, obviously, therefore, the
impact on FMS?

FINAL

And then secondly, just thinking about the political changes in the U.S., have you had any
change of heart at all, in terms of your hedging of cash ﬂows in order to pay the dividend,
given that there might potentially more volatility going on in the near future? Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, especially for the second question. On the Farmers side of things, as you
can see from the quarter, I mean, Farmers is – it's on the same track that you've seen
earlier in the year. The Exchanges are still trying to address the proﬁtability of the motor
line. And the steps that they take to do that, which will be around pushing rate, of course,
will generate more fees for us, because of our relationship with the Exchange. So, I mean,
we see the necessary steps that the Exchange is taking to address the underperformance
in auto is actually beneﬁcial for Zurich and Zurich's relationship with the Exchange.

Bloomberg Transcript

From a growth perspective, I think if you look at the quarter, the in-force dipped slightly. I
think that the – obviously, there's a limit to how far you can push some of these rate topics
without having any impact on policy count. But the Farmer is – the Exchanges have had to
manage that balance and I think they've done that very eﬀectively. But I guess the key
point here is we expect to see the Exchange to take more rates and that will drive more
fee income.
On the political changes, in general, I've got to stay away from that topic. From a
corporate ﬁnance perspective for us, I mean, obviously, we pay attention to currency
moves. I don't see anything either recently or currently in the outlook that would cause us
to change our view of how we should approach and how we deal with some of the
foreign currency basket issues that we face as a group. In general, I think it's much better
for investors if we take a very longer-term view and allow some of the corporate currency
volatility to balance out. Of course, if the situations became more extreme, then we would
have a look at it. But I mean, as of today – I mean, I was looking at the cross rates, I note
today that the dollar is stronger against the Swiss franc than it was on Monday. But more
than that, I've nothing to say on the political topic for the time being.

coming back on the top line, but looking slightly longer term, this time into 2017. And if I
kind of square up what you're saying about the competitive market and that you're
perhaps running slightly behind on the underlying (27:46) loss ratio improvements, is

there actually any chance that you could grow your top line next year or shall we sort of
write that oﬀ?

And the second question is on the competitive environment in the UK and Germany,
commercial lines. Could you just give a bit more color on that please, because you've
made a few remarks about that in your comments? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Sami. So, the top line, I think from a – I mean, if I take a longer-term view, once
we've completed re-underwriting, we will grow at rates similar to the market GDP rates in
the markets where we operate. We don't have an imperative to need to grow. We're not
trying to achieve a particular expense ratio outcome. We're far more focused on expense
levels from an absolute perspective. So, it's really market conditions that will determine
whether or not the company ﬁnds business that's suﬃciently attractive to grow next year.
Having said all of that, I think today, as I look at things, given the market conditions, and
given the market competitiveness and some of the re-underwriting that we still have to
do, I don't expect us to grow. I don't expect us to shrink at the rate we have this year, but I
don't expect us to grow next year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Competitive environment, UK and Germany. Maybe I would pick out the UK as slightly
more competitive than Germany given the price and rate trends that we see. In general,
UK is quite closer to the U.S. in terms of current market trends. Germany, we still see as a
market where certainly if we select the portfolio correctly, I think we can generate
attractive returns and drive some margin improvement through the portfolio.

We have a question from Mr. Michael Huttner from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thank you very much. I have two questions on the PYD. I think it was Q1 or maybe Q2, one
of a very astute competitors highlighted that there was a diﬀerence between the region
average of PYD of run-oﬀ proﬁt and what you showed at the group level. And I think
you've got the same in Q3, is that right? And just wondered, are you eﬀectively adding
more to reserves and is this a voluntary thing or is this is a required thing? I'm guessing
2.9% (30:20) is a country or the region run-oﬀ proﬁt and 1.8% (30:23) was at group level.
And then on the – you gave this 97%-98% range, and I really thank you for that for Q4. I
ﬁnd it very comforting. But given that you were maybe not quite so conﬁdent, but you still
expressed a range for the full year and now you'll be a little bit above that. Where's your
conﬁdence coming from Q4? I think Andrew Ritchie kind of made – in your answer, you
made the point it wasn't from the aggregate loss ratio – loss cover. I just wondered, is

there a moving part we're not seeing or are we kind of out of the season for large losses? I
just want to understand a little bit your thinking here. Thank you.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Michael. So, on the ﬁrst one. We highlighted both, Q1 and in Q2 that there
was a diﬀerence between, let's call it, the regionally reported PYD and the group PYD,
because we made a choice to take a more prudent view from an overall group
perspective. I said at the end of Q2 that we would look to try and make sure that we push
that down into the businesses. We've done more of that in Q3, but we haven't completely
eliminated it. So, the group again has taken a slightly more prudent view than the average
of the positions presented by the geographic regions. Over time, though, I expect to
eliminate that diﬀerence and to the extent that the group has a view for that to be
recognized locally.
I think I've said explicitly before that one of the things we would like to do over time, one
is demonstrate consistency around PYD over a longer period than simply the three
quarters we've seen this year. So, that's something we would continue to focus on
through Q4, Q1 and throughout the course of 2017. And at the same time to the extent
that the local environment permits me, to be more prudent overall from a reserve
perspective.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

And that's about $300 million year-to-date, this diﬀerence?

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Yeah. Very nice.

A - George Quinn

conﬁdent at Q2, and I...

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

It's not kindness. You're doing a really tough job. It's not kindness. I appreciate what you
do. Sorry, I mustn't (32:54) interrupt, but no, what you do is really hard. So, it's not
kindness it's just recognition.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So, my conﬁdence about our ability to achieve 97% to 98% hasn't changed. I guess what's
happened is that the past hasn't been as linear as I guess I would have hoped. I mean, we
are doing the things that we have indicated to take some of the volatility out of the
system. It will not remove all of it, though. So, I can't make a cash bank (33:22)

commitment that in any given quarter we'll achieve a particular outcome. But if I look at
the drivers of our underlying performance, I look at the action that we've taken and I look
at particularly the impact that that would have had in Q3 had we had that in-force for the
entire book, I'm happy with the trends that we see.
We are going to get there, but we will be subject to some volatility even when we've
completely re-underwritten the book, whether that's by the end of this year or the end of
next year. But the underlying position is the thing that's most important for me. I can see
the improvement and that will show up in the ﬁnancial performance.

The next question comes from Mr. Nick Holmes from Société Générale. Please go ahead.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Hi there. Thank you very much. A couple of questions. The ﬁrst is on the U.S. business. Do
you think the recent rise in bonds yields is going to put more pressure on U.S. commercial
pricing? And kind of can you give us your thoughts on the outlook for pricing, because
obviously it has been under pressure this year, but it's performed I think a bit better than
most people thought?
Second is on the Z-ECM ratio, wondered if you could update us on your capital policy
here. I mean, the ratio is looking stronger. And I wondered what the surplus capital
position is that you see within the group, if any? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thank you, Nick. So, on the U.S., in fact, I was asked a similar question on CNBC this
morning. I think if you look at all the markets, the U.S. is the only one that stands out with a
relatively modest rise in bond yields. It retraced that partly yesterday. I think it would be a
mistake certainly for us, and my view is for the market in general, to start to assume that
there's an upward track in bond yields and somehow we can anticipate that from a pricing
perspective.
And the point I made this morning was that I think everyone needs to continue to focus
on adapting to this relatively low yield environment. And if something else comes, I mean

that'll be good. We'll enjoy that when it appears. I don't think the bond yield topic – it
certainly, from my perspective, hasn't really had enough time to impact the pricing
environment. Pricing in the U.S., a very competitive market, lots of well-capitalized
competitors, everyone trying to make sure they hang on to the parts of the portfolio that
they like and competing for when things do emerge into the marketplace.
So, even though the trend is not as negative from a pricing perspective as it was last year,
I think still the best you can say is that the – maybe we're approaching a bottom if you look
at the trend, but the incremental is still slightly negative market wise. Z-ECR...

Q - Nick Holmes

Sorry, George. So, you would expect pricing to start to stabilize next year? Is that what
you're saying?

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I don't really want to get into the position where I'm trying to call a turn in the market. I
mean, the stance that we're trying to take is that if you look at current trends, both from
the ﬁnancial market perspective and from a pricing and loss cost perspective, you should
typically assume that those continue, because that market turn is something that's
generally out of your control.

Z-ECM ratio and capital generally, so all I can really say there is that we feel very
comfortable with our overall capitalization. As you point out, the Z-ECM ratio is slightly
above the midpoint. But that hasn't triggered some reconsideration by us of whether
there's a signiﬁcant element of excess capital that we'd like to try and think (37:47)
something alternatively to do with it. I mean, our focus is around the operational

current capitalization and wouldn't necessarily look to change it.

We have a question from Mr. James Shuck from UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hi, George. Good afternoon. I have three questions, please. Firstly could you just
comment on the German Life business? Just interested to know whether the low interest
rate environment will start leading to progressive DAC write-downs in the fourth quarter
and beyond? That's my ﬁrst question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, could you just update on the progress with distributing surplus capital from the
U.S.? I think there are plans to distribute that capital. I'm just wondering whether you've
actually progressed at all and over what timeframe you might expect to see that be
distributed.
And then ﬁnally, just a more conceptual one and obviously you've changed your book of
business a fair amount in pruning and re-underwriting, et cetera. By implication, do you
have a fair amount of legacy business that you may or may not want to keep. Just
interested to know about the Rhode Island Legislation and whether that could potentially
lead you to take a good hard look at some of your closed book or run-oﬀ businesses with
a view (39:15) to freeing up capital from them? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, James. So, on the German Life business, if I look carefully at the guarantees,
I look at the running yield that we have in the book, I look at the beneﬁt that we have from
the unrealized gain position, I don't see anything there that would suggest that we're at
any signiﬁcant risk, near medium term of a DAC write-down. I think what you do see in the
German business is that, as we've said before, you will see pressure from ZZR.
That will start during the course of next year with kind of a mid-double-digit million-dollar
impact on Life earnings. It will increase and over the course of at least our planning
horizon, I mean, we expect to see a total ZZR impact of about $400 million, which we
would be between roughly 2017 and 2021, but not seeing anything on the DAC side that
would suggest a write-down.
On the U.S. capital, I think probably the best way I can answer that question is to say that, I
think as you know, our cash planning for the year was partly dependent on a successful
outcome from that discussion. I see nothing that would cause me to change my view of
what we expect to deliver on cash, which would mean that we'll meet the more than $10

FINAL

billion of net cash remittance that we guided to. And in particular for this year, we'll
achieve at least the cash covered dividend, assuming the dividend is unchanged.
On the Rhode Island topic, so it's something we've been looking at both this year and last
year. Conceivably, it oﬀers the possibility that you can achieve, I guess, what for a UK
individual would be Part VII-type outcome. The legislation is of interest to us. It takes some
preparation of the books of business that it may be applicable to before they'd be ready
to potentially be transacted on. And of course, there aren't many people who really have
experience of buying under this regime yet.
It's certainly something that we're looking at very carefully and it oﬀers, certainly from a
Zurich perspective, a more attractive outcome, potentially because of the ﬁnality that it
really oﬀers in comparison to the economic ﬁnality that a reassurance solution would
typically oﬀer. So, Rhode Island is something that we are looking at.

The next question is from Mr. Thomas Seidl from Sanford C. Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon. First question is on page 18 where you show the running
yields by asset class, focused on debt. I mean, you look back to 2015, you showed
basically reinvestment rate 2%. This year, reinvestment rates dropping to 1.7%. Yet,
running yields have been rising over the same time horizon from 2.4% to 2.7%. So, you
frequently mentioned on the inﬂation-linked bond in LatAm. Is that the only explanation
or what else is going on? Because otherwise, mechanically, the regular yield on the ﬁxed
income portfolio must come down with this type of reinvestment rate. That's the ﬁrst
question.
And the second is then, you talked about the consistency on reserves. Now, when I look at
the segmental reserve disclosure on page 10, the last three years, 2013 to 2015, you had
basically zero reserve releases from Global Corporate and NAC. Yet, this year these two
segments are the strong deliverers. And I wonder why you ﬁnd now the reserve buﬀer in
those two segments which caused problems in previous years?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So, Thomas, on the ﬁrst one, on the running yield, you and I discussed this already on the
Q2 call. The answer would be broadly the same. And in fact, I would agree with your
hypotheses that the running yield must come down. There's no way to avoid this. The only
way that you could avoid it would be if you chose to take more risk and that's not
something that we intend to do.

A - George Quinn

FINAL

For the same two reasons I gave you at Q2, so LatAm and the inﬂation impact and the
impact of foreign exchange. That's it.
On reserving, you talked about the consistency of reserving, I guess when we talked
about consistency, I wasn't trying to imply that if it was consistently negative, we would
continue that into the future. We've made some adjustments to reserving for, in particular,
Global Corporate and NAC and those two topics we discussed last year. That's obviously
moved reserve position overall to a diﬀerent place. And other than that, we're happy with
the reserve position that we have across the entire group. I would expect over time – not
everyone, equally, in every single quarter, but over time that all of the diﬀerent businesses
contribute to positive PYD. And if you look at the numbers we have this quarter, that's
exactly what you see.

Q - Thomas Seidl

We have a question from Mr. Andy Hughes from Macquarie. Please go ahead.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Hey, guys. A couple of questions, if I could. The ﬁrst one is on slide 7 and the retention by
tier. Just looking at the Tier 4 and comparing that to the half year. So for the half year, 62%
retention, and then you've got 60% retention for the nine months, and I thought quite a
lot of this stuﬀ renewed in the ﬁrst quarter. So, has there been a material change in the
Tier 4 retentions versus what you had seen in the ﬁrst half of the year, in the third quarter?
And I guess, the second question is on Global Corporate and the comments you made
before about the rate change. I can see the kind of Global Corporate sort of (45:33) rate

FINAL

change has dropped to zero from 1% in the previous quarter. But I'm just wondering is
there any way we can adjust this for the impact you've discussed for the beneﬁt of
reinsurance, because obviously these are gross premium numbers? So, what would be
kind of a more recent – because obviously, when I look at slide 23, it's hard to see how the
kind of combined ratio is going to improve, given that the rate changes coming through is
quite low. I'm just wondering if we can kind of adjust this somehow for the reinsurance
that you've put in place, that you discussed earlier.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. So, thanks, Andy. So, on the Tier 4 topic, if you look at the size of Tier 4, it's
slightly larger at the beginning of the year than it is in the remainder of the year. But I
mean we have a continual renewal, which means there is a signiﬁcant Tier 4 element in
pretty much every single quarter. And I think what you're seeing in Global Corporate,
essentially, is the – I mean, the relatively competitive market I guess everybody recognizes
they're operating in. And therefore, it's – as they push for the rates that we're trying to
achieve – or at least, as they're trying to push for a margin improvement that would
outperform the market generally, that's had some negative impacts on retention. But I
don't see a dramatic shift in the retention dynamics between Q1, Q2 or Q3.
Global Corporate rate change and the impact, you described it as the beneﬁt of
reinsurance. Actually, going back to Andrew Ritchie's question earlier, because we're not
attaching the annual aggregate, I would estimate that the impact of reinsurance on Global
Corporate would be slightly negative rather than positive currently. Obviously, if we're not
recovering under one of the key contracts, that will have some negative impact on them. I
don't think it's particularly signiﬁcant, but I wouldn't quantify the impact of reinsurance
through the nine months as necessarily a positive for Global Corporate.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

I was thinking more of the $300 million to $400 million property reinsurance you talked
about, rather than the aggregate one on the property book, which obviously would – on a
gross written premium basis would obviously deﬂate the numbers.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. I guess, it deﬂates and slightly distorts the numbers and there'll be a seeding
commission. But I guess the margin change from that will be really, really small. I wouldn't
expect that that would change the overall combined ratio in any signiﬁcant direction. That
will change dynamics between the OUE ratio and the acquisition cost ratio. Essentially, it
just brings the entire book down slightly, reduces the overall contribution of it to the
overall performance. But I don't think it would be particularly material.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Okay. Is there an obvious way I'm missing as to why this business kind of is going to
improve with a very low rate change? I mean, is it really a beneﬁt of the mix we haven't
seen so far that will start to come through next year?

The next question is from Callum Tanner from InsuranceERM. Please go ahead.

Q - Callum Tanner
Hello. Thanks very much. I just have two questions, if I may. One is on the life beneﬁt from
the assumption changes on persistency. I wondered how long you look at in terms of data
or periods to change that, whether it's just the last – the previous three months before
Q3? I'm talking about the $30 million beneﬁt on that assumption.
And then the second one, just on the point of reinvestment versus running yields point
that was made earlier, you said that the foreign exchange in LatAm was the reason. I just
wondered if there was any increase in illiquid credit and whether that was part to do with
the reason for the improvement in income as well? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Calvin (sic) [Callum] (49:40). So, on the ﬁrst one, I mean, typically, when you're
looking at experience updates, you look at – you split the portfolio into cohorts, and you
look at the cohort back to inception. So, the periods over which you review it will vary. It'd
be very unusual that anything would be as short as, say, the last three months. You're
typically looking at one, two, three or even more years of experience before you make a
decision on whether you move persistency.
On the yield side of things, so I mean the yield that we have in there for ﬁxed income is
typically the market instrument-based one. So when we calculate that, we exclude, I
guess, things like mortgages and loans, which typically are the less liquid ends of the
calculation. So, I wouldn't expect that to have an impact on that.

Q - Callum Tanner
Yeah. So, there has not been an increase in illiquid credit investments in the quarter?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So, I'm not aware of a signiﬁcant shift into illiquids in the quarter.

Your next question comes from Mr. Ralph Hebgen from KBW. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. Ralph Hebgen from KBW. Just going back to the Global Corporate line, I mean I
know we've discussed this at some length. It just looks as if the accident year loss ratio in
the 3Q injects quite a material element of volatility into how these things run from quarter
to quarter. So George, last quarter, you gave us quite a helpful sort of commentary
around large losses and where the large loss experience you had ran relative to your
expectations on (51:32) your budgets. In 2Q 2016 there was a positive element. I was just
wondering whether you could give us a similar commentary, perhaps, at group level and
also speciﬁcally focusing on Global Corporate. So, that's the ﬁrst one.

Bloomberg Transcript

And the second one is coming back to what Andrew was talking about. I do wonder
whether – I may look at this too naively, but it looks also to me as if you're not seeing an
obvious beneﬁt from the excess of loss reinsurance program that you had. Are you
thinking – I mean, is it actually appropriate for you to think about, perhaps, lowering the
attachment point so that you would get a positive impact on the volatility, which is
arguably still present in the book?
And question number three is on life insurance. I saw, just at the high level, that's very
strong in the quarter in terms of business operating proﬁt. Are there any special drivers
behind that and where would you say your guidance is now running? You said it's like
$300 million to $350 million per quarter. Is that still what you're happy to repeat or is it at
the upper or lower level of that range? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Ralph. So, on the loss experienced in the quarter, I mean I've tried to avoid
getting to explaining how it would have been good if it hadn't been for the claims that
we've had in the quarter. Some volatility is going to be expected. I think – I mean, one of
the reasons I feel more conﬁdent this quarter compared to some of the experience that, I
guess, you guys shared with me last year, I think we have much better information as to
what we're changing, the impact of those changes on the book, and our ability to project
that forward. That's something that drives some of the conﬁdence around our expectation
of the improvement. And I guess Q3 is a reminder to all of us, in particular me, that it
won't necessarily be a linear process.
If you look at the loss experience from a large perspective, I'll cover it at group level. I
mean, if we adjust the actual experience for what we would have had, had we made all of
the changes, had it impacted the entire book, we would be better by 50 basis points to
100 basis points. But of course, the most important issue is we have to deliver it rather
than talk about it. But I mean, overall, I'm happy with the trend that I see in GI.
On the excess of loss or the annual aggregate contract, you're absolutely right, we so far
have had no beneﬁt from the contract. If I could write a contract that would allow me to
deﬁne the attachment points at the end of the year, I would absolutely choose that one.
Page 21 of 22



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2016-11-10

FINAL

But I guess we chose one based on the experience that we've had over the last several
years.
I mean, the aim wasn't to put something in place that we felt certain we would attach
during the course of the year. But it was designed to give us conﬁdence that if, for any
reason, we had a repeat of last year's experience, you and we wouldn't suﬀer the same
ﬁnancial impact. In the event, the year has turned out quite diﬀerent so far. We've made
more progress more quickly. And in particular, we beneﬁted in Q2 from a relatively light
quarter from large losses.
So that, today, would leave me to expect – as I said, I think, in response to Andy's question
earlier that the impact of the reinsurance will be negative. We will review the entire
program and look at whether there are ways in which we should adapt or change it to
make it more eﬀective. I mean, we put the contract in place for a particular reason. That
particular reason hasn't emerged in the year to date, and I think that's actually good news
rather than the bad news.
On life insurance, I think the only thing I would highlight for you in terms of one-oﬀ, in
response to I think Calvin's (sic) [Callum's] (55:35) question, was about the impact of the
