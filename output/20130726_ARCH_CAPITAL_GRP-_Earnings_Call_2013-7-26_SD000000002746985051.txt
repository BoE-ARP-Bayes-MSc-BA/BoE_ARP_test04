{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Thank you, Glen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had a
good Second Quarter from just about every perspective, with the exception of unrealized
losses in our investment portfolio due to the rising investment yields.

Bloomberg Transcript

Earnings were solid and our cat claim activity was modest relative to the significant level of
industry losses experienced this quarter. Across the group our premium revenue was
essentially flat in the quarter, although there was a lot of movement in the pieces that will
get to in a few minutes.
On an operating basis, we earned $0.99, which produced an annualized return on equity
of 10.9% for the quarter. On a net income basis, we earned $1.26 per share which
corresponds to a 13.8% annualized return on equity. For reasons that I mentioned on our
last call, which I won't repeat again, ROE based on net income was again significantly
better than ROE on an operating income basis.
Our reported underwriting results in the Second Quarter were excellent, as reflected by a
combined ratio of 87.4. They were aided by better-than-average performance on our cat
underwriting along with continued favorable reserve development on the rest of our book
of business.
Net investment income was $0.50 per share and essentially was flat on a sequential basis.
Our operating cash flow for the quarter was $183 million, a $70 million decrease from the
same period last year, due substantially to higher paid losses on prior-year cats including
Sandy.
Our investment performance suffered this quarter due to a significant rise in rates and
widening of credit spreads. Of course, in the last two weeks credit spreads have come
back, but as of the end of the quarter we did suffer a bit. As a result, our book value per
common share decreased by 2.3% to $36.80, while it increased by 6.8% relative to the
Second Quarter of a year ago.

FINAL

The insurance market continues on its path of recovery with rates continuing to rise at
roughly the same level as in the First Quarter. In our insurance operations, which gives us a
good indication because we have more granular data, we experienced rate increases in
the quarter that, based on our estimations, provided approximately 150 basis points or
expected margin improvement. This is on an underwriting year basis.
Rate changes in the US range from a negative 300 basis points to as high as a positive
1,100 points. But I would like to emphasize that most lines average a positive 500 to 1,100
basis points improvement.
The movement of business from the admitted market back to the E&S market continues.
Last quarter we mentioned our expansion into the binding authority insurance business
that caters to small, smaller E&S accounts written through the wholesale distribution
channels.
The group -- this particular group is off to a great start. They are producing an increasing
level of business and have begun to leverage Arch's distribution platform to access more
opportunities. We expect them to contribute more meaningfully to our operations going
forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

In our view, on an absolute basis, while most long-tail casual business still requires rate
improvement to meet our return requirements, some segments, to our encouragement,
are approaching rate adequacy within that block of business.
With regards to new versus renewal pricing, based on our monitoring systems we saw no
change on a relative basis from the indications that we shared with you in our last
conference call a quarter ago. On the reinsurance side of the business, terms and
conditions are generally stable, although as the profitability of the primary insurers and
our customers has improved clients have, at times, pressed successfully for additional
seating commissions. Generally, 1 to 2 points is the additional seating commission that
they gain on coder share [ph] transactions.
On a consolidated basis, in the Second Quarter of 2013 gross written premiums were
down 1.1% and net written premiums were down 1.2% year over year. Net written
premiums of the reinsurance segment were reduced by 13.1%, while the insurance
segment grew their net written premiums by 8%.
The reductions in the reinsurance segment stem from property cat lines, other specialty,
and mortgage businesses. The lower level of property cat net premiums written relative
to the Second Quarter of 2012 was due to the rate reductions, as well as to a decreasing
capacity deployed and an increased use of retrocessions.
The insurance segment had a net written premium growth predominantly emanating from
their US operations, which represented approximately -- which represents approximately
75% of the worldwide volume this quarter. The US operations grew net written premium
by nearly 18%, partially offsetting strategic reductions elsewhere in the world. The US
growth came predominantly from our program business, national accounts, and our new
Page 3 of 23



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2013-07-26

contract binding business, as well as construction and a continued reduction in casualty
lines, even though they are getting closer to meeting our return characteristics.

FINAL

Construction and national account business had continued rate increases, very strong
renewal retentions, strong new business generation, and we experienced ratable
exposure growth in those sectors.
Group-wide, on an expected basis, we continue to believe the ROE on the business we
wrote this year will produce an underwriting year ROE in the range of 11% to 13%. The
underwriting margin improvement that I mentioned earlier will influence expected ROE
positively, while the recent improvement in investment yields did not have a significant
impact on expected ROEs as of yet.
Before I turn it over to Mark, let me update you on the status of our previously announced
agreement to purchase assets of PMI and CMG. On June 20 the Arizona receivership
court approved the transaction. We are now working to obtain the necessary regulatory
and other approvals required to complete the transaction.

Bloomberg Transcript

As part of that process, we are continuing our discussions with the GSEs in order to obtain
their approval of Arch as an eligible mortgage insurance carrier. If those approvals are
obtained, it is estimated that the transaction will close during the end of this year.
It is worth noting that our cat PML aggregates reflect business bound through July 1, while
the premium numbers included in our financial statements are through June 30. So when
you make the comparison you have to bear that in mind. As of July 1, 2013, our largest
250-year PMLs for a single event declined moderately to $858 million in the Northeast or - and it represents approximately 17.5% of common shareholders' equity. And $746 million
in the Gulf where our Florida Tri-County PML now stands at $606 million.
Now I am going to turn it over to Mark to comment further on our financial results and
then we will come back and take your questions. Mark?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Great. Thank you, Dinos. Good morning all. Consolidated combined ratio for this quarter
was 87.4% with 4.8 points of current accident year cat-related events, net of reinsurance
and reinstatement premiums compared to the 2012 Second Quarter combined ratio of
87.2%, which reflected only 1 point of cat-related events. Losses from 2013 Second
Quarter catastrophic events net of reinsurance, recoverable, and reinstatement premiums
totaled $36.3 million, primarily emanating from the Moore, Oklahoma, tornado and
flooding events in Europe and Canada.
The 2013 Second Quarter consolidated combined ratio also reflected 9.1 points of prioryear net favorable development, net of reinsurance and related acquisition expenses,
compared to 8.6 points of prior period favorable development on the same basis in the
2012 Second Quarter. This results in a 91.7% current accident quarter combined ratio

FINAL

excluding cats for the Second Quarter of 2013 compared to a 94.7% accident quarter
combined ratio on a like basis in the Second Quarter of 2012.
2013 accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats, for the reinsurance segment was
81.2% compared to 81.5% in the 2012 Second Quarter. In the insurance segment, the 2013
accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats, was 98.6% compared to an accident
quarter combined ratio of 103% even a year ago. The corresponding 2012 insurance
segment accident quarter combined ratio, however, reflected a higher level of large
attritional loss activity of roughly 2.5 combined ratio points. Approximately 80% of the net
favorable development in the 2013 Second Quarter was from the reinsurance segment,
with approximately 43% of that due to net favorable development on short-tailed lines
concentrated in more recent underwriting years.
Furthermore, roughly 6% of the reinsurance segment's net favorable development was
attributable to medium-tailed lines spaced throughout many underwriting years and about
51% due to net favorable development on longer-tailed lines, primarily in the 2002
through 2006 underwriting years. The remaining 20% of net favorable development in
this quarter was attributable to the insurance segment and was primarily driven by shorttailed lines in the more recent accident years and medium-tailed lines across various
accident years.

Bloomberg Transcript

Similarly to prior periods, approximately 69% of our consolidated $7 billion of total net
reserves or losses in LAE are categorized as IBNR or additional case reserves, which is
fairly consistent across both reinsurance and insurance segments.
On a consolidated basis, the Second Quarter of 2013 expense ratio was identical to the
prior year's comparative quarter with a marginally lower net acquisition ratio offset by a
marginally higher operating expense ratio. The marginal increase in the operating
expense ratio reflects incremental expense due to certain platform expansions in both
our reinsurance and insurance businesses and higher equity expense charges than in the
Second Quarter of 2012.
Our US insurance operations achieved a positive 4.2% effective rate increase this quarter,
which translates, as Dinos denoted, to a margin expansion of 150 basis points over the
Second Quarter of 2012. This average range is from having margin contraction in some
units, such as healthcare and professional liability, up to a positive 890 basis point
improvement in our energy casualty operation.
Other areas of note in margin expansion were the executive assurance middle market,
E&S casualty, and program businesses. These figures represent the excess of written
effective rate increases over estimated loss trend and provide continuing evidence of
improving market conditions. Property lines experienced a low single-digit rate increase
this quarter and, therefore, did not experience additional margin expansion.
It is also important to understand that many insurance segment lines of business have
experienced effective rate increases over an impressive amount of serial quarters. For
example, although it is likely no surprise that wholesale and retail insurance property lines
Page 5 of 23

Date: 2013-07-26

FINAL

have seen eight to nine consecutive quarters of rate increases, it may not be apparent
that other lines of business have experience comparable results.
Our specialty casualty, national accounts, workers' compensation businesses have
experienced nine successive quarters of rate increases, whereas our executive assurance
middle market and alternative asset protection books, along with our retail construction
unit, have experienced eight consecutive quarters of rate increases. Lastly, our excess
workers' compensation and umbrella books have enjoyed seven consecutive quarters of
increases.
As always, we make capital allocation decisions based on our view of the absolute returns
and not relative improvement to loan. For example, although our insurance property
businesses did not experience margin expansion this quarter, we continue to estimate
healthy returns for this line.

Bloomberg Transcript

The ratio of net premium to gross premium in the quarter on a consolidated basis was
77.9% versus 78% even a year ago. In the reinsurance segment the net-to-gross ratio was
91.5% in 2013's Second Quarter compared to 94.3% a year ago, reflecting more retro
purchases protecting their property book. The insurance segment had a 71.3% net-togross ratio compared to 68.7% a year ago as a result of their ongoing strategy to grow
the less volatile smaller account businesses and reduce exposure in higher severity
businesses.
The total return on our investment portfolio was a reported negative 159 bps in the 2013
Second Quarter, primarily reflecting mark-to-market adjustments on fixed income
securities. Excluding foreign exchange, total return was a negative 156 bps in this quarter.
This quarter's unrealized losses of approximately $260 million overshadowed realized
gains of $12.7 million, so the following commentary will focus on the unrealized. This
quarter's unrealized loss of approximately $260 million is almost entirely due to changes
in fixed income security valuations driven by the rising interest rate environment and
widening credit spreads, particularly in corporates and mortgages.
This unrealized loss for the quarter represents 2.5% of the March 31, 2013, fixed income
asset fair value. This percentage reduction ranged from a low of minus 1.3% for assetbacked securities to minus 3.4% for corporate bonds, although much of the portfolio
clustered near minus 2.5%.
It is worth noting that equities and alternative investments now account for 14.9% of
investable assets as of June 30, 2013, versus 12.9% a quarter ago and 9.6% a year ago as
of June 30, 2012. This allocation on a portfolio basis has the potential to ameliorate future
impacts on fixed income securities from rising interest rates and widening credit spreads.
Our embedded pretax book yield before expenses was 2.43% as of June 30 compared
to 2.45% at March 31, 2013, while the duration of the portfolio lengthened slightly to 3.04
years, which continues to reflect our conservative position on duration in the current yield

environment. Our exposure to Eurozone countries as listed in the supplement with
continued minimal exposure to countries undergoing severe economic hardship.

FINAL

Reported net investment income in the quarter was $68.4 million, or $0.50 per share,
versus $65.7 million in the 2013 First Quarter, or $0.48 per share, and $73.6 million, or
$0.53 a share, in the comparable quarter a year ago.
Our effective tax rate on pretax operating income for the Second Quarter of 2013 was an
expense of 3.3% compared to a benefit of 0.3% in the Second Quarter of last year.
Approximately 90 basis points, or $1.3 million, of the Second Quarter tax expense is
associated with catch up of the First Quarter to this higher effective rate. Fluctuations in
the effective tax rate can result from variability in the relative mix of income or loss
reported by jurisdiction, along with forecast variances for the last six months of the 2013
year.
Our total capital was $5.63 billion at the end of this quarter, down 1.8% relative to March 31
and up 1.1% relative to year-end 2012. During this quarter we repurchased $15.5 million of
our common stock at an average 1.33x multiple to March 31, 2013, book value, which had a
$0.03 impact on book value per share.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our debt-to-capital ratio remains low at 7.1% as debt plus hybrids represent only 12.9% of
our total capital structure, which continues to give us significant financial flexibility. We also
continue to estimate having excess capital in excess of our targeted capital position.
Book value per share was $36.80 at June 30, as Dinos denoted, which still represents a
6.8% increase relative to one year ago at June 30, 2012. This change in book value this
quarter primarily reflects the Company's continued strong underwriting results offset by
the negative impact of rising interest rates and widening credit spreads on fixed income
securities.
With these introductory comments, we are now pleased to take your questions.

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks and good morning. Two brief questions. First of all, just going back to the data
points on pricing and new business on the insurance side, those were very helpful. I was
wondering if you could also broadly talk about the impact of exposure on those lines,
maybe just on some of your larger lines. If you were seeing any meaningful impact on that
side too.

FINAL

Exposure is customer by customer. Some customers their business starting to show some
growth and we have seen some improvements, but it is not across the board. There is still
a lot of customers that from an exposure point of view where the economy is suffering.
We are not seeing increase payrolls or increase sales, etc.
But when we do our rate calculations, they are all exposure-based rate calculations and
comparisons. But if your question is where the economy is going and if there is a lot more
buying of our products, the answer is no. It is incrementally better than a year ago, but this
economy is not moving at a high degree of new exposures.
And the customers, we haven't -- sometimes you can get them to purchase either
additional layers or additional limits and we don't see that either. They are pretty
conservative in that purchase.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

I didn't phrase that question properly. I guess what I was trying to ask is that if rates are, as
you said, are approaching adequacy do you feel that exposure growth will still result in a
positive sequential trend line? I guess that is what I was trying to ask and I think in some
ways you did answer the question.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well from a rate point of view, the more business that you get close to adequacy to
maintain the same ROE performance. Then from that point on you don't need
extraordinary rate increases, you need rate increases that will cover loss cause
escalations. So as long as we are covering trend or we are ahead of trend, then we are
very happy to write the business and continue to renew it.
In prior calls we talk about we have green lights, yellow lights, and red lights depending on
the products that we put in the marketplace. We are seeing very few reds and more
getting into yellow, that means writing with caution, and more getting into green, which
will allow our divisions to grow that business.
Mark, you want anything to add to it?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Dinos. Just a potential clarification, in the insurance group -- in the US it is
75% of the insurance group where we have all the detail. You kind of think of the
aggregate rate versus premium growth this way in the US.
Rate was roughly 4.5%. It might be, to Dinos' point, a marginal increase in exposure on
same-store accounts. Maybe 4% to 5% of that growth is new business, which is new
aggregate exposure but not growth in exposure within the existing accounts. Then the
balance, because you are looking at net written premium, you have to take into account
the change in the net to gross, which bumps up the increase in the change in net written.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Then you got to deduct the business that you have lost to get to your aggregate
exposure.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

FINAL

So you did answer my question. Sorry, I did not phrase it properly.
The only other question I had was your discussion on excess capital. On another call
earlier today we were talking about third-party capital, new capital, whatever you want to
call it. Perhaps looking at other avenues including cash realty reinsurance risk versus
traditional prop cat, I am curious A) what is your view on that and B) would Arch be
interested in something like that potentially down the road? Thanks.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

First, my views are that capital formation will take different kinds of forms. It is more
difficult from a buyer's perspective, a customer perspective to create those structures on
the casualty line, because in casualty lines, due to the long nature of the tail, it requires
more of a permanent capital. It is not capital that you can put in towards a period of time
that is in need and then withdraw it when there is other ample capacity.

Bloomberg Transcript

So my view is eventually some of these structures, even in casualty, they will be created
but it will have more permanency to the capital. And don't forget, in the casualty area you
need to have significant underwriting capability for the model to work.
So as a company we are interested in those structures. We had over the years many
different discussions with different parties, and if we find the right structure that it benefits
our shareholders we will do it. But that is basically what we are.

Q - Amit Kumar

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Thanks. Maybe a follow-up on Amit's question and I may be nitpicking here. Dinos, in the
prepared remarks I believe you cited primary insurance pricing trending in excess of loss
costs by 150 basis points.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

I wrote down last quarter that you said it was trending in excess of loss costs by 300 basis
points.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

FINAL

That is also correct.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. So is the climate being driven by new entrants into the E&S marketplace? Or maybe
you can comment on why that has changed.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

No. I think -- as Mark said, and I will turn it over to him, you are not going to get
consecutive -- you are not going to get rate increases escalating by 8%, 10% forever. So
at some point in time you will see that -- the market works in peculiar ways.

Bloomberg Transcript

When certain lines of business they get to rate adequacy, to us rate adequacy is to
produce 15% ROE. Once you get there, as I said, the only thing you need is you try to
make sure that you are getting enough rate to cover the loss trend because loss trend
will escalate. And as long as you are above it you have an improved environment.
So there is, I think, in the aggregate -- and, Mark, you know the numbers better than I do - we probably lost on average about 1 point. If we aggregate all of our businesses, the
rate increases we got in the First Quarter versus the rate increases we got in the Second
Quarter, there might have been 1 percentage point less in the Second Quarter. But it is still
an improvement because it is on top of what we got a year ago and two years ago.
When you look at it from that perspective the ROE on an underwriting year basis on that
business we write today will be a little bit better. And that is what we try to estimate, that
150 basis points. Mark?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

That is a great point. One of the reasons I talked about the serial changes for like eight or
nine quarters is you are at the right quarter, you are now approaching your third increase
which is why you are going to start to get to some of this adequacy. But a lot of this still
comes down to mix from one quarter to a different quarter.
We would have had more insurance property which flattened out a little bit more this
quarter, but, for example, we felt that more of the E&S casualty business had gone over
the goal line to 15%. That unit experienced 9.5% rate increases in the last quarter. Didn't
open that floodgate yet, but as Dinos said, it is starting to approach that.
We start contributing some of that business as it goes over the goal line you are going to
see the effect of rate changes increase because of the weighting impact of that unit.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay, that helps. Are you saying then, Dinos and Mark, that a lot of these lines have
reached the rate adequacy, meaning a 15% projected ROE?

FINAL

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

We didn't say all. As I said, we still have product lines in the yellow, which just means you
got to be selective and do it with caution.
To us a green light is a product line or a division that we believe the marketplace is
allowing them to underwrite to 15%. Still quite a bit of what we do is in that. As I said, I
gave that 11% to 13% ROE depending. And the reason we give a range is because we
don't know how the mix is going to come in, but that means there is still a lot of business
that is in there, high single-digit ROE and low double digits, in order to average 11% to
13%.
We have lines of business that are in the green, but we do have some in the red still and
we still have more and more in the yellow.

Got it. Lastly, on investment income, you guys have done a good job on the book yield
and on just overall investment levels. Do you expect the recent rise in new money yields
to be a material benefit on a perspective basis? Thanks.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Mark, do you want to --?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yes, I think to kick that off we view that the new money rates in this quarter compared
prior was about a 50 basis point move up. And that is beneficial. But the range Dinos
quoted, 11% to 13%, all it really does is change the placement within that range more than
anything else. So it depends on how sustained it turns out to be.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

We have been guarding against rising interest rates for a long time with keeping the
portfolio short in duration and also high credit quality. So in essence, we might take the
unrealized hit, but it will unwind itself within the duration of the portfolio pretty quickly.
So if rates move up it will be beneficial to us and I guess most of our competitors. It
depends what happens to the underwriting side of the business. Will the underwriting
then get adjusted because we are getting more yield, or people they say, no, let's keep
the same underwriting margin because -- and yield will be a margin improvement?
So I don't know. I can't predict the future and I can't predict behavior, but I can tell you a
rising interest rate environment, even though it is negative early on, it gets very positive

for us.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

FINAL

Maybe I could just in more simpler terms then? So if current interest rates stay where they
are and you talk about a 50 basis points increase in new money yields, do you expect the
portfolio yield to increase by 50 basis points?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Well again, it depends on what mix of business that we wind up with. But you really have
to layer on the duration of that on top of it.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Also, the portfolio turns over -- what is coming off from the prior years, what is maturing,
and what gets reinvested. But I can tell you there is also a shift in our allocations to
alternative investments and assets. That is the reason I went through that whole
explanation why our net income is different than our operating income, because as we
are increasing allocations into alternative investments, including equities, etc., some of it is
not going to come as investment income. It is going to come to us over time as realized
capital gains.
So it is not easy to answer your question with a simple answer and say, yes, it is going to
improve by 50 bps. But looking at the fixed income portion of what we do and not taking
into consideration how much is rolling off and coming and gets reinvested, anything that is
new and we are putting in fixed income has a 50 bps improvement. I don't know if that is

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Thank you. I guess one question is within the reinsurance book, all else equal, would you
expect to continue to reduce capacity that you are gearing towards property cat as the
year progresses? And would you expect to be moving at into either areas of reinsurance
or just taking the opportunity to write more insurance at the same time?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Listen, there is nothing that we do because we move from one to the other because we
are in an excess capital position. So basically all of our units can have all the capital they
want as long as they can deploy profitably. So let's start with that, because I am not

stressed out that I have to take from Peter to pay Paul. If Peter and Paul can give me very
good returns, they get all the capital they want.

FINAL

Now having said that, our market conditions will influence as to how much we do on the
reinsurance sector and depending if it is US cat or international cat or whatever. We will
look at transaction after transaction and we see what we believe the profitability is and do
we like it. Then we write that business.
As you can see, we are at 17.5% of common equity as our highest 250-year big zone, so
we got plenty of room. We are authorized by the Board to go all the way up to 25%. So
from a capital point of view, from a capacity point of view we have more. It's only the
market will allow us to do more or less.
Now you are asking me to predict how the market is going to behave. I don't know. It
depends on that behavior, and we will tell you that if rates continue to go down we will
adjust accordingly. And if rates go up, we will adjust.
Also, sometimes we are sellers and sometimes we are buyers. We did buy more this
quarter. It gives us more protection. It smoothes out the volatility within our book of
business.

Bloomberg Transcript

We felt we were getting good deals. I'm sure the people who sold it to us they also think
they are good deals, but people can have difference of opinion on that.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. One question I had is I saw recently the New York MTA floated an insurance bond
which it had sold to the capital markets. It seems to me, and I could be wrong, but I think it
is one of the first either insurance market transactions or just specifically outside of
property cat reinsurance.
Is that important as a development? Again, I realize it is very small. Or is that something
that you think will happen from time to time?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

They will happen from time to time. It is not significant. Even in the cat market today, which
the benefit seems after Katrina, which is seven, eight years, it is not a significant part of
the capital formation. Still, traditional capital and those type of transactions they are
preferred by most customers.
The sum of the specialized companies they are unrated, fully collateralized vehicles. They
are reissuing similar covers as the rest of us and that is capacity that you have to worry
about. The cat bonds, they had been around for a long time, but they are not a significant
part of the business.

Jay Gelb, Barclays Capital.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

I had a couple in terms of business volume trends. The first with the pull back in
reinsurance premiums. I understand that reflects, to some extent, market conditions, but
I'm trying to get a sense of whether you think that you will still see growth in premium
volume for the year. So that is first for reinsurance.
Then, second, can you talk a little bit more about within the insurance segment the growth
in the program business? And I will have a follow-up.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Let me start with reinsurance. Reinsurance, it is a lumpy business and it is hard to predict
what is going to happen. Let me start.

Bloomberg Transcript

We had reductions in three sectors. One, it was mortgage, but that is kind of comparing
apples to oranges. If you go back to when we reported a quarter ago, a year ago for the
Second Quarter, you will note that we had kind of an incoming portfolio because on the
mortgage reinsurance we had premiums from November, December, and First Quarter,
and Second Quarter that we booked.
Now the second part was the UK motor that we said. As long as we believe the business
is profitable, we stick with it. If it is not, we will let others do it.
As you can see, there is more competition in that line so we have switched to write more
excess of loss, not as much quota share. So that affects the premium production.
But I don't know if that is a predictor as to what is going to happen into the future. By its
nature you can write one or two new contracts and you can change the trajectory. The
reason we don't give guidance and all that is because I can't predict the future. I mean our
whole principle is we are going to underwrite and we have a big appetite, but it has got to
have profitability before we do it.
Not trying to avoid your question there, but I'm just telling you, Jay, how we operate.
The second part was the insurance group. We believe we have a great program division.
You heard from some of our major competitors who write package business, and these
are very good companies like the (inaudible) or the Travelers, etc., and they are getting
good rate increases.

Page 14 of 23

FINAL

And that is the sector that our programs administrators compete with because they write,
even though the specialized covers for certain kind of customers that are in that market.
We have been experiencing very good rate increases, which in essence give us more
revenue, but also new exposures. Winning additional customers. And that business has
been behaving extremely well for us for all the last 10, 11 years, so we are glad that it is
growing.
Our binding authority business, which is the level below that, these are average $5,000
per policy premiums. They are small E&S accounts. And that business is going through
market improvement from a rate point of view and through the teams that we have and
also the very broad distribution capability that we have for either relationships that Arch
has with wholesalers is really going very well. That unit, I think, is up to about $1 million a
quarter -- a week in production which is ahead of our projections.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

One thing I could add, Jay, is that on the program business, as Dinos denoted, and the
contract binding business and why I always bring mix up, growth in that if that is above
average growth it's going to really impact the growth in the net written, because that is
virtually 100% net business. So it's not like we are growing in a line where we are feeding
reinsurers heavily. Those kinds of things alter the net pretty dramatically.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

It is small limits. We keep it 100% net and it all sticks to the ribs.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Then switching gears to capital management. The pace of buybacks has been pretty
modest so far this year. Should we expect anything before 4Q?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

No, Third Quarter we don't like to buy because of the cat exposure that we have. That
would be an issue in Fourth Quarter.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Understood, thank you.

Vinay Misquith, Evercore.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

A few questions here. First is just a numbers question on the mortgage reinsurance and
the UK motor. So I presume those lower premiums are also negatively impacted during
the Fourth Quarter. Do you have a sense for how much is it going to negatively impact the
third and Fourth Quarter for those two?

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

FINAL

The mortgage is a comparison issue. You are comparing a fat quarter a year ago to on a
written, not on an earned basis. So basically, I don't think that has an effect as we move to
the third, fourth, First Quarter from a year-to-year comparison.
The motor will be coming down proportionally on the same basis for the third and Fourth
Quarter, because we have cut back our capacity in that line.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

So do you have a number on that by any chance?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

I don't have all the treaties [ph] in front of me calculating numbers.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thanks. The second thing is actually more of a philosophical question. I think your
company, I think you do notice, has taken the stance that we will wait for the market to
turn. And only when it is sufficiently turned, we will also go after growth.
And (inaudible) to the fact that more is green now versus red, and that is interesting. But
there's some discussion out there that maybe we are reaching the end of tier rate
increases. So just a philosophical question, do you think that you can actually now grow or
take advantage of the opportunities, or do you think that now that pricing is reaching sort
of adequacy that there will be more competition?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Like you are asking me, first, a philosophical question. Let me answer that first and then
get to the predictions, which I don't like to make predictions.
On a philosophical point of view, this is the same playbook we have been running Arch for
the last 12 years. Business is in the red, you had better justify everything that you do. If it is
in the yellow, you be very careful. If it is in the green, write as much as you can get to.
Now as I said, there is more in the yellow and there is some moving into the green, and
that is where you see growth especially. And that is more of a phenomenon in the United
States. I don't think the European markets have moved yet. So the price corrections they
are mostly in North America -- the US and a bit in Canada.
Having said that, once you get to rate adequacy, in our view, and you are getting enough
rate increases, maybe smaller than before but it is ahead of trend, you would be stupid if
you are not trying to write as much as you can. So we are going to have that approach. We
are going to try to write as much as we can.

Page 16 of 23



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2013-07-26

FINAL

Having said that, I don't know how the competitors are going to react. They might -because rates go up and down depending on what I do versus somebody looking at the
same account from a competitor's point of view. So if rates start going down, then you
are going to see us pulling back again. Because our whole mentality is let's look at treaty
by treaty on the reinsurance side, account by account on the insurance side, does it meet
our return characteristics.
Then -- we are not governed by volume. We are not a volume-driven company. I have no
production goals for any one of my divisions. They don't get compensated on production.
They only get compensated on return on equity.
It is my problem to make sure that our capital gets utilized properly. So if they can write a
lot, I give them the capital. If they can't write as much, then I have to deal with the capital
and excess capital issue at the holding company.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Vinay, one other little insight would be, I made the comment that the E&S casualty book
was up 9.5% in the quarter. And there have been prior quarters where it has been similar.
We just have chosen not to play in there yet because it hasn't gone into the green, but it
is approaching it. So there has been no evidence, strong evidence, of that abating.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay, that is helpful. Just as a follow-up to that, your primary insurance operation you only
keep about 70% net. Do you think you are going to raise your retention on primary
business now that it is improving?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Don't mislead yourself, that is a premium comparison, not a limit or exposure comparison.
Remember, we chose to grow contract binding business, program businesses, lenders
businesses -- things that don't put out a lot of capacity and, therefore, we take as
frequency-based. And we are more comfortable taking that risk assumption in-house.
The fact that D&O businesses and hospital professional businesses have capacity out to
$25 million in the US simply means we haven't deployed it as much, but they may still be
reinsured to the same level until we are comfortable of where the returns are.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Right. But if you have seen the trend for the last few quarters, our net-to-gross is
increasing. So we are getting more net, because what we are actually selling is more low
limits, primary small accounts business. And that we keep 100% net. There is no
reinsurance behind that.

A - Mark Lyons

FINAL

And to emphasize, Dinos has made the point before that this is US-centric. Technically, the
Bermuda insurance market has a lot of global and a lot of US companies that are very
complex and they buy a lot of capacity. The businesses we are growing in in the US don't
make it to Bermuda because they are very low limit. So you are not seeing those kind of
increases yet out of the Bermuda facility.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay, that is helpful. Just one last question, if I may. On the ROE of 11% to 13%, what
amount of that can we see hit the bottom line as an operating return? Because you have
excess capital and you have also the returns on the equity portfolio. So how should we
translate that into really the bottom-line operating ROE?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well if you don't know how much excess I have you can't make that calculation because
we take the S&P AA level capital and that is what we allocate to the operating unit.
Everything else -- of course, we allocate some capital to the investment department. We
expect alpha from the investment department for the capital that we allocate.

Bloomberg Transcript

Don't forget, we do the ROE on the operating units on the reinsured rate of return when I
allocate capital, so it is the combination of that. Our excess capital is not significant. It is
not 20% of the book. It fluctuates, but it has been around 10% of our total capital.
So you can do the calculation. It might affect it -- because the underwriting ROEs we do on
allocated capital to the operating units. And that is when -- and the underwriters there get
compensated on that ROE because I don't want to give them excess capital, bring down
the ROE specifically to one division, and affect their compensation negatively. Because I'm
going to go out and try to find business to write and then that is business that I don't want
on the books if they don't have the proper return.
So we try to align their interest by giving them the right amount of capital, AA capital, let
them operate, and we hold them responsible to their performance to that. So it is old
formula, it works. It is like doing cheeseburgers on a Greek diner. I used to do that when I
was in college.

{BIO 1497612 <GO>}

In your commentary you talked about the long-tail casualty leading rate in some
segments, but some hitting adequacy. I was just wondering if you could share what some
of those segments are (multiple speakers).

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

It is pretty simple. I think lead umbrella is still shy of adequacy. Don't forget, we still have
(inaudible) attachment points, like auto attaching excess of $1 million. And even long-haul
trucking sometimes they are attaching excess of $2 million, which is, to me, you are in the
buffer area. We are not in the lead umbrella area.
But if you get over 25 million or so and the area that we see on small, medium-size
accounts and all that, that is the area that now that excess -- it's still not the excess that
goes to the global markets -- Bermuda, London, etc. The Fortune 2000 per se. But MidAmerica and those kind of accounts on the excess they are starting to whet our appetite
where the lead umbrella is not yet where we want to be.
Then we like some of the primary. Sector by sector is different. It is different exposures,
different customer groups, but those are the primarily E&S, the first million of exposure
over either deductibles or SIRs. So you got the primary we like and we got kind of midexcess that we like. We don't like the umbrellas, lead umbrella, etc.
But we are watching it and we are measuring it. I'm not saying we are right, it is just one
company's opinion. That is what makes the marketplace. But I do pay a lot of guys a lot of
money to make sure that they keep monitoring, monitoring, monitoring and making
decisions. We are not going to make everything and be correct in every decision we
make, but we try very hard.

Q - John Hall

{BIO 1497612 <GO>}

Great, understood. And I just want to ask about the mortgage insurance acquisition. I
guess when you first started doing all your work the field was not very crowded and the
Page 19 of 23



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2013-07-26

incumbents were pretty beaten up. And by the time you closed at the end of the year and
then frictional start up and the like, it is going to be pretty far out there when you really
start ramping up in that business.

FINAL

I guess the question is will the opportunity that you saw six or 12 months ago be there in
another 12 or 18 months?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yes. We wouldn't have gotten into that in the permanency of such if we didn't think the
runway is seven to 10 years out. Don't forget, if I thought the market opportunity was
temporary I would have stuck just with reinsurance transactions, so I can do them when
they are needed, one or two or three years, and then move on when they are not
needed.
We view that marketplace, the need for good capacity. And the field is not crowded. It is
going to be six or seven of us in a field that has potential to expand significantly,
especially depending what our legislators do in Washington as they are trying to push
more and more of the credit risk to the private market instead of government-sponsored
enterprises, etc.

Bloomberg Transcript

FHA still is the predominant insurer with maybe -- I don't know if they have dropped below
60% of the market, but they still have 60% of the market. In normal conditions it is
supposed to be the insurer of last resort, kind of the assigned risk, and they are in their
15% to 18% market share.
So we got a long way to go and we view the opportunity today as good as it was six
months ago. We wouldn't have moved towards that if we didn't think this has a seven, to
10-year horizon in front of it. A lot of things can happen and that might change, but that is
our view for the present time.

Q - John Hall

Operator
Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Thank you. A couple questions. Mark, can you talk about the difference now between the
new money yields and your portfolio yields, assuming you are investing in a similar asset
class?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Well broadly speaking, we quoted the embedded yield on fixed income, which Dinos said
is a piece of the action at 243 bps, which is pretty flat from the last quarter. The 50 bps
Page 20 of 23



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2013-07-26

improvement that we quoted really about all I am prepared to really comment on.

FINAL

But since we are a total return-focused entity and that is total return, irrespective of the
geography of where it's put and irrespective of the asset classes, it is hard for us to
answer that question without the alternative investment side and everything else coming
into play. So --

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

We can make our own assumptions on the alternative, but the fixed income is still a big
portion of the portfolio and so that is why I was (multiple speakers).

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

But, Jay, you don't know how much is rolling on and off. Don't forget, you are getting
maturities that you got to reinvest so you got to see what the reinvestment -- and I don't
have those numbers in front of me. But maybe we can do some calculations and share
some comments. Give us a call and then we will go through it with you.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

But by common geography, as more treasuries and other things that rolls, it is going to be
higher coupons. You guys tend to focus more on the income statement NII, which is going
to get the benefit from it. As Dinos said earlier, over the term of the duration of the
portfolio it is going to unwind itself. But geography base this year going to see some
improvements because of the higher coupons.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Right, right. I guess the second question is really a follow-up on the insurance pricing
question where you suggested that the price increase decelerated a bit in the quarter.
But pointing out that it's still good to get increases above claims inflation, which is clearly
true.
I guess a concern that the equity markets have is that this is a trend we will see for the
next two or three quarters and whatever cushion there is in pricing is going away pretty
quickly. So my question to you is, while you did see that deceleration (multiple speakers)

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

That premise is not what we have said, but go ahead, finish your question.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Well that's not really the question. The question is are you -- the tone that you are seeing
in the market, the behavior you are seeing, does it really represent -- do you see a big
change in how your competitors have been behaving that would make you nervous that
this slide, if you will, will continue?

Page 21 of 23

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

FINAL

No. We don't see aggressive behavior, so to speak, in the marketplace. I think people
they are pushing for improved terms and pricing on the primary markets. Also we see the
trend that we mentioned that the primary insurers don't want to share as much of that
with the reinsurers.
They say, hey, you guys had pretty good numbers for a long time. We need the
improvement so we are going to -- you got to stick to our ribs, so pay us a little more
seating commission if you want our business. And we see that.
But this is an improving environment. An account, even though you are not getting the
same rate increase that you got a year ago, it doesn't mean on absolute basis is
marginally better. As long as that continues that is a good thing.
I hear about this second derivative BS and all that, and at the end of the day maybe those
are trying to be predictors of what is want to happen into the future. I don't know what is
going to happen into the future.

Bloomberg Transcript

But as long as we are getting as an industry, and we are, we are getting price increases
that are ahead of claim inflation, things are getting better, not worse, and there is no
other way to interpret it. If people have a crystal ball and they say this now is going to go
into a dive and the rate increases are going to be below claims inflation, you can get into
a different conclusion. But there is no evidence in anything that we see or anything else
that every competitor has reported that is pointing to that.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Great, that is helpful. If I could squeeze in one more question, the expense ratio on the
reinsurance side, the G&A expense ratio was up a little bit and one of the things you
mentioned in the release was some investments in that business. Can you talk more
about that, exactly what that (multiple speakers)?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

It was two things, it's very simple. You guys read 8-Ks sometimes, but you don't pay a lot
of attention to it. We did a big retention grant at year-end, so there is equity cost that is
coming through. Especially if you are familiar with accounting rules -- and believe me I got
so many accountants I take three Advils every time I meet with them. If a lot of our
employees they are retirement eligible, you got to take that cost in one year immediately.
So you can't spread it over the five-year cliff vesting and all that that we have.
Second then we had to beef up some of our teams, both on the -- starting to hire on the
mortgage side and starting to hire in the life reinsurance sector a few individuals. And of
course, on the insurance side we brought a big team, which is starting to produce already,
in the contract binding business.

Page 22 of 23



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2013-07-26

So the retention grant was done for the right reasons. We have good employees and we
want to retain them, and we create another obstacle for competition to take them. We
are paying for it and we are happy about it.

FINAL

But that is the two explanations. There is nothing more into those numbers other than
those two things.
