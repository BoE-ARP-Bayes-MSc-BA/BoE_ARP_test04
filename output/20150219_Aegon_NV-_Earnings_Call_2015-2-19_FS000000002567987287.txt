FINAL

Thank you, Willem, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I'm
pleased to report that the fourth quarter was a strong close to a solid year for Aegon in
what remains a challenging environment, in particular, with the persistently low interest
rates and market volatility.
Last year, we've made significant progress with the execution of our strategy. So let me
highlight a few of the steps we've taken before providing you with an overview of the Q4
numbers. In terms of optimizing our portfolio, we are pleased to have been able to
announce the sale of operations in Canada and of our stake in La Mondiale Participations
in France. At the same time, we continued to invest in our future growth, in particular, by
expanding our distribution capabilities.
In Portugal, our new partnership with Banco Santander gives us access to over two million
customers through 600 branches. And in France, our new asset management partnership
with La Banque Postale will give us access to 11 million retail customers in addition to
growing institutional client base. Finally, in Brazil, I can announce today that we have
entered into a distribution agreement with BANCOOB, Brazilian Cooperative Bank. This
will enable us to offer life and pension products to its 2.8 million customer throughout
their 2,000 branches in Brazil.

Bloomberg Transcript

While we are expanding distribution in all our markets, we also remain focused on
improving our operational capabilities. In the U.S., for example, we successfully merged
two divisions to create our new investments and retirement division. This will further
improve efficiencies, and will also help us better serve our customers along their life cycle,
including through retirement.
This brings me to customer loyalty. And I'm pleased with the programs that we have
successfully implemented throughout the organizations to better connect with our
customers in the way they choose. Examples include the Mijn Aegon portal in the
Netherlands, our new online products in Spain, but also helping more than a million
people in the U.S. with our retirement outlook, too.
I'm also proud that we have made significant progress towards becoming the preferred
employer in our sector. And as you can well imagine, this is important to us as we need to
be able to attract and retain talent throughout our organization. The results of our most
recent global employee survey showed that our employee satisfaction scores are now
above the high performing norm.
Let me now turn to our fourth quarter results. And as you can see, slide 3 provides a good
overview of a strong performance. Underlying earnings before tax were up 19% to €562
million. And this increase is driven by growth of our business, a stronger U.S. dollar, and an
employee benefit reserve release in the Netherlands of €45 million.
Sales growth continued. Return in equity increased to 9.7%. And cash flows were strong at
€338 million for the quarter. I'm also pleased to announce that based on our solid capital
position and cash flow generation, we will increase our final dividend to €0.12 per share.

FINAL

As you can see on slide 4, we continue to generate strong sales growth. This is a
particularly good result given the challenging environment with regulation changing in
almost all our markets, customer demand also changing and the low interest rate
environment. Gross deposits were up 29% for the quarter and 25% for the year, showing
clear evidence of the success of our strategy to move to a more fee-based business
model.
Life sales also higher, although maintaining profitability is being challenged by the low
interest rate environment. Earlier this year, we reintroduced our universal life secondary
guarantee product in the U.S. with real-time pricing to enable us to maintain flexibility
despite declining interest rates.
Earlier this month, however, due to the increased interest rate volatility, we took the
decision to withdraw the product from the market, and this action is a clear reflection of a
strict pricing discipline. We were also pleased to see our accident and health as well as
general insurance sales pass the €1 billion mark in 2014 for the first time, again, an
evidence of our success in expanding the distribution of our broad product offering. As I
indicated earlier, we are seeing strong momentum in our fee-based business.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'll now turn to slide 5. In the U.S., variable annuities, pensions, and mutual funds all
recorded strong gross deposits. Variable annuities in particular continue to be a major
driver of growth and expanding distribution has been key to our success. Also, here, as a
result of the low interest rate environment, we've had to make adjustments to our
variable annuity product. And in the Netherlands, Aegon's innovative online bank, Knab, is
fast becoming a success, with one of the highest net promoter scores in the entire sector.
The last quarter, we had seen the number of customers grow significantly and the
number now stands at over 50,000 customers with over €1 billion of assets. Our UK
platform continues to be the fastest growing in the market while third-party deposits in
our asset management business were up significantly compared to last year.
Now turning to slide six, I would like to make a few comments on our capital position and
balance sheet. The capital position of the group as well as of our individual country units
remain solid as our focus this year turns fully towards preparing for Solvency II. The group
IGD ratio remains strong at 208%, holding excess capital stands at €1.2 billion, and net
dividends received from our units were more than offset by the €500 million senior debt
maturity, by holding expenses and by an investment into our joint venture with Santander
in Portugal. There was also an adverse cash impact related to currency hedges due to the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
In the United States, excess capital remained stable at $1.1 billion as the impact of the
dividend paid to the holding was offset by capital generation including the benefit of
market impacts. In the Netherlands and the UK, we are actively preparing for Solvency II.
We are repositioning our investment portfolio and working hard to submit our internal
models for approval by our regulators. We expect this work to continue throughout the
year. And we expect to get clarity on a number of important outstanding items related to
Solvency II along the way.

FINAL

Given the size of our U.S. business, it will come as no surprise that third country
equivalence is very important to Aegon, and we continue to work on the process of
bringing our U.S. business under Solvency II using deduction and aggregation.
In the Netherlands and the UK, we are waiting for the clarification on several critical items
including the use of the matching adjustments and the volatility adjustment. Because of
the uncertainties that remain, we expect it will not be until the second half of 2015 before
we're in a position to provide you with more guidance on Solvency II outcomes.
On slide seven, you will see that we ended the year with a gross financial leverage ratio
of 28.7%, well within our target range of 26% to 30%. Fixed charge coverage has
improved significantly to 6.5 times, also within our target range. And this improvement has
been mostly driven by a reduction in outstanding debt of over €2 billion including €1 billion
in 2014 alone. We've also taken advantage of current market conditions to refinance
leverage at low interest rates going forward. The steps we have taken to reduce leverage
and to increase our fixed charge coverage not only strengthened our balance sheet but
also provide us with greater financial flexibility.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning now to slide eight, our solid capital position and strong cash flow generation over
the second half 2014 supports the increase in the final dividends 2014 to €0.12 per share.
This makes the full year 2014 dividend €0.23 per share, a 5% increase over the previous
year. We will continue to offer our shareholders the option to take the dividend in cash or
stock. And we will continue to neutralize the dilution and, therefore, effectively pay a fullcash dividend. As a result, our dividend payout ratio for 2014 as a percentage of free cash
flows will be 53%.
Now, in summary, I'd like to say that we are pleased with the results we achieved in the
fourth quarter. And we are seeing that more and more people are choosing Aegon and
placing their trust in our products and services, which gives us every confidence in our
future and in our ability to generate sustainable earnings growth going forward.
Darryl and I are now happy to take your questions. Thank you.

Q&A
Operator
To begin, we will take questions from investors and analysts only. This will be followed by
an opportunity for the media to pose questions. We will now take our first question from
David Andrich from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. First of all, I was just wondering, in
terms of the Netherlands. I understand that you didn't upstream any capital from the
Netherlands in Q4 even though you're above your minimum IGD target of 200%. And I
guess I was just wondering how much capital do you think you need to retain there, and
Page 4 of 19



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2015-02-19

then how high do you think you need to build your IGD capital in preparation for Solvency II
which I know the Dutch regulator is looking at more closely.

FINAL

And then second of all, kind of similar question for the UK, I see that your Pillar 1 ratio at
Q4 was 140%, and you have a minimum target of 145%. And I guess I was wondering how
that would impact the free cash flow guidance we've been given in the past in terms of
the step up in UK in 2015.
And then finally, I was just wondering on Solvency II, in terms of kind of the key debates, if
there had been – I don't think you're giving updated guidance on the range that you gave
in June, but I was just wondering if you have any kind of update on the key arguments
behind your 150% to 200% range, if there had been kind of a shift one way or another for
any of the big arguments there. Thank you.

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hey, David. It's Darryl. I'll jump in there. I think all three of your questions are quite
interrelated. The reality is, in both the Netherlands and the UK, we really are transitioning
into Solvency II this year. And as we look at the decision whether or not to pay a dividend
out of the Dutch operations, the reality of the situation is that there's just so many
uncertainties out there still remaining on our Solvency II numbers that we decided not to
upstream a dividend at this point while we continue to work through those.
In the UK, it's a similar answer. You see the Pillar 1 ratios, but again, more and more of our
emphasis is shifting over to the Solvency II. One of the things that we see specifically in
the UK is that as we actually de-risk the portfolio and take risk out, removing some of the
callable bonds to get ready for matching adjustment under Solvency II, that actually lowers
our Pillar 1 ratio, but it obviously helps our Solvency II position. So, you see that dynamic
happening.
In terms of the Solvency II specifically, we're really in the middle of our internal model
approval process. We expect to file our application and submit that in the second quarter.
That's why it's going to be really the second half of the year before we get the results
back from that. So, that really is the Solvency II answer to all of your questions as it relates
to the European business. The U.S., obviously, as Alex mentioned earlier in his notes, we'll
continue to work through the deduction and aggregation process as it relates to the U.S.

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Okay. So, it sounds like kind of a bit of a holding pattern then until you get the internal
model approved in the second half of the year?

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yes. I think that's the right way to look at it. We really are in a holding pattern. We really are
going through a lot of work on this end with the Dutch Central Bank to go through all the
elements of Solvency II, and that's really where we're at.

Thank you. We will now take our next question from Ashik Musaddi from JPMorgan. Please
go ahead.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. Good morning, Alex. Good morning, Darryl. Thanks a lot for your update. Just all
the questions related to Solvency, so slide number 23. First of all, what happened in the
U.S.? How come your capital stayed at €1.1 billion even though you streamed out $600
million of capital? How much of that is driven by – so that means there's implied capital
generation of around $600 million. How much of that is markets and how much of that is
earnings? And also, some clarity on what the sensitivities on U.S. capital on this particular
basis with respect to market, any color there would be great.
Secondly, any thoughts on what happened with that cash flow testing that you flagged in
past? Where are we on that now? Did anything new came up in fourth quarter or was it
just as per plan? And thirdly is on the – again with the Dutch regulator, can you give us
some color about what sort of dialogue you're having with the Dutch regulator, i.e. how
are they looking at capital at the moment, i.e. are they looking at Solvency I, kind of
Solvency II, how they decide whether you should pay a dividend or not or they just don't
know as well? So, I mean, how should we think about it at least? It would be great to get
some color on that. Thank you.

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Hi, Ashik. It's Darryl. I'm going to take those as well. First of all, in the U.S., on the capital
position in the U.S., it was a strong quarter for the U.S. We did see some market positives
in the capital numbers in the U.S. Those are maybe a little bit counterintuitive with the
interest rates dropping. But the reality is that our hedges produced cash earnings for us in
the quarter related to interest rate hedging.
And on the liability side, it wasn't as sensitive as the hedges because we were basically
using up past margin in the products. So, margins in the capital ratio on the liability side
were used to dampen that effect, whereas the hedges produced real earnings in the
quarter.
So, of that $600 million, you're about right on that capital generation. I would say that
about half of that was – maybe a little less than that, but a little less than half of that was
related to really the market circumstances in the quarter. So, the actual cash generation
for the U.S. was $300 million to $350 million.
The sensitivity, it does – on the sensitivity side, we do have to watch that if markets go
back the other way, interest rates go up, which of course would be economically positive
for the business. The hedges will perform the other way. So, some of this would reverse
Page 6 of 19



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2015-02-19

on the other side. So, we're quite comfortable having the U.S. operating at a capital level,
a little above the target range right now. I think that just – I think we're comfortable
operating in that range given the sensitivities that we see.

FINAL

The cash flow testing question you asked, yes, the good news is we got through the yearend cash flow testing within the provisions that we'd already set up earlier in the year. So,
there was no additional impact related to that at the end of the year.
And the third question I think you had was how is the Dutch Central Bank looking at capital
in Netherlands. They've actually been fairly explicit...

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Sorry. Not just Netherlands but the group overall as well because ultimately they will be
the local regulator for you. So how are they looking at – I mean, when you upstream
dividend from U.S., how do they look at whether you can pay it to shareholders or not,
whether you can do a buy back or not? Any sort of color, I mean, how are they looking at
it?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Sure. From a group perspective, that's actually the discussions that we're having with
them right now on how to calibrate the U.S. system into Solvency II under deduction and
aggregation. So, the good news is that the Solvency II regime allows for equivalence
treatment in the U.S., and we've been operating with the Dutch Central Bank on that
premise. And so we continue to further those discussions with them on how mechanically
to do that.
So really what's – the conversations going on right now are the calibration, how we move
from that system into Solvency II, as well as the fungibility and transferability rules within
Solvency II, so are any there restrictions that we need to put on due to fungibility of
capital. Those are the major conversations that we're having with them right now.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

And with respect to the Dutch business only?

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

The Dutch business only, they've been very clear with the Dutch industry that they want to
look at and operate on a Solvency II basis in 2015. 2015 is the transition year, so we're still
producing IGD I Solvency I capital ratios, but as we move into mid-2015, they really want to
be talking to the Dutch industry on a Solvency II basis by this summer.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. That's very clear. Thanks a lot.

Thank you. We will now take our next question from Farooq Hanif from Citi. Please go
ahead, sir.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, everybody. Good morning. You won't be surprised, a quick question on – well, quick,
sort of, two questions on Solvency II and a question on margins in the U.S. So, on Solvency
II, can you just spell out for us what the deduction aggregation issue is? If you can just tell
us in very simple terms what the kind of the bull case and bear case is.
Secondly, could you talk about your interest rate sensitivity in the Netherlands? So, my
impression is that you're pretty solidly hedged and sort of matched with hedging in the
Netherlands. But if you could just sort of confirm that for us.
And lastly, you had very strong profitability in Q4 in the VA business and in employer
solutions and benefits. So, could you just talk about what's going there in terms of what
kind of above-margin guidance, would that normalize? Thanks very much.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yes, Farooq, let me take the first two. On Solvency II, the deduction and aggregation bull
case versus bear case in the U.S. So, basically the essence of the conversation is how to
use the U.S. regulatory framework and the U.S. regulatory capital ratios and use those
inside of Solvency II, and that's what's referred to under Solvency II as deduction and
aggregation. It means that we do not compute the U.S. business on Solvency II, Pillar 1 own
funds, and SCR required capital basis.
We use U.S. regulatory available capital and required capital. And then we agreed to some
conversion of that available and required capital into our group ratios. That's actually very
similar to what we do today under our group IGD 1 ratios today. So we have to work
through how that works, getting from legal entity, regulatory capital ratios in the U.S. and
getting that converted across into Solvency II.
There is also fungibility and transferability regulation inside of Solvency II that we have to
work through, and quite frankly, it's a little bit confusing, I think, for all of us in the industry
right now exactly what that regulation calls for in terms of are there any restrictions you
have to put on, on non-EA capital as it relates to the fungibility of that capital, so that's the
activity that we're doing.
The second question you asked was on the Netherlands interest rate sensitivity. We really
do have interest rate hedges in place across all of our major liabilities. So from an ALM
perspective, all of the long pension liabilities in the Netherlands have been interested-rate
hedged. Those hedges have performed, obviously, extremely well given what rates have
done here.
Page 8 of 19

FINAL

And where we do see a pocket of residual interest rate exposure in the Netherlands is
more related to the longevity part of the business. And at the end of the day, what
happens is the risk-based capital we hold for longevity, tThe present value of that
longevity capital gets higher as you get into a lower rate environment. So that's a second
order impact that we see coming through. But by far, the vast majority of the interest rate
exposure in the Netherlands has been hedged.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Can I just quickly come back on the deduction and aggregation? So is it as simple as
saying there's a – for laypeople like us, say, is there a simple – simpler thing than the
minimum RBC ratio of which you will bring into the group calculation your...

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yes, sure. So...

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

...and you don't know where that is. So currently, is it 175% that you see, more 250% in
your (24:22)?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

We have been using 200% RBC ratio as a conversion factor. We have highlighted that and
noted that when we gave our original guidance that that is a subject of debate. I could
see that that is a topic of discussion that we're having now. So, if that was a higher
conversion rate, that would lead to a lower group ratio contribution. So, those are
conversations that we're going through now. I think...

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

So, would it be correct to say that bear cases look – they will only look at what you can pay
because that's your dividend and, say, anything below that is still minimum required
capital? So that will be, well, more like, whatever, 400%?

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yes. I think if you took a very strict read on the fungibility regulations that are out there,
you could restrict the capital down to simply what's fungible in terms of one year's
dividend. I think that's a very strict and literal read. We don't think that's the proper
application of it, but that's a possibility, in which case the conversion ratio doesn't matter.
On a different read, then it's really about the conversion ratio and, obviously, the ratio
would be different if we use 200% or if we use 300%, so as an example on how to
convert those statutory numbers across.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

And just very – sorry to take so much of your time. But on the interest rate hedging, so
correct me if I'm wrong, but you're – are you hedging economically and, therefore,

Page 9 of 19



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2015-02-19

ignoring the UFR? Or are you taking into account that you have the benefit of the UFR
and, therefore, underhedging?

FINAL

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

I think we have adjusted our hedge programs over time to the UFR. So, we look at the
UFR as a long-term rate assumption. So, there would be some exposure if the UFR was
dropped. That's possible, but our hedges are economically hedged to the liability flows
assuming the UFR.

Thank you. We will take our next question from Farquhar Murray from Autonomous. Please
go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Good morning, gentlemen. Just two questions, if I may. Firstly, just coming back on
Solvency II. We've seen some peers becoming more definitive on their Solvency II
positioning. And I'm just trying to understand why Aegon is somewhat less happy about
that. I assume it's because the aggregation deduction method is more significant for you
than for other peers. But I'm just trying to understand whether there's anything else that
just seems to explain why you're taking a slightly different approach there.
And then just on the earnings impact from low interest rates on slide 33 of the
presentation pack, can you just explain why the year-on-year guidance is essentially
unchanged from the previous guidance you've given? I might have expected the kind of
drag effect to have increased given the fall in interest rates and just want to understand
what happened there.
And actually, just on a point of detail, is that guidance based on the year-end interest rate
positioning or is it some kind of average of 4Q or the full year? Thanks.

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yes. Farquhar, hi. It's Darryl. Yes, your answer is right on the Solvency II question. I mean,
given the size and dominance of the U.S. for Aegon, obviously, the deduction and
aggregation and that whole calibration discussion I just had with Farooq is very material to
what our end ratios are. So we're just less confident on zeroing in on a range right now for
the group because of that. And I think that's a fair distinction between our position and
perhaps a couple others here in the Netherlands.

Page 10 of 19



Company N ame: Aegon N V

FINAL

On the earnings guidance, yes. So we basically slid the earnings guidance forward, so it's
the same $10 million, $15 million, $25 million that we had before, but now that's relative to
a 2014 base, before it was relative to a 2013 base. It is maybe a little smaller than what
you were expecting. Some of that is helped by the fact that when we unlocked the rate
assumptions back in 2013, we really lengthened out the time at which we expect to get to
the 10-year assumption in the U.S.
So we grade there only over a 10-year period. So that helps smooth down some of the
sensitivities. And it really should be read as a year-over-year basis. So if rates stay where
they are basically today, flat for the next three years, then this is a year-over-year
guidance relative to same quarter back in 2014.

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

All right. Just as a follow on the Solvency II aspect. I mean, has the range in any way
particularly increased from what you indicated in June? And just directionally, where has
the Solvency II ratio presumably developed since June?

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Again, I'm not going to give an actual outcome number, but we gave a 50-point
range, which is quite wide, back in June. And I still think that's a reasonable range given all
the uncertainties. A lot of the uncertainties we highlighted in June are still uncertain for us.
We still stand here today with not knowing what the volatility adjuster looks like. We still
have to go through our approval process for matching adjustment, all of the IMAP internal
approvals. Those are the same caveats that we had back in June.
I wish we had more progress on that, but we're still actually waiting for – we're still waiting
on volatility adjuster detail from EIOPA. And then the deduction and aggregation issue is
maybe more unique to Aegon, but it's a material issue for us, so we continue to work
through that with the Dutch Central Bank.

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks so much indeed.

Operator
Thank you. We will now take our next question from William Elderkin from Goldman Sachs.
Please go ahead, sir.

Q - William H. Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning, everybody. A couple of questions. First, a couple of follow ups.
With the sort of the headline Solvency II debate, importance of equivalence, what is the
sort of materiality of the group level Solvency II ratio to your ability to upstream capital,
and I guess ultimately return of capital to shareholders, particularly if the sort of the
underlying U.S. regulations aren't changing? I can see why Solvency II uncertainty in the

Netherlands is very important to that. But could you just spell it out again on why that
headline group level ratio is – whether that impacts things?
And then secondly, I've got a couple of other questions. In terms of the UK business,
you've had this £150 million to £200 million sterling capital generation target. I got a
feeling last year that you'd indicated that was going to be a challenge. Could you just give
us an update of where we've got to on that? Thirdly, in your press release, you referred
to higher U.S. operating expenses expected in 2015. Could you just give us a little bit of
some quantification there?
And then finally, in terms of the evolution of the variable annuity portfolio, I think in the
past you've talked about sort of three buckets, I think, in terms of pre-2004, 2004 to
2007, or 2004 to 2008 and then versus the newer generation of products. And if we look
at the overall portfolio you report, roughly how big are each of those elements?

Hi, William. Let me take the Solvency II question. I think it's very similar to what I answered
with Ashik earlier, the relevance of the solvency of the U.S. cash position into dividends as
per Aegon. I think, the first answer really is that the Solvency II doesn't change the U.S.
regulatory environment, first and foremost. So our ability to pull dividends and upstream
cash out of the U.S. is driven by the U.S. statutory environment and not impacted by
Solvency II.
I think where the group ratio is relevant, we get into the issue of how to then convert that
framework into the overall group ratio and the view that the Dutch Central Bank will have
as our lead supervisor on that U.S. position. And that's the source of the conversations
we're having right now on how to do that calibration. So, I think that's the important
takeaway points on that.

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Yes. On the UK, maybe I'll say something. William, we've stated clearly that we are
restructuring our UK business. We are taking our costs down. We are investing in our
platform capability, which I'm pleased to see is actually well recognized right now. We still
remain the fastest growing platform. We've also said we need to achieve some certain
financial objectives, and cash flow generation is a very important one from it.
I guided last quarter that the £150 million to £200 million level was a challenging level
because all the additional uncertainties, DWP, and now we have this issue about pension
that effectively can be taken in the form of cash. So there's a lot of uncertainty there, but
we're still very focused on trying to achieve that objective. And management in the UK is
very focused to do so. So, it's way too early today to say that it's challenging. We are
continuing to focus with that objective.
In terms of expenses in the U.S., I should say we have – I don't like to speak about good
expenses and not good expenses. But the expense growth in U.S. mainly is driven by the
growth of our business. So, we're putting more business. We have more sales people. We

obviously have to spend more to effectively administer the increased volumes. But we are
growing our business much faster than we're growing our expenses. So, what we're doing
in the U.S. is still looking at ways of reducing our expenses.
As you know, we not only invest in growth but we also are spending a lot of effort,
people, but also some expenses in further digitizing our business in the U.S. And then, I
think it's extremely important to be well positioned for the future. And so these, I would
consider, really as being good expenses because they are very clearly linked to the
growth of our business.
In terms of variable annuities, in terms of the numbers, Darryl, you've got them in the
meantime?

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yes. I'll probably have to get – I'll have to get the IR team to follow up with you on
specifically. I know that on the GMIB products, the one we talked about a lot the pre-2002
on that IB product balances are around €5 billion on that product. We also have older era.
We have death benefit only products. Those are somewhere around €18 billion, I think, if I
remember correctly. That fits within total portfolios running around $65 billion. So
hopefully, that gives you some perspective. Obviously, the vast majority are the GMWB
products that we've been selling since 2003 forward, and that's obviously the product
that's been performing well.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - William H. Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Just one brief follow up. And as the proportion of those sort of new-generation GMWB
rises, will that continue to support the overall margin we see coming through quarter-onquarter?

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yes, definitely. That's where the earnings growth – I think that's one of the earnings
growth drivers from the U.S. Obviously, the U.S. has been driven by pension mutual funds,
VA, and as well as the life protection business going forward. On that VA product, that's
where the margins have been quite strong. We have had to react as interest rates move
up and down. We will actually have to make some smaller changes to the product given
where rates have gone just in the last two or three months. And so we expect to do that
here shortly. But for the most part, the margins have been held up pretty well, I would say.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Thank you. Just some questions on the Dutch pensions market, please. First of all, could
you just update us on the persistency on your existing block of Dutch DB schemes? And
second, are you seeing margins increase as these schemes really have nowhere else to
go? I know competition is increasing, but you still got a very relatively small number of
providers offering DB in the Dutch market? And third, may I see your comment on
potentially contracting buyout market in 2015? I'm just wondering would you offer buy-ins
as is done in the UK? Thanks.

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Yes. Let me take his question on the Dutch pension market. As you know, we are leader in
the market, with close to 25% market share. Persistency actually has been very good, but I
also would say that we are not in a position to decide what schemes we want to keep on
and at what price. So we've seen a couple of schemes that we have not renewed, but
that was because we were not able to renew them at the price we think is the right price
to renew them. So with this leadership position, obviously, it allows us also to make sure
that we maintain the good pricing.

Bloomberg Transcript

Are margins increasing? I don't think margins are really increasing. As you know, there's
only a few providers. Aegon remains absolutely committed to a very strict policy in terms
of pricing. And we will continue to remain committed to that pricing discipline.
What we do see is indeed effectively that, as a result of the low interest rate, which as
you understand, is not going to be very supportive of a lot of conversion, what you see is
that we are seeing customer now moving more and more to other type of products which
are more modern products in the forms of PPIs and administration only. And Aegon is
uniquely positioned with our buyout capability, with our PPI capability, which we have at
Aegon and at TKP. As you know, with TKP, we are the largest administer of pension funds
right now in the Netherlands. And we also provide asset management services.
So we have a full range of different products and services within the entire pension
universe, which allows us actually to move on different places at the same time. And that
is exactly what we are trying to do now and we're doing that very successfully.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

And just the last question on buy-ins?

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

No. We don't see a lot of that happening in the Netherlands yet. Keep in mind, the
Netherlands has been quite a traditional pension market wherem, in the past, many
companies, corporates have their own pension. What they're more looking at is now how
can they meet the liabilities for the future, how can they satisfy also an increased
regulatory demand. That is where the focus is right now.

It's just interesting in that the average solvency in the Dutch market is actually in the
pension schemes is materially better than in the UK. And in the UK, that doesn't seem to
be a problem, schemes which are slightly underfunded, offering them buy-ins on parts of
their liability. Just wondering, I mean, is that a development that will happen in the Dutch
market, you think?

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Well, as you say yourself, the coverage ratios, although they have come down, they're still
comfortable compared to what we see in other places. So, therefore, as long as you
remain on top of – ahead of 100%, and they could seem to be actually benefiting a little
bit from very good performance on equity markets which obviously has offset some of
the negative impact from lower interest rates, that's where we see the focus right now.

Q - Gordon Aitken

Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Oh. Hi there. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Two questions. First is, just
wondered, are you still intending to neutralize the dilutive effect of the pref share
transaction this year? I think you've indicated in the past that you would like to do it this
year. I just wondered what sort of timing you might envisage if this year is still appropriate
or whether you're thinking of putting it out further.
And then also wanted to come back on Solvency II. Apologies about this. But just
wondered if you could remind us of the sensitivity to your 150% to 200% range, if for
example you were to change the 200% company action limit that is the basis of your
current calculation to, let's say, 250%, what sort of effect – I think you've given us this
before, but I wonder if you could just remind us again. Thank you very much.

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Yes. On the sensitivity, we'll come back in a second to make sure we have – because it's
the same one we've given you earlier.
On the prefs, Nick, what I can say is what I've said last time. We are indeed committed to
neutralize that effect on pref shares. But I also said clearly that we need clarity on Solvency
II and Solvency II outcome, and I don't expect that we get much clarity about Solvency II
before the second half of the year. So, only thereafter will we consider executing on our
commitment to neutralize that effect.

Yes, yes.

A - Darryl D. Button

I remember.

Thank you. We will now take our next question from William Hawkins from KBW. Please go

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hello. Could you give us a bit more color on what you're thinking about the net inflows
onto your UK platform, please? The figure has been quite stable over the past few
quarters and we all know about the regulatory uncertainty. But when and at what rate do
you expect that aggregate figure to start to pick up?
And then within that figure, I think, correct me if I'm wrong, you've been kind of
disappointed this year. Though the good news is you've had a lot of money coming in
Page 16 of 19

FINAL

from new customers, but the conversion from the back book hasn't been as high as
you've anticipated. Could you maybe give us a guide for where we were in the fourth
quarter relative to the previous nine months? Has there been any improvement in that?
And again, allowing for the regulatory uncertainty, how you think that mix may change this
year? Thank you.

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

William, I'll take that question. On the platform, as you indeed point out, we were pleased
to see that the biggest part of our customers are new customers. We've also said that we
are looking ways of upgrading existing customers from our back book that would be much
better served on a platform, and also it would allow these customers to consolidate
assets.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you know, really the game on the platform is not so much to move a customer from
one platform to another one, but really the objective here is to move him from the old
business and – well, we have not really given him a lot of attention to this platform
knowing that that customer has assets in different places. And what the good news is that
we see that significant part of customers that indeed go to the platform do consolidate
the assets from different areas. In many cases, they bring up similar amount from different
places.
Now, how that is going to continue this year and what the trend will be is difficult to say. As
you know, we have a couple of issues on the whole pension area. You are well aware of it.
But also on the individual pension area with the changes, the government now effectively
allowing people that are age 55 or plus just to take their pension out, will bring in a new
dynamic. So, I think it's too early now for us to say how we see the trend continuing.
But what I see is that our platform is not only recognized by our new customers but also
more and more by existing customers who use it as a tool to consolidate assets. And,
yes, margins are lower on the platform. But it is clearly our objective to more than offset
that by increasing the volumes because of the consolidation of the customers. And we
expect that in this quarter going forward to second quarter, we will be able to effectively
upgrade a significant amount of targeted customers from the kind of back book
environment to which we are in to this platform. But still, it's too early now to say how that
trend will continue for the rest of the year. Hope this helps.

FINAL

Hello, guys. Good morning. Can you just sort of give us some indication in terms of the
U.S. sales, in terms of the VA product changes you've made and in terms of the universal
life secondary guarantee product that you've pulled. Can you indicate what kind of
impression this has on future sales going forwards and what you're doing to offset this
impact?
And also, following up from a previous question on the sensitivity to the reinvestment
rate. I just wanted to clarify that the minus $10 million per quarter that you had in the last
results presentation threw an impact for 2014 versus 2013. Now that's been rolled forward
to 2015 versus 2014. Does that mean it's a minus $20-million impact on 2015 versus 2013?
I hope that makes sense.

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

On the sales, as we said, we are really looking at our products, not only in terms of do
they make sense for Aegon, do we meet our hurdle rate, but also if do they make sense
for our customers. And where we have come to the conclusion with the universal life
secondary guarantee is that this product at this rate with this volatility do not make any
sense for customers anymore, neither do they make really sense for Aegon. That's the
reason why we've decided to pull it.
Just to give you an indication, it was around €95 million, 15% of last year's sales. So what
we expect is that we will see some of that sales effectively being redirected to other
products, which we believe make more sense to our customers and should allow our
customers to achieve very similar objective. A good example is the index-linked universal
life product, which, as you know, we've been actually quite successful in promoting. So, on
the longer term, maybe the first quarter, we will see a clear drop in sales because it just
takes a bit of time to get your new product.
Our sales organization, our wholesalers and our brokers are acquainted with this product.
But the reality is that what you see in this market is that also the distribution, they also
need to be able to sell something. And that's why they will be looking at alternatives, and
we believe we have good alternatives for our customers. But we're really very committed
not to sell the product where we just do not think it makes sense for both the customer
and ourselves. So you will see, clearly, an impact, an immediate impact. But I expect this
actually to be recovered very quickly by products, which are different products.
Now on the reinvestment yield, I think I can confirm that your understanding is correct. But
Darryl?

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yes. I think your math is right on that. What we're basically saying is that the 2014 earnings
already included a headwind due to rates staying low relative to 2013 of €10 million. By
sliding the guidance forward, what we're saying is, if rates stay here, 2015 will be another
€10 million relative to 2014. I think, in that regard, the €20 million that you came up with is
accurate. And that is a little heavier than what the €15 million was that would have been a
year ago when we gave that guidance. So, that's maybe even also related to the question

Page 18 of 19



Company N ame: Aegon N V

that Farquhar asked earlier, and that's basically because rates have not only trended low
but trended even lower.
