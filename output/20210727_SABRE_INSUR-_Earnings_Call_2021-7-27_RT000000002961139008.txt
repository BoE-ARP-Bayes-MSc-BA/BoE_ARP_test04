Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, good morning, everyone. Welcome to another series of virtual presentations. Certainly
Sabre just done eight results calls since the IPO that we ended 2017 and exactly 50% of
them during lockdown, which is when we haven't really realized.
Clearly common format, (inaudible). These are the presenters, one new face, Matt Wright,
as you know has been promoted to Chief Actuary. Hanro will continue in this role as
coordinator. Any issues related to technology breakdowns please do put that on the chat
function and Hanro will sort it out. At the end we'll use the rise hand function for
questions, Hanro although need to upload you to participants, there'll be a short delay
before we turn on hear your question. We are as usual (inaudible) technical issues.
On the agenda, very similar approach to normal we'll look backwards of results and then
give you our best insurance nerds view of where we think the market at today, and where
we think market going.
So, ﬁnancial highlights. It goes without saying it's been a pretty strange half year clearly a
lot worse for other industries than us, but COVID has had a material impact on us.
Volumes being relatively painful, mainly driven by why the UK factors which we'll discuss
later by driving test car sales that type of thing. The claims have beneﬁted from lower
traﬃc. Overall, we're pretty pleased with the half-year performance. As we sit here today,
we can see a continued reasonably bumpy to the short-term as we hopefully merge out of
the soft market cycle, and the COVID impacts, but we're increasingly optimistic about the
medium-term, and we'll talk more about our development eﬀorts, and how we think the
market will turn later.

FINAL

To pick up on the few of the highlights. We've maintained our leading underwriting
performance we believe, strong proﬁtability in returns. COVID has impacted the slow
return to car sales and the young driver impact has impacted volume. We continue to
increase rates over the market, we are continuing to price within our normal price in total.
Low claims frequency in H1 lower than anticipated in our pricing changes, which is why
which is why we're seeing strong loss ratio performance.
Reserving position continues to be sensibly cautious to reﬂect the greater uncertainty and
claims outcome, PI claims settlements are still slow because of relatively slow court
processes. Interim diﬀerent exactly in line with our corporate policy and continued strong
capital generation.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the operational highlights, our key focus will remain on high-quality pricing
underwriting and claims management. As the COVID challenges start to fade slightly
though, we are able to raise our sites and look at development and we're probably
talking more about future developments in this session than we have in any other
presentation that we've done. Some of the highlights here are that we continue to test
new data and rating factors, we continue to ﬁnd ways to exploit and building our own IP
within our rating.
The van products being updated, the Saga relationship has gone live as planned. And
importantly, we've now gone in place, a new front end IT cloud-based system that allows
speedy and cost-eﬀective launch of new product variants and we'll talk more about that as
we go through this presentation. We've continued to support employees and customers
through COVID-19. You mind, we haven't taken any government support nor have we
furloughed any staﬀ.
Having said that, the excess headcount claims has given us some short-term home to
expense ratio, we believe maintaining staﬀ is the right thing to do both the colleagues
and for the business, this positions as well to be able to accommodate growth in future
periods, which we do strongly, anticipate coming through.
We're very well positioned for the forthcoming regulatory challenges. We have no
concerns about anything but anything that's coming up and we've largely completed all
the work that's required for the host of things that are coming through. We've got the
enhanced focus on ESG and Adam will touch more that in his section and the MOJ
whiplash reforms have caused a bit of disruption if not chaos I would say, Trevor is going
to present three or four slides on this later. So I won't steal your time, now, Trevor, I let you
talk about what's happened after that.

Trevor Webb

{BIO 21909270 <GO>}

So I think if we look backwards while COVID is clearly not had the same impact on us as
(inaudible), it has had a major inﬂuence on our business. At the same time some other
fundamental industry changes, looking into current pick up on a few of them, the COVID19 restrictions materially shrunk ours and others addressable market. We know there's
been fewer new drivers entering the market. There's an enormous backlog of driving

FINAL

tests. I know my daughter has driving test, target got until next January in Leighton
Buzzard. I'm not even sure where Leighton Buzzard is quite frankly. So it's a desperate
time for youngsters trying to get driving tests sorted out. Those lower, those drives those
lower volumes haven't yet overwhelmed, so we're still seeing the pain of some of those
things as we sit here today.
We believe some competitors have almost certainly chase that reduced volume within our
view in correct prices, we have maintained our price of discipline through this. I think the
true underlying impacts could be partially discussed with the next six to nine months by
strong current year loss ratio performance across the industry. We've chosen, sorry, to
maintain our pricing discipline on this industry the sense upon of between maintaining
volume and maintaining our strong focus on proﬁtability.

Bloomberg Transcript

This is a graph that shows quite some all the past comparison websites. And if you look
coming into the early part of this year, we've made fee bases on 2019, 2020 to all over the
place to drop comparative numbers. Still signiﬁcantly down as we came through so the
ﬁrst quarter into the second quarter here. And only modest growth coming through now,
in the most recent weeks.
I think one upbeat note, if we look forward we are conﬁdent that organic growth will come
through and our investment in our front-end systems capability over the last year or so will
allow us to push much harder and I guess still help developments. So the price and
discipline has left us very strongly positioned to capitalize on natural growth. We are
going to have to earn through overall premium position for a period. We've got probably
for the ﬁrst time we're discussing new product launches in half, the second half of this
year. We're going to be launching our new ﬂexible insurance product under the
DriveSmart brand that allows you to buy and sort by the hour, day, or week or up to a
month. This is deﬁnitely a growing niche of people who want to ensure younger people
tend to your parents cars, the temporary periods.
We think, we're not sure how, but I think it's moved it on massively in premium for the ﬁrst
periods, but it's deﬁnitely a niche we want to understand investigate and we'll able to play
in as we move forward. We've got, Focus Machine Learning program underway where we
invested and invest more heavily in machine learning and looking at how we can deploy
those new rights into those distribution groups. So we're pretty optimistic that the
combination of market strengthening, and a developments eﬀorts will be well-placed to
grow into the medium term.
Look even further forwards, electronic vehicles, electric vehicles. We already enjoy electric
vehicles and we also ensure other proportion methods like hydrogen fuel cell vehicles
which Matt spoken about less. Importantly, how we pay a network is keeping track of that
and 93% of our network have started a qualiﬁed in new electric vehicles. So, we're
conﬁdent that we can write them proﬁtably and we pair them roughly at the same time.
This is the volume position. So we have seen good recovery since the end of Q1 we've
grown by just under 3%. Since Q1 grew consistently if modestly on a weekly basis. I guess
importantly, we also track our competitiveness on the breaker panels where we play so

FINAL

that is how often are we achieve this price growth can ﬁnd and how often are we the
policy that eventually gets sold
In recent weeks, we've seen our competitive position that was how often where cheapest
increase of about 5% to 8% but our sales here was more than doubled. So, we've gone
from about 3% to 6 % share of the sales that some of our larger brokers are making, so
good signs within that market that we think there's a light coming through to improve our
competitive position.
On the premium pack body, the impacts of COVID on the premium side, I think an
important point here is that expecting claims like it's happening past back to customer
certainly by ourselves and I suspect by most of the, the market. Currently traﬃc is back to
eﬀectively 100% with the old normal. We're seeing some slight diﬀerences, van is slightly
higher car is still slightly lower. Premium reminds down due to the lack of young drivers
we've mentioned. And the bounce-back in volume have been slower than we might have
expected. But we are seeing some signs of recovery.
On the client side, the short -- have been short term beneﬁts, the claims frequency has
been much lower than we expected, debt hasn't been that much the same proportion,
balance in this larger PI claims are still slow. The courts are still slow to get through some
of these cases. And I guess, the last point here is really important, which is the net impact
of what will increase work from home look like, diﬀerent traﬃc density, potentially higher
severity, because of higher speed traﬃc. What is that going to look like? And that's going
to take some time to normalize. So we are deliberately trading quite a cautious path
through this to ensure we don't lose control of the portfolio. We don't want to boom-andbust there's no point growing rapidly and then taking the paint for that in very unattractive
losses in future years.
This is a very important slide which has been in our last couple of presentations. We've
been very open in the softer market because we've been writing towards the top end of
our pricing corridor. So we would expect all things being equal, our combined ratio to
sort of start to move slightly to the right. As we got to 2022, we'll be taking decisions we
hope on whether we should take more margin or more volume or what the optimum
position is between those two positions. At that point, I think I can put (inaudible) and
Adam I think you're going to grab control of the screen and talk through the ﬁnancial
results.

Adam Westwood

{BIO 20481660 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Geoﬀ. I think I've managed to rest of control of the slides. There we go. So
hi everyone. Thanks for joining us, remotely this morning. Right, let's talk through the
ﬁnancial highlights for H1 2021. Also throw a result focusing on premiums claims
experience, expenses, and of course the dividend. So, here we are. Headline premium at
GBP78.2 million is down on 2020 which reﬂects the continued pressure on the top line
during the ﬁrst half. Geoﬀ has already explained how market conditions have contributed
to us giving up income in order to maintain proﬁtability as far as possible during a
signiﬁcant temporary reduction in the size of our addressable market.

FINAL

Our combined operating ratio was just under 75%, which reﬂects similar dynamics since
2020 full year with a strong loss ratio being somewhat oﬀset by a relatively high expense
ratio, mainly driven by that pressure on the top line. Investment return GBP0.6 million
continues to reﬂect the long term yield across the portfolio. Proﬁt before tax of course that
GBP22.2 million remains primarily a function of our premier income and the combined
ratio. With a decrease in earned premium and a slight uptick in combined ratio follows
that proﬁt is down in 2021, verses H1 2020, which consequently increase through into our
earnings per share as you can see here.
We remain in a very strong capital position and therefore declared an interim dividend of
3.7 pence per share in line with our corporate policy. After the payment of the dividend
our year insolvency coverage ratio remains at a very comfortable, 168% -- 169%, sorry.

Bloomberg Transcript

So moving on to the next Slide, which drills down into our combined ratio versus the full
year 2020. We can see that a very strong loss ratio has been somewhat oﬀset by a
relatively high expense ratio for the same period. The headline ﬁgures, our loss ratios
down to 44.9% while our expense ratios up to 29.5%. Also if you the loss ratio ﬁrst before
digging into the expense ratio. We can split this into the cost recorded in respect of
accidents in 2021, which is our current year loss ratio. Movements on our estimated, or
actual cost of settling claims recorded in previous years, which is our prior year loss ratio.
On the current year loss ratio this came in at 50.7% versus 55.4% for H1 2020 and 51.2%
for the full year 2020. Well, the current year loss ratio can be volatile particular across the
short period. This is indicative that claims experience during the period has beneﬁted
from lower levels of traﬃc, despite discounted policy learning through. There are two
things happening here. One while we discounted policies to reﬂect expected claims
frequency over the lines for each policy risen, the length and severity of the third
lockdown was greater than anticipated. And the current year loss ratio will show a
lockdown frequency beneﬁt in H1, but potentially a higher ratio in H2 to average out at
our target loss ratio. Both of which means that we will likely see an increase in the current
year loss ratio in the second half of this year, notwithstanding the normal levels of
volatility.
Our reserve position continues to reﬂect our consistent long-term methodology and
allows for increased volatility on the latest claims. We continue to see relatively slow
settlement of personal injury claims, which of course is also reﬂected within our reserves.
The prior-year loss ratio beneﬁt is in line with our expectation of long run -- run oﬀ of
around 5.8%, this compares to a beneﬁt of 2.6% full year 2020. We previously said that we
might expect a return to normal prior reserve beneﬁt around 45% a year, which regards
here aﬀect the runoﬀ of risk marginal open claims. So those multiple in line with that.
Right. Onto our expense ratio, which increased year-on-year to 29.5%.
So this next slide shows a bridge between that full year 2020 and the HY 2021 position.
We've commented on the previous year's that pressure on expenses comment from
industry levies increased all-in costs and the costs of running a PLC to name a few. One of
those costs remain high, they've not increased signiﬁcantly since the full year 2020, so
don't form signiﬁcant part of this bridge. In fact, we're continuing to reduce operating
costs throughout the business. Although that's, of course, oﬀset by normal inﬂation on
Page 5 of 22

FINAL

recurring expenditure. Instead of the main increase in costs of come from inﬂation wage
increases. We've continued to maintain our operational capacity in the strong expectation
will recover our policy count in the near future.
We remain forward-looking and careful to manage the risk of overwhelming our
operations should growth come quickly as it has done in the past. The main driver, as you
can see here at the increase in our expense ratio is therefore the reduction in our income.
While we do have a considerable variable element of our costs, a temporary diﬀerent
premium will always have an adverse eﬀect on our expense ratio as it has through, it has
done in H1.

Bloomberg Transcript

This next slide shows our allocation we invested our sales at the period end. During the
year, we continue to step carefully into a more diversiﬁed, but still very low risk portfolio of
assets. The highly rated corporate and government backed bonds perform well during
the year with no signiﬁcant down rates or losses. Our strategy centers on capital
preservation still, while attempting to earn a reasonable yield on low risk assets. Because
we generally hold all our assets in maturity. The amount recognized in the proﬁt is the
eﬀective interest on those assets which is reﬂective of the yield to maturity. Short-term
market value ﬂuctuations then come through below the line.
On the dividend, so our corporate policy as we've said previously is to pay a dividend at
the interim stage calculated as one-third of the prior year ordinary dividend. So
mechanical looking back as based on last year this time around is 3.7 pence per share,
which we're very happy to pay given the level of capital post dividend is a very
comfortable 169%. Overall approach continues to be to return excess capital to
shareholders with that excess being deﬁned with reference to our current circumstances,
while keeping the post year-end capital in the 140% to 160% range.
This interim dividend does leave us with a very strong capital position post dividend. We
will, as always review the capital position at year-end distribute any excess capital is
appropriate at that time. This next slide is one you'll be familiar with having shown a few
times in the past, which shows our capital position over time. As you can see, we remain
very strongly capitalized as we generate excess capital very quickly, our capital position is
tended to exceed our preferred range, mainly because of the time between calculating
capital available to fund a dividend and paying that dividend. We still continue to aim to
hold post-dividend period-end capital 140% to 160% range.
But on climate we recognize the climate rightly as a huge area of focus for company's
investors, while operationally we are a very small business, we're still giving to signiﬁcant
bought our impact on the environment and the impact of the change in climate on us. For
corporate purpose is to provide fairly priced motor insurance to everyone that means
we'll never penalize those you can't aﬀord electric vehicles by setting diﬀerent, diﬀerential
prices because depending on their environmental impact. But we will however continue
to provide fair color broadcasts, which utilize new and emerging technologies that Geoﬀ
already discussed as we've always done.

We're stepping up our eﬀorts this year both in terms of our impact and in terms of the
disclosure that we put in our accounts, with some external help, we intend to build our
carbon neutral roadmap and increase our level of disclosure before our year end results.
And with that, it's back to you. Geoﬀ, thank you.

FINAL

Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Thank you. Let me get control of the screen. Just one second. Okay. And as we can now
put in some market concept and particularly focus on to two bridges. This is the Slide
you've seen many times before, it's how we grow and shrink through the insurance cycle. I
would say that COVID has extended the normal cycle via around 12 months to 18 months,
we would have predicted this turn as we came into 2020. And indeed, we think there was
strong evidence that did happen.
We were seeing right go on as we discussed last time in Q1 2020, that reversed in the ﬁrst
lockdown kicked in. Since then they've been I guess ﬁts and starts attempt to increase
rates and lockdown the start of the slot. There is a risk that claims frequency beneﬁts that
COVID do blame some competitors the underlying position, all our rates, they hold for
slightly longer.

Bloomberg Transcript

We ﬁrmly believe that for many competitors' rates need to adjust very sharply upwards in
the foreseeable future. One of the large consultancies in the annual results reviewing is
predicting 2020 position of around 110% combined. That's pretty a much about it was in
2010, and that's a pretty ugly picture for the industry overall, we don't intend to let that
happen to us.
I guess, I can't view is, there's diﬀerentiated strategies amongst competitors. Some are
still want a bit of a land grab, (inaudible) and some are trying hard to push prices now, we
know again, for some of the feedback we get from our brokers, some insurers are now
decided that's enough, and I just put them on operate on them to protect themselves in
future years. Others, sort of know they're driving towards a brick wall, but you put the
price up, the volume goes down instantly. So, I think some competitors are still stuck in
the usual trick, but knowing what you need to do, but you can't -- because the volume
impact is too severe.
So there's clear signs of pain being ﬁlled in underwriters and brokers building pressure
from a signiﬁcant rate increases feels like the -- can still be shaping but that it's not just
yet. There's been some on the headlines around this. I don't think anyone's going to be
surprise that prices need to worry about. These are our usual weighing scales that we now
put in on whether price you should be going up or down in the market. The inﬂation
factors are exactly the same as the ones we outlined the full year.
On the deﬂation factors, we think at best modest whiplash reform beneﬁts certainly
there's some GBP30 and an element here of what will happen to work from home traﬃc
density as COVID impacts unwind. The wage inﬂation is still consistent, I think is coming
through is wage inﬂation we are saying that had the feature that does impact large claims
cost and potentially reinsurance recovery position. Might be a blip, and then we know that

Page 7 of 22

FINAL

perhaps some lower earlier people are not currently in the employment market. So we'll
see whether this is a blip or that becomes a long-term trend.
This is the sort of context, you put it into the full year and we've traﬃc lighting what we
think has happened. What hasn't happened so far? So we think the market will be has
reﬂected the appropriate level of whiplash discussed with you. We have -- we've unwound
the residual amount of COVID beneﬁts that's assuming there's no future lockdowns to
come. Probably not everyone is fully unwound yet. What hasn't happened is the quote
volumes increased that we saw in 2020, as a signiﬁcant bounce back after lockdown, we
haven't yet seen the market pricing correction. And I suspect we still haven't seen the full
impact of the FCA pricing review.

Bloomberg Transcript

So some things are happening in, some things are happening slowly, some things I think
is still likely to happen before the end of this year or possibly even in 2022. We're going
to give you some detailed on of the more fundamental changes. The ﬁrst one is the FCA
pricing review which I suspect most people are pretty close with. This was our read at the
sort of ﬁnal rules, go in line with industry expectations. Non cash equivalents can't be
used to disguise price walk in that reading is vouchers hopefully that takes away the rest
of the customers being showered with shopping vouchers the disguise the underlying
price.
Stricter rules on back book or transferring books are clearly anti-avoidance is going to be
a key focus of the FCA. APR being included. Generally, we think these are sensible rules,
none of these calls us any concern as we don't do ﬁnancial parts, anyway, and we are very
comfortable we can accommodate the reporting and the various rules that are there. At
this point, I am going to hand out to Trevor. He's going to come up here and he's going
to talk about the claims reports.

Trevor Webb

{BIO 21909270 <GO>}

Right. So, good morning, all. We thought it would be relevant just to sort of describe
where we are on week 9, after the launch of the Whiplash reforms because this was
certainly call out in terms of premium being expressed. So quick recap this is for
accidents, which occur on or after the 31st of May for the adult occupants of the vehicle
and that is also subject to a number of exclusions applies to claims with a value of up to
GBP10,000 in total where the personal injury element is worth no more than GBP5,000.
The idea of this oﬃcial injury claim service, or OIC as we call it is that climates can selfmanage their claim through a portal and don't need to be represented by solicitor. They
can take representation and the solicitor in the absence of any sort of legal expense
product, cover them will take a cut of the compensation. So very similar to sort of the PPI
model that most of us will be familiar with.
Whiplash claims in fact injuries to the neck, back and shoulder only with less than a two
year prognosis and a very valued now in accordance with the tariﬀ system, which is set
down by law. Other injuries, so injuries in in addition to a whiplash valued by reference to
the Judicial College Guidelines, which has been with us for quite some time. The claimant

Page 8 of 22



Company Name: Sabre Insurance Group PLC

Date: 2021-07-27

FINAL

can say, that their circumstances are exceptional, their injury is exceptional and argue for
an uplift in relation to that tariﬀ injury by up to 20%. Importantly, for claims within these
ﬁnancial limits, there are no legal costs recoverable, but in the event that the case needs
to go to court for some sort of arbitration court fees are payable and recoverable is
successful.
So Geoﬀ, thank you. So there is a signiﬁcant technology bill for this portal, code was even
dropped on the day before or within hours of go live. We believe that many of the law
ﬁrms and potentially some of the insurers were unprepared, we're ready, and we're still
seeing ongoing developments in terms of the technology built here. Claims that we've
received since 31st of May is suppressed. What we don't know is, how many claims
haven't been capable of being presented because the technology barriers. So, I would
say that, only yesterday, we received our ﬁrst claim from one of the big law ﬁrms that we
know had technology problems. So that's certainly an example of where claim volumes
are suppressed, but we don't yet know what the new normal is going to look like.

Bloomberg Transcript

Whilst this has been built for unrepresented claimants, the vast majority of claims that
we've received coming from law ﬁrms with a really a de minimis proportional coming from
unrepresented claimants. And that maybe because of the complexity, there's a guide to
making a claim that runs to 64 pages and the pre-action protocols that describe the
processes run to another 102 pages. And if there's a claimant, you want to go to court for
various diﬀerent reasons, there are 10 diﬀerent processes, each attracting fees.
Whilst the signaling is for claimants in person, this is a process to get up to adopt, it's not
without problems. So what are we seeing? We're seeing an increase in turnover or a
proportion of claims where there's an on Whiplash injury and for some legal ﬁrms, a 100%
of their clients have an injury in addition to the Whiplash. Again for some ﬁrms a 100% of
their claimants got associated psychiatric injuries when these claims have been
presented. And believe it or not, 75% of the claims of being to be exceptional in one way
or another which clearly is not exceptional.
So, all three of those will be strategies to increase the level of damages that are
recoverable and an eﬀort to get the claim over that GBP5,000 or GBP10,000 limit. We
haven't yet seen any medical reports. So what we don't yet know is how layering of
treatment and other costs are going to be progressed but we anticipate that activity will
take place. Certainly in the early days we were seeing some strange behaviors so people
using do not reply email domains. It's necessary to sign oﬀ for submitted claim with a
statement of truth will take seven of truth was being signed by the system run by an
individual.
Claimants using the old portal where costs are recoverable. We don't know whether that
was through poor education or just an expectation that we might miss it. And then
perhaps most tellingly I'll counter-fraud team busy with these cases, which would suggest
that the due diligence that claimant ﬁrms are putting into their eﬀorts of avoiding sort of
Trojan horsing, some potentially fraudulent claims through may not be as vigorous as they
were in the past. So it's something that we're actually putting a lot of eﬀort into in terms of
that upfront activity around additional counter-fraud for checks on these claims.

So, I guess that's sort of an early site of what we're seeing, but at the moment, it's still very
early, will these savings come through again, still very early to predict. Thanks Geoﬀ.

FINAL

Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Thanks, Trevor. So ﬁnal Slide a summary. So I guess the key thing is that we are remaining
resolute focus on our long-term. And what is that the strategy, we are going to continue to
prioritize underwriting discipline and proﬁtability on volume and we are centered on a
long-term mid-70s COR, but we wouldn't be surprised to see that move slightly up
through this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have seen evidence of growth emerging as we're going to Q2, I think you may be
getting the beneﬁt that the ﬁrst early parts and tailwinds in the market, we do anticipate
much more signiﬁcant tailwinds as we go into later 2021 and into 2022. We discuss the
COR, there is I think we should stress increased uncertainty on claims course in H2 we
don't know exactly how traﬃc volumes are going to move. We don't know how will
impact. We don't know if less traﬃc involves higher speed, high-severity claims and we
haven't yet seen what the emerging whiplash impacts.
So there are deﬁnitely more uncertainty than normal, our crystal ball is slightly murkier
than normal perhaps in terms of looking out towards the end of the year, and the early
part of next year. But we are conﬁdent on, is that, our pricing discipline has avoided any
risk of boom and bust showing growth now (inaudible) and on a very strong foundation,
we do expect me to take advantage of anticipated market price turn driven organic
growth opportunities with a lot more focus on self-help, and new product developments,
and we now have the capability to roll that out pretty quickly.
And we are very committed to use in our capital range to support an attractive dividend
while we earn through the software parts of the market. So I guess, in lots of ways, similar
messages to previous presentations, probably there with a slightly stronger focus on our
ability to going through non-market term driven elements.
Now at that point, I think, we're going to pause, I'm going to hand back to Hanro, who is
going to look for any raised hands for questions, he'll then announce you and promote
you to a panelist eﬀectively. So there might just be a few seconds gap between him
calling you and (inaudible). Hanro back to you, if that's okay?

Q - Analyst
Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker

FINAL

We have loud and clear

Q - Analyst
Hi, Geoﬀ. How you're doing? Thanks the presentation, as always, pretty interesting from
you guys any insight into the market. And the question is on the guidance, so the 70% to
80% combined ratio guidance. Appreciate you meeting this year will be sort of top end,
however, in my mind the guidance is looking like a real stretch for 2022 given the trend in
the expense ratio and reserve releases. And I think the consensus forecasting 75%
combined ratio next year seems quite unlikely, for it to normalize this year for COVID
would be probably above 80%. So, could you just give me sort of your expectations for
next year and what do you think about the current guidance?

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Yes, sure. Adam, you want to take that one?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Adam Westwood

{BIO 20481660 <GO>}

Yeah, sure. I obviously, I can talk a little bit more clearly about H2 this year, and then as
you move into '22 it becomes a little bit harder to forecast. I suppose, I would think about
it like this, before we went into the ﬁrst lockdown back in last year in 2020, we were
writing towards the top end of our combined operating ratio range required to open that
in a softer part of the market, as Geoﬀ's already said, that's where we would generally
move to. And therefore, understand the reason that at some point had there not been any
lockdowns, we would have been recalling combined ratios in that area, so
notwithstanding any priorities that might have come through and obscured that.
As lockdowns fall away, we eﬀectively return to that position, which means that potentially
H2 this year should -- would show a higher combined ratio at the top end of that range,
which then obviously would be 2021 results. 2022 is a slightly more diﬃcult one to call
because market dynamics could mean that we can put prices through, which would bring
that combined ratio on our written business down, or it might mean that eﬀectively it just
supports our inﬂationary increases and we would normally be careful not to bring our
volume down too far, obviously doesn't impact our expense ratio there. So, I guess our
base case thinking is that next year's combined ratio will be higher than this year's
combined ratio, stands to reason if we don't have any lockdowns then that would be the
case. But there are opportunities to bring that back down as well. Nonetheless, I think I
would guide cautiously to potentially being higher than this year next year.

Q - Analyst
That's really helpful. Thank you. And sorry, just one other quick question, just on pricing. I
guess I'm a little bit confused, and you gave some quite a guidance that you've grown the
book and your competitiveness has increased, that's quite positive for me in terms of
Page 11 of 22

rating of price in the market. But then you've got a damning description of something or
sort of walking into a brick wall, because they don't want to give up volume. I don't know,
what's your best guess of what's happened to pricing over the last few months and
maybe what we can expect the rest of the year?

FINAL

A - Adam Westwood

{BIO 20481660 <GO>}

I think, overall, it's been pretty ﬂat in most parts of the market. I suspect we are in a slightly
diﬀerent part of the market to -- the core mass-market enjoys, and maybe we're seeing
the early signs of that come through in our partner markets likely quicker. It could be
some people will start writing some of that noise in the business, it's hard to say. All we
can really say with conﬁdence is what we've done, and the output for that is we've
deﬁnitely seen our competitiveness improve slightly.
I think it's always a little dangerous to think about the market as being the listed players,
we're not really in the same game as (inaudible). I think now between those guys are
probably than less than a third of the market. So you've got a lot of the market is like the
ice berg, below the waves, and they're not going to have the same capabilities and in
some instances they're not going to be as strongly capped, plus they won't have the same
reserve releases from previous years. So, I do think it's important to think about the twothirds of the market that doesn't get the same visibility and the pain that might be
suﬀered there.

Our next question is from Ming Tzu [ph].

Q - Analyst
Hi. Thank you for taking my question. My ﬁrst question is around their competition. Could
you just give some color in terms of have you seen any Hauser [ph] and competition
change in the non-standard market? And for example, (inaudible) is an entry in the market
soon. And second is your claims information, is that still sort of in that 7.5%, 8% range,
could you just give some update on that, please? And the my third question is, how much
price increase do you need in terms of the market you write do you need for you to go
back to their 75% or better combined ratio? Thank you.

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Okay, sure, I'll take the ﬁrst one, and maybe Adam could pick up the other ones. I think in
terms of non-standard, we're not really seeing any change. Clearly, there has been talk
around the new entrant with (inaudible) with another guy. I don't believe they're
Page 12 of 22

FINAL

necessarily targeting the non-standard business. It's important to realize that within their
business, they already have complete cover and (inaudible), who've been very active in
the non-standard market, probably the more non-standard market, and has in fact for
quite some time. So, I wouldn't overly focus on only one competitor. I guess, Adam, do
you want to talk about the price inﬂation question that was asked?

A - Adam Westwood

{BIO 20481660 <GO>}

Yes. So, we're still seeing the price inﬂation similar to what we were seeing at year end. I
think as Jeﬀ mentioned earlier, we're also seeing the wage inﬂation (inaudible) remained
high, we're not on that (inaudible) injury claim cost.

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Yeah. And the third question Adam is really around, what price increase you need to get
back to 75%?

A - Adam Westwood

{BIO 20481660 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. I guess, without saying exactly where pricing is now, it's hard to say exactly what we
need to put on to get 75%. But if we were at 80% we won't have put it on not 5%, it
doesn't work quite like that, but that's the sort of ballpark. I suppose the way to think
about is that we still think inﬂation is at the 7.5% to 8% range, so we want to put on 0.5% a
month or a bit more 1%, to match claims inﬂation. We would want to put on more than
that to get that combined operating ratio down, if that's what we wanted to do, and it
really is a case of whatever the market can support, taking into account the impact on top
line sort of as well.

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Did I answer the question?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Okay. (Inaudible)

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

We have two questions that have come in from the chat function, so I just maybe deal with
those brieﬂy. The ﬁrst question is on, the majority of listed players (inaudible) stay
disciplined then put their rates. Can you provide any perspective on which players are
putting downward pressures on like any perspective on which players have started to put
through raising prices?
I think a lot of the list of the listed companies would have stayed disciplined, I think there
are diﬀerent strategies ahead of the FCA pricing the ﬁrms, which may diﬀer -- may drive
diﬀerent behaviors. I guess the perspective one who's put through rate increases, we
don't get that detail from our conversations with the brokers, they tell us about the overall
theme of what's going on with rates and they won't name names. If I was to guess, I would
say, typically if I look back at previous cycles, it tends to be companies that aren't 100%

FINAL

dependent on motor, they'll move ﬁrst because their main proﬁt is not a part of the
business and logically why would you burn proﬁt in motor if you could make money
elsewhere. So, that's been my theory for the last couple of years, and I would be surprised
if that doesn't come true.
The other question is one for you, Trevor. Can you help quantify what the impact of the
slowdown in PI claims are? And can we expect bigger reserve releases over the next
couple of years?

A - Trevor Webb

{BIO 21909270 <GO>}

Yeah . Thanks, Geoﬀ. From a case reserve perspective, yes, absolutely, we would expect
case reserves to come oﬀ as these claims settle. And just to give you some sort of context
or color around what we're saying is, some claims need to be approved by the court as a
settlement, so those are taking time to settle.
It is on the -- both on the large claims side and on the smaller claims side where there are
disputes over the liability or quantum. So yeah, absolutely, as that certainty comes
through from the court determination, then case reserves would come oﬀ. In terms of how
that thing gets adjusted through the IBNER, Matt might want to add to this, but clearly
where we've got less settlement -- certainty than we would have had in the past, Matt will
need to be reﬂecting that in terms of the IBNER calculations that he undertakes.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Matt Wright

{BIO 19297719 <GO>}

Yeah, that's great. I don't really expect much bigger though. It's yeah -- we have some -we have to take into account, what we think that (inaudible)

A - Adam Westwood

{BIO 20481660 <GO>}

That's right. Perhaps the way to think about it is that we obviously adjust our open case
reserves for what we expect the ultimate settlement to be when it comes to the actuarial
calculation at the period end. I suppose that actual settlement is somewhat obscured the
more open claims you have or if the settlement pattern changes it's harder to predict.
Where they're going to fall, so it might be that you pulled a little bit more in that reserve
to reﬂect that. I certainly wouldn't go as far as to say we're expecting sort of bumper
reserve release as a result of these things starting to settle, and we might ﬂip with that
clarity, it might yield something but I certainly would make that in any serious main
training models moment.

Q - Analyst
Morning gentlemen. Can you hear me?

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

FINAL

Loud and clear, Graig, as ever,

Q - Analyst
Just three quick questions, numbers one. Just in terms of year-on-year rate increases,
what did you achieve on average in the second quarter? And how does that compare with
July? That's my ﬁrst question. The second question is on underlying claims inﬂation of
7.5% to 8%, what would the year-on-year inﬂation be if you added back the frequency
beneﬁts in the second half of last year? I'm obviously trying to work towards a loss ratio
waterfall, so basically how -- what were the percentage points frequency beneﬁts into H1?
And the third thing is, in the 7.5% to 8% inﬂation, underlying for the second half, are you -does that include the IBNER for the delay in replenished claims due to IT issues on the
portal? In other words, is there we are -- do we expect a few extra points year-on-year in
the second half as IT issues get resolved?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Sure. Thank you, Graig. So, on the ﬁrst, on the year-on-year rate increase, I think this is a
really diﬃcult number to think over the last 12 months, because we've had various periods
where rates have gone up and down, to reﬂect various lockdowns, I think it's pretty
diﬃcult to give at the straightforward answer on that one. What I think we can say is that at
all times we have made sure we stayed within our 75% to 80% rating corridor, looking
forward from each month reﬂecting the lightly claims cost from proﬁt underline, claims
inﬂation, whilst allowing for the potential reduction that happened through that particular
lockdown? Matt, is there anything you want to say on that one?

A - Matt Wright

{BIO 19297719 <GO>}

No Geoﬀ, you've covered it oﬀ quite well. But yeah, with lockdowns it comes quite messy
looking year-on-year. But yeah, the aim is to cover long-term inﬂation.

A - Adam Westwood

{BIO 20481660 <GO>}

So Graig, (inaudible) giving a very easy number one, this one, (inaudible) , useful and sort
of more detailed. I think it's diﬃcult to give a headline number on that one year-on-year,
because it depends on what period (inaudible).
The second one was around underlying claims inﬂation, and what within the year-on-year
inﬂation number is, I think that's the question I got there. Matt, did you want to say
anything on that one?

the route.

Can you hear me?

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

We can. Yeah.

Q - Analyst
Yeah, I'm just trying, in the loss ratio in the second half of last year, what was the frequency
beneﬁt from COVID in terms of percentage points? That's really what I'm trying to get.

Matt, you have better handle for that one (inaudible)

A - Matt Wright

{BIO 19297719 <GO>}

We'll come back to you, if that's okay, after the call.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Analyst
And then just what is the 7% to 8%, let's assume in addition to the two factors that you
have just been maintained before, is that 7.5% To 8% inclusive of any pickup in whiplash
claims as the IT issues at the claims, the lawyers and the claim management companies,
get resolved?

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

I think we can say that we have tried to allow for that uncertainty, so we are publishing

Next question is coming from Nick Johnson.

Q - Analyst
Hello, everybody.

FINAL

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Hi.

Q - Analyst
Two questions, please. The ﬁrst is on the growth outlook. You're fairly optimistic again,
just wondering if you could perhaps sort of elaborate a bit on how much of the premium
growth that you hope will come through -- will start to come through over the next 18
months, how much of that is contingent on recovery in car transactions and new drivers?
And how much of that growth depends on price rises in the market? I know it's diﬃcult to
say, but any thoughts that you can give around the relative importance of both those
issues would be helpful. And the second question is on reinsurance cost, just wondered
what you're seeing on reinsurance rates and whether reinsurance rates are reﬂecting
lower claims frequency in the market? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

I'll start on the ﬁrst one. It's hard to say exactly. I think my instinct is that the majority of this
will come from price rises in the market. So I think the thing are interrelated, so if there's
low claims volumes available in the market, people are more inclined to keep rates lower
for longer to write the share of that reduced market. So, I think that has probably been
what's held back some of the price increases over the last few months, and included in
that will be a downward pressure on rates increasing if people are still needing to chase
volume in less volatile market. So, I think the majority will polygon from price rises, but car
transactions, driving tests, other things coming back to life will be something that drives
those price changes.
On the reinsurance side, I think an interesting point I'll add about the numbers is that the
ongoing discount rate is crawling back out of the box. I think it's fair to say in terms of
conversations around here, and that we know that the next discount rate we did, Trevor, I
think it was June 2024?

A - Trevor Webb

{BIO 21909270 <GO>}

Yeah. So, I guess if I pick this up, Geoﬀ, the frequency issues, so the lives loss frequency
issue isn't necessarily linked to overall frequency. So, higher speeds traﬃc has given rise
to some more severe accidents. There is the discount rate, it's already gone up in
Northern Ireland or gone down, so there's been some pressure coming through there
and there's some outlook that the discount rate, if it was set again today in England and
Wales, would deteriorate from where it was today.
And then, I think, the third thing is, because primary rates have been down across the
market, reinsurance rates (inaudible) same income needs to be putting their rates up,
Page 17 of 22



Company Name: Sabre Insurance Group PLC
Company Ticker: SBRE LN Equity
Date: 2021-07-27

many reinsurance will look at this on a price per vehicle basis. So, there's certainly
pressure on the reinsurance on the reinsurance side.

FINAL

Q - Analyst
Yeah. And to help everyone with their models, what that means for us is that there are
insurance renewal 1st of July was a high single digit relative increase on where it was last
time around, which was -- correct me if I'm wrong, Geoﬀ, but pretty commensurate with
the market rate increases on the reinsurance side?

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

We believe so, and potentially would be sort of the forthcoming renewals sort of towards
the end of this year could be pretty tough.

Q - Analyst
Yeah. That's very helpful. Thanks very much indeed. Thanks.

A - Geoﬀ Carter

To your hand remaining and then two in the written submissions, so we'll just go to
Alexander Evans next.

Q - Analyst
Hi guys, can hear me?

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

We can.

Q - Analyst
Perfect. Thanks. Just a quick one following up on the reserve releases going. You tend to
have a little bit of a seasonality, so is 1H is a little bit greater than 2H? So, is it fair to
assume that 2H is going to be a bit muted on that respect? And then maybe just in terms
of that sort of 4.5% to 5%, how do you view the impact of the sort of delay in claims
settling on 1H? Should we expect a little bit lower seasonality if there's a sort of increase in
settling in the second half?

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

Sure. Adam, do you want to take it?

A - Adam Westwood

{BIO 20481660 <GO>}
Page 18 of 22



FINAL

Company Name: Sabre Insurance Group PLC
Company Ticker: SBRE LN Equity
Date: 2021-07-27

I'll take the sort of seasonality point, which is that typically, yes, the ﬁrst half does
somewhat ﬂatter the prior year in favor over the current year, that's purely because there's
more development related to the prior year than the current year, because it's only six
months in the current year at that point. It's hard to extract exactly what the impact of that
is. Looking back over time, obviously, the prior year reserve release has been very, very
bumpy. Clearly, last year we had a big sort of prior year reserve release in the ﬁrst half,
and a very small one in the second half. But the scale of that diﬀerence wasn't really
driven by seasonality more, by stuﬀ that happened in the second half of the year, which
led us to watch through claims which otherwise wouldn't have been there.
So, I wouldn't over state the impact of the seasonality that something there, that's
probably why we are at sort of 5% or 6% rather than the 4% or 5% for this ﬁrst half for
example. But it's relatively hard to call, and that's probably the best answer I can give on
that one.

Q - Analyst
Okay. Thanks.

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

So, does that answer most of your questions, Alex?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Analyst
Yeah. Maybe just on the claim settling perspective, has that sort of impacted the ﬁrst half
on reserve releases and if we sort of return to normal in the second half, maybe that's
slightly positive?

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

I think potentially sort of referring back to my previous comment on claims settlement
patterns, we've tried to take a best view as to how those will resolve themselves and
record that in our current reserves. So, it really depends on when these claims start to
settle if they settle, similarly to what we've seen in the past or if they settle higher than
obviously that's a diﬀerent conversation entirely. So, I won't go as far as to say, we've got
claims settling slower therefore we're deﬁnitely going to have a big sort of prior reserve
movement in the second half of the year. There could be something there, but I guess by
nature an unsettled payment (inaudible) we don't necessarily know how that development
path is going to look if it is indeed changed from previous years.

Q - Analyst
Brilliant. Thanks.

Operator
So, before we move to our last live question for today, if you maybe want to address the
two written questions.

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

FINAL

I will indeed. So the ﬁrst one is, do you anticipate any changes in behaviors from cost
comparison websites over the next 12 months when the FCA pricing regime comes in?
And then any longer term changes?
Personal view here, I think the fact that we're very excited about the FCA pricing regime. It
doesn't mean the average customer knows that's happening. So I'm not sure in the short
term there will be anything that stops customers going back to cost comparison websites
to try to ﬁnd a cheaper price. Clearly, after a year or two of trying that and ﬁnding the
prices haven't changed much, maybe they'll start to become slightly bored of doing it.
I think it's important to put this in the context, but I believe that market rates need to
increase substantially. So, you may be sitting on a renewal from your system insurer, we
know that all insurers have diﬀerent views on price, so it's entirely conceivable you will still
ﬁnd a cheaper price on the price comparison website as we go through this next 18
months or two years period.

Bloomberg Transcript

Longer term changes, I guess. Yeah. Who knows? I'm sure they're thinking very
entrepreneurially about what they might do here. I'm sure they want to have a slightly
stronger relationship with the customer or maybe look at some of the ancillary products
that are sold around there. So I'm sure we will see strategy develop, but I don't think this
is going to happen instantly.
And the second question is how meaningful do you think -- Trevor, this one's heading
your way. How meaningful you think the whiplash reforms will ultimately be and origin for
something similar a little over a decade ago? However, ultimately had little impact on
industry claims cost?

A - Trevor Webb

{BIO 21909270 <GO>}

It's a good question, and a good announcement really. So whilst we don't write business
directly there, we are exposed to claims in the southern island, so we sort of got an insight
into how that model worked. And I think it's a really good comparison. The way we see
this is that we're going to rebase personal injury. It will take some cost out, but then
inﬂation will return in that sector. So, ultimately, will it reduce expenses a bit, but we will
see a return to inﬂation and particularly if we see ongoing pressure around wage.

Hi. Good morning. And I had two questions. Firstly, I just wondered if you could tell us
how much you think your target market shrank in the sort of the depths of the COVID
impact? And how much you think it's recovered so far? And I don't know, I realized you
sort of answered this with regards to Nick's question, but I just wondered how much
further you think it's got to sort of to normalize to get back to a normal environment for
you?
And the second question was actually just on the sort of below the line losses on the
investment portfolio. Did that certainly relate to sort of changes in the risk-free yield or
whether any losses on the corporate bond holdings for you've built up? Thank you.

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

I think it's fair to say that on a temporary basis, we saw a signiﬁcant impact on our normal
addressable market. So, we know there were very few car sales coming through the
lockdown period, and we know there were no driving tests at all, in fact no driver lessons
at all. So, people essentially might have moved on as learner drivers on their parents'
vehicles, who weren't supposed to be giving your children driving lessons.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, I think those two factors are pretty signiﬁcant. Just also some additional bits around
we think of -- see the stats on this at some point less convictions for motoring, people out
driving less, necessarily best business use. So probably average speed was down I would
suspect for some people. So, I think been quite a signiﬁcant impact on our part of the
market. I would want to put a percentage on it, but certainly meaningful.
Adam, on the investment income, that's clearly heading your way.

A - Adam Westwood

{BIO 20481660 <GO>}

Yeah. So it's the risk-free rate really as opposed to anything else. If you look at the last
year's fair value gains below the line, that was pretty substantial the other way around, I
think this is just the way these things have moved over the last period. The corporate
bonds have performed pretty well, and they're pretty highly rated bonds anyways so
they're not going to be massively volatile, and that's largely driven by rates rather than
sort of anything unique to our bond portfolio.

Q - Analyst
Okay. Great. And sorry Geoﬀ, just on the ﬁrst question, you're just not speculating as to
how much you've seen in terms of recovery. I mean, it sounds like from what you were
saying that actually while there's more to go in terms of young drivers coming back in
where we're not a million miles away from where things might normalize, would that be
fair?

A - Geoﬀ Carter

{BIO 20756770 <GO>}

I think there's still more to go. I think of any other bit to think about, as we've always said
around the culture of our business probably came from more the pictures [ph] on the
mass market. Now we know the market has been as overly competitive as it has been for
Page 21 of 22



Company Name: Sabre Insurance Group PLC
Company Ticker: SBRE LN Equity
Date: 2021-07-27

FINAL

the last year, we're less likely to pick up that fringe of mass market business with our
margin requirements. So, I think anything that has had a more material impact or has a
material impact as a target market. So that's the bit where we would expect to grow back
into very quickly as rates start to increase, in a way that we don't need to because we
maintained the -- we maintain our pricing foundations longer term.
