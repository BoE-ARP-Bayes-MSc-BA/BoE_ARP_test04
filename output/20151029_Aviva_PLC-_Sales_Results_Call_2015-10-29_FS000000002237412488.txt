MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to the Q3 Results Investor Relations Conference Call. Today's
conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr.
Mark Wilson. Please go ahead.

Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Thank you, operator. And good morning, everyone. And welcome to our third quarter
trading update. I've got with me in the room a number of my senior members of my
Page 1 of 31

team, including, of course, Tom Stoddard. And I've got a few of them on the phone as
well from different parts of the world.

FINAL

So we'll cover some of the key themes of today's announcement, and as usual, hopefully I
can get time for Q&A. So what do I think about these results? I think they are a
continuation of improving performance that we've had over the past, I guess, two or
three years now.
If you look specifically at the numbers, value of new business, as you know, our Life
growth metric is up 25% to £823 million. And I should point out, this is now our 11th
consecutive quarter of growth. UK Life, our biggest business, is up 36%. And the pensions
and platforms were again the real drivers of the growth here with VNB was up in this area
by 55% to a meaningful £66 million.
We have a systemic, I think, advantage here in the UK with our scale and our systems, and
the diversity of our product makes our proposition pretty attractive. And what it means is
we have more levers to pull, I think, than most. And we are starting to see the impacts of
some positive operating jaws (1:45) with the volume and expenses. And that gives us, I
think, a bit of a competitive advantage in terms of expenses as we execute this, too.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, the fund platforms is another highlight. The net fund flows there were £2.2 billion in
the first nine months, and it was (2:04) pensions net flows, £0.9 billion. Both of these are a
good result.
Protection and annuity VNB also grew. And when we report full results at the end of the
year, you will notice a far more balanced mix of UK Life business. You will recall this was a
deliberate strategy that started before the changes to the annuities market. We've been
able to execute – because we had a bit of a head start, we've been able to execute that
well, and you've seen that in these results.
Now, excluding Friends Life, UK Life VNB growth was 13%. I think this is actually a bit of a
misnomer. The UK Life business is now operating as a single entity, so we have choice
about what products to like and where and what system and what entity, so that does get
swapped between the two entities part of it.
In Europe, VNB is up 11%, led by Italy, which is 55% higher. I guess what a difference three
years makes. I don't think anyone, probably anyone in this room either at the time would
have envisaged this sort of result and the growth and the results we're getting out of Italy
just three years ago.
Poland grew VNB by 11% to £46 million, which is notable given the £8 million contribution
from regulatory change last year. Excluding this, the growth was over 30% in Poland. We
are doing some quite (3:35) things there. We've got some good, broad distribution, and
we have a fine management team in that business.

FINAL

Moving further east. I don't mean to (3:44). I mean, I see a bit further east. Asia value of
new business grew 21% to £115 million. This shows that, despite what's been some pretty
choppy Asian volatility, our market position does give us significant room for growth. And
maybe we'll get some better comment on that later from Chris [Christopher Wei].
The General Insurance result continues to be very satisfactory indeed, with overall
combined operating ratio of 94%. That's an improvement of nearly 2 percentage points
over last year. This has been led by the 92.8% COR in the UK and Ireland, while Canada's
result improved 94.2%. And, of course, weather here helped (4:30); it's been pretty
benign. But the underlying result remains very solid and we're pretty comfortable with
(4:37).
GI and health premiums are 2% higher over that, at a bit over £6 billion, and it's been –
we're now showing a couple of quarters or a few quarters of getting the growth back in
that business after a long time of decline and cleaning up the box (4:42), so I think that
business seems to have really turned a nice corner.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now today we're also announcing a five-year distribution deal with HomeServe here in the
UK. This covers home assistance products, which importantly diversifies our personal lines
GI business. Now this is our second major distribution deal this year and this is quite a big
deal. And it's nice for this business to be back in the front hub again.
On our UK GI back book, we have entered into a reinsurance agreement on our latent
portfolio. And this is particularly important. This is a significant deal and it has some
positive impacts on the group. It's effectively a portfolio of transfer of £900 million of our
latent exposure and about £800 million of adverse development cover. So that means –
and if you really step back and think what it means – it means we're protected from claims
volatility on meso, industrial deafness, abuse, et cetera, on approximately £900 million of
undiscounted reserves.
So this is significant. It was a long time in the making. We looked at it a few years ago, but
it was just too expense then. But with markets the way we are, we're being strategic and
extraordinarily opportunistic. So I think the team has (6:11). And what was – if you want to – I
guess, we would articulate as effectively offloading a noncore risk business from market
prices (6:25). And the impact, I guess, for you to focus on in business is it reduces
earnings volatility, which is nice.
In asset management, we continue to reshape the business towards a greater proportion
of third-party assets under management. The AIMS Target Return fund has generated
8.4% to 8.7% since inception. That is clearly outperforming peers. Euan and his team have
gained some real traction with Employee Benefit Consultants, and I'm confident we will
establish distribution agreements, and we already have (7:01) with various business
partners across the globe.
That business – it's still in transition phase, and over the quarter we exited some of the
shorter turns, so, I think, £4.5 billion of outflows and just a little bit under that in inflows.
And a point I'd make there is that the inflows were quite a bit higher margin than the
Page 3 of 31



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2015-10-29

outflows because the outflows were sort of technical short-term stuff, and again I'm sure
(7:24) put a bit more color on that later.

FINAL

On to our balance sheet, IFRS net asset value increased 2% over the quarter to £3.87 per
share. Our external leverage ratio is 27% on an S&P basis and comfortably within our
(7:42). And just as an aside on that, I note that S&P has revised upwards the financial risk
profile of the group, and they see it (7:52) balance sheet, so I think that is significant.
The economic capital position of the group remains robust with a surplus of £10.1 billion,
and an economic capital coverage ratio of 172%. Over the quarter, markets were, as you
all know, quite volatile. But this ratio proved remarkably resilient and moved, I might add,
entirely in line with the sensitivities we gave you at the half year, so that shows our
model's working pretty well.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are getting ever closer to the implementation of Solvency II and expect to get the
internal model approval in early December, and we'll publish our 2015 Solvency II position,
our target range, and our future roadmaps with our results in March next year. Now, what I
will say now is that we account the upgrading within our expected target range, which is
pretty much a similar comment to what I gave you at half year.
Now, the other major short-term priority is, of course, the (8:58) and rightly, is, of course,
the successful integration of Friends Life. And you know what? I get the skepticism of that,
given the history in the UK of integrations, but let's just be clear on results here. Progress
on the integration continues ahead of schedule with £91 million of run-rate synergies, well
over a third of our target within the first six months. And I think that is a very tangible
progress, and maybe it will take us another 12 months to get the skeptics on board on
that, but that's going very satisfactorily indeed.
Now finally, with the growth that we have reported today, particularly in our UK Life
business, I think we have put to bed the question of whether the Friends Life would be a
distraction for the business. Because it's one thing to get the synergies and results and
capital benefits and that sort of thing; it's quite another to get the growth. And we've now
done that for the last two quarters of integration with some pretty good growth numbers
across UK Life. I would characterize the Friends Life transaction as being proof of – proof
and more, in fact, of everything we expected it to be.
So, I guess on that note, operator, if I can – I don't want to go on too long in the
introductory comments. If we can open it up to Q&A. And with my colleagues and I, we'll
do our best to answer the questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now take our first question. Please state your name and company
before posting the question. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

FINAL

Good morning. This is Gordon Aitken from RBC. Three questions, please. First, actually,
Friends Life deal, with the UK VNB in Q3 discrete was down 14% in the third quarter versus
third quarter last year. Just wondering what's driving that?
And secondly, you're selling the commercial mortgages. I'm just wondering what that
does for your solvency. I'm assuming the proceeds will be invested in assets which do
qualify for matching adjustment. And finally, on AIMS, I understand it's like good progress
it's making there. And on the EBC, I'm just wondering off the major consultants, how many
buy lists are you now on? Thanks.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Okay. So let's pass it around the team a bit, so do you want to start with VNB?

A - Andy D. Briggs

{BIO 4311809 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure. Very happy to. So if – well, I mean, in the first quarter of the prior year, we had
significant – a big bulk annuity that we wrote into the Aviva last year. In the third quarter
this year, that was kind of replaced, if you like, by the longevity swap that we wrote back
into Friends entity. And it comes back to Mark's point. The business is now integrated. So
we're directing the mid to large corporate pensions all into the Friends entity. We have a
single combined best of both group protection proposition out in the market and the
(12:44) derisking activity, the – in terms of the longevity swap was focused in the Friends
entity.
So, I mean, we give you the 13% number so you've got a comparator. But I would focus in
on the overall growth, and obviously 36% growth in VNB we're delighted with.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Okay. Tom, you want to take the commercial mortgage?

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

Sure. The commercial mortgage transaction is really more focused on the sort of
derisking than creating capital benefits, so at this point we're now at basically the end of a
program of cleaning up non-core commercial mortgage properties in our UK business
here. But there is some solvency, too, and economic capital benefit here. We haven't
taken that through our numbers through the first nine months. That will show up for the
year-end. It's relatively modest overall, but there is a positive solvency impact of that
transaction.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

I mean, if you have enough reach (13:34), I've said before that we thought we were too
long in commercial mortgages, and there was also (13:41) quite a few years of messy
reserves that we had to (13:46), and it was just really messy. So I think we've taken out –
Tom, what, about £3 billion? It's about £3 billion or so that we've cut off the bottom end

Page 5 of 31



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2015-10-29

of that portfolio. And that's taken a lot of time and effort, but we have done a lot of
cleaning up, which should give everyone a bit of comfort.
And lastly in EBC, Euan on AIMS, you want to add to that?

FINAL

A - Euan George Munro

{BIO 2307409 <GO>}

Yeah. I'll add some color. And obviously, the big consultancies don't like us saying how
great (14:11) it does, but they're all paying attention, and we have no – in some cases, of
the major consultants, the highest possible rating both for our investment process and
also for our operational platform. So what we're now starting to see, we're at the very
beginning of being invited to fund (14:32) the institutional mandates. So the flows that
we've seen have tended to come from platforms, and there's retail customers investing
through retail and wealth platforms, and that's across Europe, as well as in the UK.
But we haven't seen the big institutional flows, because these guys are the gatekeepers.
And four or five of the big guys have given us ratings for the process to have gone
through and given us the full (15:03) operational due diligence and are at the point where
they're taking us forward to mandates. So exciting stage for my business asset (15:11).

We will now take our next question from Ashik Musaddi from JPMorgan. Please, go ahead.
Your line is open.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi. Good morning, Mark. Just a couple of questions. First of all, you remember you
gave some targets with respect to moving your customer base – sorry, product base per
customer from 1.7 to 3, and in this quarter you have strongly delivered in terms of VNB
growth and Life. So how should we think about this concept developing? Is it more
towards Life or is it – are you targeting more towards non-life? And any update on where
we are in the process. I agree it's too early, but any thoughts on that? That would be the
first one.
Secondly, on bulk annuity, clearly, there are some positives that came out in the quarter
such as infrastructure capital charge has gone down. I think there is more clarity on
matching adjustment and credit spread continue to go down. So what are your thoughts
on bulk annuity market at the moment?
And thirdly, in motor pricing and UK motor, any thoughts on whether you are trying to
chase volumes or is it still – profitability is still a key focus because your combined ratio
looks very strong at 94%. Thank you.

FINAL

Okay. Good morning, Ashik. Okay, three questions. So, we could identify there's now
(16:40) an average product holdings, and I think you're going to see – the initial results, I
think you'll probably see more of it going into things like GI rather than Life and also things
like AIMS.
We're using the base of this cross-sell as our pensions. And as you know, we have one in
four pensions in the UK. And at the moment, what we're doing is going through all sorts
of (17:06) testing and testing on these small pilots and samples. And I know a few people
on the phone have had a look at the garage. In Digital Garage, you can see what we're
doing there. And it's quite a (17:17).
You're not going to see any marked change this year, though. And there's going to be – at
the full year results, we'll give you some metrics to use to measure it and a bit of strategy
to model and, hopefully, we're just working through at the moment what the margins are.

Bloomberg Transcript

What I can tell you is the margins from our customer (17:33) the strategy and the digital
cross-sell are quite substantially higher than (17:38) margins. I'll tell you that much, but we'll
show you some of that – some (17:41), I might add, but we'll show you some of that at the
full year.
But you won't see anything this year, Mark (17:48), in the figures you won't see anything
much you can use for next year. You won't. The first stage is actually giving our, in the UK,
our 17 million customers using the platform and we've got all sort of things we're doing
there and we'll cover that.
Chris, do you want to add anything on digital, just before going on to other questions?
Chris is on the line.

A - Christopher Brian Wei

{BIO 17014406 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Mark. Just getting back to the PCC (18:13) point, I think we're beginning to
pilot new initiatives in markets like Poland, where it is digital delivery right across life,
medical, critical illness, accident liabilities, tenants, mobile device, travel, sort of a fully
combined packages, and that's really differentiated in the market. I don't believe anybody
else can do what we are doing. Single policy, single premium delivered digitally. So, more
of these things will take place in due course. I just thought I'd mention that as a sort of
representation of our innovative thinking.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Just quickly (18:46) a couple of questions as well. So, bulk annuities, yeah, we have said for
some time that bulk annuities do behave differently under Solvency II. All of the annuities
behave differently under Solvency II. I know that you can use the insurance to offset some
of those external (19:00) limited market on that. And I personally think rates are going to –
for both bulks and individual annuities – are going to change under Solvency II on the first
quarter of next year, and I think that's pretty clear. Andy, (19:14) you got a ...

FINAL

A - Andy D. Briggs

{BIO 4311809 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean, Mark, my broad perspective here is there will still be a strong demand from
finance directors to get rid of these liabilities. It remains to be seen how disciplined the
market is. Because of the flex of our product ranging, UK Life will be very disciplined. We'll
participate in the bulk annuity market if we can do so profitably and we won't if we can't.
But when you look at the pensions and platforms, business up 49% on the three months –
or the first nine months of the year. Protection, up 34%. We've got the diversity of product
range that we don't need to play and we will be disciplined.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

And lastly – and Maurice is on the line on motor, and the (19:55) question is – are you
going to chase volume? I mean, let's be clear on that. I mean, I'm still skeptical on motor
rates. People say the rates are softening, the rates are hardening. The fact is that our
motor is still difficult to make money in, and I think under Solvency II, it becomes more of a
little playing field because you haven't got the complications with Gibraltar and the tax
and the capital advertise you can get out of Gibraltar, so I think that probably helps us.
I think our PCC cross-sell position helps us because when you can add it on to other
products, it shows you get more length of the customer (20:31), tells us how long a stay
would you have made of it, helps your profitability a bit, which means you can give them a
bit of a discount, so it becomes a bit self-fulfilling.

Bloomberg Transcript

Maurice, you're online. You want to pass a comment on it?

A - Maurice Tulloch

{BIO 17683736 <GO>}

Yeah. Sure, Mark. And good morning, Ashik. I mean to build on that, Ashik, we'll never
chase growth for the sake of just growth. I mean, I am obviously pleased with the
progress in the UK overall with our COR down to 92.8%. We're starting to see some early
signs of hardening in the motor market. Towers Watson released recently that the
momentum in Q3 was around 5%. It's now 8% year-to-date, but we look at all of our
classes (21:08) and we pick and choose our spots based on where we think we can make
a reasonable return.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

I might add that no one on the senior team (21:16) at Aviva gets paid £1 or $1 for volume.
Volume is not what we chase. I know we're growing again, but that is not what we chase,
and it's just a function of business. Okay. Next question, please, operator.

We will now take our next question from Blair Stewart from Bank of America. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2015-10-29

Thank you and good morning. I've got three questions. The first is of the Asian VNB, how
much of that – if you just cite specifically China and Singapore, how much of the Singapore
business in particular is at risk from the loss of DBS? It's the first question.

FINAL

Second question is can you quantify the impact of the weather? I think, in terms of the 2percentage-point increase – improvement, rather, in your combined ratio, how much of
that was weather-related?
And thirdly, the impact from the reinsurance transaction on your economic capital was
quite modest. I think £0.1 billion. Would you expect a more sizeable impact as you migrate
across to Solvency II? Thank you.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Good morning, Blair. So, three questions, the Asia, the VNB from DBS in Singapore.
Singapore is about 20%, and I know Chris has objectives to fulfill that. Chris, do you want
to add anything on that?

A - Christopher Brian Wei

{BIO 17014406 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Thanks, Mark. I mean, the issue is not new. We've been working on a number of
different initiatives, and we are multi-distribution in Singapore. We are a leader in ISA with
a particular focus on protection sales, and we're very proud of that outcome. We've got a
number of new initiatives to deepen those existing relationships and sign up more.
In addition, of course, we're continuing to focus on A&H. That's a bit of a group focus, but
we have all the CPF licenses, including relatively uniquely Eldershield, which is a long-term
care program under the government schemes. There's only three licensees. We're the
only foreign insurer with that license.
And of course, we signed an agreement to continue developing FinTech and digital
regulation in partnership with the UK government and the MAS, so we have a number of
different initiatives. And last and certainly not least is as AIMS gets registered in Asia, in
particular Singapore, we will put some greater focus on wealth management and asset
management.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

And, Ashik, the other point is that this doesn't impact our profit because we keep all the
customers and they can't toss (23:53) the customers out into something else, just to be
absolutely clear. So it doesn't impact our profitability. As you can see from our results
today, getting VNB growth does not appear to be our problem.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

How much of that £115 million is coming from DBS? Is it possible to say?

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}
Page 9 of 31



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2015-10-29

It's about 20% – I don't have it exactly, let's just say over 20%.

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

FINAL

I think that's probably slightly over because that £115 million is for the whole region. So we
don't – I don't think we've disclosed the split between Singapore. But just to be clear, DBS
is 20% of Singapore only. That number was for the region.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

I got you. So it's pretty – and that was a good point on the DBS, too, which (24:36). It was
so modest in terms of VNB and profit. That was sort of the point. It was nice in terms of
volume, which adds a bit of scale but we can keep that.
Then your second question was on the weather. Tommy, you wanted to just cover that?

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure. So we reported an overall combined operating ratio of 94% for the first nine months
relative to 95.5% a year before. So it's a 1.5% improvement. About 2.5 points is weatherrelated. So the underlying COR is off about 1%. There's some large losses that occurred in
that. But otherwise, we're pretty comfortable where we are on the underlying. We have
benefited from good weather. I hope that continues (25:21).

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Yeah, please.

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

But the last question is about the adverse development cover on the latents book. This is
another risk-reducing transaction and another opportunity for us to free up capital in one
of our underperforming cells, and so we've indicated about £100 million benefit on
economic capital on a group-wide basis. At the subsidiary, it actually gives us a little bit
more benefit within that business. And on a Solvency II basis, relative to that £100 million,
there also is a benefit. It's slightly larger than that £100 million, but we're not disclosing
Solvency II numbers today.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Yeah. So, this business has been problematic for us for quite some time, so we're pretty
pleased to get this on the way.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

We will now take our next question from Farooq Hanif from Citi. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, everybody. I want to go back to the asset management business. Can you talk a little
bit more about when you think the short-term tactical low-margin stuff becomes less of a
drag. And when do you think you're going to go to kind of more solid net inflows?
Secondly, in Italy, what is it that's raising the VNB so much? Are you selling kind of the
traditional participating contract there or is there really such stronger than (26:52)
protection that's driving up margin? And lastly, are there – it's capital optimization like the
reassurance deal and the commercial mortgage deal. I mean, is that a big part of what
you see is the kind of your objective to improve capital going forward? So, excluding
Friends Life, do you think that's going to be a major chunk? Thanks.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, Farooq, (27:17) is starting you on this.

A - Euan George Munro

{BIO 2307409 <GO>}

Yes. Well, I think 2016 we'll see quite a big change. I covered earlier the attitude of the
main consultancies, the asset management consultancies that buy the big pension funds.
They have a fundamentally different attitude towards my business, and that just can't be
shortcut because you need to develop the track records and show them. But the benefit
extends just beyond being (27:47) so I think AIMS will certainly drive substantial sales next
year.
But in addition to that, we have great capability in areas like infrastructure, real estate
debt. And that's of interest to pension funds, and so I've got high hopes that we'll see
more of that. And simply, the rehabilitation of Aviva Investors brand is meaning that we
have been invited to pitch for institutional mandates in areas like emerging market debt
and high yield, which we weren't being asked to do that before.
And so when we talk about tactical mandates or – essentially, what that related to was two
years ago or – four to two years ago, when the consultants weren't supporting Aviva
Investors because our interim chief executive had uncertainty about his future. The sales
team had to target the markets that they took (28:40). And often, they were markets that
weren't intermediated by consultants.
And often, they also have higher turnover of assets. And we're very close, I believe, to
stopping those outflows. I mean, there always going to be stuff coming off your back

book. But the front book, the solutions, the infrastructure, the real estate debt, high-yield,
emerging market debt, a range of propositions that I do think are going to be the future.
So 2016, I expect to be a positive net flow year.

So, then, on Italy. Italy has rehabilitated itself from (29:24) to start. We have David with us.
Do you want to talk about how the VNB was [indiscernible (29:29)?

A - David McMillan

{BIO 17298829 <GO>}

Hi, Farooq. David here. Italy is quite simple. I mean, I think as you know, we've been going
through a transformation program in that business the last 24 months, and what we're
seeing now is the results starting to earn through. So I'll stick on two elements. Firstly,
there's the restructuring of two of our joint venture agreements with UniCredit and UBI
Banca in Italy, pushing a much greater focus on protection, and our protection business in
Italy is up 31% year-on-year. And indeed we have that trend right across our European
businesses where protection has been performing strongly.
The second thing that we did in Italy is (30:13) the market to really take down the
guarantees on those profits. So we've moved about 12 months ago to 0% guarantees on
those products – sorry, on the profit (30:24) products and we're seeing that earn through
to the VNB.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

I think the answer we had made in Italy is the advent of Solvency II has changed the
competitive dynamic in Italy and some other countries, frankly. So whereas the
competitors were selling high guaranteed products for a long, long time, we've been
operating on our economic capital, so we didn't, but then what we did decide (30:50)
then they took it down and everyone else has as well, and the market is struggling with
coping with that. And we are coping, so not only is our VNB up, but our competitors'
position has fundamentally changed. And I've said this for some time, I think our
competitive position on Solvency II gets enhanced. That doesn't mean a lot on (31:09) the
Solvency II philosophically. But they'll compare through that (31:12) competitively.
And on capital optimization, Tom.

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

Sure. So, capital optimization will be a big topic for Aviva in particular as we move into
2016 and 2017 and are trying to realize capital synergies out of the Friends Life
combination. I would say, though, that as we think about the two transactions that we've
just done around the adverse development cover and the sale of non-core commercial
mortgages. Those are more balance sheet clean-up trades. There is an element of capital
optimization there.
This has more to do with our risk appetite and, frankly, my ability to sleep at night, so
these are good things that put behind us some risks. They also reflect us being a little bit
Page 12 of 31

FINAL

opportunistic in the market. The demand on the other side of these transactions has been
quite high, so we think the pricing that we've achieved has been very, very positive, and
that's one of the reasons why we've been able to create both economic capital and
Solvency II capital benefits from the transaction. They weren't driven by a need to try to
raise capital, but they did have strong capital benefit for us because, frankly, the pricing
was so attractive in each of the two transactions.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

And we will be opportunistic on that sort of stuff. I mean, we had looked about those
things before and the license book we've looked at a couple of years ago and it just
didn't make sense. And if you can find something that's compelling, we're going to take it
and that's what it's going to be.
The other thing I might add on those two transactions, if we have a cash flow (32:38) in
that order, if you want definable, predictable cash flow, then you need to take some
volatility out of the earnings, and these you can do without losing earnings and you take
the volatility out. And so (32:52) the team. It took a long time to discuss and negotiate and
we've had (32:58). It was a good transaction.

We will now take our next question from Jon Hocking from Morgan Stanley. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. I have three questions, please. Firstly, on Friends. I wonder
whether you could give some color in terms of where we are on the run rate in relation to
(33:24) the numbers, but just in terms of the actions that have been taken up. I seem to
remember the first half you'd actually – actually, most of the premises you guys have
actually touched. I wonder if you could give some color in terms of what future things
need to be actioned to get the full run rate. That's the first question.
Second question, on the GI business, as you said you've signed two new distribution deals
this year, I wonder if you look going backwards, one of the things that has happened this
year, you cleaned up a lot of the distribution deals that weren't particularly profitable that
were signed sort of mid-2000s. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how the
philosophy has changed and how you think about pricing, et cetera, and what's different
about these deals versus the ones which didn't work out so well in the past.
And then just finally on the Solvency II communication, you said very clearly in the release
you're going to give the numbers in March. I just wondered what you were going to do
around the pay raise communication and sort of model approvals. Are you going to tell us

Page 13 of 31



Company N ame: Aviva PL C

in December that you've got model approval or are we going to have to wait until March
for the full numbers? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Okay. Morning, Jon. Just to put clarity on the trends (34:30) on the company, I think we
heard a couple of people mention that today. All we've done on the company side, we
have announced we're exiting. We haven't taken any benefits from that yet.
So another key thing, I guess, on the AI, I haven't actually seen any benefits come through
from Aviva Investors either, and I think that was in the original times (34:49) we think it was
about £45 million because we've only (34:54) so you're not seeing any of that in Aviva.
But, Andy, do you want to cover some of the things we have done?

A - Andy D. Briggs

{BIO 4311809 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Morning, Jon. I'll give you a bit more color. There's supposed to be five key areas,
so one is these (35:07) people head counts and by the end of this year, about 80% of our
people would have gone through sort of the lion's share of their integration journey.
The secondary area is site strategy. While we've announced what we're doing, we've only
implemented a very small proportion of that, so the majority of that is still to come. The
third area is combining up single best of both propositions on single platforms for new
business going forward. We've done one of those so far, which is group protection. The
others are still to come.
The fourth area is more of a kind of back-end IT and some of the back-end infrastructure.
And then finally, as Mark just mentioned, moving assets across to Aviva investors. So
although we moved Friends Life investments across, which was just over £20 billion in the
second quarter, we didn't actually take a lot of costs out in doing that, because as we
bring the (36:03) assets back in next month, which is about £23 billion of assets,
effectively, we'll have that revenue stream, which is over 14 basis points of revenue, and
we'll be able to do that with minimal increase in cost.
That then means that we would have about £45 billion of assets that we've moved across
from the Friends side out of a total potential of about (36:29) and we'll obviously look at
the other elements in due course.
So you can see while we've done a lot, there's still a lot still to come and we remain very
confident in our ability to hit the – to exceed the 22.5% (36:44). I'm certainly pleased
about the fact we're still delivering strong growth at the same time as that.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Thanks now. Maurice is on the line. I'll try to (36:54) paraphrase Jon's question, Maurice.
It's you've done deals before and didn't make money. Why are you going to on these
two?

{BIO 17683736 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. Thanks, Mark, and morning, Jon. I mean, Jon, one of the things when I got in twoand-a-half years ago, this is a business that was contracting at 10%. So, absolutely, one of
the things that was clear was to build a pipeline of opportunities.
But to build on what you asked in Mark's opening comments there, we're certainly not
going to do deals just to simply chase growth. On every single deal, whether it be a large
deal like TSB or the one we've announced today in HomeServe, we have to look at the
insurance fundamentals. We look at the pricing algorithms. We look at the underwriting
process. We look at how we're going to manage the indemnity side. We look at the cost,
and that sort of discipline is really – is the hallmark of how you run a general insurance
company. We also model various sensitivities as to what could happen against a whole
range of variables.
So that sort of rigor is absolutely now there. We've also won a number of smaller deals
like a small deal with Honda, a deal with Market Study. Certainly, we've learned from the
past that simply chasing the headline deal wasn't a good way to run a general insurance
company.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

I mean, the other thing I've said, the systems in the cost to pricing has changed a lot, and I
think you can see that in the numbers and it's just a fundamentally more industrialized
system where we control the costing on these sort of deals, and the partners in this
environment accept that approach since it is a higher degree of control.
On the Solvency II, Jon, was the third question about the comps, so we will announce
when we get the approval, so, in December – December 4, is it? December 5. We will
announce that when we have approval. We're not going to do anything more at that time,
frankly, because we don't need to. I think we've given you guys enough sense we've been
(38:58) – our economic capital numbers are in the ballpark of Solvency II. There's still a few
issues outstanding. I can give you a bit of color on those. And one of them (39:14)
transitionals. This is a market issue in the UK on the fundamental spread, and we're
working on that with particularly the UK government in the (39:20).
And then there's a couple of other issues hanging around but we've – the list has got
down to just a few outstanding issues for us now. And we're comfortable with where we
sit. So I don't think we need to do anymore communication then, because if we do that
without knowing the actual numbers for the full year, it becomes a little bit meaningless,
and we haven't got any burning fires we need to put out, so I'm not going to call any
analyst meetings to do that. But – so you get a full set of numbers in March.
You'll also get our target ranges. And you will also get the road map for where we're
going. So we'll give you a bit more color about when you can expect synergies out of the
Page 15 of 31



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2015-10-29

Friends Life and what other things we have and how that capital is going to build over the
next couple of years as well. So hopefully that just provides a bit of color – color and
comfort, we'll call it.

We will now take our next question from Andy Hughes from Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, guys. Three questions, if I could. The first one is on the HomeServe deal and the TSB. I
think you described TSB as being a big deal, but HomeServe I think is £300 million of
premium income a year. Have you got the renewal rights on that one? And it wasn't just
kind of new (40:42) business on these deals. And in terms of the kind of structure of
them, are they kind of heavy profit-commission deals? So we should probably expect a
relatively high combined ratio to the 92.8%, but relatively stable and very little capital
allocated to it?
The second question was on the – I think you hinted at it already, which is the benefit of
the ADC (41:07) to the internal loan. I guess the internal loan comes down by more than
£100 million. But is that kind of a much more material impact to the internal loan and
where are we on that now?
And the final question is generally on the Friends Life capital synergy. So you talked a lot
about Friends Life capital synergies being quite material. But in terms of the economic
capital number, presuming that's done on a consolidated basis, so is it of benefit to the
economic capital number or is it of benefit to something else? Thanks.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Okay. Morning. By the way, I noticed you said HomeServe is three handed (41:40). We
actually can't – we actually can't say what it is, but let's say you're in the likes (41:46) of the
ballpark. Maurice, do you want to pass a bit more comment to the questions on the
HomeServe?

A - Maurice Tulloch

We actually do have the renewal rights. As Mark said, we're not disclosing the deal
specifics at this point. What I would say, though, building on the question from Jon, we
look at all of these and this is not a diluted deal to the company.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

FINAL

Tom?

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

Sure. On the impact of the adverse development cover – again, I think we addressed it to
some extent here that it is a positive in terms of capital both to the group and at the
subsidiary level. Our plans around the internal (42:30) have not changed. We still got £2.2
billion target for the end of the year. We've got a number of actions and trains to make
sure we get that delivered, so really no new news there.
And on capital synergies, they benefit both economic capital as we currently compute it
and Solvency II capital. Again, most of this is going to arise once we are in the Solvency II
environment, so you'll be seeing it more in those terms, and naturally we'll be talking
about it more on a Solvency II basis. But again, those capital synergies are very significant.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

I mean, Andy, if you have a look at this on economic capital risks in Solvency II as we see
the – they're in the same ballpark. But, yeah, as of next year, economic capital becomes a
bit irrelevant, doesn't it, because economic capital is Solvency II, so I can design whatever
economic capital model I like, the tip of the Solvency II and give you 500% economic
capital cover if I really want to. But it's got no relevance because the one, the regulator we
use will be Solvency II, and we may disagree with a few points on it, but that is what it is.
So, theoretically, the benefits would include both. I think we'll take in less than £300 million
(43:40).

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

Right. We talked at the half year that we realized £300 million of capital benefits through
group diversification at closing, and again we'll realize more diversification and other
capital benefits over time.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

And we sort of had to take that, really, because we had to take it then, so we put that on
the numbers there as we had to take it.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Okay. And then what does material mean? Is it around the same level of £300 million or...

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

You know, I don't know how many times I've been asked this question but it's more than
once. And I can – you can assume, yes, material is a bit more than £300 million. That
Page 17 of 31

would be a fair assumption.

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

Right. And I think the £300 million was just one action and there is actually multiple actions
in train. So there will be multiple benefits here over time.

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning, all. Just three questions if I can. Firstly, could you clarify what you mean
about a roadmap for capital? Does that mean in March you will be giving the potential
capital synergies from the FLG deal?
Secondly, you gave the weather benefit of 2.5 points on your group combined. Could you
also give the benefit from higher prior year development, because I think you just spoke
1.3 points at the half year. And then, thirdly, at the half year, I think your combined ratio in
Ireland was about 93.5%. Most other people in Ireland, including people like FBD, AXA
and RSA, are suffering some very heavy combineds, sort of 110% and over. Could you
explain why you are able to outperform by 17 points?

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Okay. Good morning. So, the first one – I'll take the first one and Tom can take the second
one. At the road map, we will certainly give you the board timings, when capital is going to
connect, we'll give you a ballpark. I'm not going to put out specific targets because I don't
like doing that. But we'll give you a ballpark of what it means. We'll give you a list of the
key actions that we're doing and the rough time trends for that. So, think of it, I guess
we'll give you the sentiments mostly that we gave you in Channel 9 (46:02) just so you
can put something in the model.
I'm not going to give you absolute numbers. I think that you guys can build in the numbers
you think in your models. And it's part of the way you share (46:11) the market, I guess.

FINAL

Sure. Again, in making a comparison to last year, in terms of margin releases, actually, that
hasn't really benefited us relative to last year. We've been basically neutral there, so,
really, when you compare last year to this year, it's much more the story about the
weather, again, partly offset by some large losses that impact the underlying, at least as
we stated.
And then the combined ratio in Ireland, there again, we've just been disciplined. We've
had cost reductions, new management teams, and have just been very focused on – to
re-underwriting that business, so we've had very strong results there, in the low 90s.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

I mean, let's be clear on Ireland. We said for a few years now that Ireland, we didn't think
that market made sense on what was happening in the market. And we didn't understand
how some other people were present (47:05). I guess that proved – and we said
eventually the market will correct itself, and it has.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have put through some rating (47:12) there as well. We have exited some segments of
that business we didn't like. And our costs were just, frankly, way too high because
historically we had put in this massive regional (47:25) structure to Europe and Ireland. And
basically, we closed the let down and reduced the cost in the business. And you're seeing
the results on that.
So when I say we're don't chase a mark which we don't think is profitable, well, we knew in
our position with lots of levers to pull in different markets, we can reallocate capital and
we've got different business lines. Well, this is a good way we've done that and now
we're seeing the benefits of that.
So it's not particularly difficult. It's just keeping it disciplined. And sometimes you got to be
brave and take a bit of flak from you guys for losing market share and stuff and eventually
it will come right. And that we did lose a lot of market share to a couple of peers over a
period of time. And now just by sticking to what we do well, we'll pick it up again.

Q - Abid Hussain

{BIO 17127644 <GO>}

Hi. Morning. Just one question for you. Coming back to capital (48:31). I was just wondering
how comfortable you are with a Solvency II ratio, which looks like it's going to land in the
170s (48:40), especially given most of your peers are probably going to be materially

Page 19 of 31



Company N ame: Aviva PL C

higher than that. I was just wondering how do you feel comfortable with a 170 (48:53) sort
of ratio?

FINAL

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

I'm surprised you now so much about it, Abid. I'm not sure they do. But I'm not going to
comment on peers. What I'd say is, yes, it's uncomfortable that capital ratio we are
definitely comfortable with our capital ratio.
I'm not going to comment, obviously, where it's going to come out. What I would say is
there's two things to consider, isn't there. There is the capital ratio and then there's the
volatility of that capital ratio and the risk associated with it.
One thing I know for certain is that a diversified book is better than a monoline insurer and
should have less volatility. And I think you've seen how our book has performed over this
volatile period over the last three months, so capital will be a function of all of those
things and the risks associated with it and volatility.

Bloomberg Transcript

The other thing I would say, I think, with a lot of certainty is currently we've been operating
on the range we have and we're sitting on the right ballpark. And many others have been
operating on what they have seen as a much higher range. And one thing I know with
certainty is our relative position to our peers, I believe, is going to be a whole lot better.
And so, it's all about relativity and what your appropriate level of capital will be.
Now, we will set our range of capital appropriately as well. I said at half year, I thought,
let's say, 200% would be too high for us at the upper end of the range. And if in the
future, we get more capital synergies and the (50:25) go the right way and that sort of
thing, if we go outside the range, then we'll determine what we do with that capital, but
we're all on different ranges.
You will have – you can't – just to be clear, you can't actually compare country-to-country
so much either because there's no such thing as Solvency II. It doesn't exist. There's
Solvency II in here and Solvency II in France and Solvency II in Germany or Italy or whatever,
and they're all actually far more different than you think.
You can pretty much compare across the UK because the UK, for everyone that's based
here, we use a pretty similar approach from the PRA. So you can compare much more
accurately, and I think we'll step up okay. But you guys will be the judge of that when we
release the numbers, won't you?

Q - Abid Hussain

{BIO 17127644 <GO>}

I think that's the point. I mean, it's not being implemented equally across Europe. I mean,
do you think Europe will force some conversions later on in 2016 or how do you see that
playing out?

No, I don't. I don't. I really don't. Well, I mean, I think what you will see – you have elected
(51:31) a review of Solvency II in 2017 in terms of limitation in 2018. Is that right? Limitations
(51:37) in 2018.
Andy won't (51:40) answer today but next year he can. There's some things on Solvency II
that don't make logical sense or economic sense. And I think we'll get Solvency II in
probably a better form as we go forward and you probably will be able to see what that
will be in 2017 (51:57) 2018, and I think some of this stuff that doesn't make sense will
actually get fixed, and I think there'll be (52:03) pretty much a groundswell even among
the regulators, in particularly central bankers to make that happen.
So you might get more uniformity there. You're not going to get it quickly – well, you're
just not. But at the same, it's closer than we've got now. We noticed in other places like
Italy that there's people now that are using Solvency II. This makes us more competitive.
So I think perhaps I'm happy competitively with where we are, but Solvency II is a regime
that still needs some work as we go forward. And I think we can (52:34).

And the third one, I'd just like your thinking on this, particularly from Tom. There's been

Okay. Thanks. Three questions and that's (53:44) There's nothing we have announced
that really is having a material change. It's still an issue with the industry here in terms of
(53:55) fundamental spread. And that might impact our level of transitionals, depending
on the outcome it may go (54:05) transitionals may go down, but we're pretty
comfortable with whichever way it comes out to deliver the transitionals at about the right
level, thankfully, for what I think they are. UK Home, Maurice, do you want to pass a
comment on that?

A - Maurice Tulloch

{BIO 17683736 <GO>}

Yeah. Sure. Good morning, Greig. I mean, listen, one of the things that we benefit on the
home market is a pure multi-distribution play. We have – if you include TSB, we'd deal with
(54:28) four of the big five banks. We have a direct proposition and we also deal through
in communities. The market is competitive right now. That's somewhat fueled by nearing
20 months of relatively benign weather. But our book is holding up quite well, and we're
seeing rate movement in the sort of flat to up 2%.

And Tom.

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

Sure. And the last point on cash flows, stocked (54:50) cash flows. We think that when
we're in a Solvency II regime, that you're actually going to have much more disclosure on
our cash flows and sources of new business value and what's coming off the existing
business. And you'll be able to see the driver to that sources of earnings. So we think
you're going to have lots of information and be able to assess value generation here
going forward with the abundance of data that you'll have under Solvency II. So, from a
disclosure perspective, we're not going to want to have a lot of competing statistics such
as the extent that we're really driving our business more off of Solvency II, that will be
where more of our disclosure is focused on and we won't have sort of a repetitive
disclosure based on the old metrics around MCEV.

Q - Greig N. Paterson

{BIO 6587493 <GO>}

So, I mean, you will give us some kind of generational profile, so that we can see if, for
instance, a block of business is maturing and suddenly the OCG from that disappears. I
mean, that's the challenge that we have if you drop the EV disclosure.

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

No, we're trying to move ourselves towards an economic surplus generation disclosure
around Solvency II. That's the way we'll manage and compensate ourselves here as a
company, and that's the way we're managing all the business. As we transition into
Solvency II, we're doing quite a lot of work on our business planning, making sure that we
Page 22 of 31

got that thoroughly embedded into all of our businesses and performance metric, so that
is the way that we will be communicating to you.

FINAL

We're not looking to cut back disclosure just for the sake of cutting back disclosure. What
we're really doing is try to manage to something that is actually going to be fundamentally
more important for the business and the way we manage it going forward.

Q - Greig N. Paterson

{BIO 6587493 <GO>}

Yeah, just as a final thought, sorry. One of your competitors, for instance, overlays
reinsurance contracts that accelerates future surplus, and the markets, as a, arguably
(56:40) to try and pretend that they've got better cash profiles. That's the risk that you
run if you don't have some kind of stock measure on future cash. So I just thought – take
away that thought.

We will now take our next question from Alan Devlin from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

Q - Alan G. Devlin

{BIO 5936254 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks, guys. A couple of questions, just (57:06) general insurance, you said that the
results there, the combined ratio is more than adequate, but it seems to be driven a lot
by or rather offset by large losses. I wonder if you could give us a kind of (57:16) going on
underneath the products. I mean, what are the large losses, and why do you think the
combined ratio underlying it is more than adequate?
And then secondly, just following up on your comments on Solvency II, being the thing that
will make sense being (57:33) over the next couple of years. And there's some concern
that actually (57:37) the process in Solvency II, (57:40) harsher with the EFR, et cetera? And
coming down, I know it doesn't impact you guys but just wondered what your views are.
Do you think Solvency II will get more tougher for the industry as a whole over the next
few years or as the companies and the regulators understand the rules they can actually
get a little bit easier?
And just a final question, the longevity you (57:56) France and is there any reason you
actually go to there to France (57:59) France is not going on internal model until 2017. Just
wondering why (58:04) France, not Aviva? Thanks.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Oh, my. Thank you. I'm going to take the second one (58:09) first, which is the Solvency II
one, and I'm going to give you our perspective. Solvency II and IFRS, to me, don't make a
whole lot of sense. And mismatching of your liabilities which you stretch out to 30 or 40
years and your assets which are mark-to-market, just doesn't make sense to me. And I
think, many central bankers around the world would agree with that, too. And I think we
have the chance to change some of the things in Solvency II in the next round. And frankly,
I can say I'm already working on that with a team of people here and with some regulators
in government.
And I think IFRS4 gives us another chance to get that right as well, because I think the IF
(58:56) did it wrong, if I can just be really clear on that. But we are where we are and we
are accounting for our position is and in answer to your question, I think you might find the
pendulum swinging back a bit more to where it should be. And it's up to – it's incumbent
on us to make that. Now, it may not be risk management team, or other management
teams that benefit from that but I think long-term good of the industry we can get in the
right place. But I can tell you that is an active discussion. Now, there's a number of things
that are not going on the phone that we are looking to discuss.

Bloomberg Transcript

Once they negotiate because I think we're getting a lot of alignment with governments
and central bankers and the political policy makers on some of the issues we've talked
about. So, what can you do with infrastructure and how do you invest in the broader
profile of investments and how do you cut out the systemic risk that Solvency II inevitably
brings to the market, which I don't like, economically.
So I'm looking a bit holistically rather than looking at this just from Aviva perspective. And
we have started those discussions already, so I'm talking about some of the things that
are already in discussions, so we're getting ahead of ourselves with that.
The other two things, at GI, I think that's a question for Maurice, and then I'll pass on
longevity onto Andy.

A - Maurice Tulloch

{BIO 17683736 <GO>}

Morning. Morning, Alan. Listen, there's a number of factors that we look at in the General
Insurance and certainly, overall, I'm pleased with the progress and the results. But if I look
at specifically your question on large losses, and there are pricing models we put in –
weather loading we put in a large loss loading, so certainly, when we see large losses pick
up slightly as they have, that factors into that the loadings are in port (1:00:43). But I'd also
say that for every single large loss, we do our post claims underwriting review to make
sure it was the fundamentals of that risk. Did we understand the fundamentals of that
risk?
We continue to adapt our pricing models, and that's how we – that's the way we run the
General Insurance business. We've had positive impact in terms of motor rates starting to
move, weather is being benign. We've had benefits (1:01:06) for core business, and we
have had a slight pick-up in large losses.

Good morning, Alan. It's Andy here. Just on the longevity swap, the only reason that was
(1:01:16) Friends' entity was that we started the dialogue from the Friends side pre the
completion of the deal with Aviva. So – and therefore, just carried on with that. I mean, I
think I'm ambivalent whether we write things in Aviva or Friends entities, our plan will be to
merge them all into one entity at some point in 2017. And so, it happened this was written
at Friends entity here. We run it as one business overall, and hence I would focus on the
overall business and not be too concerned about the sub elements between the Friends
and Aviva side. It's one business now.

We will now take our next question from James Shuck from UBS. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, everybody. I had three questions for you, if I may. Firstly, just returning
to the integration of Friends Life. I think, Andy, you mentioned the term site strategy. I'm
just trying to understand what your views are in terms of the regional offices and the
potential to sort of close some of those down. In particular, I'm hearing that there was
perhaps some confusion around what actually happened with the Dorking office, so
perhaps you could just sort of lay out your thoughts there, please. That's my first question.
Secondly, could you just kind of say what your views are on the actual Friends Life
customer data. I'm presuming you've had access to this now and I'm just interested to
know whether that data is actually what you thought it was and whether you actually
noticed any positive or negative trends around that data?
And then my third and final question is actually relating to France. You obviously talk a lot
about cash and capital efficiency. I noticed that in France, the IRR in France is 10% and the
payback period is nine years, which probably would have come down at the nine months
year-to-date probably due to investment markets.
So I'm just interested why you're so kind of seeking growth in that market at those kind of
returns. I think sales are up 15% at the nine-month stage, so to me those kind of returns
don't stack up. Those are my questions. Thank you.

FINAL

Sure. Yeah. So, I mean, I think we've been very clear with both internally and externally in
terms of site strategy. So, we were clear very early on we were coming out of the Friends
head office in London, one you changed which we completed on by the end of June, and
that was in our half year synergy numbers.
We've been clear that the UK Life business is exiting Manchester, Exeter, and Salisbury.
And we are on track to do that, as we said, by the end of next year. And we've been clear
that we were going to reduce our presence in Dorking, focusing particularly on the
corporate pensions business there. And again, we are on track to do that by the end of
next year.
We also have been clear that we're reducing the number of properties that we're in in
London, Eastleigh, Bristol, Norwich, and York, and all those moves are on track as well. The
overall impact of this is taking 33% out of our UK property footprint, which will be a key
driver of synergies. Not much of that is in the synergy numbers to-date, so we've been
clear and consistent and will continue to be.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

On the customer data, maybe I can just take that quickly. So there's about 35 million
customers from Friends. The majority of those don't have intermediates associated with
them and that was particularly strategically attractive. At this stage, what we're doing at
the moment, is we're integrating those systems, which isn't just bigger but you got
transitional middleware over the top of those systems so the idea is you bring those
customers on to MyAviva, and so the first stage of that is given once MyAviva, MyAviva
platforms and then we can use the approaches and data and things we're doing. We've
also done a favored research.
So, so far, so good. What I said before, the trends still (1:05:40) different than before
(1:05:41) it includes the customers and the data, so now the next stage, of course, is
bringing them on, and then the next stage after that is increasing the average product
holding as you cross-sell GI and those sort of things, and we're working on that now.
And the last question was on France, David.

A - David McMillan

{BIO 17298829 <GO>}

Hi, James. David here. Our strategy over the last couple of years in France has been
pretty consistent. We've been trying to shift the product mix away from (1:06:06) profits,
which is longer payback, lower margin, towards unit length and protection, and we've had
a large degree of success in that. So the growth you're actually seeing in France over the
last two, three years has all come from unit length and protection. The protection sales
year-on-year are up or kept the same in France. As we effect that shift in new business
mix, you might be seeing the IRR going up, the VNB margin going up, the overall VNB
going up, and the payback period is coming down.
And I should say on unit length, I think we've led the market in France in having that 27% of
our savings business is in unit length. I think that's the highest rate or one of the highest
Page 26 of 31

rates in the French market.

FINAL

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

So the French business (1:07:04) and I think, though, James, your point on the payback
period is well made and that's why you're seeing net new businesses mix change. Yeah,
that takes a bit of a while to flow through to the numbers to make it work. But frankly, the
payback period on the old products – on some of those old products are unpredictable.

Q - James A. Shuck

Sorry. Sorry to interrupt you. No, I just wanted to follow back, circle back on just on the
Friends Life data. Can I just clarify, I mean, you do have full access to that customer data at
this stage. You don't need any regulatory approvals that kind of then allow these events in

Q - Oliver G. Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Good morning, Mark. Good morning, everyone else. Three quick questions, first on
Friends Life and the integration. I mean, from all – from everything you've said so far,
Page 27 of 31



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity

should we be assuming that the synergies could come through quicker than previously
indicated? So that's question one.

FINAL

Second question is on the balance sheet actions that you've taken, you've mentioned I
think in one case that there's a one-off charge. Is there any longer-term drag on earnings
from that? And if so, could you quantify that?
And then thirdly, just more broadly on Europe, whether it's Italy France, Spain, Turkey,
Poland, I mean, it's obvious that the margins are pushing up on the back of lower volumes,
so the mix change that you're talking about is sort of coming through. Actually, two points.
One is you don't actually separate out unit-linked from traditional savings, so it's not
pretty easy for us to actually tell the difference, so you might help us a little bit on that in
the future. But more specifically, how much further do you need to sort of change the mix
before you're happy?

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

I'm not sure if I'm happy. I'm not sure anyone on the table is ever happy, but first of all,
integration, you can see our numbers. I've said we are ahead of schedule, but I'm not
going to give any guidance today about that. I think you guys can make up your own minds
on (1:09:48) and stuff like that, but we actually were ahead of schedule.
Balance sheet, Tom, I thought you gave some of the disclosure, didn't you?.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

Yeah. We've talked about, in particular, the adverse development cover that there's a loss
of investment income of about £10 million per annum that comes from that transaction.
Now, again, we've done this to reduce risk and so we're hoping that this will actually
provide a benefit for us, and we look at sort of the bottom line after, after, after. We're
getting a lot of volatility in the latents book.
So, overall, this is a positive economic transaction for us. We haven't provided any more
detailed disclosure around the set of non-commercial mortgages. Again, because (1:10:27)
at the end of the period here, but we may talk about that further at the end of the year.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

(01:10:31) specifically on the drag?

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

No. Nothing. Again, it was already asked about. We need to re-invest those assets. We're
working though that right now, and that's an ongoing process. But there's nothing to say
about any particular drag from that transaction.

A - David McMillan

{BIO 17298829 <GO>}

Hi, Oliver. Certainly (1:10:52) with regards to margins, if you look across Europe, pretty
much all of our business lines now and most of the products are getting an acceptable
new business margin, which is not something I could have said two or three years ago.
And you can see that flowing through in all the markets. Italy year-on-year, the new
business margin is double what it was 12 months ago, so we are pretty happy with the
new business margins we're writing, as much as we'll always look to improve those, and
we'll always be cautious about which kinds of products and which kind of volume we're
actually writing.

Q - Oliver G. Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

If I can just come back on that. I mean, what proportion of your new business across
Europe is now still in traditional products with guarantees?

Good morning. It's Fahad from Nomura. Just a very quick follow-up question. Could I just
take a chase-up on Oliver's question on Friends Life run rate synergies? We obviously
achieved a lot of the low-hanging fruits of £53 million in one half months, £28 million in the
next quarter. Just for the next quarter, should we take the Q3 as also a lot of low-hanging
fruit or and (1:12:44) expect a big drop in the quarterly run rate for just for Q4? That's one
question.

FINAL

Second question, just chasing up on the motor stuff with Maurice. Sorry if I missed it. Did
you actually disclose what rates you booked through yield book, in UK mostly, and claims
of (1:13:00) level that you were seeing in the book?
And the final question is on France. Could you just give a bit more background in terms of
dynamics. We have a company recently IPO-ing and they're quite bullish on prospects in
terms of investment and flows, so if you just give us some color on underlying flow levels
that you see in unit length business that you see going forward in France and in terms of
competition as well. Thanks.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay, Tom, do you want to take any of this?

A - Thomas D. Stoddard

{BIO 15071280 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. So, integration again, we've got an extensive team working here. We disclosed now
twice the synergies that we secured. We talked today about the fact that we'll be
migrating more of the assets under management. (1:13:48) investors, and so by year-end
we'll be able to secure more of those synergies, so that should give you a sense as to the
pace of what's happening here.
Today's not an earnings call, but as you look forward, a lot of those synergy benefits will
be reflected going forward. We're securing them during the course of this year but it will
take time for them to actually drop to the bottom line, so you'll see that more going
forward in 2016 and 2017. Otherwise, we've said that we're ahead of schedule and that's
really all there is to say at this point.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

{BIO 6409810 <GO>}

Yeah. We're not going to give – we just aren't going to give anymore guidance on that. It's
good to say we're comfortable and a bit ahead of schedule, but we can't deliver quarterafter-quarter. So, I'm not going to give any forecast or guidance into this. Okay.
Maurice, on the motor question?

A - Maurice Tulloch

{BIO 17683736 <GO>}

Yeah. Morning, Fahad. What I disclosed was the Towers index indicated just shy of 5% in
the quarter and 8% year-to-date. I said our experience is in line with that. Just give you
some color for your model, the rates that we're currently getting are ahead of the claims
inflation we're seeing.

A - Mark Andrew Wilson

negative one yet, which is quite interesting. But can you add some color there?

FINAL

We've seen fairly strong inflows over the last two-and-a-half years, 2012 into 2013 and
2013 into 2014, our French VNB but that is (1:15:17). The biggest driver of that was a flow
from (1:15:24) profits into higher margin. I think it's fair to say that those flows have slowed
a little bit going into 2016. So as you look at our overall VNB for France, three quarters on
three quarters, it's more and more of this 7%. Quarter-on-quarter, it's about 9% overall. So
slight slowing in the market but still very positive flows going through that business.
