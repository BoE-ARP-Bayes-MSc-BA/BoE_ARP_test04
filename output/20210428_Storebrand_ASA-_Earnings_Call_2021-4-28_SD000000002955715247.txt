Presentation
Daniel Sundahl

{BIO 20548519 <GO>}

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to Storebrand's First Quarter Results
Presentation. My name is Daniel Sundahl. I'm Head of Investor Relations. As usual, we will
start with our CEO, Odd Grefstad, giving you the main highlights of the quarter. And
afterwards, our CFO, Lars Loddesol, will take you deeper into the numbers. At the end of
the presentation, we will open up for Q&A. (Operator Instructions) But without further
ado, I give the word to CEO Odd Grefstad.

Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Thank you, Daniel. ,Good morning, everyone. Storebrand reports a strong result and an
exceptionally strong growth in the First Quarter 2021. The proﬁt of NOK 870 million is
driven by continued growth in assets under management and insurance premiums. Unit
Linked reserve grew by 33% compared to the First Quarter in 2020. Assets under
management grew by 19% year by year, and is amounting to NOK 987 billion. Annual
portfolio premiums in insurance grew 14% compared to the same quarter last year. A
healthy top line growth has been combined with strong cost control throughout the
group.
The focus on sustainability continues. Storebrand has successfully announced its ﬁrst-ever
Green Bond issued from a Nordic insurer. A Tier 2 bond of EUR 300 million. Increased

long-term interest rates have improved the solvency ratio in the quarter. Given the current
interest rate level, Storebrand does not beneﬁt from transitional capital anymore. The
solvency ratio was 176% at the end of the quarter, an increase of 10percentage points from
the last quarter's underlying solvency ratio. Issuance of new subordinate debt also added
positively to the solvency ratio, while regulatory solvency factors reduced the solvency
ratio in the quarter.
Moving to Storebrand's strategy. Storebrand follows a twofold strategy that gives a
compelling combination of capital-light growth in the front book and capital return from a
maturing back book of guaranteed pensions. Storebrand aims to be the leading provider
of occupational pension in both Norway and Sweden, and continue a strategy to build a
Nordic powerhouse in asset management as well as ensuring fast growth in -- as a
Salinger in the Norwegian retail market for ﬁnancial services. The combined synergies
stemming from capital, customer base, cost and data across the group provides a solid
platform for proﬁtable growth and value creation. The ambition is to deliver a proﬁt
before amortization and tax of about NOK 4 billion in 2023.
Storebrand also continues to manage capital and a back book with guaranteed products
for capital release. This leads to our dividend policy of growing ordinary dividends from
earnings as well as an estimated capital release of NOK 10 billion towards 2030.

Moving to the strong growth across all our Future Storebrand. Unit Linked reserves grew
by 33% compared to the First Quarter in 2020. The growth in Unit Linked savings is driven
by premiums from existing contracts, new sales, investment returns and increased savings
rates. This gives a 9% premium growth year-by-year.
Assets under management, and Storebrand asset management increased by NOK 25
billion or 3% to NOK 987 billion in the quarter. The growth is driven by positive net ﬂow
from new sales as well as market returns. However this quarter, currency eﬀects fully oﬀset
the market return in the quarter. Within insurance, the overall portfolio premium grew by
14% year-by-year with a 40% growth in the pure P&C and individual life portfolio
premiums. P&C growth is partly driven by the portfolio transfer from Insr.
The bank lending portfolio increased by NOK 2 billion or 4% to NOK 52 billion during the
First Quarter. The portfolio consists of low-risk home mortgages with an average loan-tovalue of 55%. High digital interaction and activity among retail customers is contributing
to strong growth with a signiﬁcant high percentage growth in retail savings, 33%
increased year-by-year, and a 40% growth in P&C and individual life where onboarding
on the Insr portfolio is moving faster than planned, and we have already transferred close
to NOK 500 million in annual portfolio premiums by the First Quarter. The strong growth
in -- and digital activity demonstrates our position as a digital front runner.
Regarding Individual Pension Account, Storebrand experienced strong interest from our
customers, but low numbers in actual movement in pension accounts in the market.
We have, however seen increased activity on our digital platform from the introduction of
Individual Pension Account that has contributed to increased retail sales. It is very

FINAL

satisfactory to see that Storebrand asset management is the fastest-growing Nordic asset
manager in 2020 with a 15.17% growth. The growth is driven by positive net ﬂow from new
sales as well as market returns. We are especially pleased with the strong demand for our
private equity solutions from Cubera and our new partnership with infrastructure
investments.
As presented in 2020, a new growth area for Storebrand is public sector occupational
pension where Storebrand won its ﬁrst mandates in 2020, transferred into the balance in
the First Quarter of 2021. This has resulted in a large net increase in deﬁned beneﬁt
reserves in the Norwegian business of NOK 7.5 billion in the quarter.
Moving to the announcement this morning of the sales of Værdalsbruket. Storebrand has
connected strategic review of its ownership of AS Værdalsbruket and has entered into an
agreement to sell 100% of the shares in AS Værdalsbruket to Fabritius Gruppen AS, fully
owned by Gjelsten. As Værdalsbruket is the second largest private landowner in Norway
located in (inaudible) county. The main activity are forestry, sawmill and limestone
extraction. Storebrand has owned AS Værdalsbruket since 1935.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are pleased to have found a new owner who wants to preserve and further develop
the business in a good and sustainable way. The transaction is estimated, a positive
impact of approximately NOK 500 million on Storebrand's group result in the Second
Quarter 2021 and add 2percentage points to Storebrand's group solvency ratio also in the
Second Quarter. Completion of the transaction is expected to take place of May 2020.
And with that, I give the word to our CFO, Lars Loddesol.

Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Thank you, Odd Arild. Good morning, everyone. The First Quarter 2021 was a satisfactory
quarter with NOK 870 million in group proﬁt and NOK 671 million in operating proﬁt.
Revenues were up and costs under control. Insurance results were generally on the weak
side. More details on that in a moment.
Due to a higher tax charge in the quarter, earnings -- sorry, with the increased interest rate
level in the quarter, we are now entirely out of the transitional solvency capital, and the
underlying solvency is up by 10percentage points to 176%. Due to a higher tax charge in
the quarter, earnings per share after-tax adjusted for amortization is on the weak side. I
will revert to this.
Despite the signiﬁcant rise in interest rates, we have been able to maintain most of our -most of the customer buﬀers in Norway and actually increase them in Sweden. This is due
to good returns, the asset liability match in Sweden and a large portfolio of bonds at
amortized cost in Norway. The solvency of Storebrand is now without transitional capital.
The solvency has strengthened by 10percentage points to 176% in the quarter, primarily
resulting from higher long-term interest rates. This is somewhat below analyst
expectations, which may be attributed to a negative impact from symmetric equity stress
and other regulatory changes. Furthermore, strong business growth in the public sector

and the bank dilutes the solvency position initially, but as solvency -- or is positive to
solvency generation over time.
The regulatory solvency is down by 2percentage points as we no longer beneﬁt from
transitional capital. The underlying solvency is up 10percentage points to 176%. The
sensitivities show strong resilience to further market development. The solvency position
is more robust as the UFR is lower and the equity stress is higher. It means that it's easier
to invest at the solvency discount curve and that a potential fall in the equity markets will
be neutralized by a lower equity stress factor.
Fee and administration income is up 9%, adjusted for currency movements. The Insurance
result is signiﬁcantly better than last year, but negatively impacted by seasonal swings and
some one-oﬀs. Costs remain under control despite growth related to the acquisition of
the Insr portfolio and acceleration in digital investments, as communicated on our Capital
Markets Day in December last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

The most noteworthy item on this table is the non-payable tax charge of 41%. We have
currency hedged part of the investment in our Swedish operation. Accounting-wise, the
value of our investment in SPP will ﬂuctuate with the Swedish kroner and Norwegian
kroner currency cross. This does not have tax implications. The currency hedge, however
is a taxable ﬁnancial instrument.
In the First Quarter last year, we got a tax income from a stronger Swedish kroner. In the
First Quarter this year, we saw the opposite eﬀect. Furthermore, under IFRS, we have to
account for a tax liability on Swedish real estate investments despite the fact that this will
never lead to any actual taxes being paid by SPP. This has a negative eﬀect of NOK 44
million in the quarter, but it will have limited eﬀect from here on. The underlying
normalized tax rate for the Storebrand group remains at 19% to 22%.
In the lower table on this slide, we ﬁnd the same group ﬁgures, as on the previous page,
broken into our 3 result segments. Savings, Insurance and Guaranteed. Savings show
strong growth. Insurance is signiﬁcantly up from last year, but below our ambitions and
market expectations. Guaranteed shows a good quarter after strong ﬁnancial results from
the Swedish operation. Other contains the operating cost in the holding company as well
as company portfolios and debt expenses.
Continued strong growth and good cost control drives improving operating proﬁt in
Savings. The weak ﬁnancial result in the First Quarter of 2020 was related to the market
turmoil caused by COVID-19. The ﬁnancial result this quarter is slightly above
expectations. All underlying business areas show signiﬁcant improvements from last year.
Unit Linked Sweden includes a special income element of NOK 36 million. The result in
asset management has been reduced by NOK 26 million in performance-related
expenses due to good relative performance in many of our active funds. Earned but not
booked income amount to NOK 73 million and will be booked in the Fourth Quarter. The
ﬁxed result, i.e., the result without performance-related income or expenses, is NOK 181
million, the strongest on record.

FINAL

This picture illustrates continued good premium growth. A 33% growth in reserves and
Unit Linked as well as 19% growth in asset management. A combination of strong sales,
structural growth and good market returns drive the growth. If it had not been for the
stronger Norwegian kroner in the quarter, assets under management would have passed
a cool NOK 1 trillion.
The bank once again -- is once again growing after a period with ﬂat development. The
margin is satisfactory given the low interest rate environment. The insurance area also
shows good growth in premium income. Operational cost is up primarily as a
consequence of the acquisition of the Insr portfolio last year. Claims are negatively
aﬀected by a negative prioritization eﬀect in SPP of NOK 28 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

In P&C, we traditionally have larger seasonal claims in the winter, which is also reﬂected in
the results this year. Furthermore, the weak employment market continues to reduce
reactivation, i.e., it's more diﬃcult for people on long-term sick leave to ﬁnd a way back
into the workforce. The latter situation is an industry-wide problem and is expected to -or a nationwide problem and is expected to continue for at least the next quarter. We
expect a return to normal reactivation levels when the pandemic, hopefully, is under
control in the second half of the year.
The result in P&C and individual life is strongly up from last year. Health and group life is
weak due to disability and low reactivation, where the pension-related disability insurance
Nordic is hurt by both prioritization issue and lack of reactivation mentioned above. The
COVID-19-related reserve strengthening we made in the First Quarter last year remains
untouched and creates a cushion for long-term health eﬀects from the pandemic as well
as potential permanent changes in disability claims patterns.
Here, we see that the combined ratio ended at 98%, above the targeted 90% to 92%
following the issues commented on the previous page. There is strong growth in P&C
insurance and individual life with 40% growth in portfolio premiums. This is partly
explained by the takeover of the Insr portfolio, but also successful development in our
partnerships.
We are ahead of the business case for the takeover of the Insr portfolio, and we are now
targeting around NOK 700 million in new premiums to be moved to Storebrand by the
summer. The Insr portfolio is onboarded on satisfactory tariﬀs and we see no adverse
claims development.
Guaranteed shows satisfactory development in operating proﬁt and strong proﬁt sharing
from the Swedish operation. Deﬁned beneﬁt in Norway is weak due to risk results
impacted by higher disability claims and low reactivation. Guaranteed product Sweden
showed good results after realizing high ﬁnancial returns in the quarter, in particular,
related to a sale of a property that generated a nice book proﬁt.
The small reduction in reserves in (inaudible) is a result of 2 major elements: ﬁrst, we have
taken on around -- or NOK 7.5 billion in public sector assets after winning several public
sector customers as of January 1. This is good growth. The other major factor is a weaker

FINAL

Swedish kroner, reducing the value of the Swedish kroner assets as measured in
Norwegian kroner. The third element worth to notice is that Euroben has been reclassiﬁed
from a subsidiary under other to guaranteed products in Sweden. The reserves of
Euroben are around NOK 10 billion and proﬁtable and with low-risk to shareholders.
Due to higher interest rates in the quarter, buﬀer capital is in the form of market value
adjustment reserves, and excess value of bonds at amortized cost has gone down. At the
same time, we have managed to build reserves in additional statutory reserves and
conditional bonuses in Sweden. The healthy buﬀers we had coming into the year reduced
the negative results -- the result eﬀect of higher rates in line with the strategy and the risk
management policy. The higher rates have been used to extend the maturity proﬁle of
our bond portfolios to reduce interest rate risk and manage reinvestment risk. The
balance sheet is stronger than ever and guaranteed reserves as a percentage of total
pension reserves continue to fall.

Bloomberg Transcript

After the closure of Banco and the transfer of Euroben to SPP, what remains in the other
segment are the company portfolios of around NOK 32 billion, and the holding company
senior debt and life company sub debt of about NOK 10 billion in total. The ﬁnancial
result is negatively impacted this quarter by NOK 35 million due to repurchase of EUR 50
million of subordinated bonds, which will reduce the interest rate expenses going
forward.
One subsidiary remains in these ﬁgures, and that is Værdalsbruket. I can already now
guide you on extremely good results under this segment in the Second Quarter. To sum it
all up, the First Quarter of 2021 is a quarter that demonstrates continued strong growth in
our core -- in our strategic core. Strong ﬁnancial risk management that supports both
superior returns to our clients and resilience to volatility in ﬁnancial markets and a strong
balance sheet. And with that, I give the word back to you, Daniel.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) First with Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

So the ﬁrst one was on solvency. I was wondering could you just give us an idea of how far
you currently are from transitionals kicking in? I mean maybe how far interest rates would
have before you did get transitionals back or something like that? Very helpful. Second
one was on today's divestment. I'm wondering if there are any other similar assets you've
got that might potentially be looked at the strategic review in the future? And also

Page 6 of 17

whether there's any tax implications either from today's sale or any sort of possible future
sales?
The (inaudible) Was on Insr. You said it was going faster than planned. I'm just wondering,
are you able to update us at this stage on what premiums you sort of expect to ultimately
receive from it? And maybe if I can very, very quickly squeeze in a fourth one. Just on what
you were saying last -- just now your explanation of the sort of weak employment market
and low reactivation rate impacting the results. I just -- that comment seemed quite similar
to the reasons that you gave last year for the reserve strengthening.
So I'm just struggling to reconcile the comment that the reserve increases are suﬃcient,
but they're still dragging on the results. I'd probably missed something and there's
probably slightly diﬀerent eﬀects. But if you could explain that, that would be very helpful.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Peter, unfortunately, the ﬁrst part of your question disappeared in some technical issues
on our side. But I heard the last question. I will try to reply to that. Then you unfortunately
have to repeat the ﬁrst question. But on reactivation, it's correct that the explanation of
weak disability results in the third, Fourth Quarter last year as well in the First Quarter this
year is similar, i.e., as long as the situation continues with a weak employment market as a
consequence of the pandemic. And a lot of Norway and Oslo, in particular, is basically all
closed currently, we will expect weaker reactivation levels. However the reserves that we
set aside in the First Quarter last year were for the long-term eﬀects of long-term health
eﬀects of COVID-19, i.e. like people will have long-term sick eﬀects, not just temporary sick
eﬀects. And furthermore, that there will be changes in the long-term disability claims
patterns in society. So we set aside extra reserves for the long-term eﬀects of COVID-19.
But the fact that we have lower reactivation on a temporary basis as long as a pandemic
last is something that we are taking on in the results every quarter.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Perfect. The other questions I asked were, ﬁrstly, on solvency, how far you are from the
transitionals kicking in? And the second one was on today's divestment that you
announced, and I'm wondering whether you've got any other similar assets, which you
could potentially sell? And also whether there's any tax implications either from today's
sale or possibly any future ones? And the third one was on Insr. You said it was going
faster than planned. I was wondering if you now had a view on sort of what the ultimate
amount of premiums that you might get from that business is?

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Okay. If we start with how long -- how far we are away from transitionals, I think you can
see that on Page 10 in the analyst presentation that if interest rates were to fall by 50 basis
points, we would get about 11percentage points of transitional capital back into the
regulatory solvency. So I guess that's the best answer I can give, not exactly in terms of
basis points because it will depend on the whole curve and a couple of other factors.
When it comes Værdalsbruket, unfortunately, I cannot say that we have a lot of these type
of assets. It's been a long history with Værdalsbruket. It's been owned by Storebrand

Page 7 of 17

FINAL

since 1935. We have, of course followed that investment very closely. I think now it's the
right time to sell it and give it to a new owner. This is -- I see as a very good sale from
Storebrand, NOK 500 million in result and a 2% point in increase in solvency that will
come into place in the Second Quarter. But you should not expect us to have more of
these type of assets.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

And on the tax side, there's no tax implication from the sale. It's the tax under Norwegian
tax law.

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

And on the total insurance, Insurance -- no, Insr takeover. As I mentioned, we expect to
take over most of the portfolio by the summer. It will probably end up in excess of NOK
700 million in portfolio premiums.

Operator
The next questions come from Ashik Musaddi from JPMorgan.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Just a few questions I have is, ﬁrst of all, how do we think about the solvency ratio hurdle
of 180%, given that you have raised solvency debt into this quarter? Does this mean that,
that debt will be part of that to 180% hurdle going forward as well? Because in past, you
mentioned that you don't want to return extra capital, which is supported by debt
issuance. So that's my ﬁrst question. The second question would be, can you just give
some more thoughts about the movement in solvency ratio in the quarter? Because it was
lower than expected, and it was largely driven by the equity spreads and model
adjustment, et cetera. Can you give a bit more color on that as to why was it very diﬀerent
from the sensitivity that had been provided? Suggest us to understand like -- and we
don't get it wrong in the future. So that would be the second question. The third one
would be any thoughts on this Individual Pension Account, which has been introduced
this year? I mean how should we think about margin development going forward? Should
we be expecting like 1 basis point decline a year in terms of revenue margin or 2 basis
points? Or any color on that would be very helpful. The reason why I'm trying to get a bit
more color is given that you would have already seen some impact in First Quarter. So any
thoughts around the annual view would be great.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

If I start on the solvency ratio, I think what we have said that there should not be a material
impact from transitional rules when we look at 180%. That debt reﬁnancing and debt -subordinated debt is absolutely full part of our solvency ratio. There's no conditions
around that. We have a strong solvency ratio of 176% now. We, of course aim to be in
position, as we have talked about, to start share buybacks, hopefully in 2022.

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Page 8 of 17



FINAL

Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2021-04-28

I should say that the subordinated debt that we have issued now is part of the capital
management framework. It does not -- there is no reduction in terms of solvency level for
share buybacks. So it's part of an appropriate and good capital management structure of
the group. And absolutely no negative eﬀect, quite the opposite on our ability to do share
buybacks and regular dividends. In terms of the movement, there will always be some
model and assumption changes relating to the changes in the business, and it's diﬃcult to
predict exactly what they want to be beforehand because as soon as we build them into
the model or the business changes, it will lead to model and assumption changes.
In this quarter, they amount to approximately 2percentage point negative. On the
regulatory changes, there's a small uplift from VA, but the UFR is lower. The fact that the
UFR is lower, it's the solvency of approximately 3percentage points. But it must be also
said or repeated that with the lower UFR, it's easier to reach a ﬁnancial return above the
discount rate in the solvency model, which means that we will create more solvency
capital over time. And thirdly, the equity stress was up quite strongly this quarter, and
partly because of the way it's structured that based on European equity markets.
So European equity markets did well this quarter. That means that the equity stress goes
up, more than would be indicated by world economic -- world equity markets where we
have a -- we are more invested towards a MSCI world basket whereas equity stress -symmetric equity stress in the -- under EIOPA is more based on the European markets. So
I think that probably explains most of the -- that's about 5percentage points in terms of
negative impact.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

I just want to stress that I really feel that the movement in the solvency in the quarter is
strong and the negative eﬀect is actually also, on the long term, very positive for us
because the equity distress now reaches the level where it's not going to be increased
much more. The reduced UFR means that the hurdle rate going forward is reduced and
will create faster solvency generation.
On top of that, the very strong business growth is, as we have shown, with very high
double-digit return on equity. It's very proﬁtable. But of course at the 180% solvency level,
it will have some watering out the solvency ratio in itself, but it's the best way of creating
value for the group long term. So I feel it's a strong set of solvency ratios and the negative
elements is all for the good causes. We showed the picture on the Capital Markets Day
indicating that the bank solvency is 110% to 120%, that the Unit Linked business, 140% to
160%. But that means that when you add more business in these areas and you blend it
into 180% or 176% solvency, you get the dilution eﬀect day 1. But that (inaudible), it does
create more solvency cation going forward, it's proﬁtable growth for Storebrand.
It, over time, will reduce our -- reduce the need to have 180% to -- in order to do share
buybacks or special dividends. As indicated on the Capital Markets Day that could go
down in a few years' time. When it comes to the Individual Pension Account, as I said in
my presentation, there has been a limited transfers in the market altogether. But we will
see gradually the capital set of cases during the year being included in the Individual
Pension Account. And as we said on our Capital Markets Day that will reduce as we see it,

the result element from deﬁned contribution in Norway altogether with around NOK 100
million in 2022. But there is a strong growth in the portfolio. And already in 2023, we
expect to be at the same level in research generation from this portfolio as we see this
year and last year. Of course strong growth in combination with very strict cost control will
lead to a situation with continued growth in this portfolio after the NOK 100 million dump
in the route, so to say in '22.

The next question comes from Håkon Astrup from DNB Markets.

Q - Håkon Astrup
Two questions from me. The ﬁrst question on Insurance. Do I understand you correctly
that you think it will be diﬃcult to reach your combined ratio target of 90% to 92% in 2021,
I think given the headwinds that you expect from disability? That was the ﬁrst question.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

No. We still aim to reach 90% to 92% in combined ratio for the full year. And as you saw
last year as well, we had a bad First Quarter, but then we had a couple of quarters in the
mid-80s. So we made up for the shortfall in the First Quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Should also add that, of course the strong growth in the portfolios now comes in with cost
initially. But during the year, we will have much more income from the portfolios, and then
we also will have a better research generations, especially in other lines in P&C during the
year.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

We're also constantly monitoring the proﬁtability in the diﬀerent product lines and making
adjustments where needed.

Q - Håkon Astrup
Perfect. That was very clear. The second question, a bit more high-level one, and that is on
the bank. So how do you see the position of Storebrand Bank going forward given a
potential murder -- merger, sorry, between Sbanken and DNB?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Hope it's not a murder. But now, of course this Sbanken has been a digital foreigner in the
banking market in Norway. It's a highest customer satisfaction in the market. I think an
acquisition of Sbanken of from DNB open up the space for other digital-based banks as
Storebrand Bank. Of course we are very eager to take our (inaudible) share of the growth
in the banking market to expand our retail position that are in very strong growth, as we
see from the numbers this quarter. We look very forward to meet that opportunity. And
you see that the growth in this quarter of 4% points of more than NOK 2 billion in growth

of the loan portfolio. That is a good start of the continuing growth and development of
Storebrand Bank.

Q - Håkon Astrup

FINAL

And just to follow-up. So I'll just see a potential of diﬀerent strategic options for
Storebrand Bank going forward?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

What do you mean with strategic options?

Q - Håkon Astrup
Yes. I mean in the past, you have talked about that you -- that in future, for instance, go
into partnership with other banks or et cetera? Or do you still feel that Storebrand Bank
works best on itself?

We, of course always follow the market very closely. But we feel that having the bank
operation, together with the insurance operations and the saving setup in our retail
business, that gives us the opportunity to have the best solutions for diﬀerent groups of
customers. Adding these types of products together in good value propositions for our
customers and having a fully owned bank, that doesn't need to be the largest bank in the
market, but needs to be a good bank solutions, especially on the savings side, together
with our savings strategy. That is important. So we are very happy with Storebrand Bank
and are happy to grow it organically from the point we are today.

The next question comes from Ulrik Zürcher from Nordea.

Q - Ulrik Årdal Zürcher
And congratulation for a fantastic inﬂow momentum. Really happy to see that. But I ask
two questions. The ﬁrst one is you had a negative Unit Linked transfer balance in Sweden
two quarters in a row now. That's -- it's been years since you had that. Is there anything
speciﬁcally going on in that market we should be aware of? Or why have you been losing
some business there? Second question, I was just wondering if it would be possible to be
a bit more speciﬁc on the P&C claims ratio. That was up, I think 14percentage points Q-onQ eﬀect was just driven by the cold winter in Norway or product mix given your new
business? Or what was the driver there?

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

So on the negative Unit Linked balance in Sweden, we see especially one competitor that
oﬀers quite high compensation for transfers in the Swedish market. So we've seen some
more -- some transfers to one competitor, in particular, due to high compensation from
them. That's a very costly growth strategy. We've implemented measures to counter that,

and we continue to have high ambitions for a positive transfer balance over time in
Sweden. On P&C claims, in addition to normal seasonality swings in the winter, there was
also a runoﬀ loss for motor in the quarter of NOK 15 million, which is -- yes, we have -- so
that was more negative than we've seen in the past. Hopefully, that was a one-oﬀ runoﬀ
loss.

The next question comes from Blair Stewart from Bank of America.

Q - Blair Thomson Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

I've only got a couple of small questions left. Firstly, in the DB fee segments. I just
wondered why the fee income wasn't any higher on a quarter-on-quarter basis, given that
you've taken in the transfer balance from the public sector? Or was it just simply too early
to see any beneﬁt of that? Or is there something else going on?
Secondly, the loss of the group life contract, which was about NOK 275 million in
premiums. I just wonder if you can talk a little bit about that and what the -- if any P&L
eﬀect of that is, I'm assuming, because it's left you that it wasn't very proﬁtable, but
perhaps not? And ﬁnally, just on the pension-related disability line. I think you took a NOK
28 million hit from Sweden. Was that just an error in the previous quarter that had to be
rectiﬁed? Or was it something else?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Good questions, Blair. On the DB fee income, we -- the old DB portfolio is in runoﬀ, so
that goes down with premiums going down as well. But then we have the public sector
funds that came into this portfolio the way we book it in the quarter. And unfortunately,
not all of the income relating from that portfolio has been fully recognized in the quarter
simply due to the fact that we are taking on board this currently and some of the income -fee income related to that will be booked in the Second Quarter.
So that's only -- like the takeover procedure has a delay in the fee income recognition. So
your question is accurate and well spotted. On the group life loss of this one particular
client, the reason why we lost it is because we priced it in a way that should provide
proﬁts, and it has not been very proﬁtable for us. So losing an unproﬁtable client is
acceptable. It does lead to lower premiums. So we do have to adjust somewhat on the
cost side, but very limited. So it should not have any signiﬁcant P&L nor balance sheet
impacts in the short to medium or at all. On the NOK 28 million in Sweden, we were on
disability or sick leave claims in Sweden.
We booked NOK 28 million too much -- or a positive result, which was NOK 28 million
higher than it should have been due to a technical error during last year. That has been
reversed now. It was still very proﬁtable with disability insurance in Sweden last year, but
NOK 28 million less proﬁtable than what can be seen from the accounts of last year. That
has now been rectiﬁed, and we do expect continued positive results from this business
line in Sweden going forward.

(Operator Instructions) We have a question from Vegard Toverud from Pareto Securities.

FINAL

Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

I have three questions. First, Værdalsbruket, should you slow the sale price or conﬁrm that
you have booked it at around NOK 60 million in your account?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

We can conﬁrm that the sales price was a little bit higher than NOK 800 million, and that
means that the booking in our account was a little bit less than NOK 300 million.

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

But the reason why you asked about NOK 60 million is probably because it's been
booked partly in Storebrand ASA and partly in Storebrand Life.

Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

Yes. As far as I could tell this morning, it was a little lower, but we could follow-up on that
maybe on e-mail. On the transfer marketing, seems also that the net transfers of DC in
Norway are quite negative compared to what it used to be. Is there any change in the
competitive environment? And who are you losing premiums to here?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

It was very tough competition last year on deﬁned contribution contracts in the
Norwegian market ahead of, I guess positioning, ahead of the IPA, the Individual Pension
Account market -- no, sorry, yes, the Own Pension Account market. So we did lose some
contracts in the Fourth Quarter that were booked in the transfer balance now.

Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

Is it possible to say where these premiums are going? To which competitor?

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Well they went to diﬀerent competitors, but I don't know.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

No I think it was a lot of diﬀerent mandates and tender oﬀering from all the diﬀerent
competitors last year. We won some, and we lost some and it's, of course all the still -- the
large players in the market that both had some losses and some gains on that with DNB
and Nordea, maybe as the largest competitors to us in this market.

Okay. Then lastly, as you expect also a lower reactivation next quarter, is that already in
the accounts? Or have you provisioned for it now? Or should we expect also lower results
for the next quarter?

FINAL

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

No. I would expect reactivation to be low until the employment market normalizes
somewhat. And as long as Norway is closed, we expect lower reactivation and lower
disability results in the Second Quarter. But as I mentioned, when the whole service
industry and those kind of industries open up again hotels, traveling, restaurants and
cafes and bars. Hopefully, that will open up sometime during the summer or, at least, in
the Third Quarter. That should pull away a lot of that lack of reactivation that we've seen in
the last few quarters. So we try to reserve for the long term eﬀects, but the short-term
implication on reactivation has not been reserved for. So it leads to an expected weak
result but not losses.

Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

Okay. And could you then just potentially give some details on which lines will this hit the
group life and the DC-related pension in insurance and also some in the Guaranteed
segment?

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well that's what we've seen historically that we've had both in the -- some of the group life
contracts in the DB contracts as well as the disability in Norway linked to deﬁned
contribution contracts.

The next question come from Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

I have 3 more questions, please. The ﬁrst one was Swedish Unit Linked. The fee margin
was very high this quarter, 89 basis points. I'm just wondering if there's anything sort of
particular that was driving that? And I mean I guess given your comments about needing
to be a bit more competitive, might that put a bit of pressure on that going forward? Or
how should we think about that?
That would be great. The second one, I mean also in Sweden, you posted a very strong
consolidation ratio at 111%. I mean I guess that just means that the income you already
talked about should be more secure without meaning you can go up to the next level, but
any comments you can make on that would be very helpful.
Does it give you any sort of more ﬂexibility? Or what does that mean for you? And the
third one, just on the asset management net ﬂows, obviously very strong across the
group. Would you be able to split those into sort of Storebrand and Skagen? And any

Page 14 of 17



Company Name: Storebrand ASA

thoughts on the outlook there, sort of pipeline you're seeing, how that might develop
would be very helpful.

FINAL

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

Okay. On the Swedish Unit Linked margin, you're right, it was 89%, but it includes a oneoﬀ transaction fee of NOK 36 million. So adjusted for that, it's 0.78. That's in line with the
slow decline in the margin in Swedish Unit Linked overtime. So if you make that
adjustment, you will see a normalized development. On consolidation of 111%, you're
correct. It ensures that we will get the consolidation -- the indexation fee going forward. It
was booked with NOK 37 million in this quarter. It includes one more small portfolio in
addition to the one that you have in your spreadsheet. So you should expect that to be
slightly higher than it has been in the past. But you're correct, the next level before we get
a signiﬁcant jump in further indexation fee is at approximately 120%. So that's much
higher up. So it ensures that we will get the indexation fee, and it's slightly more than it
has been.

When it comes to the ﬂow in asset management, as you say it's a very strong ﬂow
numbers altogether. Of course on the Storebrand side, an example with the NOK 7.5
billion in transfer in the public sector is a very positive ﬂow in our captive asset
management business. But the very strong growth also come from alternatives, and
especially Cubera on a real estate side. We also now started doing very positive business
with infrastructure. So these elements are the main drivers on the external side for the
growth. Together with, of course our bread and butter business in asset management that
goes to institutional players. When it comes to more active business like -- active funds
like Skagen and also Delphi, we now see a very strong return. That's also, as Lars said, we
have very positive performance fees that is not booked, but we have to take, of course the
cost as -- on a quarterly basis. So we have a very positive outlook when it comes to our
active mandates due to the strong relative and absolute performance we see in these
mandates going forward. But the main drivers for the growth is, as you understand, the
growth in Storebrand as it comes from our captive business, but also very much external
business due to alternatives.

(Operator Instructions) We have another one in the queue already, and that's from
Thomas Svensson from SEB.

Q - Thomas Svensson

{BIO 17516221 <GO>}

Just a follow-up on the asset management ﬂow there. So your long-standing ESG proﬁle,
how do you think that will beneﬁt you for the next couple of years? Is it so that everybody
is green now. So you will not get an extraordinary mandates as a result of your ESG
proﬁle? And secondly, on the public -- and so far, what is the potential of the pipeline for
ﬂow of funds from the public sector in the next couple of years?

Well thank you. We feel that we are perfectly placed in the market with our ESG proﬁle for
our asset management. Been performing this kind of asset management now in more
than 25 years, gives us a very strong position for ESG mandates. That is, of course
important for all our business, but we see that the Nordic growth and international growth
in special is absolutely important with the ESG solutions we can oﬀer to the market. It's a
full very broad range of it from index funds that are very much ESG-linked without high
tracking errors to specialized funds, very focused on ESG. So that is a very strong sales
point together with the return in the portfolios and funds, of course. And especially in the
international growth that we have a breakthrough when it comes to international
mandates last year. We see this as a very important point going forward. When it comes
to the public market, of course that is divided into diﬀerent parts. Of course public
companies, that is an ongoing process, and we see large interest and ﬂow into the
business on an ongoing basis based on discussions for public companies. But the mere
municipality market, that has an opening in the end the end of the year. So that is an
autumn type of business. So we are now working on our dialogue with diﬀerent
municipalities. It's too early to say how large this market will be at the autumn of 2022, but
there is positive '21 and -- but there is positive discussions around
these mandates.

And the last question for today is from Jan Gjerland from ABG Sundal Collier.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Sorry, if this has been asked before, but the DCC in Sweden, could you shed some more
like into how it would work going forward? If you expect more contribution from taking
back money from the DCC? Or how should we read your strong performance-related
earnings in Sweden?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

I can try, Jan. Yes. I think in expectation, given changes in rate levels and how we look
now, we would expect somewhat higher recuperation of deferred capital contribution
going forward and what you have seen when you look in the rearview mirror.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

So not NOK 100 million every quarter, but sort of a contribution between 0 and NOK 100
million would be sort of what we should be put into our model, so to speak?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

I think we're going to be careful to guide in the model, but what you do see is that the
drag becomes less in the sensitivities, which we published in the supplementary
information, the drag from the low interest rate environment becomes lower each quarter,
and that means that we will, on average, have a little bit higher contribution from DCC
each quarter. But I don't dare to give a number.

FINAL

It's a lot of moving parts, as you know. Of course this quarter, very positive on the real
estate side as a gain on that part. But of course equity markets, credit spreads, how the
alternative is behaving on a quarterly basis have an impact on this. But having a lower UFR
and a lower hurdle rate helps for getting more positive returns overall going forward.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Perfect. Just back to the proﬁt sharing and the indexation fees, which is sort of the moving
parts as well. You touch a little bit on them and that indexation fees are to stay maybe a
little bit higher, as you said. The proﬁt sharing, how does that work when it comes to -- is
that on top of the indexation? Or how should we read that proﬁt sharing in a diﬀerent kind
of models?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yes. So the proﬁt sharing is -- in the portfolio with a proﬁt sharing, which is not in the
portfolio, which has an indexation fee works in the way that if you have a return above the
guaranteed rate, 90% goes to the policyholder and 10% goes to the shareholder. So you
can still have proﬁt sharing and indexation fee at the same time, but you need to have
suﬃcient return in the so-called EF portfolios in the Swedish business, while the
indexation fees is in the deﬁned beneﬁt or the so-called KF portfolios for those who follow
us very closely.
