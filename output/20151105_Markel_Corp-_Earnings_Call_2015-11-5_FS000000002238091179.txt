Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Tom, and I echo the good early morning to everyone on the call. I'm happy to
report that our year-to-date underwriting results are outstanding, contributing just under
$300 million to pre-tax profits for the first nine months of 2015. All three ongoing
insurance segments contributed to this result by producing a lower combined ratio
compared to a year ago.
While underwriting results have made a significant contribution to shareholder value, the
favorable impact from underwriting was muted by our investment results for the nine
months which were adversely affected by volatility in the equity markets.
Our total operating revenues grew 4% to $3.9 billion in 2015 from $3.8 billion in 2014. The
increase is driven by higher revenues from Markel Ventures. Other revenues, which
include revenues from Markel Ventures, were up 30% to $817 million from $630 million
last year, primarily due to our acquisition of Cottrell in July 2014.
Going back to the underwriting results, gross written premiums were $3.7 billion for the
first nine months of 2015 compared to $3.8 billion in 2014, a decrease of 3%, driven by a
decline within our Reinsurance segment. During 2014, we ceased writing auto reinsurance
in the UK and we also decreased our non-standard U.S. auto reinsurance business.
Foreign currency exchange rates also had an unfavorable impact on the year-over-year
change in gross written premiums. However, even at a constant rate of exchange, gross
written premium volume declined 1%.
Market conditions continue to be very competitive, especially within the property and
marine and energy product lines. Consistent with our historical practices, we will not write
business when we believe prevailing market rates will not support our underwriting profit
targets.

FINAL

Net written premiums for the first nine months of 2015 were $3 billion, down 3% from the
prior year. And our net retention was in line with the prior year at an 82%. Earned
premiums were $2.9 billion for 2015 and were flat to prior year. At a constant rate of
exchange, earned premiums for 2015 would have increased 2% compared to the same
period a year ago.
During the period, we saw organic growth in several specialty division product lines within
our U.S. Insurance segment, which was offset by a decline in earned premiums for the
Reinsurance segment for the same reasons I've just mentioned.
Our consolidated combined ratio for the first nine months of 2015 was an 89% compared
to a 97% a year ago. The decrease in the combined ratio was driven by more favorable
development on prior accident year loss reserves in 2015 compared to 2014.

Bloomberg Transcript

For the first nine months of 2015, prior year redundancies were $459 million, compared to
$260 million for the same period a year ago. As I have mentioned in prior calls, during the
first quarter, we entered into an asbestos and environmental Reinsurance agreement
related to exposures in our UK book, resulting in a reduction in prior year loss reserves
during the period by $36 million, which had a one point favorable impact to the combined
ratio for the first nine months of 2015.
In addition to the impact of this Reinsurance transaction, we experienced more favorable
prior year loss reserve development, driven by our U.S. and International Insurance
segments. The more favorable development in the U.S. Insurance segment is primarily
due to experiencing favorable development on our inland marine products in our Global
Insurance division for 2015 compared to adverse development in 2014, as well as the
impact on adverse development on our architects and engineers and brokerage access
number of our product lines in 2014.
The more favorable development in the International segment in 2015 is driven by case
reserve reductions for a small number of large, general liability and professional liability
claim. Lastly, our 2014 results included $27 million of adverse development on our
asbestos and environmental reserves. We completed our 2015 asbestos and
environmental review in the third quarter without adjustment to held reserves.
Before moving on, I would also like to comment on the second asbestos and
environmental Reinsurance transaction which we reported as a subsequent event in our
Form 10-Q. Late last week, we completed a retrospective Reinsurance transaction to cede
a portion of our U.S. asbestos and environmental exposures.
The impact to earnings, if any, resulting from a change in the estimated volatility of our
consolidated net reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as a result of
this transaction will be reflected in our fourth quarter results of operations.
While we recognize that the two 2015 ceded Reinsurance transactions related to our
asbestos and environmental reserves will have the short term impact of reducing

investment income, we have significantly reduced the future uncertainty around these
exposures and have increased our flexibility regarding capital allocation.

FINAL

Moving on to Markel Ventures, on a year-to-date basis, revenues from Markel Ventures
were $784 million compared to $595 million from the same period a year ago. Net income
to shareholder from Markel Ventures for the nine-month period was $14 million in 2015
compared to $16 million in 2014.
EBITDA was $76 million in 2015 compared to $66 million in 2014. The increase in revenues
from our Markel Ventures operations during 2015 was primarily due to our acquisition of
Cottrell in July of 2014. Additionally, we have experienced higher revenues within our
other manufacturing operations due in part to higher sales volume in 2015 compared to
2014.
Likewise, EBITDA from our Markel Ventures operations increased in 2015, primarily due to
our acquisition of Cottrell and more favorable results within our manufacturing operations.
This increase was partially offset by an increase in our estimate of the contingent
consideration obligation associated with the acquisition of Cottrell.

Bloomberg Transcript

As I mentioned last quarter, a portion of the purchase consideration for Cottrell is based
on their post-acquisition earnings through 2015, which we expect will exceed our initial
projection. As a result, our estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration
increased by $27 million in 2015. The decrease in Markel Ventures net income for the first
nine months of 2015 is also a result of the contingent consideration adjustment for
Cottrell.
Turning to our investment results, net investment income for the first nine months of 2015
was essentially flat to year ago coming in at $271 million. Net realized investment losses
for 2015 were $3 million compared to net realized investment gains of $29 million a year
ago.
The net realized investment losses in 2015 were driven by $23 million adjustment for
other-than-temporary impairments attributable to equity securities. Net realized
investment gains in 2014 included $4 million of other-than-temporary impairments.
Net unrealized investment gains decreased $397 million for the first nine months of 2015
compared to an increase of $499 million for the same period last year. The declines in net
unrealized investment gains this year was attributable to decreases in the fair value of our
equity and fixed maturity portfolios compared to prior year end.
Looking at our total results for the year, our expected tax rate was 21% in 2015 compared
to 25% a year ago. The decrease in the tax rate in 2015 was driven by foreign tax credits
for foreign taxes paid. In previous periods, taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions were not
available for use as tax credits against our U.S. provision for income tax.

FINAL

In 2015, we anticipate a sufficient amount of earnings from our foreign operations will be
taxable in the U.S. This will allow us to recognize the benefit of significant foreign tax
credits against our U.S. provision for income taxes. A similar benefit may not be available
in future years.
We reported net income to shareholders of $385 million in the first nine months of 2015
compared to $204 million a year ago. Comprehensive income for the period was $98
million compared to $517 million a year ago. And as a result, book value per share at the
end of September 2015 was $552 an increase of 1% since the end of 2014.
Finally, I'll make a couple of the comments on cash flows and the balance sheet. Net cash
provided by operating activities was $550 million for the first nine months of 2015
compared to $537 million for the same period of 2014. Operating cash flows for 2015
included higher cash flows from our Markel Ventures operations partially offset by higher
payments for income taxes compared to the same period of 2014.
Operating cash flows for the period was net of approximately $70 million of cash paid in
connection with the first quarter 2015 asbestos and environmental reinsurance transaction
that I have previously mentioned and $29 million of cash paid to complete innovation that
transferred our obligations under a reinsurance contract for life and annuity benefits to a
third-party. Invested assets at the holding company were $1.3 billion at September 30,
2015, compared to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2014.

Bloomberg Transcript

With that, I will turn it over to Mike to talk about the U.S. Insurance segment.

F. Michael Crowley

{BIO 6836605 <GO>}

Thanks, Anne, good morning. As we mentioned earlier, U.S. Insurance segment comprises
all direct business written on our U.S. Insurance companies and includes all of the
underwriting results for wholesale and specialty divisions, as well as certain products
written by our Global Insurance team.
Gross written premiums for the U.S. segment were $1.9 billion for the first nine months of
2015, an increase of 1% over prior year. This increase is due to continued growth in our
wholesale division casualty lines, as well as our Hagerty classic car program and our
worker's comp product lines, both within our specialty division.
Partly offsetting this favorability are declines in our wholesale property, excess in umbrella
and environmental lines. As mentioned in previous calls, we have also exited certain lines
of business.
We maintained our underwriting discipline throughout the year. The U.S. Insurance
segment combined ratio for the third quarter of 2015 was 90%, compared to 95% for the
same period a year ago. The combined ratio for the year was 89%, compared to 97% for
the nine months ended September 30, 2014.

FINAL

The decrease in the combined ratio for the year is driven by more favorable development
of prior accident years' loss reserves as well as lower current accident year loss ratio and
a lower expense ratio. Prior year losses were favorable by two points, driven by favorable
development in our Global Insurance division in 2015, primarily our inland marine product
line, compared to adverse development in 2014. The current accident year loss ratio
benefited from lower attritional losses across each of our divisions.
And finally, the decrease in our expense ratio was primarily due to higher earned
premiums in our specialty division driven by the premium growth I mentioned earlier, as
well as lower general expenses. The rate environment in North America remains
challenging, as has been the case throughout 2015. We are still achieving modest, singledigit rate increases on our smaller accounts, in the specialty and excess and surplus lines
divisions.
The large account excess property and casualty business in our global division is still under
significant rate pressure. We are experiencing more opportunities in the global,
professional and marine lines. In September, a number of our Markel professionals
attended the NAPSLO conference in San Diego. And we conducted over 300 individual
meetings during the conference. And the atmosphere was one of cautious optimism.

Bloomberg Transcript

In early October, professionals from our specialty and global divisions attended the CIAB –
Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers – Conference in Colorado Springs. The information
garnered from numerous meetings with our agents and brokers in attendance supported
our belief that there remains strong opportunity for profitable growth in our specialty E&S
and certain global lines of business despite current market conditions.
During the quarter, our product line leadership made progress on several new products
that will be available in 2016. And the product line leadership is also working on new filings
and enhancements to eight existing products.
We continue to focus on expense management and operational efficiency with the same
commitment that we give to underwriting profitability. Our account pool is as strong or
stronger than it's ever been. And we're continuing to recruit bench strength wherever
possible. We remain confident in our ability to continue to produce solid results through
superior talent, underwriting discipline and expense management. Richie?

Thanks, Mike, and good early morning to everybody. I'm just going to say if we keep this
early start time, I'm going to try to do next quarter's call from our London offices. Today,
I'm going to focus my comments on our underwriting results for the first nine months of
2015 for both the International Insurance and Reinsurance segments.
Both segments continue to produce outstanding underwriting results through the third
quarter this year. First, I'll start with International Insurance segment, which includes
business written by Markel International division, as well as certain products written by our
Global Insurance division.

For the year, gross written premiums declined just over 1% to $912 million. The year-todate combined ratio was 87% compared to 95% in the prior year. The decrease in
premium writings is primarily due to the continued impact of the strong U.S. dollar.

FINAL

Excluding currency impacts, gross written premium volume actually increased 4% for the
year, due to continued growth in our professional liability product lines in both divisions, as
well as growth across multiple product lines in the Markel International division.
The lower segment combined ratio was driven by more favorable prior year takedowns,
partially offset by higher expense ratio. Per year losses were favorable by 12 points, driven
by higher redundancies in the Markel International division across multiple product lines.
We also experienced favorable development in our Global Insurance division, which had
slight adverse development through nine months in 2014. The expense ratio has
increased nearly four points due to higher profit sharing costs, higher general expenses,
and lower earned premium this year.
Next, I'll discuss the results of the Reinsurance segment, which includes treaty reinsurance
programs written by our Global Reinsurance division as well as that written by our Markel
International division.

Bloomberg Transcript

Gross written premiums for this segment decreased 12% for the year to $876 million,
down from $1 billion a year ago. The segment has also seen the effect of the strong U.S.
dollar. And excluding currency impact, the decline for the year was 9%.
As we've disclosed and talked about a number of times, at the end of last year, we made
the decision to cease writing UK motor reinsurance business and to take smaller line sizes
in our non-standard auto U.S. book. You're now seeing this show up in the year-over-year
comparisons of gross written premium volume.
The combined ratio for the reinsurance segment was 92%, compared to 97% last year.
The reduction in the combined ratio was driven by a seven-point decrease in our loss
ratio, partially offset by higher expense ratio. The decline in loss ratio comprised of a
lower current accident year loss ratio due to lower property losses in 2015, as well as
more favorable development than prior year's loss reserves across both divisions. The
increase in the expense ratio is due to higher commissions and lower earned premiums
this year.
Just a few operational comments, when it comes to discussing competition, I'm starting
to feel little like a broken record each quarter on the earnings call. As Mike and Anne
discussed, market conditions remain extremely competitive and that's very little change
from what we reported to you in the first and second quarter of this year. Speculation has
now started in earnest on what's going to happen with rates on the January 1 renewals.
Our expectation is that without some sort of catalyst, pressures on rates are going to
continue. As a result, underwriting discipline is going to become even more important as
we enter 2016.

I would also like to mention that we continue to make good progress towards closing our
previously announced CATCo transaction, and we expect to close in the next several
weeks. To refresh everyone's memory CATCo is an insurance linked securities asset
manager that currently manages $2.7 billion of retrocessional and traditional reinsurance
portfolios for clients around the world. CATCo's business generates management and
performance fee income on its assets under management. We expect a smooth and
efficient transition of the CATCo business into Markel. And we've already started planning
how our reinsurance operations and CATCo will collaborate going forward to bring our
entire suite of traditional reinsurance and ILS products to our ceding clients.
With that, I would like to turn it over to Tom to discuss investments and ventures.

Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Richie. The good news at Markel is that we enjoy a set of what I would call
structural advantages as we continue to build the long term value of this company. And
they are as follows. First, we operate a successful insurance business with a long-term
record of underwriting profitability. Second, we operate a high-quality and low-cost
investment operation that amplifies the returns generated from the insurance business.
And third, we have a diverse set of majority-owned industrial and service businesses in
the form of Markel Ventures that increasingly contributes to our overall results.
Prospectively, we can and we will allocate capital among those opportunities in search of
the best long-term results. It's always the most fun when we can discuss each of those
components when all of its cylinders are firing. The reality, though, is that's not always the
case. And that is the circumstance so far in 2015.
The good news is that even without all cylinders firing, we made modest but forward
economic progress. The cylinder that didn't fire in the first nine months was our
investment operation. Our overall investment returns for the first nine months were a
negative 0.3% in local currency terms and a negative 1.2% after the foreign exchange
effects. Equities were down 5.3%. And fixed income earned a positive return of 1.3%.
If I had only one word to describe all of our investment operations, it would be quality. In
fixed income, that's relatively easy to quantify and describe. 97% of our holdings are rated
A or better. We also do our own credit work in addition to that of the rating agencies. And
I'm happy to report to you that our quality is as high as we know how to make it.
In our equity operations, we maintained a similar discipline and focus on quality. Equities
are not rated in the same way as bonds, and as such I don't have a statistic to cite which
would correlate to quality. I can assure you, though, that we underwrite each and every
equity security we purchase with thoughtfulness and a desire to own durable, long-lasting,
profitable businesses.
In a world with increasing rates of change, that job is getting harder rather than easier. But
we remain dedicated to our long-standing commitment to this effort and I'm optimistic
that our discipline will continue to serve us well.

FINAL

Tactically, after several years where we let the duration of the fixed income portfolio
decrease due to our concern about the possibility of higher overall levels of interest rates,
we now are at the point where we expect to keep our duration from coming in anymore.
Including cash and short-term holdings, the overall duration at the end of the third quarter
stood at slightly less than four years.
A normal number for us would be between four years and five years, depending on the
nature of our insurance reserves. So as you can see, we are, as we have been, a bit short
of that duration target. We will work to try to keep the duration between the four-year and
five-year bandwidth as we reinvest maturities and cash flows.
On the equity side, our allocation as a percentage of Markel's total shareholders' equity
to equity securities stands at 54% on September 30, compared to 55% at year-end 2014.
Historically, this number has ranged between roughly 50% and 80% over the last 25
years. That allocation is a residual of our views on finding specific investment
opportunities which meet our four-part thought process, as well as our overall view of our
insurance operation, opportunities and the overall investment markets.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you can see, we've got some dry powder on our balance sheet. I think the option value
of having quickly available capital to deploy as opportunities present themselves is a big
advantage for Markel going forward. I would also add that we incur very little in the way of
opportunity cost in doing so, given the low overall level of yields and investment returns
all along the curve.
Additionally, I think it's worth pointing out that at cost, our equity portfolio has a dividend
yield of over 3%. In short, we're getting the yields we would get on fixed income and the
upside of owning equity securities in the current environment.
While that number is based on historical cost, it isn't too hard to pencil out similar
dynamics for the equities we're buying today. Often times, current dividend yields roughly
equal what we could get on high-quality fixed income securities. One or two dividend
increases starts to open up a gap in our favor over time.
At Markel Ventures, we're enjoying a very solid year overall. Revenues advanced to $784
million from $594 million a year ago. As we spoke about in the second quarter, we have
the very high-class problem that one of our recent acquisitions is doing better than we
projected at the time of purchase. As such, the earn-out payments associated with that
deal are higher than we first forecast. We're accounting for that payment as an expense
item in 2015 rather than capitalizing those costs. This item will be fully accounted for this
year.
We are recording EBITDA from Markel Ventures of $76 million versus $66 million a year
ago. If you adjust for this one item, the run rate for EBITDA would be in excess of $100
million through the first nine months of the year. Within Markel Ventures, some of our
businesses tend to correlate quite highly with the overall level of the U.S. economy.

FINAL

We've had a very good year in those businesses. We understand the basic cyclicality
inherent in those operations and we fully expect their results will fluctuate over time. That
said, we are very happy with the returns on capital being generated by these companies
over a reasonable time period, and we'd be delighted to own more of these kinds of
businesses.
While we would like to own more Markel Ventures-type businesses, it seems that the rest
of the world would like to do so as well. As such, we've regularly encountered pricing that
goes beyond what we think we should pay. And we remain disciplined and on the
sidelines so far in 2015. We continue to actively engage in many discussions, and I'm
confident that we'll productively deploy capital on certain special circumstances as well as
in a more favorable overall pricing environment in the future.
Meanwhile, we continue to learn from and support our successful managers of these
operations. We also continue to look for ongoing opportunities to improve across each
and every company within Markel Ventures. We'll never stop doing so.
As I said at the beginning of my comments, we enjoy a unique set of structural
advantages at Markel. In a rapidly changing world, our first and foremost advantage
remains our unchanging, deeply rooted culture as described by the words of the Markel
Style, first penned in 1986 – your management team, and all of the people of this
organization, looks forward to meeting the challenges of building on our worldwide set of
insurance, investment, and industrial and service opportunities.

I'll attempt that one. And you guys kick in anytime. Jeff, we've been acquisitive over the
years and Tom was talking about the current environment right now. There's certainly
companies out there that we think would be nice strategic fits with Markel. But the
problem seems to be right now a lot of other people seem to think those companies
would be great strategic fits as well. So, the things we look forward when we're doing
acquisitions, the culture has to be a fit, it's number one, needs to be a good strategic fit,
good reason for it. And then, obviously, it's got to be at a fair price. And that's probably
the one we're having the most trouble with right now.

A - F. Michael Crowley

{BIO 6836605 <GO>}

Yeah, I'll add. I completely concur with Richie's comments. And we're hunting all the time.
And sometimes, frankly, we get surprised by the opportunities we come across just as
much as you are. So we know about it a little before you do, but we'll keep hunting them,
we'll keep you posted.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Okay. And then, on the pricing front with pricing remaining pretty difficult here, are you
seeing any of the standard riders move in, in some of the E&S lines more than usual or...

Bloomberg Transcript

A - F. Michael Crowley

{BIO 6836605 <GO>}

Yeah, Jeff. This is Mike. I've been in this business for – this is now my fifth decade. And
whenever you have the pricing situation we have today, you're going to have the standard
carriers moving into the E&S space. I think the advantage that we have is that we have not
one insurance division, not just an insurance division, but we have our U.S. specialty
business, we have our global business, and we have the international business. So, market
conditions are competitive. But as I mentioned in my comments, on the smaller U.S. based
business, we're still getting modest rate increases. But certainly, in this type of
environment, we are going to see the standard carriers move in. But they'll also move out
as they have in the past.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Jeff, I've got one editorial comment to that. Obviously, the investment side was the
toughest part of the house for us. But we breathe the same air as everybody else. The
investment operation – environment that we're operating in is the same that every
insurance company is. So, while everything is competitive, I don't think anybody's under
the delusion that they can operate on a sloppy fashion on the underwriting side and make
it up on investments.
So, the nature and tone of competition and where that bar is set in terms of underwriting
profitability is lower this time around than what it would have been in previous cycles. So,
that's somewhat good news. It's hard to get the volumes, and we have to compete for
every piece of business that we have. But I think everybody is competing in a more
Page 11 of 20



Company N ame: M arkel Corp

Date: 2015-11-05

disciplined fashion than they were in previous cycles. And that's a function of both lower
level of investment returns and better underwriting data and technology that gives
people better insight into what the costs of what they're writing are.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Right. Right. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Hey. Good morning. Just a few questions. Let me start with CATCo. Richie, maybe if you –
it seems like that's a little bit less typical of a normal Markel acquisition. Maybe you could
just talk a little bit about how that fits in, what's some of the ambitions you might have for
it? And then I guess the other question I have related to CATCo, is that going to folded
into the international unit or is it going to picked up as one of the other segments?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Sure. Well, first, I'll take the easy one first. Markel CATCo, as it will be called going
forward, we're going to set that – since it is a little bit different as you recognize, Mark, it's
going sit long side our Reinsurance division. And we expect Tony Belisle, who is going to
be running CATCo for us; and Jed Rhoads, who runs our Reinsurance division; those two
teams are going to be work it very closely together because we think there is a lot of
synergies, lot of opportunities to collaborate across those two platforms.
So, they'll sit beside each other. And that array of product set we hope to make available
to our clients. You did mention you know it's a little bit different than what we've done
before. And the reality is the insurance market's little bit different than what it was five or
ten years ago. Insurance-linked security business alternative capital was people called it
initially.
It's just simply capital now, has been coming into our market over the last 5,10 years. And
that trend is going to continue quite honestly. And it's going to continue to become more
meaningful. We've got small pace to that with our purchase of Alterra with their New Point
facility that they've had for a quite long time before the acquisition. And Jed Rhoads and
myself, we talked about the fact we felt like we needed to be more meaningful in that ILS
space going forward.
And CATCo provided us that opportunity. And like I said, we really view that as kind of
extending that product set across the reinsurance space both traditional and ILS. And then
going forward, we hope to develop new products. And that could mean potentially
moving into different areas of insurance as opposed to just reinsurance.

FINAL

And Mark, I'll add one editorial comment here too, and why you correctly categorize this
as being different than what we have been doing today. Frankly, that's typical of almost
every deal we've ever done. Part of the reason to do acquisition is we've done that over
our 30-year history as a public company is to learn, to expand, to recognize that the world
keeps changing, and we pick up people and skills, and talents, and opportunities that we
didn't have internally. And I think that is an absolutely typical and recurring feature of
Markel's. And we'll continue to be doing.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Just a follow-up on some of that. To characterize CATCo, is this skill set here – is this an
underwriting skill set? Or is this more of brokerage in asset management or placement
type of skill set? I guess I'm trying to be clear on which bit of the house you are bringing to
bear in making this ultimately successful.

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

There is only two scales. The one that in my mind is the preeminent skill set is the
underwriting. And that's where we spent a tremendous amount of time was –
understanding and getting comfortable with the underwriting the CATCo does. And we
believe they do a fantastic job of underwriting the business. So it's a skill set we are very
familiar with. We are underwriters at heart at Markel.
The ILS combines two skill sets. It brings that underwriting skill set to the table along with
raising funds. It's a fund manager. So, the other skill set, and one that Tony and his team
possesses is the ability to go out and explain the story that CATCo had and the skill set
that they have to investors, such that they are willing to invest in the funds. So, it is a bit of
a hybrid, and it's a model quite honestly that we're going to see more and more in our
industry.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful and let me ask a second question, changing gears to the tax rate.
You've documented throughout the year kind of the pluses and minuses on that. I guess
this quarter, this was primarily a true-up to get to – now that you can have some better
visibility of full year results to kind of true your full year provision into that 21-odd percent
full year rate.

A - Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

That's right. The way you treat the quarter is just the mechanics you get there.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Right. So, all else equal, would it make sense that the fourth quarter number would be
somewhere in that same ballpark?

A - Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Should be.

But then, just on – go ahead.

A - Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

FINAL

Sorry. Go ahead, Mark.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Well, I was going to say then – but still now view yet on next year as to whether there's
any likelihood that this credit will carry forward into 2016 outlook?

A - Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

So, I don't believe today that the cut out will carry forward. But it's hard to know for sure.
We would likely think next year would be more typical in the mid to high-20s from a tax
rate. The real story on the tax rate this year is higher pre-tax income than we projected,
which is a good new story that results in tax rate sort of bouncing around.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. And then, the third question I had related to the new asbestos, environmental retro
that you did, to the extent that ultimately produces any gains or losses, I think you
mentioned there was a $10 million-odd of gain – or loss rather in – on the initial transaction
before any re-visitation of reserves setting. Is that going to show up in the other
segment? Or is that going to be in one of the North American segments?

A - Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

It should show up in the other segment.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Thank you.

FINAL

Q - James Terry Davis

{BIO 20249565 <GO>}

The 15% compound book value growth track record is what causes us to take a look at the
company. And as we've been doing our diligence, we've noticed some changes in the
company that suggest that book value growth is likely to be meaningfully lower in the
future. But we wanted to get your thoughts to make sure we are thinking about this the
right way.
The two big changes that seem to have taken place at the company are, first, investment
leverage has declined meaningfully. 10 to 20 years ago, investments were about four
times your book value. But today, this is only about half that, 2.1 times your book value.
And second, investment yields have declined meaningfully; 10 to 20 years ago, portfolio
yields were on the 5% range versus 2.2% today.
So, our math suggests these two factors combine to create a pre-tax ROE drive of about
15% relative to previous periods, making it tough to get to a double-digit ROE without a
significant rally in the equity market. We seem to be seeing this play out this year as a
relatively minor hiccup in equity markets has resulted in flat book value growth for the
year. Are we missing something or have these changes made historical returns very tough
to meet going forward?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Yeah. This is Tom. I'll try to take those. Compared to 10 or 20 years ago, I think you're
correct. I mean, now the premium leverage we can get relative to our equity capital is
lower. Now, specifically, what we can do in the face of that is that we can increase the
allocation to higher total return securities because the reason we would have a fixed
income portfolio is predominately to over-collateralize the insurance liabilities and the
claims payments that we expect to make. So, if we have less leverage and we're writing
less business, what that means is we can allocate a higher percentage of the portfolio to
equities where we would expect to pick up a higher return.
The second point you mentioned is lower overall investment yields. I would agree with
that. I would also suggest that the higher yields occurred during a period of higher
inflation. So, nominal yields are lower, but real yields have not decreased as much. So
nominally it's a lower return environment. That's correct. But in a real sense, if we make
high single-digit, low double-digit returns in a zero interest rate world, both the nominal
yield and the inflation circumstance that we face, that would be a spectacular economic
outcome. And we're optimistic about our ability to do so.

Q - James Terry Davis

{BIO 20249565 <GO>}

Okay, got it. That makes sense. And then, with the equities, as you mentioned previously
on the call, you're currently at kind of 54% of book value versus the historical range of
50% to 80%. So, in terms of the opportunity to increase to higher-return assets, we're not

Page 15 of 20



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2015-11-05

necessarily seeing that right now. Is there an intention to increase that allocation to try to
make up for that difference is the first question.

FINAL

And I guess on the second question, makes perfect sense, lower inflation, lower nominal
yields. I guess are we right to think that that just translates into lower nominal ROEs as well
going forward relative to what we've seen in the past?

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean, that's the math of lower nominal ROEs. But in real terms, as I've said, we're
going to try and do the best we can. In real terms, we've generated excellent returns for
a long time and hope we have the formula in place to continue to do so. In terms of the
additional allocations to the equity portfolio, whisper some good ideas to me after the
call, and then we'll put it to work.
Just like the acquisition question, we work all day, every day, looking for things at the
moment. We're driving down the road tapping the brakes a little bit just as a function of
being picky about what we buy. But as we see things, and we hunt for them every day, we
do have the capital to put money into the equity portfolio and we would love to do so
when we see it.

Q - James Terry Davis

{BIO 20249565 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Makes perfect sense. And so did I hear correctly that in the current environment the view
is that kind of high single moving into the low double-digit would be a great outcome?

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

We don't make forward-looking forecasts or any expectations of that sort. But when you
pencil out the math that you did, I don't think you're doing that incorrectly.

Q - James Terry Davis

{BIO 20249565 <GO>}

Got it. And then just final question, we've always admired the discipline at the company.
And like you said, there's a lot of headwinds in the market right now. The investment
leverage and rates, which we talked about, but like you pointed out pricing's weakening,
equity markets are a little more difficult, trading at elevated multiples on above trend
margins. But the private acquisitions are certainly tougher given the price that's out there
today.
And in terms of your core business, like you said, accretive acquisitions are tougher. It
seems like there's an M&A premium kind of built into everything that's trading out there. Is
the right way to think about Markel right now that it's a tough environment, you've
reduced leverage, you're kind of retrenching, and we will have a period of lower returns?
But as the market change, there'll be the ability to play more offense and move to high
returns at some point in the future?

FINAL

Well, let me split that. And I think Richie alluded to this a bit in his discussion of CATCo. It's
always tough. Markets are always competitive. So, I don't think there is anything new
about that than what has been the case all of the time that the record you speak so kindly
of was created; it's always tough.
But break capital into two forms. There's financial capital and there's intellectual capital.
Financial capital is what a lot of people have a lot of. I mean, there's a lot of money
flashing around everything and that leads to the comments about insurance industry
pricing, acquisition pricing, things of that nature.
But intellectual capital, that's scarce, and that's where the returns really can be generated.
So just like Richie was talking about the creativity behind the folks of capital and what
they're doing, a good portion of the returns they generate is because they thought of
stuff, they were creative and they apply intellectual capital. That is similarly the case in the
Markel Ventures operations.
We're looking at businesses that have the markets they have and have the customers
they have because they creatively have found a way we take care of their customers. And
they tend to operate in markets that are not distorted by big gobs of financial capital.

Bloomberg Transcript

Similarly, you look at the historical set of businesses that Markel underwrites in our
insurance world, we need expertise. We need creativity. We need people who know what
they are doing in different and unique lines of business. And there's really nothing about
that changes. And I think creativity and intellectual capital will always be able to earn a
return.

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

The other opportunity that we have and has been proven out in the past with acquisitions
like THOMCO and FirstComp and others is that they are a number of private industries
out there that would fit with Markel. And the principles of those industries don't
necessarily sell for the highest price.
We were successful in some of those acquisitions because the principles we're looking for
a long-term place and a good fit for their employees and for themselves and for patient
capital for long term to continue doing what they were doing rather than had me gabbled
up and chopped up and stripped and flipped and whatever.
So, I think those opportunities still exist and will present themselves to us over the next
few years as well. We don't – we want the highest price in some of those deals.

Q - James Terry Davis

{BIO 20249565 <GO>}

Got it. That's a huge advantage. And we compete against the same gobs of capital. So,
we understand exactly what you're going through. Appreciate answering the questions. I
guess our last items is just when we look at the current valuation of the stock, it seems
like the market is expecting the same future returns as what they've seen in the past in
terms of the stock trading at 1.5 times book value. And that's kind of the root of the
Page 17 of 20

questions. We think of that – the franchise is very valuable, the opportunities very valuable,
we're just trying to figure out right now kind of what price makes sense. Thanks so much.

Hi, Dave.

Q - David McKinley West

{BIO 1838548 <GO>}

Mike, it's a question for you. I guess that my grasp on time is not real good, but you've
been in the workers comp business now at least to three to four years. And could you talk
– give a little more color about pricing trends and workers comp? And also, are you
making underwriting profits in that line of business now?

A - F. Michael Crowley

{BIO 6836605 <GO>}

The answer is yes. That's been a tremendous success story. When we acquired
FirstComp, I guess it was 2010, there was work to be done there. And the environment
was tough. Their geographical mix of business or the other mix of business was not what
we thought was the right path for the future. And Matt Parker who now heads our
specialty division, and Chad Bertucci is now running FirstComp, and the entire team there
have absolutely executed on a plan that has been perfect in terms of restructuring of the
business geographically, product line, pricing-wise. The pressure on the pricing there is
not as significant as it is in other lines right now. And yes, they are making underwriting
profits. They had their expense ratio well under control as well as anybody in our business.
And we couldn't be more pleased with the plan that they executed over a span of two or
three years and where they are today.

Okay, great. Thank you for that. I think in Anne's comments, when you'd talked about the
impairments taken this quarter, it was I think mostly on the equity side of things. Could you
provide some color on that? Was that a mechanical process or did one or two securities,
particularly you think warrant the impairment charge?

FINAL

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Yeah, there's a mechanical process that triggers the reviews that is consistent we'll be
doing it that way quite some time. Half of that came from energy securities. And I don't
have to tell you what went on in the energy markets and oil prices. To harken back to the
earlier comment I made about quality, Exxon has our largest position. Schlumberger has
our second largest in the energy world. Those are last men standing in that entire food
chain that existed. And point of fact, and you always see it happening with Schlumberger. I
mean, they have the balance sheet to be able to acquire things during a very tough
market.
So, we make sure that we invest in people that we think make it to the other side; and not
only make it to the other side, but are better off by the time to time you get there. So, we
don't have what I would consider speculative energy positions. Exxon and Schlumberger
would account for, I don't know, 80% or 90% of the total amount we have in energy. So, I'll
fight with those guys.
