Good afternoon and welcome to SCOR Q1 2020 results call. My name is Olivier
Armengaud, Senior Manager of Investor Relations team, and I'm joined on the call today
by Denis Kessler, Chairman and CEO of SCOR; and the entire Executive Committee. Can I
please ask you to consider disclaimer on page 2 of the presentation, which indicates that
the financial results for Q1 2021 including the presentation unaudited. I would also ask you
to note the statement in respect of COVID-19.
Before starting our Q&A session, I would like to hand over to Ian Kelly, CFO of SCOR.

{BIO 19976646 <GO>}

Thank you, Olivier, and welcome everybody to the call today. Let's start on Slide 4. In a
quarter marked by the continued expected development of COVID-19, and an extreme
and severe winter storm in the U.S., SCOR clearly demonstrates once again its resilience
and shock-absorbing capacity. COVID-19 continues to develop as we anticipated. It is
manageable and tracks closely in line with what we communicated within our full year
2020 results.
On the life side, the COVID-19 impact stands at EUR162 million, of which EUR145 million
comes from the U.S. mortality portfolio. While on the P&C side, the impact is stable
compared with the end of 2020. Our solvency ratio at the end of Q1 is very high and
stands at 232% above the optimal range and reflects all currently expected future COVID19 impacts.

Bloomberg Transcript

In addition, the industry you have to face the large natural catastrophe event of winter
storm Uri in Texas, which had an impact of EUR98 million for SCOR, net of retrocession
and before-tax. Whilst the combination of such events is extreme, it remains within the
group's risk appetite and it is the duty of the group to anticipate these risks and to absorb
them.
Moving on to Slide 5. In the first quarter of 2021, SCOR continued to successfully develop
it's franchise. You can see on the slide, at constant exchange rates, gross written
premiums stand at EUR4.4 billion, up 5.6% compared to Q1 2020, driven by P&C, up
10.3%, benefiting from the excellent renewals during the year, and steady life growth up
2.1% with continued franchise expansion in Asia.
Moving on to Slide 6. In the context of the pandemic and the natural catastrophes, SCOR
delivers a net income of EUR45 million in Q1 of 2021 with strong underlying profitability. On
the P&C side, the combined ratio stands at 97.1% with 12.6 percentage points from natural
catastrophe. On a normalized basis, the combined ratio is extremely strong at 91.4%,
better than the quantum leap assumption.
On the Life side, in line with what we had anticipated, the technical margin was impacted
by COVID-19 claims in the U.S. in line with the communicated guidance and stands out
1.6%. Finally, SCOR global investments seized opportunities presented by the bond
market on the back of the reflation dynamic and delivers a solid return on invested assets
of 3.0%, driven by EUR77 million of realized gains.
Moving on to Slide 7. The solvency is very high at the end of Q1 2021, standing at 232%.
This, as I said, is above the group's optimal solvency range of a 185% to 220%. The
increase in solvency was mainly driven by the significant impact from market movements
on the back of the sharp increase in U.S. interest rates, but also from the positive
contribution from the operating performance of the portfolio. The solvency ratio at the
end of Q1 continues to reflect all currently expected future COVID-19 impacts.

Let's move on to Slide 8. SCOR continues the digitization program we laid out in quantum
leap and continues to deploy new technologies across the organization to improve our
operational efficiency and productivity, but also to broaden our product and service
offering to create long-term value. In the first quarter of 2021, we have been able to
deliver several ambitious digital projects, notably on the P&C side and used satellite
based pasture insurance tool in Brazil, a rating tool dedicated to inherent defect insurance
and enhanced business-to-business pricing engine in trade, credit, insurance and an inhouse pricing and risk scoring mobile app. On the life side, we launched Vitae, a cuttingedge artificial intelligence biometric risk calculator. And finally, on the group side, we
moved our internal reinsurance software Omega into the cloud.
Let's move on to Slide 9. We have many reasons to be confident about the industry's
prospects. On the life side, the acceleration of the vaccination rollout confirms that
COVID-19 death track in line with our epidemiological modeling. Whilst some uncertainty,
of course, remains around the magnitude and the duration of the pandemic, at this stage,
we expect to be able to return to the quantum leap technical margin assumption range of
7.2% 7.4% by Q4 2021, translating into a full-year technical margin of around 5%.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the P&C side, we believe that COVID-19 is one of the factors helping to create the
conditions for stronger reinsurance growth combined with a positive pricing dynamic. We
expect these positive trends to drive continued pricing and terms and conditions
improvements in future renewals. For 2021, this translates into a P&C normalized
combined ratio trending towards 95% and below.
Finally, on the investment side, we continue to seize opportunities presented by the bond
market on the back of the reflation dynamic particularly in the U.S. through realizing gains.
The liquidity from this divestment is to be reinvested across the course of the year, as the
market restabilizes. We confirm our return on invested assets assumption for the year in
the range of 1.8% to 2.3%.
Briefly on a few other key financials, on Slide 12. The shareholders equity of the group
remains strong at EUR6.3 billion, an increase on the year-end position, and this results in a
book value of EUR33.61 per share.
And finally, on Slide 13, I would like to highlight the strong cash flow of the group, with net
cash flow from operations exceeding EUR0.5 billion during the quarter, resulting in a
strong liquidity position of EUR3.3 billion.
With that, I will hand back to Olivier, and we can go to the Q&A session. Thank you.

Olivier Armengaud

{BIO 20892984 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Ian. On Page 21, you will find the forthcoming schedule event. And

Questions And Answers
Operator

FINAL

(Question And Answer)
(Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Vikram Gandhi from Societe
Generale. Please go ahead, your line is open.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Hi. Hello, everybody. It's Vik from SocGen. Hope all of you are doing fine. I've got a couple
of questions. First one is on the Solvency II ratio. I acknowledge that 232% is quite strong,
however, when I use the latest sensitivities and then overlay the fact that the Group has
higher liquidity and lower corporate credit exposure, it appears a bit too low compared to
what I would have expected, perhaps you can elaborate on some of the underlying
movements there. And secondly, on the ordinary investment income where there is a
drop of about EUR20 million quarter-over-quarter. I appreciate the Group were sitting on
more liquidity about EUR1.3 billion, but even considering that the drop seems to be a bit
too high. Can you shed some light on what is driving this? Thank you.

A - Olivier Armengaud

{BIO 20892984 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Frieder, on the first question.

A - Frieder Knupling

{BIO 17247809 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you and hello everybody. As Ian said, most significant drive of the increase in
solvency ratio was the increase in yields, U.S. yield. So this accounted for the bulk of the
upwards movement, there was also positive capital generation broadly in line with the
average quarters in the past. So there was nothing unusual. We do allocate capital and
deploy, it's the growing business, so that of course needs to be funded and we have also
accrued for a quarter of regular dividend in line with previous practice, but there were no
other significant movements beyond this and only very marginal impact from COVID
during the quarter.

A - Olivier Armengaud

{BIO 20892984 <GO>}

Thank you, Frieder. Francois.

Operator
So maybe I think there is two question in your question. So the first one is linked to the
liquidity and exposure to corporate bond and the second one is the impact on the
(inaudible). So first of all, let me explain the technical positioning that took place at the
beginning of the year. At the end of last year, we identify an increasing probability for U.S.
interest rates to rise on the back of inflationary pressures which even transitory create a
new dynamic for the inflation trade in the interest rate market.

Page 4 of 22



FINAL

Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity

So we took advantage early January of this positive environment and we managed to sell
more than EUR1 billion equivalent of U.S. corporate bonds, just before the highs of the 10year U.S. interest rates. So the timing was good. We do believe that there is further room
of maneuver for a steepening of the U.S. yield curve and still on the theme of derivation,
dynamism in the bucket and in the months to come. So that's why you see liquidity
temporarily at 15%, so which means the proceeds of the sale program are still in cash and
the exposure to corporate bond had significantly reduced to 36%. We intend to reinvest
in the next few months this amount of liquidity and to come back to normal asset
allocation, as soon as we will consider the interest rate market will stabilize.
So the impact on the income yield as you saw at previous quarter, our investment yield
has rebounded after having reached low point in H2 2020. So that's explain the decrease
of the income yield and also the fact that we have 15% of liquidity and only 30% of
corporate bond today. As soon as we will reinvest and you see the good news is the
significant increase during the quarter of the investment yield to 1.6% compared to 1.2% in
December. So you should expect in the second part of the year rebound and an increase
of the income yield again.

Our next question is coming from Kamran Hossain from Royal Bank of Canada. Please go
ahead.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hey, good afternoon. Two questions, first was just on the, I guess, the underlying
combined ratio, it looks like it is surprisingly strong, I guess, relative to your guidance for
the year. How much of that 91.4% should we bank? And how much is simply kind of good
luck [ph] on manmade has been loss in the quarter? And the second question is, I guess,
all the focus has been on COVID in Q1, especially in the U.S., where it's been a horrible
quarter for, I guess, everyone and yeah the U.S. everywhere. What's ex-COVID mortality
look like? So if you give any examples or kind of ideas around that that'd be exceptionally
helpful. Thank you.

A - Olivier Armengaud

{BIO 20892984 <GO>}

Jean-Paul, on the combined ratio.

Operator
Yes, thank you, Olivier. Hi. Kamran. On your question on the normalized net combined
ratio, as you saw this quarter is the sum of the net attritional loss ratio and commission is
overall 5 points lower than Q1 2020. So of those 5 points roughly 3 come from low activity
-- a lower activity at manmade losses than in Q1 2020 and the rest is really the
improvement of the portfolio. But going forward, we'll still have to wait for few quarters to
Page 5 of 22



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2021-04-28

confirm this, but we think that we're starting to see some of the pricing improvements
flow through the portfolio. And then, we also benefit as I said from a very low level of
manmade losses this quarter.

A - Olivier Armengaud

{BIO 20892984 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

Okay. Thank you, Jean-Paul. Paolo.

Operator
Yes. Hi, Kamran. In terms of what we're seeing ex-COVID globally, I would say outside the
U.S. the business has been experienced relatively buoyant performance in Q1, so we're
very happy of what we're seeing. In terms of the U.S. portfolio, which is our largest
mortality book, we are seeing some increasing planes across the overall U.S. portfolio
after we excluded that clearly reported is being due to COVID-19. The volatility similar in
scale to volatility we observed in other periods in the past like the Q1 2020 experience for
example. So it is too early to conclude whether this is connected to COVID-19 or just
regular volatility.
We have seen the usual annual flu impact globally eliminated as a result of the COVID-19
containment measures. And we have to say that any long-term impact from COVID-19 will
take some time to be determinant and to managing. We want to confirm the resurge
continued to be very strong with the significant margin of prudence and we have a bestin-class experience study team based in the U.S., focused on constantly monitoring and
further improving our understanding of the driving factors of the U.S. mortality. So I
believe, as we do regularly, I think when we come to the Investor Day later in the year,
that's a good time for us to give you more information on the overall evolution of
mortality that we are observing in 2021.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

That's great. Thanks, Paolo.

A - Olivier Armengaud

{BIO 20892984 <GO>}

Next question please.

Operator
Our next question is coming from Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hello. Hi there. First question just on top line premium for the non-life business. I can see
the effect of FX. And I guess, the effect of FX does seem a bit stronger than I would have
judged just from observed market movements in FX other, there's something unusual
about the FX mix of your premiums in Q1. And the second sort of related question, when I
look at the effect of deduction of unearned and deduction of reinsurance or retro, it is

Page 6 of 22

FINAL

bigger quite a lot bigger than Q1 last year. So it implies some mix shift or something
different also about your Q1 non-life premiums, whether it's a lot, no longer dated
business, there's a different earning pattern in it. Maybe could you just give us some color
around that topic the top-line P&C and how we -- is there something odd about Q1 in
particular?
My other question was I think the CAT load seems quite high. I can see the Texas effects
and the Texas number looks about what I would have expected relative to the industry
loss, but I'm surprised that you've picked up quite a lot of other CAT loses in a relatively
benign quarter, where you surprised by that? And presumably these levels of losses are
such that there are kind of low-level frequency type stuff you're not getting any benefit
from retro? Thanks.

A - Olivier Armengaud

{BIO 20892984 <GO>}

Thank you, Andrew. Jean-Paul?

Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Thank you, Andrew. So, on your first question, the constant FX growth as you saw
reinsurance is decreasing roughly fairly more than 6 -- it is growing at 6.7%. Most of the
growth is following the 1-1 renewals for the current underwriting year is growing at 10% in
line with renewals, while the prior year's is pretty flat. So that's where you see a difference
in premium earnings. In addition, the growth in specialty premium insurance is very strong
at the 22% and that tends to earn more quickly as well.
The impact of FX really comes from, I'd say, two phenomenas, one is the weakening of
the dollar which has an effect when translated to euros, but also the strengthening of the
euros compared to all currencies and so that affect not only premium in dollars, but
premium all other currencies. But that's why we have a big effect this quarter.
On your second question on the CAT loss ratio, yes, we were affected by other CAT
losses in addition to Storm Uri. The European storm phenomenon affected Spain and
Southern France and that's roughly EUR15 million impact to SCOR, which is in line with our
share of the treaties in France and Spain. And relative to the other CAT losses, the more
significant ones is additional deterioration on Sally, and Laura, and this comes from the
fact that the losses we had booked in Q3 and Q4 did not have complete information from
our Cedents and the Q1 results incorporate additional information received from number
Cedents, which shows these losses deteriorating further. So we were surprised a little bit
by this deterioration on prior losses, but still the level of users right now makes us
comfortable that it should be stable for the remaining quarters.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Sorry, can I just follow-up the growth of specialty insurance earns more quickly than I
should -- surprised with the degree to which the amount of the transition from net written
to earned seems lower this year, quite a lot lower than Q1 last year, which is especially
France is growing faster wouldn't be the case.

FINAL

Yeah. But it's only 25% of the overall premium. The bulk of the premium is reinsurance and
the larger amount of premium earning is comprised underwriting years, which is flat more
or less.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. I guess the point being done the earned pace will pick up significantly as the year
goes on as we transition from as the prior year runs off as it were and the current year
growing (Multiple Speakers) from the prior year.

The next question is coming from Will Hardcastle from UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Good afternoon guys. Two quick ones from me. Can you just give us a bit of color on how
the 1.6% reinvestment returns been achieved, it doesn't look to the being much re-risking
within the quarter if I look at duration or asset classes you've touched on. I guess, just
perhaps an outlook (inaudible) seems stay from here, is that the sort of level you'd be
expecting, albeit you mentioned the expectation of U.S. pick-up. And perhaps voluntary
de-risking how much year-on-year income yield compression should we expect for next
year looking beyond, I guess?
And second one is on premium. You've kind of touched on the rationale and the drivers
behind the FX, it doesn't sound like -- they have normal then, I guess just so we're clear. If
I look at those, should we expect a further headwind for Q2 before it stabilizes for the
remainder of the year, is that logic correct?

A - Olivier Armengaud

{BIO 20892984 <GO>}

Thank you, Will. Francois?

FINAL

Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2021-04-28

On the first question, so that's true that our current reinvestment yield stand at 1.6%.
Again I remind you the definition of the reinvestment yield, that's the market yield of the
fixed income and loan portfolio, the last day of the of the quarter and we see an increase
of 40 basis points compared to the 31 of December last year. And that's mainly due to
the increase of U.S. interest rate. So you should expect that increase of the reinvestment
yield to continue with the steepening of the yield curve. And we should see a higher
reinvestment yield in the quarters to come. And as a consequence, as soon as we
balance the 15% of liquidity into mostly U.S. corporate bonds, we will look a new level of
interest rate. And that will conflate into a higher income contribution compared to this
quarter.
So we confirm the range for the return on equity -- on invested assets for 2021, so
between 1.8% and 2.3%. At this stage, it's impossible to give you guidance or an
expectation or an objective for 2022. It's too early, and it's too difficult to predict such in
advance, what central bankers are going to do and what could be the level of inflation in
the next quarter. But my sole conviction is that you should see an increase of the income
yield, again as soon as we rebalance the portfolio and that will mostly done on U.S.
corporate bonds. So you should expect by the end of the year to come back to an
allocation between 43%, 45% to corporate bond within our portfolio and liquidity
between 5% and 7%.

Jean-Paul on the second question.

Operator
Yeah. Thank you. On the second question relative to FX, the comparison to Q1 is
comparing Q1 2020 with Q1 2021. I think as we've progressed throughout the year and
compare Q2 versus Q2 or the half year of 2021 versus the half year 2020, the FX should
be more stabilized everything else being equal, the big change in the currency happen
with COVID, so probably more in Q2 2020, so that effect should be much less going
forward. In addition, we have a large amount of premium that was and growth at 1-1-2021
which would the earning through in Q2 and the remaining quarters and that is also should
have the effect of the rate of exchange. So we expect it to be more stable throughout
the year.

The next question is coming from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca, please go ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes, good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for my two questions. First is for Paolo on the
life technical margin, so Paolo, I've been watching this, I'm impressed how the modeling
Page 9 of 22



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2021-04-28

FINAL

of the projections of mortality in the U.S. have? I think for the first time in at least a few
attempts made in the last year, this time they have been kind of grinding to the chart that
we have been seeing, so below 1,000 deaths by March end and maybe 750 now moving
average and then moving towards something 600-700 by the end of June. So, what I'm
trying to understand is that because obviously, in the past these models had an error. So
and this time now they are tracking nicely. Would you say that there is some upside
potential for the 5% for the 2021 technical margin? So that's my first question on life.
Second question is for Francois on the ROI target? Given this liquidity rebalancing and also
potentially some gains in the year, I mean, if you look at even the top end the 2.3 and
already being achieved 3% in the first quarter implies (inaudible) for the rather low 2%
odd in the remaining three quarters, how should we -- I mean, are you just being
conservative or you think there could be some upside to that 2.3 if you don't want to
quantify it at this stage. So I just want to get any thoughts on these two topics. Thank you.

A - Olivier Armengaud

{BIO 20892984 <GO>}

Thank you, Vinit. Paolo, for the first question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
Yeah. Hi Vinit. Yeah, as you mentioned for us, what we're seeing in Q1 is pretty much what
we had projected at the Q4 disclosures in February. So we stay by the 5% -- our
projections and not materially changed from what we presented to all of you in February. I
think the only change we are observing is our weighted scenario we show and narrowing
of potential outcomes would probably a shift of casualties from COVID-19 being brought
into Q2 and lesser amount in Q3 that's kind of the change that our models would indicate.
As said, that arrow you were talking about beneath that is always being the challenge that
any modeling as that to capture human behaviors effectively. First of all human behaviors
in terms of respecting certain restrictions whether distancing or masking, and I think the
next big challenge is vaccine as you can see overall that is also a human behavior. So that
is what we're tracking very closely. We're also tracking very closely the emergence of
potentially versions of new variants and the behavior of current variants, particularly in
terms of vaccine resistance.
So overall, I think we feel -- we reiterate the 5% assumption we have for the overall year
we still think that's a good number right now in terms of where we're seeing our results
ending for the year. Thank you.

A - Olivier Armengaud

{BIO 20892984 <GO>}

Thank you Paolo. Francois?

Operator
So on your question, Vinit, so, first of on the capital gain what you should expect for this
year, so we took EUR74 million of capital gain on the fixed income portfolio. I cannot
Page 10 of 22



FINAL

Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2021-04-28

benchmark Q1, but if I benchmark what our peer at least in Europe did in 2020, we are in
the low band of the contribution of fixed income capital gain to the return on invested
assets. We are at low 7% of contribution compared to our peer distance between 0.6 to
0.9. So I would say, we are quite conservative on this side. You should not expect
additional material contribution from the fixed income portfolio to capital gain this year.
We are awaiting now the steepening of the various yield curve, especially the U.S. one, we
have, let's say a kind of target or expectation of an entry point at 1.9% and we are at 1.6%
to the -- on the 10-year U.S. rate.
On the real estate side, that's true. That's also a contribution that you see here each year.
Given still the lockdown measures in France today, it's a little bit too earlier at this stage to
have a firm view on our ability to dispose real estate assets this year, the current
environment is too uncertain. Having said this, we all the save all real estate assets, which
are mature and that we could sell if the market is there. And again, if the market is there,
you could expect one sale before the end of the year. But I don't have yet the full visibility
given the lockdown to confirm this. I remind you that we have EUR122 million of unrealized
gain on the real estate portfolio that will flow into the P&L in the next few quarters and
year.

Bloomberg Transcript

So now to your final question, am I conservative by maintaining the range 1.8%, 2.3%,
maybe it's a little bit too early. It will really depend on the speed of the steepening of the
U.S. interest rate and the timing of the redeployment of the massive amount of liquidity
that we have. I think we will have more visibility in July or during the Investor Day after the
summer to confirm or to revise upward at the range.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Thank you and good afternoon. And just I have couple of questions if you can help me,
sorry, going back to the ROI topic. I mean, clearly, you are saying that the entry point that
you will have on the reinvesting that cash or temporary liquidity into corporate bond is
1.9% versus we are at 1.6% at the moment. So, how long will you wait for that entry point
of 1.9% to be achieved? I mean, let's say rates start move for next three to six months. So
how long will you wait for that? And as long as you don't reinvest at a higher yield, I mean,
is it fair to say that you will be hitting this year's recurring ROI at more at the lower end of
the range, which is 1.8% rather than 2.3%. So some color on that would be helpful.

FINAL

The reason why I'm asking is, I agree that interest rate should be trending higher this is
what all the pundits are saying as well. But never say, never with interest rates, it goes
down forever. So, that's one thing I have noticed for past 25 years. So that's the first
question.
The second question is in terms of combined ratio improvement, thanks a lot for giving
some additional color about 5% lower attritional as of now. You mentioned that it is partly
because of lower activity and partly because of portfolio improvement. Is it possible for
you to give a bit more light on how much is that lower activity and how much is that
portfolio improvement? I'm just trying to think a bit more for next three quarters, how it
might pan out from a lower activity perspective? Thank you.

Francois on the first question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
So, on the first question maybe let me give you our economic scenario. What we think
today is that with central bank's committee to stay behind the curve and governments to
spend more money through budget for fiscal deficit. We think that steepening pressure
should continue to affect the different interest rates curve and notably in the U.S. Come
back to full economic activity and (inaudible) seems I think to be a prerequisite to any
action by central bank against the potential strike inflation. And acceleration of the pace of
vaccination, easing of lockdown measures coupled with tension on supply chains that we
see makes me a believe that there is still potential for further inflation dynamism in the
months to come and my conviction is that it should happen by the end of the summer or
beginning of the fall. So that's the scenario we are playing today, so that's why I said and
that's my conviction. You should see a full rebalancing of the portfolio by the end of the
year.
The opportunity cost, of course, there is a cost we need any strategy. So the opportunity
cost to maintain 1 billion of corporate bond -- U.S. corporate bond in cash, which means
remunerated almost at zero today. On the full-year basis, it's a cost of 20 basis points on
the income yield, again 20 basis point if we maintain EUR1 billion in cash 12 months.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 20892984 <GO>}

Thank you, Francois. Jean-Paul on the combined ratio.

Operator
Yeah, on the combined ratio, so again comparing Q1 2021 with Q1 2020, there's a 5 points
improvement, of those 5 points 3 are coming from a lower manmade loss activity. It's a -we're not really sure where -- why it's such a benign quarter this quarter, part of it could

FINAL

be explained by lower industrial activity because of COVID. And part of it could be
explained just improvement in terms of conditions on the insurance side. So we'll have to
wait few more quarters to confirm whether this is an anomaly or a new trend. On the two
remaining points is really improvement in possibility that we're seeing in this quarter. So if
there was a normal level of manmade activities this quarter, the normalized would be
instead of the 91 point something it is this quarter it would be more like a 94.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. But just to be clear on this one is basically, it feels like so far what you're seeing in
terms of net pricing feeding into the combined ratio is 2%, which could be a function of
your portfolio change or the pricing improvement, so that's a fair comment yeah. It's not
1% that you were driving at the beginning of the year is 2% at the moment.

Operator
Yeah. Right. At this quarter it's 2% that's right.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes, good afternoon everyone. First question would be for Paolo, regarding management
actions taken in -- portfolio management actions taken in Q1. I think that adjusted for the
COVID-19 claim in Q1, actually, we can compute a pretty high or higher technical margin at
9.4 implying delta to your long-term assumptions of EUR44 million. So maybe Paolo could
explain us where this EUR44 million are coming from? And if at the end of the day you are
expecting portfolio actions to be a bit higher than what you were potentially guiding to at
the end of the year?
Second question would be related to P&C. Actually we are seeing very, very strong results
coming from the credit insurers, it looks like expected bankruptcy claims are far to pick up
at this point in time. Could you quantify how much COVID-19 trade credit losses you've
taken at the end of the year and what the prospect for this COVID-19 losses on credit, I
mean, should we expect some form of release in the coming quarters? And very last one
to squeeze also, on the P&C. Can you say is the Swiss -- the Suez Canal blockage for you
was a Q1 plan or Q2 plan? Thank you.

Thank you, Tom. Paolo.

FINAL

Operator
Yeah, Hi Tom. I think as I just mentioned before, for Q1, we saw very good underlying
performance in the business and ex-COVID we have seen the business performing
definitely above our Quantum Leap assumption of 7.2, 7.4. I just like to remind you, we're
constantly working with our clients and our retro partners on treaties that are not
performing as expected to optimize structures. And as part of reinforce management
we're regularly reviewing globally the portfolio and take actions where appropriate.
I will say that in Q1 consistent with prior quarters, we have taken step to increase premium
rates in certain underperforming contracts and these actions are similar to what we have
done in the past. As we mentioned in February, when we did the 2020 full-year results
presentation, the P&L impact and solvency ratio impact of each action it really depends on
contract terms in the mixture of business covered in each contract and the claim
experience in the contract and other factors. So it's very difficult for us to forecast exactly
how much is happening one quarter the other.

Bloomberg Transcript

And in 2021, we are continuing our strategy of optimizing overall our reinforce portfolio.
So overall, again, as I said, we feel comfortable with the 5%. We think it gives us a -- yeah,
it gives us good comfort as we go through 2021. I would also like to note that, our overall
research continue to have very significant margin of prudence and that makes us feeling
comfortable as we move into the rest of 2021. Thank you.

A - Olivier Armengaud

{BIO 20892984 <GO>}

Thank you, Paolo. Jean-Paul on the two P&C questions.

Operator
Yes. So, first one on the credit and surety, what you're saying, Thomas, we see the same
thing that I think the fears of additional losses coming in COVID to the credit and surety
portfolio is not -- has not been happening. We've seen reassuring results from some of
our cadence in Q4, and from what we hear Q1 is a similar trend actually I think a lot of the
underwriting actions have been taken has actually improved the portfolio compared to
maybe where it was before. So there's been a lot of underwriting actions taken by these
companies and the performance has been very good.
So, we have some IBNR that were taken for credit and surety and that we keep holding
that Q1 and we'll review those as we receive additional information throughout the year. I
think going forward it's going to be very difficult for us unproportional business to really
separate what is COVID and what is not COVID from those board roads. So we just look
at the overall loss ratio. But the overall loss ratio right now, aims to hold steady compared
to pre COVID conditions.
On the Suez Canal, we did take some charge in Q1, a very small charge of EUR1.5 million.
That's really related to whole and some whole loss. What's uncertain is the sort of the
Page 14 of 22

contingent VI both from the canal itself and then from suppliers, as you know the
company managing the Suez Canal has filed a significant claim of the order of $1 billion,
but the justification for the claim remains very unclear. And so, I think those -- that
information will take time to make its way through the marketplace. So right now, Q1
we've taken the effect that we know for sure on the whole and the rest we're waiting to
see how this develops.

Commerzbank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good afternoon to everyone. Two questions, first on the Texas
Winter Storm and freeze the EUR98 million net loss to -- or net claim you incurred from
that. Obviously, it's quite a complex loss, first of all, can you give us a cross figure and how
much the reinsurance recoverable is? And naively one could think it comes from one
treaty, but that is definitely not the case, it comes from many treaties and also many signs
of business. Can you shed more light on the composition of this loss? How many treaties?
How many lines of business? Second question, the obvious question capital position is
very strong. What do you think about capital repatriation? Do you feel you need a buffer
against your optimal solvency range? These are my two questions.

A - Olivier Armengaud

{BIO 20892984 <GO>}

Thank you, Michael, Jean-Paul on Texas.

Operator
Yeah. On Texas, so the market was estimated for the storm is about $15 billion. Our
estimates are really coming from property treaties primarily and this is primarily for risk
and proportional treaties. There's some CAT excel contribution, but very little most of
these losses would be in the retention of the larger programs. The CAT excel with some
small companies that are affected and we have a few clients from specialty insurance, but
it's very limited. So the bulk of it is coming from relatively large number of risk and
proportional property treaties.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

And can you say the cross amount? What do you expect for yourself ?

Operator

Page 15 of 22



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2021-04-28

Yeah. The amount of recoveries is very limited, I'd say it's more or less gross and that's
because of the composition of the loss. And the fact that it also happened early in the
year.

A - Olivier Armengaud

{BIO 20892984 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you, Jean-Paul. Ian on the capital question.

A - Ian Kelly

{BIO 19976646 <GO>}

Yeah. Sure, and hi, Michael. And obviously we're very happy that the solvency of the group
is in a very strong position. But let's be clear that that's partly due to the movement in the
interest rates in the quarter. On top of that, I would add we are still in the pandemic. It
really is too early to be thinking about capital management actions such as additional
capital return at this stage. I would say on top of that, we remain in a positive market
environment in particular on the P&C side. So you've seen strong renewals from the
group and given the market opportunities that we have with that hardening market
environment, which we think will be sustained that will carry on into 2022 that represents
good value for shareholders in terms of accretive growth. So given all of those factors, it's
a bit early to be thinking about capital return with the solvency ratio where it stands.

Q - Michael Haid

Operator
Our next question is coming from James Shuck from Citi. Please go ahead.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon, everybody. So a couple things. The reduction in corporate exposure -corporate bond exposure Q4 to now 43 down to 36, obviously, you're rebating that up by
year end let's say close to 45%. What's the drag on solvency that we should expect from
that, benefit in Q1, from moving the other way but just came to know what the drive will
be as the year goes on?
Second question, on the combined ratio on P&C. So 91% is your normalized number, but
you're normalizing for 7 points of net CAT and Q1 is normally very light year for net CAT.
So are we normalizing more 3% or 4% based on history, which you can be shown in the
appendix? So that implies the kind of number of sub 94%, which is the number that you
indicated normalized for manmade, so maybe writing about 91. So, perhaps you could
shed a little bit more light on that absolute number. And what's driving that strong
absolute number into Q1, please? Thank you.

{BIO 20892984 <GO>}

Thank you, James. Frieder on the first question.

FINAL

A - Frieder Knupling

{BIO 17247809 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Olivier. You should expect a relatively small impact of the reduction in
recurring income. This is going to be much smaller than the effect of the interest rate
movements themselves, which affect the overall bond portfolio at the whole balance
sheet and our SCR. So, compared to the dynamics of interest rate movements on our
solvency position, the impact of holding a share of the portfolio momentarily in cash is
quite smart and can actually be favorable if interest rates continue to increase. It will
dampen the loss in market value of existing fixed income portfolio and industry overall
favorable for SCOR's position.

Operator
If I may add to what Frieder said, and we benefit also in the internal model from a
significant diversification benefit on the investment portfolio. So, in any case any re-risking
of the portfolio, especially with investment grade corporate bonds would have let's say
non-material impact on this current situation.

A - Olivier Armengaud

{BIO 20892984 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. Jean-Paul on the second question.

Operator
Yeah. I'm not sure I understand your question, but if I go back to the CAT activity, some
normalized using a 7% CAT ratio or net combined ratio would stand at 91.4, as I describe
compared to Q1 2020, that's 5 points lower with (Multiple Speakers) coming from -- yes,
please, James.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Yeah. So it's just like 7 points nat cat across the whole year makes sense, but Q1 is
normally very light for nat cat. So would 7 points to normalize in Q1, so, if I take your 94%,
which is a normalized number of mandates and then assume 3 or 4 points of nat cat in Q1.
I'm getting a number more like 91 and my question is what's the driver of that being so
good?

Operator
You mean the normalized or the cap, I don't understand your question. On the -- the
normalized what we do is we take 7% cap -- with 7% cap ratio regardless of the quarter.
Whether it's Q1, Q2, Q3 we take 7% so that the rest is really an indication of the
performance of the portfolio ex-caps. And here what we see is it's improving compared
to last year.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

FINAL

Maybe we can take it offline, the question is, more than 7% nat cat, makes sense across
the full year, but Q1 is not a normal. Q1 is normally in lower number for natural catastrophe.
So only normalizing at 7 normalizing at lower number, which means your underlying
(Multiple Speakers) much better.

Operator
Right. Yeah. I understand your point. So we -- this is not the way we've been doing it or we
don't have a normalization for cap that's relative to the let's say the activity throughout
the year. We just applied the same number of course the same quarters, but you're right,
Q1 is typically been a very low activity quarter. For the U.S. we see for the industry overall
the Q1 this year is 4 times higher than the 10-year average.
It's a reflection of the unusual nature of the Storm Uri. But throughout the year Q2 is
typically also a relatively low activity quarter. So we'll have to see what the rest of the year
has installed for us. But in the meantime the 7% is a normalization we use across the
entire year and every quarter.

Yes, hi and good afternoon, everyone. Couple of remaining questions from me. Firstly, on
renewals. Now we've seen the results of your revenue there is some market commentary
about the slowdown in pricing momentum as we go into June-July and given June-July it's
a bit more U.S. focused. I mean, if I look at your rate revenues you have been quite busy
and you have been stating that in certain cases prices were not very compelling. So, if you
can give us some kind of commentary or expectations going into June-July that would be
helpful.

Now secondly again on the P&C side, and it relates more to the development of the
COVID loss. I'm wondering how IBNR reserves essentially have been developing over the
quarter as you have been getting more claims notifications and whether now you have
additional data points that make you confident that the current level of the reserves is
adequate. I remember most time we heard you on the phone saying something along the
lines that up to EUR20 million of losses on the P&C side for 2021 relating to COVID, is that
still the case or has anything changed there? Thank you.

A - Olivier Armengaud

{BIO 20892984 <GO>}

Thank you, Paris. Jean-Paul, on the two questions.

Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, thank you. On the first question, so going into the reinsurance renewals, we did see
at April 1st especially in the U.S. sort of a more difficult market for reinsurers. But it's also a
reflection of the fact that it's a relatively small renewal in terms of number of clients and
treaties renewing. And as well the treaties renewing we're mostly not lost affected. So on
the property side, you saw in our disclosures, 4% rate increases on the U.S. cat, which is
smaller than we achieved in 1-1 and smaller than we anticipate the going forward. But I
think it's just a reflection of the program renewing difficulty in that date or for the CAT
excel going into June-July, we expect to go back to rate increases year-over-year of high
single digit to low double digits on the cat side.
On the casualty side, we also saw in the U.S. a different dynamic than expecting were a
number of markets have been satisfied with the level of rate increases achieved on the
insurance and therefore happy to keep commissions -- reinsurance commissions either
stable or actually increasing them in favor of the insurance companies. In those cases,
we've reduced or come off those programs. So going into the renewals in June-July, we
expect more of that dynamic to take place. To question mark of say the casualty renewals
were affected by some of the new markets, either new companies or companies that
were not active in casualty becoming active in casualty reinsurance again and those
markets affected the outcomes. The question is whether they will remain to the same
level of activity in June-July or will that sort of level off. So we remain cautious on the U.S.,
more optimistic on the CAT going into June-July, and on the rest of the regions renewing
still very bullish in terms of market trends and price increases achieved.
Relative to your question on -- and maybe before we go to COVID, maybe Laurent, you
can give an overview of what we're seeing on the specialty insurance side.
Sure. I mean our specialty insurance, so what we mean here is largely the large
commercial lines insurance and CAT business, rate increases still remain extremely strong
in particular on the casualty side where the momentum remains the same. On the
property lines in energy, occupancies and heavy industries, we have been seeing rate on
rate increases of two digits for almost three years now. And we are seeing a deceleration,
I would say of the increases. So still positive increases, but clearly there has been a
deceleration.

FINAL

In terms of rate adequacy, we are in very positive territory on property lines, and clear do
casualty given social inflation, given interest rates, we still have some way to go before
getting good rate adequacy. But by and large, we are currently in a hot market for
insurance that we haven't been in for several years. So it's the profitability has been pretty
strong.
On your second question regarding COVID, at the end of Q4, and again in Q1, we had
booked EUR284 million for COVID at the end of Q1, we have paid EUR39 million for
claims. So, even though we're starting to receive some information from Cedents has
been still very slow coming in especially on the Property BI, I think insurance companies
are also trying to get a hold of the information themselves, whether it's one wave, two
wave, three waves or is it one event or several events. And so I think these -- this
information is still ongoing and will probably take another quarter or two you to get better
clarity.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Hi, thank you for the opportunity. I've got two more left. One is on the forex impact on
top-line, which I'm aware we discussed early in the call where Francois I think you
suggested that it was dollar depreciating against the euro and euro also appreciating
most other currencies. Now, when I see how the shareholders equity has developed in Q1.
There is a decent positive impact from Forex translation. Now, I know it isn't impossible to
have the sort of divergence. But I would have thought it's pretty rare. So perhaps you can
explain what is driving this difference, the positive impact on balance sheet and a negative
on P&L.
And the second question was really trying to understand the movement in unrealized
gains on real estate. And this is on Slide 45. I see there is a small drop in unrealized gains
from EUR125 million to EUR111 million, whereas there hasn't been any realized gains from
real estate over the course of the quarter. So I'm just trying to understand what's the right
way to look at these figures? So any explanation there would be helpful. Thank you.

A - Olivier Armengaud

{BIO 20892984 <GO>}

Thank you, Vikram. Ian on the first question.

A - Ian Kelly

{BIO 19976646 <GO>}

Yeah, sure. So the dynamic -- the FX dynamic that you're seeing there I think is that Q1,
sorry the top line premium that's an average rate comparison, Q1 2021 against Q1 2020.

Page 20 of 22



Company N ame: SCOR SE

FINAL

And what we see there is Q1 20 the dollar/euro rate was about 0.9, in Q1 2021 it's about
0.8 and that's driving the impacts there those average rates across those periods. And to
give you some sense on premium, we've got about 44% is U.S. dollar denominated, 19%
euro, 10% GBP and then we're into other currencies.
And then on the CTA that you see in the balance sheet that is a -- that's a closing rate
impact, that's closing rate Q1 against closing rate Q4 2020. And there you do see a slight
reverse in fact, so I think Q4 '20 and the dollar/euro rate was 0.82, now 0.85 broadly, so
that gives you the dynamics that the reason you see the top line coming down, but a
positive impact in CTA. Okay?

So, on the real estate portfolio that's just a mechanical effect due to the fact that we have
invested on some assets. So it increases the book value of some assets and we have an
external valuation of real estate portfolio by an independent tax payer that is done at the
end of June and at the end of December. So market's value have not been reviewed, it
will be done in Q2 as previous years, but we have increased the book value due to

Yeah. Hi. So, it's Ian here, Thomas. On the tax, and this is distorted a little by a couple of
effects. Firstly, we were experiencing a geographic rate mix and that had losses in the low
tax rate jurisdictions, principally COVID losses. So, that was appearing in Ireland and then
coming -- sorry, appearing in the U.S. and then coming through into Ireland. And then we
had the profits coming through more in the higher rate, tax jurisdictions, particularly in
France. So the losses on the P&C side, they were principally retained in the U.S. some did
come through to France, but the very strong underlying profitability that we've been
talking about in the call on the P&C side that more than offset that. So that's distorted the
group ETR in a quarter where the overall net income is low. So we would expect to
normalize back to towards the 24% Quantum Leap numbers by the end of the year as we
progress and through the following quarters.
