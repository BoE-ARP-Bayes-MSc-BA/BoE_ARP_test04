Thank you, Susan. Good morning to everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter and
year-end conference call. I'd like to share my thoughts about the quarter, after which Jay
Bullock, our Chief Financial Officer, will add more commentary to the financial results. We
look forward to responding to any questions you may have following our remarks during
the Q&A portion of the call.

Bloomberg Transcript

After the market close yesterday, Argo reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter
of 2016 of $19.8 million or $0.65 per diluted share, compared to $24.5 million or $0.78 per
share in the 2015 period. Results in the quarter reflect an increase in property losses
mainly related to certain catastrophic events. On an annual basis, our results reflected
another solid underwriting effort, coupled with strong results from our investments
portfolio, with operating earnings of 13.9% higher at $3.92 per share compared to $3.44
per share in 2015.
Net income of $1.07 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016, $4.75 per diluted share for
the year 2016, and an annual return on average equity of 8.5%. I should also add that for
the past four years, on a combined basis, our ROE has averaged 9.8%. We ended the
year with book value of $59.73 per share, a 10% increase from December 31, 2005 (sic)
[2015] (3:58).
And I should also say that for the past 15 years, we've grown book value per share on a
compounded annual basis in excess of 10%. In 2016, this was accomplished despite
catastrophic losses over 2.5 times the level experienced in 2015. As we've discussed in
the past, we consider the compounded annual growth rate of book value per share as the
measure that most clearly demonstrates value creation for our shareholders.
I also want to again highlight the improving underlying trends in our loss ratios excluding
catastrophic losses and prior-year accident development. On an overall basis in the fourth
quarter of 2016, our underlying loss ratio improved 2.3 points to 56.7% from 59.0% in the
fourth quarter of 2015. On an annual basis, the loss ratio excluding cats and prior-year
development improved to 55.4% from 56.4%. We're particularly pleased that the
improvement was reflected in all of our business segments in the fourth quarter
comparison. And for the year, three out of our four businesses reported better results,
with the Syndicate basically flat in 2016 over 2015 for the year.
Taking a look behind the overall numbers, our U.S. businesses continue to perform quite
well. In fact, underwriting income from our Commercial Specialty business in 2016 was
$62.5 million. Let me say that again, $62.5 million in underwriting income, which was higher
than the $49 million of underwriting income earned in our E&S business and twice the
Page 2 of 17

FINAL

underwriting income that we earned in 2015 for Commercial Specialty. Nearly all of our
businesses in Commercial Specialty reported an improved result over the prior year. I will
go into further detail in a moment.
While the Syndicate and International Specialty segments were impacted by aboveaverage catastrophic and property losses and intense market condition, they're
continuing to grow and develop as a key strategic component of our platform. These
businesses are now being led by Jose Hernandez, our new Head of International, and the
acquisition of Ariel Re, which recently closed, we added further scale and diversity to our
Bermuda and London-based businesses, continuing to advance our international growth
objectives.
Gross written premiums in 2016 grew to over $2.1 billion, up 7.6% over the 2015 result. And
our combined ratio increased modestly to 96.2% from 95% in 2015, reflecting the
increase in property-related losses that I mentioned earlier. As reported results,
catastrophic losses increased more than 2.5 times in 2016 from those of 2015 and we
were less dependent on prior-year development, which I consider a real positive.

Bloomberg Transcript

Prior-year favorable reserve development was $14.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016
and $33.3 million for the year, fairly consistent to the 2015 experience. I'm pleased to note
that net investment income grew 30% to $115.1 million, up from $88.6 million in 2015. Asset
class diversification and an allocation to strategies away from our core bond holdings
contributed strongly in both the fourth quarter and in 2016 to our overall investment
results. Also, as discussed in previous calls, our expense ratio is showing favorable yearover-year improvement. In 2016, the expense ratio was 38.8% versus 39.2% in 2015.
Another initiative you've heard me talk about over the last few years is our investment in
innovation to meet the changing needs of our clients. We're simplifying how we do
business by leveraging technology to make Argo an easier carrier to do business with.
While many of these investments in technology will take several quarters to demonstrate
the value we think inherent in the ideas, we can point to several initiatives that get us
quite excited that we're on the right path.
For example, we're developing a tool called Smart Search (8:34), which pulls important
individual account risk information from a variety of internal and external data sources at
the touch of a button. Built on a modern cloud computing platform, proprietary artificial
intelligence algorithms help reduce underwriting errors and get us closer to our goal of
delivering complex underwriting decisions at greatly increased speeds. This is just one of
many examples of what our digital team is working on.
Another dynamic that is quite positive is the new additions to our management team on
all levels. As our company's performance continues to advance and as others consolidate
and retrench, we're attracting and hiring more of the great talent in our industry. As you've
heard me say before, we now have more of the best people in the right positions in our
company than at any other time during my tenure as the CEO of Argo.

FINAL

You can see this in the underwriting results at our Commercial Specialty segment in
addition to the solid momentum in many of our businesses. With an increasingly visible
and respected brand, we have never been in a better position to execute on our longterm goal of being a leading global specialty underwriter and to continue delivering
improving results as we did in 2016.
Now, let me briefly comment on each of our operating segments. On average, overall
rates for the segment were up – on average, overall rates for the E&S segment were up
modestly, as increases in specialty lines were offset by larger decreases in property lines,
if you can believe that. For the quarter, our – for the quarter and year, our E&S business
grew by 6% and 4% in 2006 (sic) [2016] (10:17).
Growth is primarily being driven by our casualty lines, historically one of our most
profitable segments. Our advantage continues to be the strong relationships our business
leaders and underwriters have with our customers. We're focused internally on
underwriting excellence and value-adding actuarial analytics, and externally, by
distinguishing ourselves in the marketplace on our service.

Bloomberg Transcript

Perhaps the most positive result to comment on this year is our Commercial Specialty
segment. In calendar – in 2016, this segment produced $62.5 million in underwriting
income, up from $30.1 million in 2015. To put things in perspective, in 2012, we had an
underwriting loss of $47.6 million in this segment. Kevin Rehnberg, our Head of the U.S.
Insurance Operations since 2013, has had in his first priority restoring the historical
profitability of our Commercial Specialty segment. And I'm happy to report that now,
nearly all businesses are reporting near record results.
Overall, gross written premium was up 15.2% in the quarter and 18.7% for the year 2016,
driven by our program, surety and professional lines businesses. Positive gains were also
reported by our public entity business, Trident. Three years ago, we moved Ron Vindivich,
a seasoned pro from our E&S operations to run the public entity business. In 2016, under
Ron's leadership, Trident posted the best underwriting results in over 10 years.
In 2016, we hired Craig Landi, another industry leader, to run our professional lines
business, Argo Pro. At Argo Pro, in 2016, gross written premium was up 20% for the
(12:07) prior year. And I should also mention that our surety business, under the leadership
of Josh Betz and his team, had its best year ever as measured both by gross written
premium and underwriting income, despite challenges in the energy sectors, which are
most important to our surety business. So, in summary for Commercial Specialty, we're
firing on all cylinders and have never been better positioned.
And moving on to our International Businesses, 2016 presented challenges for the
industry. While we suffered our share of losses, we weathered the catastrophic activity
well. In October, we introduced Jose Hernandez as our new Head of our International
Platform. We brought Jose on board given his experience building and running successful
operations in several countries around the globe, particularly those where we at Argo
operate.

FINAL

Jose and the entire International and corporate team spent the last few months of 2016
completing the Ariel Re acquisition. The transaction was completed on a quick time
horizon and the company well-positioned for the important January renewal season, and
we're confident that he will continue to grow our International Business to reach our
ambitious expectations.
Turning to Syndicate 1200, I wish I could tell you that the market conditions were
improving, but the fact is competition remains fierce at Lloyd's. We did achieve 14.5%
growth in gross written premiums in the fourth quarter and 4.2% in 2016, and this growth
was achieved even as we reduced our ownership of the Syndicate slightly. The Lloyd's
market continues to be more challenging now than in the last two decades.

Bloomberg Transcript

We've been very vocal about the need for scale to effectively compete in this market, and
the acquisition of Ariel Re provides us with much needed scale, which will improve our
efficiency. Our advantage continues to be the market credibility of underwriting teams and
distribution relationships. As with Lloyd's, our International Specialty segment continues to
experience challenging market conditions. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we grew gross
written premiums by 8.7%, driven primarily by new business in our Bermuda casualty and
professional lines operations.
Premium from our operations in Brazil was up in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to
2015, but declined modestly for all of 2016, primarily reflecting the country's economic
recession and the depreciation of the – and the depreciation of the Brazilian real was
down approximately 6% compared to 2015. Despite the challenging economic
environment in Brazil, we continue to see strong growth in professional lines driven by our
digital platform. And I'm happy to say that we made an operating profit for the year in our
Brazilian business.
At Argo Re, in 2016, our reinsurance business was challenged by competitive market
conditions, including excess capital in the space and related pressure on pricing. With our
acquisition of Ariel Re, however, we expect to benefit from additional scale in that market.
Earlier this month, we announced that Ryan Mather, former CEO of Ariel Re, will be
running our reinsurance business going forward.
Ryan has over 25 years of industry experience, a tremendously profitable track record and
a loyal following in the business. We're also very excited to have him and his team as part
of Argo Group. Matthew Wilken, who's been running the reinsurance business at Argo Re
for the past few years, will continue on working in conjunction with Ryan as his number two
running all of our reinsurance business. And also, I'm not sure if I said this before, but it
was actually Matthew's idea that we bring Argo Re and Ariel Re together. So, Matthew,
well done.
Turning to our investments for the year, our core bond portfolio was up 1.9% and our risk
portfolio was up nearly 13%. Our reported net investment income was $25.4 million for the
fourth quarter, $5 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2015. As most of you know, in
2016, we began to include the performance from our alternative investments in
investment income. Alternatives contributed $3.1 million in the quarter compared to $9.8

FINAL

million last quarter and to a loss of $1.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. As a reminder,
we expect the alternative contribution to be lumpy by quarter and have provided historical
data in our press release tables.
For the fourth quarter of 2016, Argo's total return was flat, bringing year-to-date return to
4.3%. During the fourth quarter, Treasury yields increased, which negatively impacted our
core bond portfolio, where most of our investment grade mandates were down about
1.3%. Offsetting this was our high-quality CLO and bank loan portfolios, which were up
1.6%. Furthermore, our actively managed currency EM debt, high-yield debt and equity
mandates in our risk portfolio were up 3.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. This has been a
really good year for our investment portfolio, and I really want to thank Mark Rose for all
of his hard work.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving on to capital management, I'm compelled to comment each quarter on our
philosophy, but in reality has not changed. Our first use of capital is to support the balance
sheet, our second is to grow the business, our third is to have capital available for
opportunities as they arise, and the most recent example is the acquisition of Ariel Re.
Once those are satisfied, we will have actively – we will continue to actively return excess
capital to our shareholders in an effective manner.
In 2016, we repurchased 847,111 shares of stock for $47.1 million. In total, over the last six
years, we've returned more than $374 million of capital to shareholders, with $266 million
of capital through share repurchases and we paid $108 million in cash dividends. We
continue to view our stock as one of the best investments available and will balance the
return of capital to shareholders with our priority of building the Argo franchise and
shareholder value in the long-run.
With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Jay Bullock.

Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Thanks Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll be brief in providing some detail on the
financials, and then open it up to questions. As Mark highlighted, 2016 represented
another strong result for Argo, not in the least measured by Group-wide underwriting
profit of $54 million, supplemented by an increase in the investment results of over $28
million.
We're often asked a question of improvement in our margins, and the response is
consistently the same. We strive to maximize underwriting profits, whether from better
underwriting or a more efficient operation, and we look to augment growth in book value
per share through thoughtful management of our investment portfolio. And looking at our
underlying results, excluding catastrophe losses and prior-year development, you can see
the continued progress in our loss ratio. Despite some one-time expenses, our expense
ratio has improved. And as mentioned, it was a good year for investment results.
Moving on to some points of note on the financials, gross written premium was up 11.8% in
the fourth quarter and 7.6% in 2016. When looking at the increase in gross written
Page 6 of 17

Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2017-02-14

FINAL

premium in 2016, it's partially driven by growth in our state funds fronting business in the
Commercial Specialty segment. We cede 100% of the rest to (19:41) these state funds. It's
more of a fee-based business and thus does not contribute to the net written or earned
results. The smaller increase in net written premium is also due in part to reduced
participation on the Syndicate.
It's worth repeating we're encouraged by the continued improvement in our core loss
ratio. Our current accident year non-cat loss ratio is 56.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016
and 55.4% for the calendar year. Both compare favorably to the same metrics for 2015,
demonstrating the continued improvement in our underlying business. By segment and
for the Group, the current year accident loss ratios are displayed in the table in the press
release, reconciling the various loss ratios, which we believe gives you a good look at the
underlying profitability.
In addition, in 2016, we continued the trend of overall favorable reserve development
from prior accident years. For the fourth quarter, we experienced net favorable
development of $14.5 million, and for the calendar year 2016, it was $33.3 million. Of
particular note was the contribution from several different businesses in our Commercial
Specialty segment. That alone contributed almost $23 million to the annual result.

Bloomberg Transcript

As always, all the relevant figures on loss development are displayed in the table in the
press release. As mentioned, catastrophe losses in the quarter of just under $23 million
were primarily related to Hurricane Matthew, additional late reported losses from
Louisiana floods in Syndicate 1200 and the New Zealand earthquake. These losses
accounted for approximately 6.4 points on the combined ratio.
For the year 2016, losses related to these claims, along with U.S. weather, including Texas
hailstorms and the Canadian wildfires. Also, as we have talked about in prior calls, we
continue to see a favorable trend in our expense ratio. We remain focused on organizing
the business with a simplified approach in mind that will allow us not only to scale our
existing operations more effectively, but also make it easier for customers to do business
with us.
Our recent acquisition of Ariel Re puts us further along in the path in both our Lloyd's and
Bermuda businesses. A couple of comments on investment returns. We saw a meaningful
contribution to investment income from alternatives for the year of $23.9 million in 2016.
And as you can see from the table in the release, these results have varied from $1.5
million loss in the first quarter to $12.5 million gain in the second.
These returns will continue to vary quarter-over-quarter, but we expect consistent positive
returns over the long-run. The result for 2016 is a very good result and exceeded our
expectations. The foreign currency movement through the income statement was a gain
for the quarter of $9 million and $4.5 million for the year. This was due to favorable foreign
exchange movements in the quarter, which resulted in a gain on non-dollar liabilities in the
quarter.

FINAL

For the fourth quarter of 2016, the effective tax rate for the Group was almost 30% versus
our core assumption of 20%. The higher-than-expected rate was mainly due to
approximately 79% of earnings being attributable to our U.S. operating platforms. In
addition, the current quarter includes tax paid on the movement of capital to our Bermuda
platform. The effective tax rate for 2016 was 19.4%, very close to our assumption of 20%.
Finally, on the balance sheet, as mentioned, we recently closed the acquisition of Ariel Re.
What is not reflected on the year-end balance sheet, but which will be part of the first
quarter presentation is the debt assumed of approximately $83 million with the
acquisition and the $125 million drawn on our line of credit to fund a portion of the
proceeds. For the year, we ended with a pre-tax unrealized embedded gain of $116 million
in the investment portfolio compared to $84 million at December 31, 2015. The majority of
the gains are part of our equity holdings. Our fixed income holdings remain very short in
duration and carrying value currently approximates market value.
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. We're now prepared to – we're now
ready to take questions.

Q&A
Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question we have
will come from Greg Peters of Raymond James. Please go ahead.

Q - Charles Gregory Peters

{BIO 4656608 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for the call. I wanted to follow-up on a couple of the
comments you made. Jay, on investment income, obviously, the full-year result for 2016
was quite strong relative to 2015. And I'm just trying to figure out, from a modeling
perspective, what 2017 should look like. So, any additional color you can provide regarding
the pattern of alternative investments, et cetera, would be helpful.

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Well, Greg, if you look at the – as I mentioned, there's a table in the press release that
details the quarter-by-quarter alternative investment income. The other – the rest of
investment income is off the – mainly off the core portfolio, and I would expect that to
continue to progress with the increased cash flow that we've seen in the past year. As it
relates to the alternatives, I think you really have to look at it as an annual result. It's very
difficult to predict quarter-over-quarter. As I said, it probably exceeded our expectations.
We tended to assume, in this environment, 6%, 7% would be a pretty good outcome.
Generally speaking, the underlying investments related to that vary anywhere between
$200 million and $300 million depending on what we've got allocated to various
strategies. So, if you take 6% times $250 million or $300 million, that gives you a sense as
to what the annual result might be in a normal year. So, I would – if I were building a
model, I might assume something in the range of $13 million to $16 million, $17 million
Page 8 of 17

evenly spread quarter-over-quarter, knowing that there will be some variance in how
those quarterly results develop.

FINAL

Q - Charles Gregory Peters

{BIO 4656608 <GO>}

Thanks. Thanks for the clarification. And then, on the debt, the $125 million and the $83
million, what's the interest rate on that? And as part of – maybe this is a broader question
for Mark. As part of the capital management process, would you consider just using cash
flow to pay down that debt or what's your perspective there?

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Greg, I think right now, we're pretty comfortable with our leverage. Having said that, if
there is an opportunity to pay off some of the things in our capital structure, and I wouldn't
just limit it to the drawing on the line of credit, that's something that we'll consider as we
do thinking about paying dividends, increasing dividends and/or buying back stock.

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Greg, to answer the question on cost, the drawing on the line of credit, there's a
disclosure in our 10-K about the pricing on the line of credit. I think it's – I believe it's pretty
detailed. It's 1.625% over LIBOR. And then, as it relates to the debt that came with Ariel,
it's structured very similarly to the trust preferreds that were put on, but that were issued
in the market middle of the last decade LIBOR based plus – I believe it was 300-andchange basis points. And so, it has some structural advantages. So, I think to Mark's point,
we've got a lot of flexibility and options with the capital structure and we'll be looking at
alternatives over the next six months to two years.

Q - Charles Gregory Peters

{BIO 4656608 <GO>}

Okay, thanks for that answer as well. And then just finally, Mark, in your comments, you
talked about the challenges in the Syndicate with the combined ratio just for the year, I
think, right under 100%. When we look at maybe just the broader combined ratio target
for the whole organization, considering the acquisition, how should we think about
management's financial objective for 2017 in terms of the combined ratio?

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Well, I think Jay and I have been pretty consistent in saying that we'd like to see a 100
basis point improvement in the combined ratio sequentially year-over-year. And I think
that the Ariel Re reacquisition helps us to get there, because it does get us some scale in
terms of operating efficiencies, primarily in London and to a lesser extent in Bermuda. As
respects our Syndicate 1200, my commentary is as much about the London market as it is
about our Syndicate. I think our Syndicate is very reflective of what's going on there. And
but for an above-average absence of cat activity, I don't think our results would have been
much different this year than a year ago.
They – if you look at across all of the Group, the place that absorbed the most amount of
the cat losses for the year and mainly the fourth quarter was the Syndicate. But by the
way, we would expect that amount of volatility, because we do write a fair amount of
Page 9 of 17

Date: 2017-02-14

FINAL

primary property cat exposure in the Syndicate. So, I – look, I think that we're moving in the
right direction. I think that the Ariel Re transaction helps us lower cost. It gives us more
flexibility and gives our colleagues at the Syndicate a little more flexibility.
So, I think we're on path to keep improving. As I pointed out in my remarks and I think Jay
did too, if I had to point to any one thing to kind of mark progress, that would be one of
the exhibits in the press release. I think it was page 15 that shows our reconciliation of loss
ratios. And if you just go down the year-end columns and you look at current accident year
ex-cat, you'll see that there continues to be a sequential improvement in every segment.
The Syndicate was flat. And by the way, the Syndicate was flat at 53%, so that's not bad.
And the average for the whole Group now is 55.4%, which I'll put up against anybody
when you consider our mix of business and the amount of liability exposure that runs at a
longer tail on the book. So, I'm very happy with where we are today. And if you just look at
our financial results for the last four years now, we've been making sequential progress
year-over-year, and we just keep our head down and keep moving ahead.

Q - Charles Gregory Peters

{BIO 4656608 <GO>}

On the current accident year loss ratio, the 55.4% that you pointed out, that – it's actually
kind of surprising considering the headwinds of just the competitive marketplace. Is it your
expectation that you might be able to get a little bit further improvement in 2017 with Ariel
or do you think the current levels are pretty much as good as it gets?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Well, I don't know if it's as good as it gets, but I was kind of happy with that number.
Having said that, look, as we've said for the last – certainly, the last two years, that we
have given up growth in the top-line for continued change in portfolio mix, so that we can
let go of some of the risk that we don't think meets our pricing targets anymore and
focus on bringing on risk that does. And one of the places that I always use as an example
is E&S. So, in my remarks earlier today, we talked about all the things we're doing with
technology to make it easier for our underwriters and easier for our clients to engage us.
And then, I said, and we grew low single-digits. Well, the two don't go hand in hand.
Well, the reason for that is that for the businesses that we've invested and we're actually
growing double-digits and pretty strong double-digits, but we're still letting go business
that we don't think meets our pricing criteria. And so, that's why you see an overall growth
rate in E&S of less than you might otherwise expect, given my comments. And I think
that'll continue in 2017. I think that we will be presented with far more opportunities than
we take advantage of, because we just don't think that they're adequately priced. I think
that we'll continue mixing around our portfolio. So, in answer to your question, yes, I do
think it's possible that we can still improve our loss ratio, but that's more a function of how
we change our mix of business.

Next, we have Arash Soleimani of KBW.

FINAL

Q - Arash Soleimani

{BIO 18869554 <GO>}

Thanks. Just building off of the last question, does that – so, does that imply from the 100
basis points of improvement that you're, I guess, expecting or targeting in 2017? So,
should we expect a majority of that then, it sounds likes, to come from the expense ratio
with potentially a portion of it coming from business mix changes within core loss ratio
improvement?

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

I'm going to quote my esteemed colleague Jay Bullock, who's in the room with me. We
focus on underwriting margin and the combined ratio, and we don't just focus on either
the loss ratio or the expense ratio. We're trying to drive improvement in both across the
base (34:37).

Q - Arash Soleimani

{BIO 18869554 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And I can't tell you exactly where it's going to come from. I can just tell you that we're
focused on both.

Q - Arash Soleimani

{BIO 18869554 <GO>}

Okay, that's fair. And then, in terms of, I think, you have gotten on a New York real estate
program with Brownstone (34:57). Can you just talk about, I guess, the premium impact
that we should expect that to have?

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Yeah. I think for an annual run rate, it's around $50 million once the program is fully on
board. But that program, I think, just started in the fourth quarter or maybe just in the first
quarter of this year.

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Yeah. But when we bring on new – when we bring on new programs like that, we don't
necessarily write everything that's expiring, so.

Right.

So, maybe $30 million, $35 million...

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

FINAL

Right.

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Is a more conservative number to think about.

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Fully – as a full run rate which will be probably into 2018 (35:36).

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Arash Soleimani

{BIO 18869554 <GO>}

Okay. And then, could you just talk a bit about – obviously, the tax outlook is a bit
uncertain. But if there are any kind of cross-border issues that arise, does that change
your view on pricing at all? Does that – as a Bermuda domiciled carrier, does that make
you look at your underwriting differently? I just wanted to get your thoughts on that.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Well, it's true that our holding company is based in Bermuda and it's true that we have a
large trading platform in Bermuda for both insurance and reinsurance. But we have – we
have almost – we have a ton of capital sitting in the U.S. that supports our underwriting
businesses. And not knowing exactly what will happen, I can't answer the question with
precision. But I can tell you that if the U.S. corporate tax rate goes down in the U.S., that's
beneficial to us. If some tax comes up that impacts how we reinsure our U.S. businesses
either with our own companies or with other companies, we have the ability to take more
risk net here in the U.S. if we want to. So, my guess is for us, it's probably a net positive,
but it's probably more neutral than anything else, keeping in mind that our effective tax
rate is about 19% or 20% right now.

Q - Arash Soleimani

{BIO 18869554 <GO>}

Okay, great. Thank you very much for the answers.

The next question we have will come from Jeff Schmitt of William Blair.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. A quick question on...

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Good morning.

FINAL

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

A quick question on the loss environment. As you'd mentioned, the accident year loss
ratios look really good in the quarter. We're hearing from others a trend up in verdict
payouts, a more active plaintiff bar in the U.S. Is that something you're seeing at all or any
hints of that?

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Well, I grew up in South Texas, where the plaintiffs' bar is about as active as it can get. So,
look, I don't see it being materially – for our portfolio, I don't see it materially different
today than it was a year ago.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Okay. And then, on the capital management front, Mark, I know you'd hit on this. But are
there any valuation parameters there? With the stock trading overbooked, did that
change the equation at all?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Well, if you only want to – if we just focus on repatriation for a minute, then I think that my
colleagues on the board and I will probably give due consideration to whether it makes
more sense to repatriate capital via dividends versus stock buybacks, including the
consideration of a special dividend. Having said that, given that we just acquired Ariel and
brought on a little bit more debt, we may want to settle down the whole balance sheet
before we get too aggressive with capital repatriation. But I do think where we're trading,
dividends maybe a better solution for our shareholders than buying back stock.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Okay, great. Thank you.

Operator
Next, we have Matthew Carletti of JMP.
Hi, good morning. My name is (39:14) I'm asking question on behalf of Matt Carletti at JMP.
And it's regarding the Commercial Specialty business. Mr. Watson had mentioned earlier
the great improvement in this business, and I wanted to ask if there – and I wanted to ask
regarding the ex-cat loss ratio improvement. What business lines are driving this and if
there are any updates on the initiatives of this segment for 2017? Thank you.

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

So, a lot of the improvement is coming from the growth in our surety business, as well as
the growth in our professional liability business, which both run at a lower loss ratio than
Page 13 of 17



Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td
Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2017-02-14

the other parts of Commercial Specialty. So, what you're seeing there is a change in the
mix of business.

Q - Operator

FINAL

Okay, thank you. And then, can you just also comment on why the expense ratio was
sequentially higher in the quarter?

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Yeah. There were some one-time things in the quarter. Are you speaking about
Commercial Specialty in particular or are you talking about the Group?

Q - Operator
Just general.

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

In general, there were some one-time things in the quarter. We had cleared out a lot of
the cash settled options earlier in the year, but we still have some outstanding. And when
the stock price goes up, there's going to be an impact of that. Stock price was up just
under 20% in the fourth quarter. We sort of expect a 2.5% to 3% increase in a quarter. So,
that added $4 million or $5 million of additional expense in the quarter. So, that generated
a decent chunk of that increase, and then there were some other smaller items, including
a small amount related to transaction-related expenses for the Ariel.

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Right. And remember that the expense related to compensation is a non-cash charge.

Q - Operator
All right, thank you very much.
Next, we have Ken Billingsley of Compass Point.

Q - Ken Billingsley

{BIO 6971717 <GO>}

Good morning. I did want to follow-up on the Commercial Specialty answer. I understand
you're saying obviously it's surety and professional liability. Kind of two parts to the
question. One, U.S. infrastructure spending, if the expectations remain there, do you see
continued double-digit growth out of Commercial Specialty into 2017?

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

I would say that depends on market pricing environment over the course of the year. But
we certainly aspire to that, Ken, but we need to see how the market evolves over the
course of the year.

FINAL

Q - Ken Billingsley

{BIO 6971717 <GO>}

And that leads right into my second question. How – you had two years of really strong
growth, not just top-line growth, but improvements in the loss ratio and the combined
ratio for Commercial Specialty. Obviously, I understand there is a business mix shift that's
going on there. I would expect the expense ratio to rise if you write more surety. But how
long can you continue to deliver double-digit growth and get, I guess, pricing
improvement or really that not so much pricing improvement, it's just the change in the
mix of the business?

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Yeah. It's mainly the – it is mainly the change in the mix of business that's driving margin
improvement. And you're correct, that if we write more surety that runs at a higher
expense ratio, but it runs at a lower loss ratio, which is why we keep trying to get
everyone focused on combined ratio and not dwell on one or – either of the expense
ratio or the loss ratio.

Q - Ken Billingsley

{BIO 6971717 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And how long can you carve out this type of production, which is getting that growth?
Obviously, the mix will shift and the combined ratio will be what it is. I would imagine your
competitors are taking notice. Is there – are there particular lines that you find that you are
having a significant competitive advantage in and you're having a lot of opportunities? Or
is this kind of general across the board and which would be at risk, as competitors see
your production, may come in and try and carve out a slice themselves?

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Well, remember it doesn't take – it doesn't take that much for us to move the needle on a
percentage basis relative to the competitors that I think you're talking about. So, I'm not
sure that our modest growth in dollar terms really gets their attention. But I – look, I think
that we're very good at executing. I think I mentioned earlier that Josh Betz and his team
in Surety were doing really, really well. And I think they've got one of the best operations.
So, I think that is their – I think they are very well positioned to keep growing, and I think
they have a strong competitive advantage to do that, as an example.

Q - Ken Billingsley

{BIO 6971717 <GO>}

Thank you. I want to ask a question on the Ariel Re. You'd commented – and please
correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought you had commented that this new business also will
create some flexibility in Bermuda and London. And on that flexibility, does that actually
create maybe a substitute for the type of product that they're going to be working with or
is this going to be new opportunities that they're going to be able to explore?

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Well, look, I think we have a platform that allows us to be a little bit more flexible in many
different ways. And as you know, I like to talk about what we've done, not what we're
going to do. So, stay tuned and let's talk about it in the end of the first quarter or the end
of the – probably the end of the second quarter is a better time.

Q - Ken Billingsley

{BIO 6971717 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. And then, on what you did – this is from the presentation. I believe the last 12-month
net income for Ariel Re was about $29 million. Is this something that would be enhanced
under your umbrella? And if so, does that assume that Ariel Re could add about 200 basis
points to return on tangible equity, just if it continue to operate as it was? And is it
something that you guys enhanced under your umbrella?

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Well, I think in the short-run, there is – well, in the short-run, we're just trying to get
everybody on the same page. In the medium-term, so think the second half of this year,
there is some cost savings to be had. And I think that particularly given the Lloyd's
planning cycle, it's really hard for us to start to leverage and bring things together until the
beginning of 2018. And that seemed a long way away last summer, when we started
thinking about it. But now, it doesn't seem so far away. We have to start planning with
Lloyd's in about four months' time.

Q - Ken Billingsley

{BIO 6971717 <GO>}

No sign of further questions. We'll go ahead and conclude today's question-and-answer
session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Mark Watson for any
closing remarks. Sir?

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Thank you. And I'd like to thank everyone again for joining us this morning. You may have
noticed that I mentioned a number of my colleagues during the call this morning, and
that's because it takes a whole team to run this place. And I really think that, as I said in my
remarks earlier, we have a great team. I'd like to thank everybody.
For every one I did mention today, there's probably 10 more people I should have. And
we finished this year in a really good spot. I think we're continuing to invest in the future
and in a good place to keep executing against that. And I just want to thank everybody for
their hard work, and I look forward to talking to you all at the end of the first quarter.
Thank you. That concludes my remarks.

Operator
And we thank you, sir and the rest of the management team for your time also today. The
conference call has now concluded. Again, we thank you all for attending today's
presentation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines. Thank you. Take care and have a
great day.
