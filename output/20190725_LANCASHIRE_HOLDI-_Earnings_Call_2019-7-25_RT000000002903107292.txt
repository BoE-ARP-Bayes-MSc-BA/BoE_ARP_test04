Presentation

Hello, and welcome to the Lancashire Holdings Limited First Half 2019 Results. Throughout
the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode, and afterwards there will be a
question and answer session. Please note, this call is being recorded.
Today, I'm pleased to present, Alex Maloney, Group CEO, please begin your meeting.

Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report a strong set of results
for the first six months of 2019. Our return on equity of 6.9%, with a combined ratio of
86.6% demonstrates our underwriting and investment strategies continue to deliver
sensible risk-adjusted shareholder returns during a period of change in our industry. Our
year-to-date return on equity is marginally higher than the corresponding periods for both
2017 and 2018 which makes sense to us. Our results are on track and where we thought
they would be, albeit a with a slightly different blend of the investment and underwriting
returns.

FINAL

Our investment returns are higher than the corresponding period in 2018, given the move
in yields and spreads and strong equity markets. Our underwriting results have been
marginally impaired due to attritional losses mainly emulating from our onshore energy
account. But these losses are within our expectations for such events and highlight the
value of our policies and claim service, which we provide to our clients.
As the year has progressed, we have seen rating levels improve in virtually all the classes
of the business which we underwrite, as demonstrated in our Renewal Price Index. We're
also seeing more opportunities to write to new business as other shared business which
allows us to offer our own pricing at levels we believe are more sustainable.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have always said -- we've always had the view that we would flex with the
underwriting opportunity, and that is reflected in our premium growth this quarter and for
the year-to-date. We have grown our premiums 20% during the second quarter, with topline growth of 9.5% for the year-to-date. But when adjusting for multi-year contracts and
other premium adjustments, our underlying premium growth for the year-to-date is
approximately 15%.
There has been a noticeable shift in sentiment during the second quarter of this year
versus the first quarter where we are witnessing a more disciplined underwriting climate.
We believe, this is driven by three main factors, loss creep emanating from prior year CAT
losses, risk losses highlighting the anemic levels of premium in various classes of business
and large carriers reducing their risk appetite. We still wouldn't call the current climate a
hard market but there are more pockets of dislocation across a number of classes of
business, which we underwrite. We expect rating levels to continue to improve through
2019 and into 2020 regardless of any CAT activity, we may witness over the summer.
Clearly, if we do see another CAT loss, or a series of CAT losses, we would expect the
current pace of hardening to speeden up. We have always said that, we believe our
industry is cyclical and we are now entering the next phase of the cycle. At Lancashire, we
feel particularly well positioned to maximize this stage of the cycle. We have the right
people, no legacy issues, and the capital to enable us to grow into the improving
opportunity.
Finally, I'd like to thank all my colleagues for their continued hard work, and our
shareholders for their support of our company and I'll now hand over to Paul.

Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Thanks Alex. The first half of 2019 has certainly been eventful and we're undoubtedly in
the transitioning market. At the start of the year, we anticipated continued rating
improvement in the specialty insurance lines and a broadly flat property CAT market,
albeit noting, loss impacted territories, such as Japan and elements of the US portfolio
are likely to show rate strengthening.
On the whole, our expectations have been borne out, and some areas marginally ahead
of where we expected it to be. Our underwriting strategy has always remained constant.

FINAL

This is to match risk and return as best we can. Up until the end of 2017, this has meant
being stubbornly disciplined and shrink into a core portfolio of risk. We hoped that this
would allow us to be well positioned when the market inevitably started to improve.
As the market started to show the first green shoots of recovery, we decided that the
time is right to cautiously grow, whilst always remembering how far rates had fallen.
Guides have folded. In 2018, we were able to deliver underlying growth of approximately
20% and so far this year, underlying growth is at approximately 15%. This growth is from
rate improvement, our new teams and new business from existing product lines. Our new
teams have contributed just under GBP30 million, in the first half of 2019, noting that the
aviation team write the majority of their premium in Q4.
In the insurance lines, we've seen positive rate movement in energy, aviation, marine and
property D&F with rates gaining momentum through Q2 in the last four of these product
lines. Some of these lines are now seeing double-digit rate increases at the half year,
including marine, onshore energy, property D&F, and certain aspects of the aviation
portfolio.

Bloomberg Transcript

It's always worth noting that our RPIs do not include rate movement on new business and
often the RPIs on our new business are better than we see on our renewing portfolio. In
reinsurance lines, there was a clear bifurcation of ratings in Q2 versus Q1 as loss impacted
territories renewed in Q2 skewing the RPI higher. This is something we expected and
clearly signaled in our previous commentaries.
We have historically been underweight in Florida, but we've always said that as the
underwriting opportunities improve, we will enter this market. The June renewals
provided us with an opportunity to build out a modest new Florida property CAT portfolio
from our Bermuda platform as well as grow and further improve our syndicates portfolio.
Capacity tightening and loss creep created an improved rating environment. So we
decided that now was the time to build some foundations in Florida. I believe this move
encapsulates our underwriting strategy.
We've seen the retro market continue to tighten through the course of the year and
therefore rating levels have continued to improve. Our main platform for retro writing is
Kinesis and we were able to grow Kinesis again at mid-year. We've been able to grow
Kinesis limit deployed by just under 50% in the past 12 months and we are now
approximately 80% larger than this time two years ago.
What is most pleasing, is that in an ILS environment where it's increasingly difficult to grow,
we've been able to do so. This does not of course mean we immune from increasing
investor scrutiny far from it and this is likely to continue. But at least it demonstrates that
our disciplined approach is giving us a platform to benefit from an improving rating
environment. Whilst we're obviously very happy that rates have improved across almost
all of our product lines, we've always said we're coming from a low base. This may have
been seen by some as negative tone. Our view is it is simply realistic, and we think that
the first half of '19 demonstrates this.

FINAL

Our combined ratio of 86.6% is very respectable, particularly given the market has seen a
number of large risk losses in such as aviation, marine and energy, plus loss creep from
the 2018 catastrophe events. None of these are necessarily out of the ordinary, but
certainly put pressure on underwriting margins and demonstrate that whilst rates have
been improving over the past 18 months, they're not yet at a level the allows the market
to easily absorb such losses. However, these losses certainly help the market maintain its
resolve and continue its momentum.
So in summary, we we're really pleased with where we're at from an underwriting
perspective. Rates across most of our portfolio are improving and in most cases, this is
the second year of rate rises. Our new teams have bedded in well and the market
conditions in those lines continue to improve, making our timing look favorable. Market
conditions have allowed us to grow and further optimize our historic lines of business and
build out Kinesis in the appropriate underwriting environment. As market conditions
continue to improve, we'll look to grow in line with that opportunity, whilst always
remember in the relative level of rates.
I'll now pass over to Elaine.

Bloomberg Transcript

Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Thanks, Paul. With strong equity markets plus the reduction in treasury yields and the
narrowing of credit spreads, our investment portfolio has performed well and produced a
return of 3.2% to the half year. Our underwriting results were also good with the
combined ratio of 86.6% and we therefore produced t ROE for the half year of 6.9%.
Comprehensive income for the half year was $68.7 million.
As Alex and Paul have boasted, markets have performed very much in line with our
expectations this year so far. While the 1/1 renewals were broadly flat from a pricing
perspective, our April and Jun renewals saw rate rises, which we benefited from. We also
took the opportunity to add some direct Florida exposure to our books to take advantage
of the improved pricing we saw there. So while we still had dampening effect from multiyear contracts that were not yet due to renew, our premiums are up 9.5% overall, but as
Alex, said with underlying growth more like 15%.
As the third quarter isn't the major renewal period for us, we wouldn't expect much in the
way of new business, but do expect to see more meaningful new business flow at the
aviation renewals in the fourth quarter. Our reinsurance spend to the half year is
significantly up on last year. As we've previously discussed, we renewed most of our
expiring program on reasonable terms, but we also have a combination of additional
cover purchase, timing impacts and reinstatement premiums impact on that number.
Additional cover was largely across the new lines of business we added, across also
growth in the lines where we put quarter share cover in place. The timing impact is in
relation to cancelling and replacing cover in our energy book and the reinstatement
premiums are largely driven by development on JEBI. With the new cover we've added

Page 4 of 18



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2019-07-25

for the new lines of business, our spend for the year should be quite a bit higher than last
year's. Although this quarter, share covers are dependent on the end risk volume.

FINAL

The increase in ceded premium relative to risk book has meant the net earned premium
for the half-year has not increased to the same degree as our top line increase. In
addition much of the new business added is recent and still has to produce earnings, that
effect should normalize somewhat over the course of the year.
On losses, we didn't have much of note reported in relation to the current accident year,
although, we did see a slight increase in the attritional claims being reported. We also had
some late reported energy claims from 2018 accident year coming through and had some
adverse development on the prior accident year sovereign claim, plus a handful of small
claims at Cathedral. Otherwise, we had some general IBNR releases due to a lack of
reported claims in coming through. While we experienced loss creep on JEBI as others
have, it's largely within our reinsurance program and therefore much more of a
reinstatement premium impact.

Bloomberg Transcript

Happily the 2017 and 2018 event, net reserves have been broadly stable. Neither the
uptick of attrition, nor the prior accident year claims trickling through give us any cause for
concern or change the way we think about our reserves or the attritional ratios we've
been you guiding to. It's just the slightly lumpy nature of our book, given the lines of
business we write.
As I mentioned, investment returned 3.2% for the half year with all of our asset classes
having a positive contribution to the return. Most of the return comes from our fixed
maturity portfolio and we have some nice support from our bank loan, hedge fund and
equity exposures. With the fair change in stance we've removed some of our interest rate
risk hedging, although, our risk assets remain a natural hedge to interest rate risk. With
the removal of our interest rate hedge, situation naturally stepped out a little.
We don't intend to increase that any further at this point until the curve normalizes. We do
anticipate rate cuts going forward, but believe that's been largely priced in and we've
already seen the benefit of that in the first half of the year. There is therefore no changes
in our portfolio positioning or strategy.
G&A is largely in line with the same period last year, although we do have the benefit of
lower year-on-year sterling exchange rates this year. That has offset, general salary
increases and the additional costs of our new teams. Our financing costs have increased a
little give an increased debt costs and also our adoption of IFRS 16 on leases. That's
moved some of our lease cost from G&A to financing for the overall net impact was
minimal.
Lastly on capital, we continue to be comfortable with our current level of capital. We'll
more than adequately support the book we hope to write this year. As ever, we'll monitor
underwriting opportunities and adjust our capital accordingly.
With that, I'll now hand over to the operator for questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator

FINAL

(Question And Answer)
Thank you. (Operator Instructions). The first question comes from the line of Kamran
Hossain from RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi, everyone. Just a few questions. And the first is on the I guess on the premium this
quarter. Could you maybe give a split if you have it? I know it's probably not that simple
between kind of renewal business and kind of new business as a kind of indication. The
second question is basically around Q2 standalone, because if I back out what your rate
increases in Q2, standalone, obviously there has been a pretty remarkable acceleration
and I get to something like 11% of rate in Q2. Could you maybe comment on that and
within property and the I guess the rate rises you've seen there, is this mainly D&F from
which I kind of understand is really going through the roof at the moment. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

So Kamran, I'll give you a sort of a general comment about Q2, and then Elaine Whelan
can take the new business thing, and Paul Gregory can talk about D&F. So we have
witnessed a change in sentiment in Q2 versus Q1, and even towards the end of Q2 things
were definitely getting more interesting. So yes, the market has definitely moved on from
Q1. Things just feel a lot better, and we all are seeing noticeable changes in different kinds
of product lines. Obviously, anything that's at Lloyd's or anything where people have
moved out of classes of business is moving more than other classes. But yes, there is a
noticeable change in Q2 and that's how we've grown into the opportunity. So that's why
you're seeing the jump.

A - Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Yes and in terms of the number on the RPI Kamran, you're not a million miles away.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

And in terms of new business versus in renewal business and there are a number of
moving parts within there. There's always multi-year impacts reinstatement premiums,
other bits and pieces. But new business for the half year was probably especially around
about kind of $60 million ish level.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks very much.

The next question comes from the line of Johnny Urwin from UBS, please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Johnny Urwin
Hi guys. Thanks so much. So it's a pretty bullish on the outlook today, which was a nice
change. I just have one question around capital. So Elaine you mentioned that you think
the capital profile good enough to support your underwriting plans for this year, but how
should we think about that in future years, particularly given a small move back into
Florida, I appreciate that much of the specialty growth is lower capital intensity. But I'm just
trying to gauge your thoughts on the next two or three years.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Yes, I guess if you think about the way, that we think about capital it's always matching it to
underwriting stressing it, and then putting buffers on top of that. So we're always making
sure that we've got plenty of capital there to take advantage of opportunities, and that's
exactly what's happened this year, so you're absolutely right, the specialty business takes
way less capital, but we have increased our cap footprint in Florida this year and it hasn't
really meant very much as to a capital perspective. So we still have decent buffers in place
to take advantage of any new business opportunities on the cap side.

Q - Johnny Urwin

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, thank you. And then just one more quick one on the attritionals.
So I know guidance is mid-30 and it's hard for you guys to pin it down, because there's
always some quarterly variances, but just thinking about the rate that you've earned last
year and this year, how should we think about that guidance going forwards?

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Nothing has really changed in terms of how we think about that as yet. We have that said
the new lines of business that we're adding are a bit more traditional in nature and that's
why we increased -- 36%, 37% guidance that we gave you last year. Our accident year
loss ratio looks a little bit higher than that, but if you back out some of the claims that
we've had I would a bit higher than the attritional then it really kind of get right back into
that 36% to 37%.

Q - Johnny Urwin
Brilliant. Thank you very much.

Q - Kevin Ryan

{BIO 1814771 <GO>}

FINAL

Many thanks. I just wanted you to ask a question around the prior year reserve releases.
There seems to be a bit of a market-wide issue with JEBI costing a bit more and also the
California fires and I was just wondering if you could offer any more put a bit more flesh
on the bones of how you're seeing some of your bigger claims pan out -- and whether
what we've seen this half is likely to push on into the second half, and into 2020. Thank
you.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

So I think, as you identified, JEBI is the biggest mover this year. We think the loss creep
from JEBI and Michael, just this year is about $8.5 billion, I suppose, we've been very vocal
in the past about CAT losses, and creep and we've always tried to say reserves at a
conservative level. Obviously, these events are quite difficult to calculate, but I suppose
the JEBI loss creep and other CAT losses creep-in is no real surprise to us, and thankfully
it's not massive issue for us. But it clearly that's one of the factors that probably aid in the
market move forward on rates and levels. So I wouldn't say we're wildly surprised. I think
all the commentary that we have read from others is consistent. We're just not that
surprised really.

Q - Kevin Ryan

{BIO 1814771 <GO>}

Thanks.

The next question comes from the line of Nick Johnson from Numis Securities. Please go
ahead.

Q - Nicholas Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

Hi. good afternoon. Just a question on reinsurance spend. I think particularly on the new
lines of business can you just discuss whether that will reduce at some point and give us
perhaps a feel as to when that might be? Thanks.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

And I think a lot of the new reinsurance that we've been putting in place on the new lines
of business is more of a quota share type cover other than excess of loss type cover. So
in terms of the magnitude of that, it really depends on what the risk book does. We do
have a significant quota share on our aviation deductible book, which we mentioned in the
past. So the more of that business that we write, then proportionately we'll be ceding a
bit more as well. So it really is driven by the opportunity that we see on those new lines of
business. So on both the Lancs and Cathedral sides of the business is more quota share
in place.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Yes. Nick, I think it's very class specific. Obviously as a general principle if the market got
more interesting, we would like to take more risk and one of the ways you can take more
Page 8 of 18



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2019-07-25

FINAL

risk is by less reinsurance. But clearly, as Elaine said I think the change you're seeing really
is more about the underwriters that we've brought to the company and the best way that
we feel to protect those portfolios, but as a general principle as the market hardens, you
can take more risk and one of the ways to do that is by less reinsurance. But we're not
there yet.

Q - Nicholas Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

So on the new books is a case of maybe waiting two or three years and then
reconsidering the sort of reinsurance structure or would you have about anticipate in the
same structure on these new lines in the long term?

A - Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

So it really depends Nick, on each in each class of business and the market conditions at
the time -- is that, as Alex said there are some of the classes that -- market conditions is
really improved and reinsurance market got -- even tighter then we may look to retain
more, but that'll be driven by market conditions and then was something like aviation
deductible that's more suited to the type of reinsurance, we purchased there, again you
can flex how much of that you buy or don't buy so -- sorry -- it's not a very concise answer,
but it really does depend on the line of business and where you are in the market cycle.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And obviously Nick our kind of play really is to try and make margin out of difficult volatile
classes of business, and when we're buying reinsurance, we are trying to take out some
of the volatility. And our share prices will clearly pick up losses.

Q - Nicholas Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. And can I just kind of as just a quick other question -- more of a formality
really, but you've had significant reinsurance recoverables I think from the JEBI loss in the
first half -- if you just give us a feel for how much limit remains on those -- those
reinsurance sections.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Yes. We -- Yes -- we got no concerns on that, on that, Nick. Obviously, they relate to 2018
and that was the only material loss and we've got no concerns about reinsurance cover on
the JEBI loss in particular.

Q - Nicholas Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thank you very much indeed.

Q - Oliver Troop

{BIO 20944194 <GO>}

Hi, Yeah. Good afternoon, everyone, a couple of questions. Firstly, you're wanting 1/250
year peak zone exposures, and -- I noticed a they ticked up quite a bit over the first half.
Can you just explain what's going on there? And also just whether that's going to have
much of an impact on your required capital? And the second question, I wonder if you
could just give a brief update. Obviously hiring new teams as a big driver of your -- of your
growth last year, maybe you can give an update on how you're getting on with your
discussions with potentially hiring more new teams? Are you having many productive
discussions? What's the outlook there? Thanks.

A - Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Okay. I'll take the new teams and also the first part of the question around PMLs. So on
the 1/250 PMLs. As we said we have we've been writing some more business and we've
been writing some more business in certain CAT territories like Japan and Florida where
the rating environment has improved and obviously when we write more risk, our PML
levels can increase. We've written that from our Bermuda platform primarily and our
Bermuda appetite for CAT risk tends to sit at the high level of programs, which is why you
see that coming through this 1/250 number. In terms of capital, I'll let Elaine talk about that.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Sure. And so we've got individual P&L tolerances, which is what you're seeing moving and
then we've got plenty of headroom within those. They're not really our capital driver by
themselves. We look at the rating agency models to drive our capital and there's different
measures of exposure within those models and diversification benefits et cetera. So it's
really those that are driving the requirements and not the individual PMLs.

A - Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Okay. And on and on and on the new teams. We constantly talking to people. And people
are constantly coming to our door with business plans. As we've said in the past, we're
actually more positive about the market now as you can probably tell and therefore it
make some of these conversations easier, but fundamentally we look at things as we've
always looked at them and if we think a person or a team, can add to our underwriting
profit over time and the market conditions allow that then obviously we'll do what we can
to bring those teams in and there are numerous conversations going on at the moment.
We're always having numerous conversations and in 2018, as you know we were able to
land three new teams and if we can find another team, that we think can add to our
underwriting underline profitability then we'll do it.

Bloomberg Transcript

Alright Andreas, Paul will give you the details, but in the very early days at Lancashire, we - which is what we still do, we just look to deploy capital where we can get the biggest
returns. So in the early days of Lancashire, that was Gulf of Mexico energy CAT. So we
deployed most of our capital down and we didn't really want much to do with Florida,
which I think was a mistake now. And Florida is the biggest CAT market in the world and I
think we had one Florida specific contract, which just didn't seem right to us. So I think with
rates going up in Florida, we just saw it as an opportunity to build a position.
We should have a position in Florida. What I would definitely say to you is that, when we
come up with that plan to, to have our Florida exposure we I suppose you have three
different views of depending on where rates went and the portfolio that we've built
currently I would describe as incredibly modest. But although rates are up in Florida, and
that's great, we don't think it's a hard market and we don't think that's brilliant. But if
Florida was went through to the next pricing level clearly we would be very keen to
expand heavily into Florida, because it's the biggest CAT market in the world and we
should have a position there. So I think what we've done this year makes sense and there
is an opportunity, but it's not a hard market.

A - Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Hi Andreas, just to answer your number around, how much premium growth did we see in
Florida, which I think was the initial part of your question. Approximately looking at what
we did from Lancashire Bermuda and then some growth we were also able to have that
the syndicate approximately it was $10 million, the majority of that did come from the
growth from the Bermuda platform.

Hi, everyone. Two questions from me. Firstly, just a point of clarification on the reinsurance
spend on the new teams, I think when we've previously spoken, you've talked about that
quota share being in place, mainly while you sort of test and learn and grow those teams
out. Obviously with the sort of rate environment improving all else being equal, should we
be expecting that reinsurance spend to full? And then the second question is mainly on
Kinesis. Obviously you've had some good growth there, I'm just trying to understand what
stops you looking to grow the funds in that business more, especially given the sort of
large fund raises as, we've seen from some competitors in the market, and if you think
those fundraisers might have an impact on the market going forward. Thanks.

A - Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

On Kinesis, as you know, we have, we have put on some decent levels of growth not only
this year, just under 50% in terms of limits deployed, but also by versus two years ago
where we are now 80% up. I do appreciate that's not at the level of some competitors,
but then there are a number of other funds in that world that are not growing at all. The
argument was there were a number of opportunities at mid-year that made sense for us
to underwrite and we did. There were a number of other opportunities that didn't hit the
return hurdles that we required that our investors in Kinesis required. So all we're doing
with Kinesis is doing what we've always done, which is if there's opportunities out there
that makes sense and can hit our required return hurdles, then we'll write as much of it as
we can, but we're also prepared to walk away from business. And whilst the retro market
is improving and has continued to improve through this year, it still wouldn't be what I'd
call, a really hard retro market, it's just a hardening retro market.

On the reinsurance side of things and I think as Paul said, it's always going to be subject to
market conditions. We do have our quota share in most of those new lines of business like
variations deductible, we have a significant quota share there and that's likely to remain
there for the foreseeable.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Yes. I wouldn't say we're buying quota share on these new lines as we -- learn the class,
because we just -- we wouldn't be in a class if we wasn't confident, we couldn't make
money, I think the different way to look at is some of the new classes, we've gone into a
aviation deductible is the best example. The guys that we brought in had some quota
share relationships at that they've brought to the business. So that's the way they have
constructed their portfolios in the company. I used to be in and that's sort of brought that
to Lancs or Cathedral, so it's definitely not a -- we're not buying quota shares too before
we get comfortable with the class, it's just those underwriters have protected our books
in a certain way and we bought those reinsurance relationships to the Group.

go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Joanna Parsons

Thanks very much. Two questions from me. Firstly, in terms of the claims activity, you've
seen and you've talked about the fact that your attritional loss ratio will probably creep up,
because of the new books of business. Just wondering what's going on with the existing
book, and whether you've seen any -- whether losses are one-off or whether there are
any trends developing there? And my second question is on the multi-line -- sorry multiyear policies that you've been writing, given the way that the rating environment is
moving, are you still writing multi-year policies or are you now looking to just let those run
off and write single-year policies, because of the a better rating outlook.

A - Elaine Whelan

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 1558226 <GO>}

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Hi, Joanna. We do have more attrition in lines of businesses that we brought into the
business. The existing lines of business not really any change there, it's more that the new
lines that had brought up that and estimate that we've given you to work with. There are
always one off exceptions. I know it sounds a bit ridiculous, but it's true. And so, one of
you might have a quarter or two where there is a tick-up in attrition. But it doesn't really
change the overall view of the book and in those existing lines of business. And on the
multi-year policies and some of our lines of business are just -- they're just more typically
prone to multi-year policies. So if you look at things like political risk terror some of the
energy lines of business, you just get policies in there that are multi-year or non-annual.
And some of the other lines of business there is a relationship angle to it as well -- where
we might write some multiyear cover for client and some annual coverage for them, and it
depends on what clients are looking for. And there's a hedge both ways in terms of
where pricing is going.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

But obviously, Joanna, if we sit here and we think rates are going up. We clearly don't
want to tie our book up in multi-year contracts. But said, I think you've got certain classes
business that all multi-year that's the way the business is done and but clients, we got
CAT clients that hedge part of their programs and we will continue to do that for them.
But, yes we're not going to lock in at today's prices. If we think prices are going up and
that's the way we've always viewed it.

Hi, Good afternoon. I've got one question on the breadth of rate increases. I'm just
wondering whether we can now confidently say that we see rate increases outside of the
loss affected lines and perhaps you could actually highlight some of the lagging lines
where we're not seeing the improvement on that -- across the book? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Yes, okay. So the only area really that we're not seen rate improvement is on the
terrorism portfolio. There still remains ample capacity in that market, it's not anywhere
near Lloyds decile 10 class and as a result people are still reasonably bullish in that market
and there's no lack of capacity. That only means one thing for rates. They are all
reasonably stable you're only talking a point or two off. But in every other line we are
seeing some degree of momentum. It does differentiate between lines. And I think those
lines seeing the better rate increases are certainly those lines of loss activity, certainly
those lines that have been within the Lloyds decline 10 approach. And also those lines that
have seen some of the larger players reduce or pull out. Does that answer your question?

Q - Ivan Bokhmat

{BIO 15378004 <GO>}

Yes, I suppose so. I'm sorry, on the large players pulling out. I think so far then there had
been one big start-up set up the over summer. I mean what's your outlook, do you expect
more, more capital being drawn in by those rather bullish commentaries that you and
many of your peers have made?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Yes, I mean look. Clearly if they didn't start up, that would be better. But in fairness I think
the people running that business are sensible people, I don't think they think anything
crazy and clearly they're setting the business up today, because I think the underwriting
opportunity is going to improve. So I don't see that as a massive issue and I think in
general there is enough pain in the system now, where -- I think the market moves on
from here. So I don't think we go backwards from here, even with Convex starting I don't
know it's a massive issue for the market and as Paul said, we have seen very large carriers
pulling back and that's creating opportunities.
And I think this is all -- this is just a realism of where we are. You've had two difficult years.
You can look at multiple classes of business, where you like aviation is a good example or
very recently satellite you have one loss and that one loss takes the whole class's is
premium for the year. That just shows you how much right the market has given up during
the soft market. So yes, we're positive, yes rates going up, but before this industry gets
back to anything, that's sustainable, we think rates need to move on quite a lot from here
and I think this is the start of that process. And again we've said many times we think our
industry is cyclical. And for me this is kind of we're all going back to basics part of the cycle
and everyone's going back to actually underwriting which is something that we've been
talking about for a long time. And we'll go through that part of the cycle and then we'll be
giving reductions in three years' time or whenever that is and that's what happens.

(Operator Instructions). The next question comes from the line of John Urwin from UBS.
Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Johnny Urwin
Thanks. Just two quick follow-ups, please. So firstly, I guess the terminal pricing is positive,
it has been across 2Q reporting. But is we've also got to know that Renre just raised $700
million third-party capital -- so. I guess what's the risk that the retro market just becomes a
bit easier again and that limits the momentum? And then just a quick clarification -- so 15%
underlying growth in 1H that's premium right not volumes 7% rate increases roughly an 8%
volume growth. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

So look, I think. Yes, clearly our market is driven by supply and amount of capital. So I think
if huge amounts of capital are raised in the retro market that is clearly going to add more
supply and that's going to affect on rates and I that's just what happens. I think for us the
opportunities -- If you look at the weight of opportunity, we've got it's more specialty at
the moment. So I suppose at the moment we are more interested in the specialty market
very much as Paul said, the way we look at retro. And clearly we're Renre, but when retro
got tight for the sort of June 1 renewals, we thought that market improved. And I'll give
you a real life example. You know the cheapest you could buy top end retro was six
online, probably at June 1, it went to 8 online and our view of something close to a hard
market for those type of layers would be 10 online. So I think for us, we see most of our
opportunity in what we describe as specialty at the moment and you have to remember
specialty is a very different business to CAT business.
So you just don't have third-party capital providers turning up in the energy market
tomorrow. It just doesn't happen. So I think that's why we're quite confident that specialty
continues. The CAT market what will be driven about by what happens in the wind season,
I think and even absent a windstorm I think with JEBI loss creep some of those third-party
capital providers, even if the wind doesn't blow this year. I don't think they're going to
settle down there and say, this is the time to double down in our industry. So I'm the less
worried about that. Clearly, there's always the fear factor that can happen I'm just not that
worried about it.

{BIO 20944194 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi. Yes, just a quick follow-up. I wondered if you could just give a brief update on the
energy market. The 4% price increase was maybe just the one area, which was maybe a
bit less than I was expecting. So maybe if you give a brief update and kind of no break it
down between onshore, offshore, upstream, downstream that kind of thing. Thanks a lot.

A - Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Yes, sure. So that the upstream, downstream market are in quite different places at the
moment. And obviously traditionally well and now the bought the bulk of our energy book
is upstream. Now the upstream market has performed reasonably well over the last
couple of years. So it hasn't been in Lloyds decile 10, you haven't really seen people pull
out of the class, and therefore the rate rises that we've been seeing on the upstream
energy book are broadly in line with last year, which was around 3%. It's positive, but it's
still moving in the right direction, but as with all things unless there was a retraction of
supply or a massive increase in demand, it's not going to motor ahead.
Completely different in the downstream energy market. People have pulled out. There
were some big players reducing lines. There have been a lot of losses over the last few
years and you are now seeing pretty standard claim business renewing at double-digit
rate increases. But because the blend of our portfolio is more upstream currently, that
downstream RPI is obviously dragged down in the blend we've got is the 104.

The next question comes from the line of Ben Cohen from Investec Bank. Please go
ahead.

Q - Ben Cohen

{BIO 1541726 <GO>}

Hi, I had some two questions, please. The first was just, just sort of in the sort of market
environment that we're in, if this continues, is there any reason structurally given, I guess
what's changed over the last few years, why you couldn't get back to historic peak levels
of premium for the business adjusted for our focus Cathedral? And the second question
was just trying to think about the size of a potential special dividend -- to the extent that
growth is matching sort of price increases, should we assume that effectively you would
still be able to return all of all of the profits that you, that you earn? And I guess that also
talks to the earlier point about diversification in terms of what you're, what you're seeing
how much, how much diversification are, are you getting in the growth that you're, that
you're achieving at the moment. Thank you.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

On revenue clearly if the market moves, we'll writer more revenue as we've
demonstrated. So that's, that's just a function of where the market goes and how far
Page 16 of 18



FINAL

Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2019-07-25

does the hardening go. So I think on the revenue front, yes, I mean clearly I think I think our
peak we were just under GBP1 billion, I think. I think we can replicate it, but if the market
gets there -- we're only going to get there if the market gets there. We're not really
worried about that. If something crazy happened and the market really hardened, and
then we'd look to get as big as possible, if it made sense. That's always been the play it
Lancs, it has always been -- we underwrite the opportunity and if the opportunity is not
there, we can give the capital back and if opportunity is there, well we'll try and deploy
more and that's the way we think about things.

Q - Ben Cohen

{BIO 1541726 <GO>}

And sorry on the interplay between sort of price and underlying volume growth and how
much capital you need to retain to grow?

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

So, again if it's specialty that's a difference of capital, requirement to CAT, and in general
CAT -- if we start to in a write -- retro is the best example. If we started to write a lot of
retro, that eats up capital quite quickly -- if you write loss to terrorism that doesn't. So it
just depends where the opportunity is. And because we're quite small we're quite nimble,
and we can get to our capital requirements is quite easy. But we can generally assess not
quite real time, but pretty quickly, what we need to, to run our business and then Elaine
talked about told how much money we've got to either spend will give back to
shareholders.
