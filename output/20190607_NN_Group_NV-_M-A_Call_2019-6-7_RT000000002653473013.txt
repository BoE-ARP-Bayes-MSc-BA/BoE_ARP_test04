Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Before handing this conference call over to Mr.Lard
Friese, CEO of NN Group, let me ﬁrst give the following statement on behalf of the
company. Today's comments may include forward-looking statements, such as statements
regarding future developments in NN Group's business, expectations for its future
ﬁnancial performance and statements not involving historical facts. Actual results may
diﬀer materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.
Any forward-looking statements speak only as to date they are made. And NN Group
assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information or for any other reason. Furthermore nothing in
today's comments constitute an oﬀer to sell or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy any
securities. Good afternoon, Mr.Friese, over to you.

Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Lize. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for dialing in on this call.
My name is Lard Friese, I'm CEO of NN Group and I'm joined by Delﬁn Rueda, our Chief
Financial Oﬃcer; as well as Jan-Hendrik Erasmus, our Chief Risk Oﬃcer.
We issued a press release this morning announcing that NN Group and Athora have
reached an agreement with on buying on the acquisition of the activities of VIVAT Under
this agreement, Athora will initially acquire 100% of shares of VIVAT, after which NN Group

FINAL

will acquire the VIVAT Non-life business from Athora for a consideration of EUR 416
million. In addition, we will acquire the inter-company loans that the VIVAT Holding
Company granted to VIVAT Non-life for EUR 150 million. On the following slides, I will
outline why we believe that this is a compelling opportunity for NN Group, our
shareholders and other stakeholders. So let's turn to Slide .
2. We believe that scale and diversiﬁcation are essential to be able to deliver an attractive
and sustainable customer proposition in the long term. Therefore, combining the VIVAT
Non-life activities with a Non-life business of NN Group is a logical step, both from a
strategic perspective and from a ﬁnancial perspective. Strategically, this transaction
further strengthens our position in the Non-life market in the Netherlands, adding almost
5% market share, mainly in the Property and Casualty segment.

Bloomberg Transcript

This additional scale will enhance our risk selection and underwriting capabilities.
Financially the acquisition will lead to both expense and capital synergies resulting in an
increase in free cash ﬂow cash of approximately EUR 50 million by 2022. We will ﬁnance
the acquisition using existing cash resources, while maintaining a strong balance sheet.
Please also note that this transaction does not aﬀect the share buyback program, which
will continue as planned.
We have a proven track record of successfully integrating companies and extracting the
synergy beneﬁts. Given that this is a new market transaction, with a business that we know
and understand, we're conﬁdent that we can and will execute successfully. Acquisition of
the VIVAT Non-life business by NN Group is subject to closing of the acquisition of VIVAT
by Athora. In addition the acquisition of the VIVAT Non-life business from Athora is
subject to the customary oﬀer conditions, which include antitrust and thus Central Bank
approvals.
We expect to close the transaction in the ﬁrst quarter of 2020. At closing, we will enter
into a service agreement with Athora to ensure a smooth transition during the migration
period of 2 years. Let's turn to Slide .3.
The combination of VIVAT and NN Non-life activities will create a leading player in the
Deutsche non-life market, adding scale mainly in the Motor and Fire portfolios, as well as
in disability in accident. As I've already said, this additional scale will allow us to further
improve underwriting and realize cost eﬃciencies. Furthermore, the combined company
will be in a stronger position to invest in digital capabilities and innovation and to oﬀer
attractive products to our customers. In terms of distribution, we're adding another
channel for the bank insurance agreement with the Volksbank, and we can also leverage
on the digital and direct capabilities of VIVAT With that, I will hand you over to Delﬁn
Rueda.
Delﬁn, over to you.

FINAL

Thank you, Lard, and good afternoon, everyone. The ﬁnancial highlights of the
transactions are shown on the Slide 4. Our capital position remains strong after the
transaction.
The pro-forma impact on our Solvency II ratio is around 6 percentage points. Let me walk
you through the various element in the Solvency II movement. Firstly the transaction price
for the Non-life business of EUR 416 million is deducted from Own Funds. When we
include the Own Funds and SCR as reported by VIVAT Non-life at the end of 2018.
Thirdly, the capital synergies reﬂect the expected diversiﬁcation beneﬁt in the SCR Over
time, we foresee some further capital synergies following the expected legal merger and
application of the NN Group partial internal model. Lastly, we will have some assumptions
alignments, mainly relating to P&C reserving. As Lard already mentioned, the additional
scale is expected to lead to pre-tax cost synergies of around EUR 40 million per annum by
2022, driven for example by removing overlap in the complimentary portfolios, IT and
oversight functions. We expect the incremental free cash ﬂow to grow to EUR 50 million
per annum by 2022.

Bloomberg Transcript

We also anticipate that the IFRS operating result will be roughly in line with the free cash
ﬂow over time. There could be a temporary negative operating result contribution in
2020, reﬂecting the impact of various day-one alignments, as well as some portfolio
churns and pruning. Following this, we expect proﬁts to grow driven by the realization of
cost synergies, operational improvements such as insurance and claim ratio of the
optimization and the impact of shifting to higher yielding assets. The return on investment
of this acquisition is expected to exceed our cost of capital.
This is consistent with our equity story of deploying capital in value creating opportunities.
Please note, that we have also agreed to acquire the Tier 2 loans that the VIVAT Holding
Company granted to VIVAT Non-life or an amount of EUR 150 million. The coupons of
these loans will provide an additional cash ﬂow of around EUR 10 million per annum. I will
now, pass you back to Lard for the warp up.

Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Delﬁn. Let's go to Slide .5.
We believe that this transaction is both strategically and ﬁnancially compelling. The
creation of a larger, stronger, more eﬃcient in dynamic business will be beneﬁcial for our
customers. We will be better placed to oﬀer attractive and relevant customer propositions
and further enhance our customer experience. The transaction is expected to deliver a
double-digit return on investment and after the acquisition the balance sheet remains
strong.
We can and will successfully execute on this transaction and deliver the beneﬁts. We've
shown that we can integrate a business and extract synergies, and therefore we are
conﬁdent in our ability to do the same with this one. This transaction reinforces our

ambition to be a company that matters to all our stakeholders. And I would now like to
open the call for your questions so.
Liz, over to you. (Question And Answer)

FINAL

Operator
Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we will start the question-and-answer
session now. (Operator Instructions) The ﬁrst question is from Mr.Ashik Musaddi, JP
Morgan.
Your line is open. Please go ahead, sir.

Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

This is Ashik here. I just have a couple of questions.
First of all, after this P&C deal. Can you just give us some clarity as to what is your M&A
appetite for the Dutch business? I mean are you still okay to do asset management deals,
Life deals and P&Cs? Any thoughts on that given that you're now pretty big in Life for the
pretty big Non-life? Second question is, can you just give us some clarity as to what
happens on the dividend and buyback for coming years? I mean is this deal accretive to
the dividend from coming years, which is like 2020-21. So when shall we see that
accretion? And how should we think about buyback for in coming years from this one?
Because you have, like, used up around $600 million cash? And the last one is, is there a
possibility as to what assumptions you are using with respect to combined ratio for this
acquisition? Thank you.

Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes, thank you Ashik.
So I will do the ﬁrst one and then -- can you Delﬁn take the other two questions. So the
ﬁrst one, to be honest the Ashik, we've just announced this transaction this morning, we
work today to work with media and investors to communicate this. And the next step that
we're going to do. After today is to work on the closing and that's going to be a focus for
this and we hope to close as we said in the press release, in the ﬁrst quarter of next year.
We have a thriving platform in the Netherlands, as you rightly point out, in both after the
Delta Lloyd acquisition and when this transaction is closed, we have indeed market
leading positions in many areas. So we're very pleased with that. And I'd like to leave it
with that. Then when it comes to the other two questions, Delﬁn?

Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes.

FINAL

Thanks Lard. And Ashik, thanks for your two questions. The way I see this acquisition is not
more not less than another proof of our application of our capital management policy and
our strategy, the same way that we have stated it over time. This is a transaction that
provides a good return on our surplus capital with a return of double-digits, and as a
consequence the capital policy including our dividend policy, we stay unchanged.
We will evaluate when we have surplus capital and how we will deploy that through the
ordinary dividend but also with share buybacks, if the case were to be that -- that
important to say that based on our ﬁnancial ﬂexibility today, we can do the acquisition,
funding it from our own cash at holding. And the current share buyback is stay intact. So
we plan to execute as planned with 500 million share buyback expected to be completed
by the end of February. And if anything -- of course, we do especially with the increase of
the free cash ﬂows that we have estimated at around $50 million per annum, that with
increase of course the available free cash ﬂow generation and with that the dividend
going forward.
In terms of the combined ratio, as you can imagine with signiﬁcant cost savings, the main
beneﬁt on the combined ratio will be the reduction of the cost ratio. But, also we have
prudently -- but gradually included some improvements on the underwriting as well.

Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

That's very clear. Thanks a lot.

The next question is from Mr.Matthias de Wit, Kempen. Your line is open. Please go
ahead, sir.

Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Yes.
Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. Can you just to come back on the
cost synergies. Can you provide maybe a bit more color maybe on the breakdown
between underwriting and cost on the one hand? Also maybe on the phasing of the cost
synergy, is there anything you can say on that? And then secondly on disability, there has
been a regulatory change, which will -- which means that it will become mandatory to take
out disability insurance to self-employed. Just wonder, if you consider that major positive
or whether that could drive growth going forward of the business? And then lastly, is
there anything you can say on how proﬁtable VIVAT Non-life business is today? Yes, in last
year there was a result release, there was also the storm impact, it's diﬃcult to see how
proﬁtable it is at this point in time.
Thank you.

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. Thank you, Matthias for your questions. I will do the ﬁrst two and then hand over to
Delﬁn for the third question.
So on the cost synergies, the synergies that we see in this business are synergies around
that technology. So migration for portfolio to target systems. Obviously, removal of
overlaps in portfolios and in some roles that have overlaps, so those are some areas,
there's multiple areas where we see the ability after we've done obviously good due
diligence for protocol synergy. On the other point about the self-employed and what
you're referring to is a headline agreement that has been struck in the Netherlands on the
overall pension system in Netherlands.
And is part and parcel of that, the position of the self-employed at whether or not they
should have a mandatory with an opt-out disability insurance and taking -- that area is an
area, which still needs it's headline, that is headline agreement is still by the way an
agreement that needs to devoted upon by the members of trade unions. And the second
thing is, that it's a headline agreement. So there's a lot of details missing at this point, and
there is very diﬃcult to gauge what that particular element would mean at this point. So,
then we go to the third question, Delﬁn.

Bloomberg Transcript

Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, Matthias. Well there is some public available information of VIVAT Non-life. I think for
the 2018 annual report as you see a net proﬁt of EUR 9 million. I think it's fair to say that
the overall proﬁtability is limited at this point of time and that there is room for further
improvement of the underwriting result.
The way we have of course assumed, how this evolve in order to assess a valuation and
assess the impact on NN Group going forward, is that we expect in the short-term
probably the ﬁrst year after acquisition still some negative impact on the operating
results, due not only for proven assumption in terms of the underwriting, but also in terms
of potentially some resurfaced strengthening. Looking at also the fact that under IFRS is
day one balance sheet, you need to recognize the net present value of future proﬁts of
the Disability and Accident business. And that's going to have some reduction on the
proﬁtability of the company. So overall, we expect some prudent improvement of the
underwriting going forward and very signiﬁcant cost savings.
The reduction on the cost of insurance as well and some other small things, which will
drive these improved proﬁtability on the range of the EUR 50 million as from 2022
onwards.

Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

The next question is from Mr.Bart Jooris, Degroof Petercam. Your line is open. Please go
ahead, sir.

FINAL

Bart Jooris

{BIO 3470300 <GO>}

Yes.
Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I have basically three. Could you give
us an idea of an estimate of the integration costs you foresee? Then on the other hand
you can talk about cost synergies, but you also have new distribution channels, that you
see revenue synergies there and you have an idea how high these would be? And then
lastly given the limited proﬁtability of the business at VIVAT, was there an improvement
program foreseen already? And which guarantees do you have that will be continued in
the year that's -- let's say a little bit more than half a year, that's still going on before the
closure of the deal?

Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes.
Thank you, Bart. The estimation of the integration costs and for question number three
about the proﬁtability, I'm going to ask Delﬁn to take care of that. Let me comment on the
distribution channels. So, on the distribution channels that VIVAT Non-life is using, is
mandated brokers, intermediaries.
So let's say independent broker, direct and of course the distribution agreement with
Volksbank. So the bank which should be contain [ph]. And these channels are channels
that we -- that of course NN Group also operates, but the Volksbank is obviously a new
channel as we currently work with -- on the banking side with ING and with ABN AMRO
So, we expect some revenue synergies, we expect to improve the abilities, drive
proﬁtability in the market by becoming larger, because we -- in this transaction we take
out of course a competitor. And as a result, our strength in the distribution channels is
also increasing in terms of our position that we have with our distributors.
There is -- on the revenue side also reinsurance optimization that Delﬁn already
mentioned earlier. And we also need to be realistic, that could also be some partly oﬀset
by some cheering of existing customers. So if you -- those are kind of the comments that
we can give on the revenue synergies as we thought about that. So with that, I would like
to hand over to the Delﬁn for your other two questions.

Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Which were the integrating cost. So Bart, I think it is early to be very precise about that. I
think the restructuring cost we expect to be consistent with our own experience and with
precedent transaction of similar size, this is of course in market transaction and there will
Page 7 of 16



Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity
Date: 2019-06-07

be some restructuring cost as it has happened also in previous transactions like Delta
Lloyd. In terms of the -- if the company has an improvement, if NN has had a -- has an
improvement program, I think that when you look at how the proﬁtability of the company
has evolved over the last years, there has been a very mark improvement of proﬁtability.

FINAL

And I think that they have done a very good job on the position they have started with.
And I do expect -- we do expect that it will continue over 2019 and going forward.

Bart Jooris

{BIO 3470300 <GO>}

Did you get any guarantees on that or vote of conﬁdence?

Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Maybe, I can add -- maybe I can add Bart that we have a target of 97% or below for our
combined ratio. And if I look -- as Delﬁn was saying actually, if I look at the improvement
that we're seeing in the last ﬁve quarters.

Bloomberg Transcript

We've seen absent of the large storm, right, that we had in the ﬁrst quarter last year. And I
know that this is part and parcel of our business, but if you want to track whether your
measures are taken eﬀect, you need to take that little bit out of the way to see the
underlying improvement. We're now seeing ﬁve quarters in the row of combined ratios
below 100% and also with an improvement track there. So you've launched that program
in the Capital Markets Day of 2017.
We at that time said that we needed 24 months for measures to emerge. We are gradually
seeing that this emerge -- so the recipe that we're basically applying for our own business,
is something that Delﬁn rightly said, is something that we also aim to apply to the the
acquisition once we close it. And this has to do with expense reductions, this has to do
with improvements on let's say re-pricing risk, also on a case-by-case basis on and
especially as some new risks. Looking at have we really got the right underwriting
conditions in place.
And there are also sometimes co-products, if we believe that certain risks, that cannot be
managed through the life cycle in a proﬁtable manner. And though that recipe will also be
applied to that business to ensure that we also bring that business to a better place in
terms of proﬁtability.

Bart Jooris

{BIO 3470300 <GO>}

Yes. I appreciate that.
But my question was more about what was going on at VIVAT during the time that still will
pass before let's say the end of the year that when you closed the deal. Because looking
at results of 2018, there could be still some improvement be made over 2019. We have
any agreement with them that they will not just, let's say stay as is for the coming time?

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, Bart. As I said before, we have seen that system management has improved the
proﬁtability of the business, as you know, gradually.
And that they are as you know doing the right thing. So, we do expect that for the rest of
the year 2019 or until the date at the transaction is completed. That they will continue with
the resisting initiatives and perform on that way. If your question is it from a legal point of
view, contractually point of view, we have a particular agreement of how this is going to
evolve.
The answer is no.

Bart Jooris

{BIO 3470300 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

The next question is from Mr.Farquhar Murray, Autonomous.
Your line is open. Please go ahead, sir.

Bloomberg Transcript

Farquhar Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Good morning, gentlemen. Just three questions, if I may.
First, just in terms of the cost base that's coming across with regards to the EUR 40 million
of synergies that you're achieving. I just wanted to frame that EUR 40 million. I just
wondered if you could give us the cost base against which that's happening. Obviously
we've got some of the non-life entity.
I just wanted know anything else in there? And then secondly, on the additional capital
synergies that will come after the immediate closing. I just wondered if you could provide
any kind of time frame around that perhaps some details as to where those are expected
eventually come from? And then ﬁnally, just a little bit of follow-up on that question
around kind of control over the business. Can I assume that management control of the
Non-life business will occur in 1Q '20? And could I just get a little bit of detail around what
the service agreement relates to in terms of which elements the business come under that
part. If that's possible? Thanks.

Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes. Farquhar, thanks for your questions. The ﬁrst two one -- I'm going to ask Delﬁn to
taking the ﬁrst question, I will take myself.

Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes.
The cost base for the Non-life always had -- VIVAT has had -- is administrative expenses of
EUR 115 million, that was the administrative expenses basis as of the end of 2018. So, you
could use that as a reference for the synergies that we expected to achieve the EUR 40
million. So, is approximately 35% of that amount. In terms of capital synergies, the
majority of the capital synergies are obtained already at the day one due to the
diversiﬁcation.
Mainly the diversiﬁcation beneﬁts that happened at group level, as the Non-life business
diversiﬁed very well, away from our majority life exposure that we have at the group. The
additional beneﬁts that will come following the legal merger and a way we use the partial
internal model of NN into the activities of VIVAT, this will be more limited and it will
happen once we agree with DMV our regulator, and I will do that in due course. But the
majority of the capital synergies are already reﬂected as of day one and presented in the
Slide 4 that we have showed before.

Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes.
And on your third question Farquhar. Control over the business at the time of closing, so
when we closed the transaction. We aim to do that in the ﬁrst quarter of 2020, but
obviously we are -- depending on the timing of which regulatory approvals come in. Then
when it comes to the service agreement, we are entering indeed with Athora that time on
the service agreement and the reason for that is that VIVAT Group is a group, which has a
holding -- services are provided by the holding for let's say the asset management and
Life company in the one hand and then the Non-life business on the other hand.
What we then need to do, is we of course then after closing when we take control, we go
over the business, we and Athora need to work together to ensure that continuity of
services can be provided as we are disentangling that business and making sure that we
can take out the non-life fees and subsequently integrate that non-life fees into NN
Group. There is a time period that we need for that and in that period we need services
and those services obviously are all -- have all been agreed with Athora at that particular
point in time to take eﬀect in this, and that's what this service agreement entails.

Farquhar Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Okay. Just a follow up on that.
And you're going to use the full 2 years for the asset management kind of transfer then?
Because it seems quite a long phase that other one?

FINAL

No. Let me say, we don't -- the asset management and life remains with Athora. So,
there's nothing that we -- we have no -- let's say this is -- this pertains solely to the Non-life
company, that this transaction for us is in scope. What is not in scope, not in scope is life
and asset management, asset management also grows with the product.

The regulatory approval attached, it is given that the proﬁle of the VIVAT ﬁle, I guess the
regulator has already been looking at what's going on. So can you maybe comment a
little bit into what extent this has been blueprinted already? And maybe you can share the
level of comfort you have on antitrust matters with regards to AFM Thank you.

Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes.
So ﬁrst some of the -- Robin, good afternoon. Let me take these questions. Obviously, we
maintain a good relation and professional relations with our regulator on an ongoing
basis. And obviously, but we need to apply for declaration of no objections, et cetera.
And that's a process, which takes time, it's something that we have experienced and as
you know, and we just need to work with the regulator through this. And I cannot
speculate any particular outcome of the timing of that, but we expect to close the
transaction in the ﬁrst quarter 2020. When it comes to the antitrust question you had. We
foresee no issues on antitrust.

Robin van den Broek

Please go ahead, sir.

Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. Hi two quick questions. The one is in the Netherlands now you have loan position
basically non-life.
Would you expect to be able to achieve, that means you're still in a fragmented market.
But now you will be by far having a leading market, -- market share. So if you could give
us any idea and highlight how you can leverage this position and by when? That would be
great. The second thing is for the combined ratio, I mean as you said it on you're trending
very well.
Now of course maybe some or at least I had expectations that maybe something, your
target could be reviewed earlier. Now with the transaction is probably too much to ask,
but do you ﬁnd that we will have for example once you close the transaction, review and
again renewal of targets or maybe not. So basically something that could come in the
second quarter of 2020. Is that a reasonable expectation? And the last quick one is, when
I look just at the presentation, you had the 2% market share loss in a certain way looking
at the Delta Lloyd presentation on the presentation today on how you present your
market share.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now of course there are some businesses that you are happy to let go, some overlap of
the clients. Is it something you could quantify on this transaction?

Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Jason, thank you very much. You're breaking up a little bit in the last question. So can you
please repeat that please the third one?

Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

Yes.
In the last, if I look at presentation you had for Delta Lloyd, you were showing a market
share of I think 23% -- 24%. Now you say your market share is 21%. So that is
understandable because maybe you had an overlap with some Delta Lloyd clients,
probably there are some business that you -- you shared as part of the merger. So
basically there is some attrition.
So I was wondering if it's something that you would -- if you could give any comments on
what you would expect with the transaction today with VIVAT?

FINAL

Yes. I understand your question now Jason. Thank you very much. So let's ﬁrst -- let's take
them all three.
The ﬁrst one. Yes, we've said that this transaction has 5%, roughly to the current market
share that we have and indeed to become a market leader in Non-life. And obviously with
that, we have a large position in the Netherlands the market leader -- leadership position.
And we aim to use that additional scale to help drive proﬁtability and drive synergies out
of the platform that we have, which is a thriving platform.
Certainly after this acquisition. We have targets that we have set ourselves, 97% combined
ratio or below. And if you take a step back that those targets are in place already as you
rightly point out. And let's take a step back we expect, but we actually aim to achieve.

Bloomberg Transcript

What we aim to achieve, is that we aim to build a structurally sound, well run, proﬁtable
large Non-life company. And we aim to do that by using our scale to drive eﬃciencies and
improve the expense ratio. Number two, use this scale with all the data analytics and
underwriting inputs that we get to improve the underwriting capability that we have. We
also want to use that scale to attract people, to move to new technology, which allows us
to far quickly than in the past far more quickly and responsive in the past, re-price and a
response to changing market dynamics.
And as a result, what we aim to build is a capability that structurally is a sound and well
run Non-life company with currently a target of 97% or below. We are making progress in
the many measures that we are implementing, we are aiming to also after this acquisition
put the similar medicine if you will to just to strengthen the proﬁtability of the business as
a whole. We are making progress, there's a lot more work to be done to obtain our
objective of 90%, 97% or below but the ultimate objective is sound well-run proﬁtable,
large Non-life business leveraging the scale that we have. If we then go to the point, I
think I covered basically the two ﬁrst questions you had.
And the third one has to do with, yes, some -- we said that could be some churn as you
improve -- as you take some measures, et cetera, we've done that also in the last
acquisition that we did. If you apply measures to improve the proﬁtability of your
business, we've also called product lines to certain products we stopped. When we may
see market shares that have a slight shrinkage that could happen. But the point here is
not, that we're going to market share, we're going to proﬁtability as a priority.
And I think that needs to be taken into account.

Yes, just to come back -- just a quick follow up on the churn point. Are there speciﬁc areas
that you can identify and that you can see at this stage? Or it is more something that will
come naturally after integration takes place?

FINAL

This is a very -- the process that we're going through also in our current business, where
we do a lot of proﬁtability improvement actions, underwriting improvement actions
premium changes and all that. We aim to do that very thoughtfully.
So, there is not a one size answer for this. We deliberately prioritize proﬁtability over
market share, that's I think an important message to give. The second one is that as a
result of that, obviously you try to balance and you want to make sure for instance if you
look at car insurance, that you don't do a re-pricing across the book, so that your good
drivers for instance are being chased away from you. Going to competition and you're left
with a relatively poor overall proﬁle.
So, you need to do it very thoughtfully and that's what we do. But if at the end, all the
actions combined, in the end would lead to some attrition, the objective is proﬁtability,
not market share.

(Operator Instructions) The next question is from (inaudible) Young, Morgan Stanley. Your
line is open. Please go ahead.

Analyst
Hello.
Thank you for the chance. And just to ask two questions please. First one is to clarify that
the return on investments that investment does that includes 150 of the internal loan? And
do you plan actually to remove that internal loan after the deal is closed? So that's
question one. And then second one is apart from this EUR 150 million internal loan VIVAT
Non-life apparently, if you look at their disclosure, they still have some other related party
transactions with the other part of the VIVAT Holdings.
I've just wanted you to please conﬁrm that actually all this -- the cost -- the change of
control wouldn't kind of pose signiﬁcant risk in terms of whatever the related party
transactions with the rest of VIVAT holding? Thank you.

Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks, Philly[ph] for your question. So, can I -- Delﬁn?

Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, Philly[ph] on the return on investment ,you can see it from diﬀerent perspectives.

Either you see, that cash out ﬂow is relating to the price consideration EUR 416 million.
You can see thus including their EUR 150 million internal loans, because this doesn't -also on cash out ﬂow. Either way you would have diﬀerent cash ﬂows over the years, but
to have an idea, it will be there EUR 50 million coming, if you take only the element of the
cash or EUR 60 million, including the proceeds derived from the interest of the
intercompany loan. We do not plan and therefore in both cases as you get into our return
on investment, that way we always look at it in a very simple way is what is the amount of
cash outﬂows and what are the inﬂows that are expected to come in.
And that is what comes with our return on investment of double-digit. You -- second part
of your ﬁrst question related to, if we have intention to cancel this intercompany loan?
And the answer is. no. We also have also a Tier 2 loans with our other subsidiaries.
And this is a very eﬃcient way in order to capitalize the subsidiaries. So the intention is to
maintain this loan going forward. Just to make sure that there is no confusion there, let
me say that there are no other loans or commitments. So the intercompany transactions
are something within the group, which does not relate to third-party.
And of course those will be clear in the normal course of business.

Thank you. And my second question was about whether the change of control will change
it of the -- aﬀecting any of the related party transactions?

Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

No. I was not aware of any change of control.
I don't know in the other party transactions that you are referring for example to our
distribution agreement with Volksbank. But also here there is no change of control that
will interrupt the distribution agreement.

Analyst
Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Mr.Friese, there are no further questions. Please continue.
