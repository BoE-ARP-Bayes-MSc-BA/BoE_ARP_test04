Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, ACE had a great quarter with record
earnings, record underwriting results, and good revenue growth in constant dollars. Aftertax operating income of $897 million or $2.74 per share was driven by P&C underwriting
income of almost $600 million.
Foreign exchange continued to cast a shadow in the quarter, impacting our premium
revenue income and book value. Book value declined 1.5% due to FX and financial market
volatility in both equity and fixed income markets. Our annualized operating return on
equity was about 13%, an excellent return on shareholder capital.
Year-to-date, we've produced over $2.4 billion or $7.38 per share in operating income,
which is essentially flat with prior year in spite of about $85 million in foreign exchange
headwinds. Strong underwriting gains and 6.5% premium revenue growth in constant
dollars contributed to these results.
Returning to the quarter, underwriting results were again simply excellent. Total P&C
underwriting income growth was driven by strong underlying current accident year results,
positive prior-period reserve development, and relatively low catastrophe losses.
The P&C combined ratio was 85.9% and the P&C current accident year combined ratio,
excluding cat, was 89.2% versus 89.8% prior year, so an improvement. All P&C divisions
produced outstanding calendar year and current accident year results in the quarter.
We were about two months into the conversion of the Fireman's Fund business to ACE
paper. We're on track and, in fact, ahead of plan. As of today, both business retention and
financial performance are ahead of our original projections. The retention rate as
measured by premium is 87%. The business we are not converting is in line with our
expectations because it either does not meet our business profile or in our judgment is

underpriced. If you would like more color during the Q&A, Juan Andrade is prepared to
answer your questions.

FINAL

We produced $549 million in investment income, down about 3% on a reported basis and
1% in constant dollars, very good result given the interest rate and equity market
environment and adverse FX movement. We continue to benefit from strong operating
cash flow.
Turning to revenue growth, global P&C net premiums, which exclude agriculture, grew
nearly 8% in the quarter in constant dollars. Foreign exchange negatively impacted global
P&C by 7.5 points, nearly equal to our underlying growth.
In North America, net premiums for P&C, excluding crop, grew 11%. In our large
commercial business, ACE USA, net premiums grew just over 2%. In our two wholesale
E&S businesses, ACE Bermuda and ACE Westchester, net premiums grew about 4.5%
and 2.5% respectively.

Bloomberg Transcript

We grew 11.5% in ACE Commercial Risk Services, which serves small to mid-market clients
for specialty products. Premiums in our U.S. personal lines business were up 86%, driven
by the addition of the Fireman's Fund business. Excluding Fireman's Fund, our high net
worth personal lines business grew 14%, our highest growth rate of the year, as we are
also benefiting from increased submission activity and new business from over 300
Fireman's Fund agents newly licensed with ACE.
Premiums in our agriculture business declined 3.5% as expected due to lower commodity
prices and fund selection. The crop business is in good shape and from what we see
today, it appears it will be an average crop year in terms of profit and loss.
Turning to our international operations, P&C net premiums in ACE International were up
9% in constant dollars, driven by Latin America with strong growth of 22%. Premiums in
Asia Pacific were up 8% while premiums in Europe were down 1%. In our London-based
E&S business, premiums were down 12% as we continue to shed business in the London
wholesale market.
In our A&H insurance business, net premiums were up about 6% globally in constant
currency. A&H premiums internationally were up about 5.5% lead by Asia with growth of
15%. Premiums for combined insurance were up about 5%.
Net premiums written for international personal lines were up 18% on a constant dollar
basis. In our Asia-focused international life insurance business, premiums were up almost
9% in constant currency. And finally, in our Global Re business, net premiums declined
9.5% due to market conditions.
I want to now say a few words about current commercial P&C market conditions. The
underwriting environment continued to grow more competitive in the quarter for our
commercial P&C business globally. With some exceptions, price declines accelerated

FINAL

modestly that would vary by class of business and geography. All of the themes we've
been saying in previous quarters remain true. Large account business, particularly shared
and layered, is more competitive than mid-sized; wholesale is more competitive than
retail; and property more so than casualty-related. For our U.S. commercial P&C business,
general and specialty casualty-related pricing was flat in the quarter. Management
professional liability pricing is down 0.5%, and property-related pricing was down 9%.
New business writings in North America were down year-on-year, as one would expect,
but it varies by class, depending on the rate and terms we can secure. So in fact, new
business was up in certain targeted classes, including specialty small commercial, personal
lines, professional lines, and A&H. Renewal retention levels are holding up well. For our
U.S. retail business, the renewal retention rate as measured by premium was 96%.
Internationally, commercial P&C insurance market conditions also grew incrementally more
competitive. Again, for the business we wrote, casualty rates were down 3%, property
was down 7%, and financial lines rates were down 1%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Generally speaking, pricing is not keeping pace with loss-cost trends, though it varies by
line and geography. We continue to execute strategies to ameliorate to the extent
possible the impact of pricing on our combined ratio through a combination of mix shift,
targeting classes with better margin, portfolio management that informs underwriting
actions, including tighter individual risk selection, and pricing actions in more stressed
areas; John Keogh, John Lupica, and Juan Andrade can provide further color on market
conditions and pricing trends.
While the main event to talk about today and quarters to come, I'm sure, is our merger
with Chubb, I want to fill you in on where we stand. We're on track with obtaining all
necessary regulatory approvals in order to close hopefully early in the first quarter of 2016
as we had announced.
We received necessary U.S. anti-trust clearance, as you all saw, and we expect to
announce an overwhelmingly positive response from both company's shareholders
following tomorrow's extraordinary general meetings that will be held by each company.
Although the voting continues, based on the 80% of ACE shareholders who have cast
their votes today, to-date, approval of all Chubb-related proposals is running in the very
high 90s.
We are making very good progress in our integration planning process. Things are moving
very well with executives on both sides working in teams that represent all lines of
business and support areas around the world, addressing leadership, organizational
structure, roles and responsibilities and resource requirements.
We are also establishing teams to work on future growth initiatives. Chemistry between
both sides is excellent. Communication is good, and we are building a detailed roadmap
for integration that will allow us to hit the ground running when we close.

We are learning more about each other, and I think the admiration for each other's
people, business and culture has only grown stronger. By way of a few examples, ACE
people, starting with me, have a greater and growing appreciation for Chubb's renowned
global claims and risk engineering capabilities, its U.S. branch and agency distribution
system and its training capabilities. Chubb people have a greater appreciation for ACE's
product breadth, global operations, risk appetite and insights and speed at which we
move. Senior leadership is also working separately as a team to help facilitate cultural
integration.
Lastly, I will tell you that the reception we received from the agent and broker community
as well as from our customers has been very supportive, very positive. For example,
members of our senior management team, from both ACE and from Chubb, including
me, were in attendance two weeks ago at The Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers, or
CIAB, meeting in Colorado Springs. There was an energy and optimism in the room
among our teams that signaled to our important distribution partners how excited we all
are about our two companies coming together.
They all recognize the complementary nature of our companies. Frankly, the more we
know and the more we learn about each other, the more bullish we are on the valuecreation opportunities we can create for our customers, our business partners, our
employees, and our shareholders.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil and then we'll come back and take your questions.

Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

Thank you, Evan. In the quarter, investment income of $549 million benefited from our
strong cash flow, private equity distributions, and call activity from our corporate bonds.
Year-to-date, cash flow has essentially offset the impact of FX on our cash and invested
assets which are down $140 million on a reported basis and up $1.2 billion in constant
dollars.
Our average new money rate is 2.9%, versus our current book yield of 3.6%. For the past
12 months, our operating cash flow was $4 billion. As I said on previous calls, our strong
cash flow has offset the impact of lower reinvestment rates, and we expect this trend to
continue. Our cash flow for the third quarter was $808 million.
There are a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income including
the level of interest rates, prepayment speeds on our mortgages, corporate bond call
activity, private equity distributions, and foreign exchange. We currently expect our
quarterly investment income runway to be $540 million.
Net realized and unrealized losses were $1.16 billion after tax. This included losses of $309
million in our investment portfolio primarily due to widening of credit spreads on our
corporate bonds, a $313 million loss from the mark-to-market impact on our variable
annuity reinsurance business, and a $548 million impact on book value from foreign
exchange. FX impacted tangible book by $345 million.

FINAL

Our investments remain in an unrealized gain position of $1.3 billion after tax. Since
September 30, we have recovered a substantial portion of these marks, almost $450
million including a positive mark on the investment portfolio of $200 million.
Our net loss reserves were up $212 million adjusted for foreign exchange, and our pay-toincurred ratio was 94%. We had positive prior period development of $210 million pre-tax
with about one quarter from short-tail lines and three quarters from long-tail lines from
accident years 2010 and prior. This included $76 million of adverse development for
legacy environmental liability exposures in our Brandywine run-off operation, which is
included in our North American segment. As a reminder, we conduct our environmental
review in the third quarter and our asbestos review in the fourth quarter.
Our prior period development also included the positive impact from the release of $79
million from an individual legacy liability case reserve and our Overseas General and
Global Re segments. Pre-tax catastrophe losses of $72 million came from a number of
worldwide investments and events, including $22 million from the explosion in Tianjin, $5
million from a Chile earthquake, and the balance from other events including U.S. flooding
and Asian typhoons.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the quarter, the Fireman's Fund business made a one-time contribution of 0.75 point to
the improvement in the combined ratio due to the underwriting gain from the portfolio
assumption. However, note the Fireman's Fund contributed only $20 million to operating
income with underwriting gains substantially offset by purchase accounting.
On the other hand, foreign exchange negatively impacted operating income by $36
million. As you can see on page 4 of the supplement, our A&H constant dollar operating
income was down $6 million compared to last year's quarter. We had positive reserve
development of $8 million in last year's quarter and negative development of $5 million
this quarter. Excluding development, earnings growth was 6.1%. This business continues to
perform very well.
Also on page 4 of the supplement, you will see Life operating income is down $8 million.
This is principally due to the runoff of the VA reinsurance book.
We are finalizing our plans for our $5.3 billion debt issuance in connection with the Chubb
acquisition. We'll make an announcement in the near future.
I'll turn the call back to Helen.

We will take our first question from Cliff Gallant with Nomura International.

Q - Cliff H. Gallant

{BIO 1854853 <GO>}

FINAL

Good morning.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Good morning.

Q - Cliff H. Gallant

{BIO 1854853 <GO>}

Great. Two questions. The first one was – and thank you, Phil for that – the $22 million loss
number for the Tianjin loss. I was curious, when we see events like that in the news, from
an insurance claim perspective, how should we think about losses like that? How does it
differ from an event that we might see in the U.S.?
And then my second question that I just will really just sort of follow up, you volunteered
Juan Andrade to speak about the conversion rates of the high net worth business at
Fireman's. I would love to hear more detail about it. How is the approach different
between – how Fireman's is running and you guys are? And are there any lessons that are
– will be applicable as you integrate another high net worth business?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yeah. So, your first question, I don't know how to answer your first question, because I
don't know what you're asking really. So, can you be more specific or rephrase it? I mean,
it's a manmade natural – it's a manmade disaster that occurred in an urban center. The
only difference I'd say really between that loss occurring in China than anywhere else has
to do with the regulatory environment and how you enforced the accumulation of toxic
chemicals or other combustibles in an area like that. And so, the risk management
generally an infrastructure of a more developing country versus a developed country. But
other than that, if that's what you're getting at, there is an answer. But other than that, I'm
not sure I understand the nature of the question.

Q - Cliff H. Gallant

{BIO 1854853 <GO>}

No. That is a good answer. I appreciate that.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Again on personal lines before we dive into it, what would you like to know?

Q - Cliff H. Gallant

{BIO 1854853 <GO>}

Well, what is the conversion rate of the business of Fireman's today? What challenges
have you had? Had there been any surprises? And again, are there lessons applicable to
the Chubb filing when you look at the Chubb book?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

FINAL

Yeah. Before Juan gets into that with you, I want to make sure you understand something
about the Chubb book versus the Fireman's Fund. In the Fireman's Fund, it's a conversion.
We are literally having to convert the customer from the policy they had with Fireman's
Fund, the statutory paper to ACE paper. We did not buy the insurance company, we
bought the renewal rights to the business. When you put Chubb and ACE together, there
is going to be no conversion.

Q - Cliff H. Gallant

{BIO 1854853 <GO>}

Right.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

The customers will remain on the paper they were on. With that, let me turn it over to
Juan. Go ahead.

A - Juan C. Andrade

{BIO 16371272 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Evan. Cliff, what I would say really to start is a couple of things. I would
reinforce the fact that our premium retention is running at roughly around 87% which is
really better than the expectations we had when we did this deal.
Secondly, and as Evan mentioned, when we look at the total return aspect of the
underwriting income from this business is also running better than what we expected. I
think in the six or so months as we closed this deal back on April 1, we have been able to
successfully integrate over 500 new colleagues from the Fireman's Fund. We're very
pleased with the talent and the skill that they have brought. We've created two new
centers. One in O'Fallon, Missouri and one in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania that have really
deepened our ability to provide even better claim service, even better operational
servicing capabilities to our customers.
In addition to that, we've also onboarded about 357 new Fireman's Fund agents that
were not appointed with ACE prior to all of this. Those agents were associated with
roughly over 400 store fronts and that has generated some of the very positive
momentum we're seeing in the quarter from a new business standpoint as well.
So, all of that, so far so good. We have received tremendous support from our
distribution, both the fund distribution as well as the ACE distribution and all of this. And
it's frankly one of the reasons why we're seeing the retention rates where they are.
Regarding the business that we're not retaining, as Evan pointed out, I think there's really
a couple of specific reasons for that. One of those is really some of that business does
not fit our target-client strategy, meaning, that it's truly not a high-net worth business so
we are doing some selective re-underwriting there.
I would say the second category is business that we don't believe is adequately priced for
the exposure, particularly in some cap-prone areas. And therefore you see some of the

Page 8 of 27



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2015-10-21

business that we're not retaining which again, all of that has been built into our models
and really has been contemplated into our financials.

Q - Cliff H. Gallant

{BIO 1854853 <GO>}

FINAL

All right. Thank you very much.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

You're welcome.

Operator
And we will take our next question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Thanks. Just on the North America P&C business, the expense rate – it looks like you had
about 210 bps of improvement year-over-year, about two-thirds of that was expenses
and acquisition in particular. Second quarter in a row that that's been down year-over-year.
Is there something changing there, reinsurance or some other attribute that's driving that
acquisition ratio down or is that not something that we should think should continue?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Well, it's going to continue. It's going to continue for a period of time. We have a mix of
business change and we do have selectively in that mix of business more reinsurance.
And the biggest impact to all of that has to do with the Fireman's Fund business that we
picked up.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. Okay. And so, that's – and then on the other third being the underlying loss ratio. Is
it fair to assume that that's weather or lack of weather or is that potentially some mix shift
as well?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Well, you see current accident year, ex-cat. So, you understand how it looks without cat
losses within it. We told you that there was some improvement due to the Fireman's
Fund, and when you adjust for that, you can see how the loss ratios – very stable year to
year.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay. So, on apples-to-apples, if you were to control for those shifts then pretty stable,
that's...

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yeah. Sure.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay. And then, I also saw ACE recently purchased...

FINAL

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

And as you know, let me just say one thing. As you know, it's up a little bit and that's a
combination, on one hand, you got price and trend. And on the other hand, you got mix
changes. And I do expect over time, all things equal, you expect the loss ratios to rise a
bit.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. Great. And then, last, CoverHound, the company mentioned that it had taken a
stake or they have released that ACE had taken a stake in that company. Can you talk
about – I mean, and I think – if I remember at the release you mentioned some business
through Fireman's Fund that was being placed. Can you talk about like strategically what
benefit that provides and is there also some opportunity with the new Chubb book to
leverage that relationship as well? Thanks.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. No. I'm not going to talk much about it. The only thing I'm going to tell you is I think
in your mind, you linked Novato, California with San Francisco, California and linked
Fireman's Fund and CoverHound because we didn't put any linkage. There is no linkage
between Fireman's Fund and CoverHound. And we're not doing any personal lines
business with CoverHound and we have – we really have no plans to.
We like CoverHound. We like what we see in terms of their technology and their
development and their algorithms to match customer to the right insurer. And they're very
thoughtful people. And stay tuned as to what more over time we may do with
CoverHound.

And we will take our next question from Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Hey. Thanks. I guess my first question is just on the Life segment. Obviously, we've had
this headwind from the VA runoff, I guess, the last couple of years. But it sounds like
international life insurance growth still remains pretty strong. I'm just wondering if there's

Page 10 of 27



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2015-10-21

any visibility on where you might – on when you might see that cross over where growth
from either U.S. A&H or international life might be enough to kind of offset that headwind?

FINAL

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yeah. That's a really – that's a good question, and we look at that all the time. The
international life business was in a loss-making position because it was greenfield and we
were continuing to invest to grow it, to build it because building agency distribution is
costly. So, we kept plowing into it.
And it crossed over last year this year into a positive earnings position. Its earnings over
the next year, two and three will accelerate significantly and will overcome that number.
Our projections are over the next five years, so it has to happen year by year, but that it
will be a meaningful – international life will become a meaningful contributor to ACE's
earnings.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

And I guess, just to try, by meaningful, $100 million more than that, or...

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

To be meaningful in ACE, it has to have 100 – it has to be in the 100 – you have to have
hundreds of millions to be meaningful to ACE.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Okay. Understood. And then I guess my second one was, I guess just on professional lines
and combining the two companies and whether it's right or not, I think we think about
Chubb as writing more primary layer of professional lines business, ACE writing a little bit
more excess in large case. And I guess, how do you think about the opportunity, longerterm integrating those two businesses? And is that the type of process that could cause
near-term disruption because of any customer overlap?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No. Not that much. Very little, as we look at it. I think you got it partially right. I think we look
at it this way. Chubb is so strong in middle market and small customer professional lines
business. And there, of course, it's not a shared and layered business, you're writing it
ground up. In the shared and layered, the large account business, ACE is a very
meaningful primary writer as well as an excess writer, as well as an individual DIC writer,
which is major Side A coverage.
Chubb as well writes in the large account space. We don't see an overlap by the way
when we – to the degree we are able to look at our concentrations of customer. We don't
see an overlap that gives us concern, and we don't see an overlap of significance.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful.

And we will take our next question from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Josh Clayton Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking the call. So, Evan, I was hoping I could start with
a big picture question on strategy if you don't mind. I know you take a long-term view of
the business, and I'm wondering if you can walk us long-term how you're thinking about
growth.
I mean, if we look back the past decade, you've organically added a lot of products.
You've done bolt-on acquisitions, entered new markets, and you took advantage more
recently of a hardening market to accelerate the top line. But now that the market is
softening and you've got Chubb to digest, I'm wondering how we should think about
growth as we look out to next 5 or 10 years?
And in looking at the portfolio today, given all you built, what do you think long-term run
rate for growth would be, so either the number you're shooting for internally or what we
should think of as a sustainable target? Thank you.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yeah. I'm not putting out a long-term growth target, but I'm going to give you a picture.
And I appreciate the horizon you're taking of 5, 10 years, and I'll deal just within the fiveyear period right now. We're already putting together teams to focus on what we see as
meaningful growth opportunities, target opportunities. Chubb has approximately 4,500
agents in the United States who it has a deeper relationship with. Chubb has industry

verticals in the middle market with deep product capability based on insights they have
into those customer cohorts that they've done a lot of study and a lot of work on, very
thoughtful.
Our ability to add, and we can see it, middle market oriented specialty products to the
Chubb core portfolio to enhance industry verticals and grow them, to enhance general
market customer, those customers in many instances in the products were contemplating
together are already buying those products. And in many cases, those agents are already
selling those products. It is not doing it for Chubb or that agent is not selling it to that
customer, someone else is. And we see a whole lineup of that on one hand.

Bloomberg Transcript

Number two, the small commercial space is an area – a very big marketplace, and it's an
area that ACE hasn't been endeavoring along in a specialty way. Chubb has been
contemplating, and Chubb brings traditional product capability that ACE doesn't have.
ACE brings specialty product capability and some technology that Chubb doesn't have.
And Chubb brings distribution that is awesome to be able to move into that space. We
see a very large opportunity that way.
When – and two other things on the U.S. when we think about it. In the upper middle
market area, ACE doesn't have a good traditional product offering in commercial auto, in
risk transfer comp. Chubb brings us capability in that area that will enhance our presence.
Now you have to be mindful of underwriting cycle and sometimes it'll be a greater
opportunity than others, and it is one of the death valleys, there are a few of them, of the
insurance industry. So you have to be very careful. I make those comments so you
understand we're well-informed about all that, we're underwriters. But that is a real
opportunity for us to begin towing into.
In the personal lines area, stay tuned. That's a $41 billion, as we can tell, marketplace, and
we'll have between us somewhere around $5 billion of that. There are a lot of customers
out there who are not buying high-net worth product, though they have the need of the
coverages and the services that are provided. It's a long-term to grow that and get them
out of the traditional writers that they are with into something, into a product that more
meets their needs and they're not really price conscious, they just don't focus on it. But to
stay tuned it's also about, Masterpiece has been a leader in the industry – in that industry.
It really set the course and it may be time in a reasonable period of time to reveal
Masterpiece 2.0 and that's on our radar screen.
When you get internationally, ACE has endeavored along both in brokerage and agency
distribution as you know. We've grown both large commercial and we have grown middle
market commercial business on the continent, in the UK, modestly in those and in Latin
America and Asia.
Chubb colleagues that we will be adding bring us a lot more capability to add resource
and industry verticals and product to our distribution and to our own and to bring
enhanced distribution and to enhance our presence in that market. And we see it in a
meaningful way, and there are three or four or five countries right now on our radar
screen that we're building plans to move into.

FINAL

So, I think the growth will start to show. It takes time to put in place. I think it will – and we'll
find a way without gaming it in any way to reveal – to show you the progress. It won't be
right away. But I think over the medium term, you look out a couple of years, you're going
to see meaningful additional revenue streams that the two of us as one company will be
able to get that the two of us independently would never get. And over five years, I think
it's going to be very meaningful revenue that we'll throw off. We're underwriters. We're
looking for margin. It'll throw off meaningful margin.

Q - Josh Clayton Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Yeah. That's great. That's great, Evan. Thanks for serving so comprehensive. If I could
switch gears just briefly, sort of the other side of the coin, integration and sort of
operating risk management. Sometimes good deals sort of flounder from lack of
attention and details once you close, and I'm sure it wasn't (38:38) for you guys...

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

My (38:40) laughing because...

Q - Josh Clayton Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

But ultimately, I'm wondering as you think about the history of the industry, you think about
other deals that went sideways. What are the big risks for integration and leveraging the
franchise that you guys are aware of and that you're sort of managing around to try to
avoid them?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I can't point to with specificity to what I – knowing what the failures are. I don't know them
intimately of others. I can give you my own sense of it though, and that is that somehow
you make a large acquisition and when it closes, it's like victory. I did it. We're done.
Frankly, from the day we announced or I should say the day after we announced (39:31),
we dove right into what it's going to take to integrate. We're deep into integration
planning. You really – it is about detail. It's about understanding and causing all your
colleagues to understand and everyone to conceptualize and then bring it down to a
fundamental day-to-day action plan that you can execute. What are your expectations as
to the true resource required? What does the organizational structure look like? And who
are the right people for it? And what is the right cost for that kind of a business or that
kind of a service organization? And it has been and is a drains-up exercise that we are
going through. You want to get it done reasonably quickly. You can't linger on it or you're
internally focused too much. And then you got to get on from the day you close with the
implementation of it and you can't lose your appetite or your passion for the detail of it.
And we're looking at the detail all the time and everyone is as we plan it, and we know
we've got short time until we have to begin executing. And that execution takes time.
When you run the cycle, it takes you two years to get other than mop-up done, and you
have to be relentless. You can't lose your focus, you can't get bored with it, you got to
know it has to happen, and it takes leadership to lead people. It's a long march and you
got to lead them from the beginning until the very end. And you got to be intimate with it.

And at the same time, you've got to, in parallel, create for your organization the vision of
why you're doing it. Because you're doing it for the greater good, you're doing it for the
efficiency, you're doing it to be competitive, you're doing it so you can invest and you got
to lead to it and show it. Because in parallel you got to move on growth opportunities and
show the positive.
At the same time, you're working on what is a difficult process of integration. And it takes
a wide bench of managers. And the managers are the team that has to lead it and that
team is inclusive. It's not a we and they. Very quickly, it is not ACE and Chubb. It is just
Chubb and it is all of us. And it's getting people's mental mind around that that you are –
that that's who you're dealing with. We are all colleagues; let's just get it done together.
That's the whole deal, man.

And we will take our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays.

Q - Jay H. Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Good morning. I want to follow-up on that comment, Evan, on the high net worth market, I
just want to clarify, are you sizing the high net worth personal lines market at around $40
billion, of which the commodities Chubb would have $5 billion currently?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Go ahead, Juan.

A - Juan C. Andrade

{BIO 16371272 <GO>}

Yeah. So, Jay thanks for that. So, the...

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

You may correct me.

A - Juan C. Andrade

{BIO 16371272 <GO>}

The U.S. personal lines market is roughly about $250 billion. I think the last estimate that
was out there from Conning and a few others estimates high net worth to be roughly in
the $80 billion range. What we're referring to in the $40 billion range is really our sweet
spot in our target clients on what we'd like to go after. And so when we think about our

Page 15 of 27



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2015-10-21

true client strategy of being high net worth – ultra high net worth customers, that's really
how we're sizing that market.

Q - Jay H. Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Why would the target market be half the total?

A - Juan C. Andrade

{BIO 16371272 <GO>}

Well, these are...

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Isn't that big enough for you? $40 billion is pretty big.

A - Juan C. Andrade

{BIO 16371272 <GO>}

You like chasing on that?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

How about when we get close to that target, we'll start arguing about the other $40
billion?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Juan C. Andrade

{BIO 16371272 <GO>}

These are approximate numbers. And the way that some of the firms out there, the
consulting firms, et cetera, and the research firms identify high net worth is not exactly the
way we do it. So, for instance, Conning and a lot of the folks out there will define anything
over $1 million in value. Our homes typically are over $2 billion and $3 billion in value and
higher. So we do identify a subset of that high net worth market. That's really what we're
looking at.

Q - Jay H. Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

All right. That's helpful. Then, I guess, more for...

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Buddy, you're always are. Go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Jay H. Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

With regard to the share buyback, can you kind of clarify what the plan is for 2016 after
the merger closes, and then what you're thinking about in terms of share buybacks as a
percentage of annual earnings going forward?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yeah. What we've said is that for 2016, we expect no buybacks. And when it gets to 2017,
we'll let you know, right? We'll see how the capital develops, and we'll make that position
as we go into 2017.

Q - Jay H. Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Historically, ACE standalone...

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Buybacks are not the first thing on our mind.

Q - Jay H. Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. I mean, historically, ACE has repurchased around the equivalent of half of annual
operating earnings, and Chubb was higher. Is that half level a potential starting point?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

What are you calling historic?

Q - Jay H. Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

2014?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I'm thinking the last 12 years, buddy. And I don't know that you've come to that number.

Q - Jay H. Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

All right. And then the last one, if I can try on this one. So, the ACE's effective tax rate is in
the low teens. Chubb's is in the mid-20s% including the benefit for Chubb of a big
municipal bond portfolio. Putting those two things together in year one after the
transaction, is it then reasonable to expect that the new ACE-Chubb would have a higher
tax rate than ACE on a standalone basis?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Page 17 of 27



Company N ame: Chubb L td

Yeah. That's the way we plan it, right? We've said that we don't expect to see – we don't
expect – well, we haven't built into our plans any changes to the reinsurance. As you know,
our view has been this deal stands up without that, and so that's the way we're going
forward.

And we will take our next question from Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Good morning.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Just a follow-up on the tax question. I would think there would be a substantial opportunity
to put in some internal quota share reinsurance and incremental savings on the tax side as
well. Could you just elaborate on why that wouldn't be the case?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No. We're not going any further with that line of thinking. But if you want to elaborate on
why you think there is that opportunity, we're listening.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Okay. Yeah. I think it's a – I wouldn't – it could be like you'd leave any money on the
people, I think that would be a meaningful additional revenue stream in addition to the
strategic sense of the deal. Okay, then just moving on...

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Well, I think you're – Sarah, I think you're not thinking of it the right way. Not the way we
think about it. We don't do internal reinsurance for tax planning purposes and we never
have. We do it for capital management purposes and we do it around how we manage
our risk exposures and where we pool capital and, therefore, pool risk so that we can
manage volatility and we can manage our capital exposures that are spread around the
world to be able to take the risks we take locally. So if you think that way about it and you
put your head around that, I think that then that leads you to a whole another line of
Page 18 of 27



Company N ame: Chubb L td

thinking. And I think you then understand why we're not going to expand on that on the
call.

FINAL

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Okay. Fair enough. And then just the unfavorable development in the A&H business, could
you just elaborate on what drove that and how we should be thinking about the run rate
life earnings going forward?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Well, I think the A&H – we had a positive prior-period development last year. And so we
can't – we just can't project reserve development. This year $6 million, it was noise and
there's nothing systemic. And it was in a portfolio where we just saw that it's quite
profitable portfolio, but the loss ratio was running a little bit higher in there than we had
estimated and so we adjusted forward and just raised it.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thanks for the answers.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

And we will take our next question from Vinay Misquith with Sterne Agee CRT.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. The first question is on the soft issues with integration. I'm sure you're
doing a lot with the details. But just a big question on the cultural integration. Evan, it
would be helpful to hear from you, to your own experiences and what's being done on a
firm-wide basis to integrate two very different cultures.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I have to tell you, the more we get in and look and the more we work together, the more
in my mind and I think in the mind of my colleagues and I believe in the mind of our Chubb
colleagues, those who've been working together, the cultural differences, there are far
more cultural similarities than cultural differences. And I think the differences have to do a
lot with simply speed and have to do within – in some areas, what we consider, what
management responsibilities or supervisory level responsibilities, how broad are your
responsibilities.
I don't think – I think what's so similar is our striving to execute with excellence, our striving
– we both put a lot of pride on technical excellence, whether it is in underwriting, or in
claims, or in product, or actuarial, or in accounting. I think you find that – and that's one of
the things we're seeing. Each one comes to the table and has sniffed the other one out
Page 19 of 27



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2015-10-21

FINAL

as to how are you about, how detailed are you, and how deeply do you think about it?
And I think we find that the similarities are gratifying. When we listen to each other's
objectives and what you concentrate on and focus on to execute your plans, what's
important to you, speak in very similar ways. When we think about opportunities, we see it
in a similar way.
Chubb is an older company and has some of the attributes that we admire of an older
company that is more mature in some ways in its processes and capabilities. I shout out
claims to some degree, but more training and development and some areas like that.
ACE has invested more in technology, I don't mind saying that. As an example, we're both
deep into data analytics.

Bloomberg Transcript

Culture requires – now to answer your question directly, it requires leadership and
management to be extremely visible in the behaviors and exhibiting the behaviors that
they expect of everyone else. It's not just what you say; it's how you do it. People watch
your actions, and then they listen to the exact words you use, not your description of
culture, but how you live the culture. That is true of the senior most leadership and how
we all display it. That then is emulated by the leaders at the next level. And on down and it
cascades. And that we are all vigilant to reinforce that is important.
Yes, at the same time, we have groups working on what I'll call them more mechanical
ends of it of language that we use in common so that we know what each other is saying
of being clear of here are some of the behaviors that we all admire and should
accelerate, what our brand identity is together. And so we give ourselves a name of, a
meaning behind the name of Chubb. Those are all things that we're paying attention to,
and that will happen here.
But finally culture is also built on shared experiences in my experience, and that is the
more people work together and have shared experience together, that's what builds a
common team spirit between yourselves. That's how you take from what starts out as a
little more sterile to absolute familiarity and where people really are one because they've
gone through it together. And you can't short circuit that. You can try to help it to happen
and create those experiences. That'll happen over time, and you pay attention and you
be patient about that part.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. The second question is on the small commercial initiative. My
thoughts or my views about small commercial is that it's more of a low touch business
versus maybe the middle market to the higher end which is more high touch and that
small commercial is driven by technology. So, could you help me understand how long do
you think you would take to build up your technology and what sort of investment do you
think it would entail for you to be a meaningful player in small commercial?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Got it. Okay. Just you obviously gone through some approvals already, so I don't know if
that sped (56:50) things up. Okay. So, I also wanted to ask on the personal lines just to
understand a little bit better. The difference between how you go to market with Chubb
and the Fireman's deal. So if I understood the way you were saying it, under Fireman's
essentially, that name doesn't exist anymore, right? So, you're just going to market,
everything's – when they renew, it becomes ACE and if you're going to have two separate
papers in the market going forward, it's obviously, I mean, I just know when I have
shopped before, right, you get four or five names like I had shown to you. It's not like you
got 20, like a standard to market personal auto.
So, how in the agents' mind, are they going to have two, are they going to have a
representative from ACE and a representative from Chubb that they are going to deal
with? How do you not confuse the agents? I guess what I'm trying to get at if they're
going to have two separate plans (57:45)...

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

It's really – Ian, it's really simple. They're going to have one Chubb person call on them. I'm

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

You have an insurance company that you bought it from. Do you know the statutory
company name on the paper, the actual statutory company name? So, for instance, you
buy from Chubb – you could be buying, you're buying federal paper most of the time.

I understood. Okay. Okay, so, you're not going to have two separate...

entities.

Okay.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

(59:20) back up for me.

And then just lastly, you mentioned the asbestos usual analysis in Q4. Just given – any
changes you're seeing in the environment? We've seen, I think, from others, charge
continue to tickup a little bit. It sounds like there's a little bit of increase – sort of the typical
increase in defense costs, maybe, I don't know (59:46) worse, maybe we're getting more
real mesos as people are living longer. Anything – any color you can provide on it – is this
sort of business as usual? Or does it feel like things have gotten a little worse?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I think business is usual in what remains just a hostile environment. The liabilities are long
dated and they're in runoff. But we don't see any – we don't see change to the
environment. The legal environment has been hostile for years. And that remains. The
mortality tables and mesos living longer has been baked into the thinking in that
environment. You're right, that is something we've been living with as a dynamic. The
plaintiffs going to more peripheral industries and defendants, whether it's pump
manufacturers or those who make flooring has been going for a number of years.
So what you end up with in development is really case-specific as the cases ultimately
develop and settle, which is claims work much more than it's actuarial work.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Got it. Okay. Okay. Great. I think that's all I have. I'll let someone else take it. Thanks.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Thanks.

A - Helen M. Wilson

{BIO 2078659 <GO>}

Yeah. Operator, we'll take questions from one more person, please (61:21).

Excellent. And we will go next to Brian Meredith with UBS.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. So, Evan, just a quick question here. Last quarter, I think you mentioned
that even with the FX, you expected to see mid-single-digit revenue growth in the P&C
business. Through year-end, it does look like that's achievable. What's changed?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

FX.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

The FX is just worse and you...

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yeah. FX is worse and that's primarily. Asia and Latin America economically are a little
slower and you see some softness there. But that impacted us in the third quarter on the
margin – a bit marginally. It was more FX, it was worse than – we took another leg down.
The dollar took another leg up.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got it.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

...and you saw that. And that was not in our forecast. That was not in what we had
forecasted. We did not anticipate that. That is how we would have.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then, next question, what other regulatory approvals do you still need to
close the Chubb transaction, the major ones?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Sure. We need insurance department approvals.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay. (1:02:42) okay.

Six or seven – Joe is – go ahead.

A - Joseph F. Wayland

{BIO 3534068 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. We need approvals from six or seven state insurance departments and we need
approvals from about the same number of foreign regulators as well.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay. And then last question to Evan. So, ACE is known as a very efficient operator out
there as one of the insurance company. I'm just curious, when you look at Chubb, what
disciplines or what area do you think you could make them more efficient? Are there
areas that you've kind of identified? Not so much merger synergies, but more what
Chubb does?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I don't know enough yet. I can tell you one thing that what I – they are thoughtful
underwriters, thoughtful leaders that way in how they think about their domain and their
business and we've seen that. And they've been very – they're thoughtful in how they
manage claims and a lot of expertise. I doubt we're going to lend a lot of benefit to their
fundamental underwriting thinking. I think there'll be colleagues and it will be on the
margin that will each find it. I think some of our rigors and process around enterprise risk
management and how we think about it, and how we think about concentrations of
exposure and how we think about using our own capital and industry capital to manage
that. I think that putting the two together, we will gain from that.
I think we'll both gain from the insights over time. It's not like throw the switch into the
data and analytics of the two of us in that regard. I think that ACE – Chubb has deep
distribution knowledge and experience in agencies that will help us, help ACE. On the
other side of the coin, ACE has very broad distribution capabilities and experiences in
other channels of distribution, including direct response. And we have technology in those
areas that I think will over time we will mix and match for each other and help improve our
overall distribution management.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. Thank you.

A - Evan G. Greenberg
