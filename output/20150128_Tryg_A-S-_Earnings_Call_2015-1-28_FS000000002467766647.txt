MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION

Bloomberg Transcript

Lars Møller
Yes. Good morning, everyone. This is Lars Møller, Head of IR at Tryg. And we are here to
present our Q4 and Annual Result for 2014. And with me today, I have our CEO, Morten
Hübbe; and our CFO, Tor Lønnum, with me.
And with this short introduction, over to you, Morten, please.

Morten Hübbe
Thank you, Lars. And if we turn to slide three, we're pleased to announce the best fourth
quarter since Tryg IPO'd some 10 years ago. With a combined ratio of 83.7%, we
increased the technical result in the quarter by some 40% and for the full year some 22%.
Of course, the quarter has been helped by some DKK300 million lower weather claims, as
well as higher run-oﬀ gains. On the other hand, we've had roughly DKK150 million higher
large claims year-on-year in the quarter.
Clearly, the underlying main driver is our eﬃciency programme, which now has resulted
in almost DKK1 billion. And also, we see that despite a write-down of our domicile
premises of roughly DKK100 million, also our pre-tax result is up some 20%. If we look at
the top-line for the fourth quarter year-on-year, it was down 2.4% in the fourth quarter
2013 and down 0.1% in 2014 fourth quarter. So, we're stepping in the right direction, but,

realistically, we're expecting also pluses and minuses on the top-line in 2015 and then in
2016 a more stable top-line around the inﬂation level.

FINAL

If we turn to slide four and we'll look at the full year. As I mentioned, technical result is up
some 22% or more than DKK500 million. Clearly, we had a helping hand from the one-oﬀ
gains relating to Norwegian pensions in Q2 of some DKK135 million. We improved the
combined ratio 3.5 percentage points for the full year.
The top-line improved from minus 2.7% in 2013 to minus 1.1% in 2014. So, clearly, not
ﬁnalized, but a step in the right direction. We delivered return on the equity of 23% posttax. And we suggest to the AGM an improvement of the dividend from DKK27 per share
last year to DKK29 per share and also a split of our share in 1:5 at the AGM.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we turn to slide ﬁve, we point some of the main events in 2014. Clearly, the most
important probably is that, at the Capital Markets Day, after successfully delivering
DKK950 million of savings in the old eﬃciency programme, we target a new DKK750
million of eﬃciency measures towards 2017. At the same time, we've set ambitious targets
for our customer development in a fashion that makes customers and earnings go handin-hand, by focusing on customer loyalty, customer satisfaction and the amount of
products per customer to become broader.
We also decided to do another DKK1 billion of buybacks programme in 2015. We shifted
our provider of IT maintenance during 2014. And we've made signiﬁcant progress in our
project of price diﬀerentiation and also build upon that our customer lifetime value
initiatives to make sure that we continuously improve the quality of our portfolio, as well
as our competitive position.
If we look at slide six, we see how the four diﬀerent business areas contribute to the
earnings improvement. And there's no doubt that the two main drivers has been Private
lines, our biggest business areas, with a combined rate of 82.5% and also an
improvement of 21% in the technical result and, clearly, an improved trend on the top-line
and customer development in Private lines; and also, the second driver, Commercial, with
a combined ratio just below 80%, an improvement of the technical result of more than
30%.
I guess elevating Commercial from an area which is just four years, ﬁve years back actually
didn't have any positive technical result to now a signiﬁcant result of DKK785 million, but
clearly further behind Private lines in terms of top-line. Sweden and Corporate also at
satisfactory levels of around 92% in Sweden and some 89% in Corporate.
If we turn to slide seven, we show our strategic initiatives for 2015. We are not exactly
inventing the wheel with four new initiatives, but rather building upon the four previous
and I would say successful recipes we've used in 2014. We will further enhance our price
diﬀerentiation. Being historically an old mutual company, we still have signiﬁcant potential
to improve our price diﬀerentiation and also our customer lifetime value modeling.

FINAL

Number two, our customer experience. We will further enhance our focus on increasing
the Net Promoter Score, our customer retention rate and the number of products. And,
clearly, we see that as an important driver also of eﬃciency and of earnings quality.
Leading in eﬃciency covers our new eﬃciency measure of DKK750 million on claims
procurement and on costs, which will be the main driver of earnings improvements in the
coming year. And also, we see IT stability continues to being important, adding upon that
further focus on digitalization, which will enhance sales, service and eﬃciency, helping the
cost measure as well.
On slide eight, we show the quarterly improvement in eﬃciency. We delivered some
DKK117 million in the quarter. On claims, particularly in property, but also workers' comp,
we see a positive impact. In the cost side, we see working with IT sourcing, but also, at the
moment, working with ﬁnance sourcing will be drivers of earnings improvement. And
then we see the fact that we've done more digitalized communication with our customers,
have reduced our cost as well.
On slide nine, we show our continued focused on reducing the cost ratio. If we look at the
full year, the 14.6% cost ratio looks very promising, but bear in mind the one-oﬀ impact of
DKK135 million from Q2. And if you adjust for that, the full year is at 15.3%, an
improvement of 0.3%, but still further improvement we will take during the coming years.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we look at the quarter in isolation have improved year-on-year from 15.4% to 14.9%,
which we think is a strong level for Q4. And we see that we have further reduced the
number of headcounts by 161 people, excluding the purchase of Securator.
And then if we turn to slide 11, we elaborate slightly on how the four business areas
contribute, both to the technical result and the top-line. And, clearly, if you look at the
annual numbers, Private lines now reaching a technical result of DKK1.6 billion, worth
mentioning, Commercial lines DKK875 million. And, clearly, those are the main drivers of
improving the technical result.
If we look at the top-line, Private improves the most together with Corporate, Private from
minus 2.2% to 0%, Corporate from minus almost 3% to a plus of just about 1%. And,
clearly, if we turn to the quarterly numbers, we see that the underlying improvement in
claims are mainly from Private and Corporate. And we see that the top-line improves
gradually to minus 0.1%.
And then over to you, Tor.

Tor Magne Lønnum
Thank you, Morten. If we continue on slide number 12 and look at customer retention, we
can see that there is a continued, positive development in Private Denmark, up to 89.6%
in retention level. We see that there is a small reduction in Norway. We see that on the
Commercial lines, there is a positive development in Denmark, an improvement, whereas
you can see that there is a decline in the Norwegian market. Although you can still see
Page 3 of 13



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2015-01-28

FINAL

that the decline is coming after a long period of improving the retention rate and thus
should be considered more as a normal ﬂuctuation.
If you look at slide number 13 and look at the development in average premium, you can
see that there is a continued, positive development in average premiums in Norway, both
for house product and for the motor product. In terms of the motor product in Denmark,
you can see that there is a weaker development. It's a negative development in average
premium.
There are a few drivers in terms of the average premium. It's related to competitive
pressure and discounts. But it's also related to the fact that as we have mentioned for a
number of quarters that there is people moving to smaller and safer cost.
In terms of the underlying claims ratio, as is mentioned on the slide, we actually see that
there is a signiﬁcant drop in the claims ratio as well. So proﬁtability is sustained. In Q1, we
will introduce a new car tariﬀ, which we think will actually improve our situation in terms of
market, being able to sustain our market position.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we move on to slide number 14 and talking about Private Sweden. You can see that the
Sweden retention level are more or less on a normal level. We see that the Nordea
portfolio, as is shown isolated, has moved more or less back to what you can see is the
average for the portfolio and really indicates that the pressure we had on the portfolio in
the beginning seems to be leveling out. In terms of the proﬁt development, it's slightly
weak result in Q4. It's due to seasonality and some one-oﬀ eﬀects. Among others, we
have some signiﬁcant run-oﬀ gains in the quarter last year.
If we move on to slide number 16 and looking at the claims development. As I think
Morten mentioned earlier, we see that we have an underlying improvement overall in the
quarter by 0.3% overall. We see that there is a 1.8 percentage point improvement for the
full year. And, in particular, I'd highlight the fact that we do have an improvement of 1
percentage point in Private.
If you look at the Corporate, Commercial and Sweden, it's a more mixed picture. You see
that there are some weakening in terms of Commercial and Sweden, some improvement
in Corporate, although I would call it more normal ﬂuctuations, in particular, Commercial
coming from a very low level.
If we move onto slide number 17 and look at large claims, weather claims and run-oﬀ. As
Morten mentioned, there is a signiﬁcant increase in large claims this quarter, up DKK150
million. We see that there are a couple of particular types of business that have that kind
of claim. It's related to seismic and it's also related to ﬁsh farming, although we don't see
it as a particular negative trend.
If you look at the weather-related claims, as Morten mentioned, of course, there was a
signiﬁcant drop in weather-related claims, some DKK300 million. I would highlight
though that if we move into 2015, we have seen signiﬁcant storms both in Norway and
Denmark here in January. So, I'd say that it's more or less accidental whether it's on this
Page 4 of 13

Date: 2015-01-28

FINAL

side of New Year's Eve or on the other side. And we do see that there are claims in the
area of slightly above DKK100 million related to the storms here in January.
If we look at the run-oﬀ gains, you see that there are slightly higher run-oﬀ gain this
quarter. It's actually 7% run-oﬀ gain which elevates the run-oﬀ gains to approximately 6%
for the full year. Going forward, as we communicated on our Capital Markets Day in
November, we will see a likely higher probability of run-oﬀ gains. Historically, the run-oﬀ
gain has been in the area of 4% to 6%, whereas we, for the next strategy period, expect
run-oﬀ to ﬂuctuate around the current full year level.
If we move onto slide number 19 and look at the investment results. We had a good
performance in equity prices in the fourth quarter, although relatively volatile. So we
actually realized a 3% return on the equities which elevated the equity return for the full
year to 10%. As Morten mentioned, the portfolio is, of course, impacted by the write-down
of the domicile here in Copenhagen which reduces the return by slightly less than 1%.
If we move to slide number 20 and look at the capital structure, there is a continued,
positive development in the capital buﬀer. It's at 51% despite the increased dividend that
Morten mentioned. We have initiated the buyback programme and you see more or less
weekly or the weekly reporting related to that. And, ﬁnally, I'd mention that the equity
development, as you can see, is more or less stable. So a solid capital development as
well.

Bloomberg Transcript

And with that, I'll leave it back to you, Morten.

Morten Hübbe
Thank you, Tor. And just our last slide, on slide 21, where we reiterate our new ﬁnancial
targets as we stated them at the Capital Markets Day. For 2017, we have an ROE target
after tax to be at or above 21%, at very low interest rate levels. We might add a target to
reach a combined ratio at or below 87% and a target to reach an expense ratio at or
below 14%.
Clearly, the main drivers will be our eﬃciency programme of DKK750 million for the
coming period until 2017. But also our work with price diﬀerentiation will add to the
quality and the margin in our portfolio, together with working with the customer
experience, enhancing the customer loyalty, enhancing the broadness of the product
coverage and also improving on the lifetime value and selection of these customers, and
all-in-all to make sure that we continue a positive trend and the positive earnings
momentum in the coming years.
And with that, we'll turn over to your questions.

Q&A

FINAL

We have the ﬁrst question from Mr. Per Grønborg from Danske Markets. Please go ahead,
sir.

Q - Per Grønborg
Yes. Good morning. Impressive results. I just have a single question that I would like some
comments on. If I look at the segments, I see that your combined rate, I think it was 27%
on workers' compensation. Can you give some comment upon that? I guess it's primarily
a prior year gain that is rolling it down to this level.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yes. Per, that is correct. And, of course, when you look at the higher level of run-oﬀ this
quarter, it's primarily workers' comp being a source. I'd just add to that comment that you
also see some variances in terms of where the run-oﬀ result is stemming from. So you've
probably seen that there are slightly higher run-oﬀ in Denmark, whereas it's actually a bit
lower in Norway. So, of course, that impacts the geographical segments that you
commented on.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per Grønborg
How much are there – I guess this is still related to the changed liability law back in 2004.
How much are there still to roll back on the liability line or are you more or less in place
now?

A - Morten Hübbe
I think you can both, Per, look at the liability law change but also the general margin on
workers' comp also in older years than that. And I think we have sizable positive margins
on both. And I think it's fair to say in the higher expected mean of ﬂuctuating run-oﬀs in
the coming years, workers' comp will continue to be a signiﬁcant driver of that.

Q - Per Grønborg
Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Our next question comes from Mr. Gianandrea Roberti from Carnegie. No. Excuse me.
Next question is from Mr. Jakob Brink from ABG. Please go ahead.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Yeah. I just have one follow-up question on Per's question, actually on run-oﬀ gains. I
mean, historically, you've been talking about – I mean when you do your claims estimate
then you have, let's say, a best estimate of DKK100 million and then you add a buﬀer of
Page 6 of 13



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2015-01-28

FINAL

DKK7 million. But you're now talking about a sustainable higher level of run-oﬀ gains. Is it
then only coming from prior years over-reserving on workers' compensation in motor or is
it also because that DKK100 million – the best estimate is actually too high that your
models may be not factoring in inﬂation good enough or low inﬂation or what exactly is
going on?

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yeah. Jakob, I think, ﬁrst and foremost, to make sure that there aren't any
misunderstandings, we are saying the same today as we did at our Capital Markets Day in
November which is that we do expect a higher level of run-oﬀ gains in the strategy
period. I.e., there is no inﬁnity in terms of – or perpetuity in terms of run-oﬀ gains. On the
contrary, of course, we do factor in a margin on the reserves, as you commented yourself.
But it's important for us to say that it's not like we are saying that the current run-oﬀ level is
something that will run into perpetuity.
Although I would add to the latter comment that when we look at the development in
terms of margin, clearly, there has been – and that has been a continued trend that you all
know about the fact that sort of the early vintages of the 2000s have shown a very
favorable development. And that is something that we have continued to see for both in
Denmark and Norway.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thanks, I guess. Thank you.

Operator
Now we have Mr. Gianandrea Roberti from Carnegie. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning from me as well. I have three little question. The ﬁrst one just to make
sure I have got my number right. You have done DKK952 million out of the DKK1 billion
old savings plan. And then when I look at the new savings plan, I think you mentioned
before the DKK415 million we should expect DKK125 million out of the DKK750 million.
Do I need to add the DKK48 million missing from the old savings plan or that goes in the
DKK125 million? That's the ﬁrst question.
My second question is that you mentioned that the claims ratio in motor Denmark is down
5% during 2013 and 2014. By the way, I like the word proﬁtability sustained. It's probably a
little bit more than sustained on that point. Does it mean that the combined ratio in motor
Denmark is down 500 bps from the end of 2012 to the end of 2014 or it's actually down
1,000 bps? Can you clarify that? And also how has that developed in Norway? That would
be quite interesting.
And the last question that I have, it's on the sideways reinsurance agreement. I think you
had around DKK150 million in that agreement as per Q3 and few nasty weather has been

Page 7 of 13



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2015-01-28

hit in Q4 and Q1. Can you just tell me how much you have so far under that agreement?
Thank you.

FINAL

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yeah. Gianandrea, to question number one, yes, the remaining DKK50 million will come
in – will be factored into the savings which is planned for the coming three years, i.e., it
will be a part of the DKK125 million. And so that will be a part of the programme going
forward. In terms of the last question, can you repeat that, please?

A - Morten Hübbe
Sideways.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
The sideways cover, sorry. In terms of the sideways cover, yes, we do expect to get some
recovery on the storms that we had here in January. I think you'll ﬁnd in the annual report
that we comment that there is somewhere around DKK80 million left before we get into
the cover. So that will give you sort of at least an overview of what's going on around the
reinsurance agreement.

A - Morten Hübbe

Bloomberg Transcript

And I guess the DKK80 million that was left before we earn the money on the sideways
cover, Gianandrea, is a 1 of January number. So prior to the -

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Basically, if I assume that the storm has cost you DKK80 million, you are in a way home
free or larger weather event until the 1 of July. That's the right way of thinking, correct, or -

A - Morten Hübbe
That's probably your wording and not ours but you are correct in the math.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

Operator
Our next question comes from Mr. (24:42) from Exane Paribas. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Lars Møller
Yes. Good morning, all. Guillaume (24:48) from Exane. I have a question on the
foundation. Even though it's not in your hands, could you provide us with an update on
anything you know and on the potential timing for discussions regarding the adaption of
a policyholder dividend model? Has anything changed or has been accelerated
compared to when you commented at the CMD last November? Thanks.

FINAL

Well, I can comment on that. I guess the process is that the group of 70 representatives
have during 2014 been working to ﬁnd diﬀerent modeling to do a customer bonus
model, including solving the question that part of their historical fortune has been built
also from Nordea life and how would that be handled in the process.
The process is now that they have the next discussion of this topic during February. Then
they read or they look at the discussion again in March. So, I think the earliest possible
decision could be in the middle of March, but I think it's a democratic process with 70
people involved. So, we need to have some respect for that process, but the earliest
decision possibility, as I see it, is in the middle of March.

Q - Lars Møller
Okay. Thanks very much.

Operator
Next question is coming from Mr. Bin-Young (sic) [In-Young] (26:29) Chung. Please go
ahead, sir.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - In-Young Chung
Hello. This is In-Young from Goldman Sachs speaking. So just one quick question on
Sweden. We see that the Nordea portfolio retention is up and ex-Securator the premium
change in the quarter seems to be about minus 5%. So do you have any comment on the
Swedish portfolio, ex-Nordea? That, I think, up to 3Q was developing fairly okay. So, yes,
just a question on Sweden, please.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yeah. I think it's a mixed picture related to Sweden. As we comment, the Nordea portfolio
is developing positively. We do have two other aﬃnity agreements that have been
terminated that will impact the revenues in 2015. And despite that, we actually see that
the sales there in Q4 has been relatively good. So, it means that, for the full year, Sweden
will probably be negative, but not as negative as we had expected. Based on that, I would
reiterate what Morten said that for the full year 2015, the top-line guidance is between
negative 1% and up to neutral. So exactly the same as we said on our Capital Markets Day.

Q - In-Young Chung
Sure. So the minus 1% to neutral, that's on a group level, isn't it, rather than for Sweden?

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Correct.

Q - In-Young Chung
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.

Next question is coming from Mr. Christian Hede from Nordea. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. This is Christian from Nordea in Copenhagen. I just have a question
on your capital structure and I guess this is mostly a question on timing. In November, you
were also talking about the option for issuing more subordinated debt when the rules are
clear. So I'm basically wondering what is your best estimate for when the rules will be
clear. Is that still going to be sometime mid-2015? Thank you.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Good morning. I think it's really diﬃcult to say what the authorities will do or not do,
because it will be based on what will happen around the regulation for the Natural Perils
Pool. And we are, of course, hopeful that we should be able to give a comment about that
in the ﬁrst half. But to make any promises on behalf of others that we don't control, I think,
is really diﬃcult. But as you indicate, Christian, it will be important in terms of what we do
related to the subordinated debt, which, as you mentioned, have a call date in November,
December this year.

A - Morten Hübbe

Bloomberg Transcript

So, I guess, Christian, you can conclude that hopefully we have news on the Perils Pool
prior to November, but the actual call date of the existing sub debt is November. So, I
guess, the latest timing where we will make a change would be Q4 2015.

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

The next question is coming from Mr. Mika Koskinen from SEB. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Mika Koskinen

{BIO 1557965 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I only have a very simple question on
the investment income and relating to your write-down that you made on the domicile.
Should I read this that, excluding the write-down, of course, your investment income had
been DKK106 million higher? Would that have been a kind of normalized or normalized
level of investment income or whether other one-oﬀs impacting the investment income in
one direction or the other?
And then, as I'm totally new or fairly new to the company, a question to you. Was this
write-down communicated in before a year, was the underlying investment income
actually a fair amount better than the consensus expectation was, if we adjust for the
write-down?

FINAL

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yeah. Good morning. I think, ﬁrst and foremost, yes, the DKK106 million had an impact on
investment result, as you say, in Q4. Whether or not Q4 was normal, it's really diﬃcult to
answer. What I can say is that, as I mentioned, we had 3% return on equities isolated in
Q4, i.e., 10% full year. And our expectations in terms of return on equities are 7% for the
full year and it's at 6% on real estate. So, we do try to give some guidance in terms of the
normalized investment result. What I'd highlight is, of course, the fact that we have seen a
new interest rate drop and, of course, that will have an impact on our investment return
going forward.

Q - Mika Koskinen

{BIO 1557965 <GO>}

Absolutely. Okay. That's fair enough. Thanks very much.

Operator
We have the next question from Mr. Paris Hadjiantonis from KBW. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good morning. Excellent set of numbers today. I was wondering if you could
comment a bit on the impact that the FX movements and basically the depreciation of the
Norwegian currency is going to have on your earnings capital and growth for next year
and the years after. And if you could also explain the lower tax rate that we saw in this
quarter. Thank you.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yeah. If you take the FX movement, ﬁrst, I guess, ﬁrst and foremost, it's important to
understand that we try to hedge the currency risk related to the equity exposed in the
Norwegian branch. So capital movements overall should be more or less neutral. It's not a
perfect hedge, but it should be more or less neutral. We do see some deviations there.
In terms of overall impact related to proﬁt with the current level of exchange rates against
the Norwegian krone, it could have – if we hypothetically say that it stay at the same level
for the full year, it could have a DKK50 million impact on the proﬁt level. So it's not a very
signiﬁcant number.
In terms of the tax rate, it's clearly impacted by the fact that equities have been a major
driver for investment return. And that actually impacts the tax rate signiﬁcantly for the full
year and also for the quarter. So, that's the main deviation point in terms of the tax rates.

A - Morten Hübbe
We might add that, I guess, for Norway, we've seen in the previous years a rather high
GDP growth relative to the rest of Europe, as well as a rather high developed new car
sales, et cetera. And it will be interesting to see in the coming years how the lower oil
price and the impacts of the surrounding industries in Norway – how that may impact the
longer term GDP development in Norway, as well as new car sales and car insurance
Page 11 of 13



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2015-01-28

sales, et cetera. So, I guess, it is likely that that growth will be slightly lower in Norway in
the coming years and that we'll have to work slightly harder for top-line in Norway in the
coming years.

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

FINAL

Excellent. Thank you.

Operator
We have a follow-up question from Mr. Gianandrea Roberti. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Sorry, just to go back, I had a question that I don't think we discussed yet. It's the claims
ratio in motor in Denmark. I didn't quite understand when you write that it's down 5%
during 2013 and 2014. If that's a cumulative 5% or how should I read it? And how has that
developed in Norway, if you can give us some comment as well? Thanks.

Yes. We haven't discussed it, Gianandrea. Sorry. I was actually going to comment on it.
But the number of 5 percentage points is what you can ﬁnd in and out to the annual
accounts movement from 2013 to 2014. So, it's not a cumulative eﬀect. In terms of the
development in the Norwegian market, we do see the same kind of positive development
in risk margin in Norway as well. So there is a sustained, good proﬁtability in the motor
product.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Tor, just to make sure I understand this correctly because I haven't seen the notes in the
annual account. But, typically, you reported the product proﬁtability on a consolidated
ﬁgure, right, not on geography by product?

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yes.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

So when you're saying the notes of the account, are you referring to the then Tryg motor
book or what?

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yes.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.
