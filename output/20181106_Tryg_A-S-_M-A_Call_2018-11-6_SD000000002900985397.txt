Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning, everybody. This is Gianandrea Roberti, Head of Investor Relations of Tryg.
We're hosting this call today following the approval of the Alka acquisition. Morten
HÃ¼bbe, our CEO, will walk you through slides and then we will leave it to Q&A. Over to
you, Mort.

Morten HÃ¼bbe
Thank you, Gian. Good morning to all of you. And of course, ﬁrst on Slide 2, very pleased
to announce that the Danish Antitrust has now approved our Alka transaction with 3 nonstructural remedies. One, being an annual donation to what we call, Forsikringsguiden, in
Denmark; two, being cancellation of certain fees for early cancellation; and three, being
the removal of exclusivity on certain partner agreements.
I will elaborate on the next slide on these 3 remedies in a bit more detail. But generally,
we estimate the ﬁnancial impact of these 3 remedies to be roughly DKK 20 million per
year for ﬁve years. We conﬁrm very ﬁrmly our synergies target of DKK 300 million with
unchanged timing and unchanged size.
In reality, that means that we compensate for the DKK 20 million annual impact of
remedies by adding additional synergies. But let me get back to that. Then we conﬁrm, as
expected and communicated, a solvency ratio of 170% after everything has been carried
out.
On Slide 3, we elaborate further on the 3 remedies. First of all, for those of you outside
Denmark, Forsikringsguiden is not well known. Forsikringsguiden is a comparison poll

also. But very unlike your typical U.K. comparison site, which tries to come between the
customer and the insurance company, which charges commissions and pushes costs up
for the insurance company. Forsikringsguiden is indeed developed by the Danish
Insurance Association together with various consumer bodies. It has been in place for a
number of years, generally to inform objectively about diﬀerences and carve-out price
across the Danish industry. And we have agreed to pay an annual donation to
Forsikringsguiden for the coming ﬁve years.
To elaborate on the second remedy, we've accepted to suspend certain existing fees that
relates to a situation where the customer carries out an early cancellation of their policy
and we have accepted to suspend that also for a 5-year period.
Then, ﬁnally, we have accepted to remove exclusivity on a number of partner agreements,
both in Tryg and in Alka. In our experience, what determines success in the partner
market is whether the partner ﬁnds our products attractive, more and more so whether
they ﬁnd our digital and innovation solutions attractive and whether they ﬁnd our prices
attractive and generally that the cooperation between the 2 parties work.

Bloomberg Transcript

And fundamentally, it's key that a partner agreement is attractive to both parties. If that is
not the case, then actually a contract would not save the business. And actually, exclusivity
does not fundamentally change that recipe for success.
We have already, together with Alka, received very positive feedback from the unions that
Alka works with. A wish for further and more additional cooperation, more new
development has been required from a number of unions and several unions already plan
to use some of their proceeds from the Alka sale to buy more insurance for their
members, which is very positive. And it's quite clear for us that the Tryg family's bonus for
members by TryghedsGruppen puts us in a very unique position where we are very
attractive in these partner agreements.
If we turn to Slide 4, we see that the Alka ﬁnancial performance has remained very strong
since the announcement of our transaction. nine months this year, combined ratio of 84,
technical result of DKK 276 million, 4% growth and a very healthy improvement of the cost
ratio.
On Slide 5, we slightly elaborate on the Alka portfolio. Very positive to see that it is
predominantly a Danish private lines business. And if we look at Tryg's historical business,
Danish private lines is our largest and most proﬁtable portfolio. And if you look across the
Tryg group, it means that our overall exposure to private lines will increase from
approximately 50% across the group today. So approximately 60% after Alka. And we
ﬁnd this a very reassuring and positive consequence of the transaction.
On Slide 6, we actually repeat the synergy slides that we published in December '17. While
during this rather lengthy approval process, we have had lots of time to carry out very
detailed plans, very detailed investigations, which means that we are very conﬁdent on
the synergies planning. As an example, we have carried out a number of clean teams, for
instance, oﬃcial external consultants have gone through all of the spending in Tryg and

FINAL

Alka on claims and contract data. They've gone through as much as 700 diﬀerent
contracts, carried out more than 50 workshops and interviews to make sure that we have
a completely clear picture of what to carry out and when and a very detailed plan of doing
so.
It means that we will oﬀset the DKK 20 million of remedies by an addition of DKK 10
million of reinsurance synergies and an addition of DKK 10 million of procurement
synergies.
Also, we are very pleased to have noticed that in 2018, Alka has been running at some 8%
lower costs year-to-date. The cost ratio has improved from 16.6% to 15.3%, corresponding
to some DKK 28 million lower costs year-on-year, very positive for the total case and the
future. Also, it's quite clear that when we've investigated further, there will be extra
eﬃciencies from group and innovation teams. We have very high activities on Innovation
Tryg, Alka has the same, that will continue. But we don't need to do everything twice.
Thirdly, it means that the total synergies of DKK 300 million are very, very ﬁrm and that the
timing and size is unchanged and that we actually oﬀset the DKK 20 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Bear in mind, as we have communicated all along, there will be one-oﬀ costs. We expect
to be at DKK 200 million in Q4, of which DKK 120 million will hit the technical result and
DKK 80 million will hit other.
On Slide 7, we mainly repeat our solvency expectation of around DKK 170 million repeat,
as already communicated, no extraordinary dividend on the back of full year '18. It's quite
clear that our proﬁtability has been very high and robust in Tryg alone. Alka, in addition,
will increase our earnings ability going forward. And quite clearly, with our ROE target, we
have no intention or incentive to grow our equity too much and that will, of course, help
our total payout.
And we're generally pleased to have now even more private lines exposure, which longerterm, will result in higher proﬁtability and lower capital requirement and then the starting
point, all other things equal. On Slide 8, we mainly conﬁrm our unchanged 2020 strategy,
including now the Alka technical result and synergies and a target of DKK 3.3 billion
technical result in 2020. And as always, we ﬁnalize and close out with our favorite quote
from John D. Rockefeller before moving over to your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) The ﬁrst question is from AsbjÃ¸rn MÃ¸rk of Danske Bank.

Q - AsbjÃ¸rn Nicholas MÃ¸rk
A couple of questions from my side. First of all, on the remedies, Morten, you seem very
focused on the 5-year time horizon. And I understand that you're not too concerned
Page 3 of 7

about the exclusivity suspension. But I guess, this could have an impact going forward as
well on potential lost revenue after your 5 -- or is there something I'm missing here?

FINAL

A - Morten HÃ¼bbe
Well I think that if we look across the Tryg book, we have a very large proportion of
partner business already today. I think we've proven that -- there's no doubt that partner
business structurally has more risk than direct business. I think we've proven historically
that we've been so good at driving the partner business that we have more longer lasting
relationships. We have actually even stronger loyalty and even stronger returns in the
partner business. And in addition to that, the bonus is now a new character which would
help the total partner business. Could you lose partner business? Yes. You could with
exclusivity or without exclusivity. But our experience is that if the partner doesn't feel that
an agreement works, they stop putting business into the agreement, regardless of what
the legal wording is. And that is why we see that there is no fundamental change to the
way we perceive our ability to create success in partner business and if you look at it from
the union in Alka, they get the same product as before at the same price as before and
now they get 8% bonus in addition. And that is getting very, very positive feedback from
the unions, exclusivity or not.

Q - AsbjÃ¸rn Nicholas MÃ¸rk
So there is no real catch for union members in any way? They get at least the same
product and 8% custom bonus?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten HÃ¼bbe
They get the oﬀer that they're getting today and then they get 8% bonus on top, which I
think most of them will ﬁnd attractive.

Q - AsbjÃ¸rn Nicholas MÃ¸rk
Of course. Okay. Question on your -- on the synergies. First of all, the bridge that you
have, it's altered slightly since the December last year announcement. You have 5% box
called reinsurance investment, now you have costs about -- about 30% or 25%, is that just
technical or is there something that we should focus on?

A - Morten HÃ¼bbe
No. To be honest, it is fair to say that in December a lot of the synergies were
assumptions. And now as I mentioned, with 700 contracts and the 50 workshops, we have
altered a ton of things within those lines, one of them being, for instance, that reinsurance
has more synergies and development and group costs has more costs, synergies, et
cetera, et cetera. So a lot of moving parts. But I think, the overall picture is fairly
unchanged. But I guess, initially, we thought that the implementation would start earlier
and therefore, we would start with more simple and crude plans. Now instead, we start a
little bit later. But with extremely detailed plans. But in the overall and bigger scheme of
things, it actually looks slightly more positive than planned and now, more detailed.

So the extra DKK 20 million from procurement and reinsurance, I guess that is seen as
sustainable, right? So after year 5, you would actually have met synergies of 320, all things
equal?

A - Morten HÃ¼bbe

FINAL

That is correct.

Q - AsbjÃ¸rn Nicholas MÃ¸rk
All right. Then ﬁnal question from my side, you mentioned as well Morten, the cost ratio in
Alka, of course, has come down quite signiﬁcantly. But I also think, I guess, marketing
expenses, et cetera, has come down quite substantially as well. So is it really the correct
starting point to look at the actual cost ratio as of Alka right now? Or is that including
some of the, what you would call cost synergies going forward because they have
lowered their marketing spend, et cetera?

A - Morten HÃ¼bbe

Bloomberg Transcript

I know for a fact that a lot of Alka's new business comes from the beginning of the year
and I also know for a fact that there is a rather large marketing spend planned for
November and December. So no, you cannot just assume that that is the run rate. I would
probably more look at it as an additional positive signal that Alka is becoming even more
eﬃcient. But I think Alka will continue to have a rather high marketing spend. So I think, I
would assume the same run rate as before. I would add the DKK 300 million and then I
would see this, if you will, getting slightly ahead of the curve as just one more positive
signal that we're on the right path.

Operator
The next question is from Per GrÃ¸nborg of SEB.

Q - Per GrÃ¸nborg
Per GrÃ¸nborg from SEB. Two questions from my side. First of all, mostly a clariﬁcation.
You are removing the fees for power plants, moving their contracts within contract period.
How much of those fees did you charge in 2017 just to get a perception of how big a
share that is of the DKK 20 million?

A - Morten HÃ¼bbe
Well. Good morning to you, Per. I'm pleased that you start with a question that we will not
answer. I think it is fair to say that the early cancellation fees did actually not exist in Alka.
They existed only in Tryg and that they play a sizable proportion of the total DKK 20
million. It is not our experience that they have a signiﬁcant impact on customer behavior.
But of course, there is a ﬁnancial impact, which we then have to compensate.

FINAL

Okay. My second question, getting a bit back to AsbjÃ¸rn's question but a bit broader.
You have approximately DKK 750 million of operational improvements in November '17.
You posted an additional DKK 300 million from this acquisition. How far -- how much have
you delivered by the end of -- should we expect you to have delivered by the end of '18 of
the 1050, sorry of the 750? Then, I think I didn't get very clear on your answer, the DKK
300 million new plans of synergies on Alka, should we base that on the 2017 earnings or
should we base that on the 2018 earnings?

A - Morten HÃ¼bbe
I think you should base it on the 2017 earnings and then, probably, assume that when we
look at the run rate of '18, we are slightly ahead of that curve. What I would suggest is that
when we do the full year '18, we spent a little bit more time giving a complete status on
the targets for the three years in Tryg and the initiatives and the run rates on those and
then, we show you a little bit more color on the synergies and the plans for Alka. It's clear
that up to now there has been rules as to how close we've been allowed to get to Alka
data. That's why we've used clean teams that are external teams. But when we report Q4,
we should be able to give you more detailed information both on the synergies and plans
there. But also on the status on the 3-year initiatives in Tryg. So let's elaborate on that with
Q4.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) The next question is from Vinit Malhotra of Mediobanca.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Some topics have been addressed so thank you. But I'm just curious that, the exclusivity
clause, for example, is it something like car dealerships or is it partnership business? That
could mean a lot more on the cooperate and those kinds of things. But what kind of
exclusivity clause could this be? I'm just more curious about the actual nature rather than
the numbers as such because I'm just trying to understand what the competition authority
got out of this as well.

A - Morten HÃ¼bbe
Well. Good morning to you as well, Vinit. Fundamentally, the bulk of Alka's business is
private lines business. So we're talking about the private lines business. In that business,
roughly half of the business is related to cooperation with unions. Those agreements have
a length, typically ﬁve years, which is the legal maximum period and then they have today
an exclusivity, which means that the union cannot work with other insurance companies
than Alka. Now what this changes is the exclusivity clause, which means that the union has
the opportunity to work with other companies than Alka as well. And that's where I
comment that when a union, which -- slash partner is pleased with the products, the
innovation, the digital, the pricing and now, in addition the bonus, they will not want to
work with other insurance companies than us and Alka. If we don't perform, then they
won't put business to us, regardless of whether there is exclusivity or not. But it relates
fundamentally to these union agreements in private lines.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. And in your assumption, sorry, to follow up. But in your assumptions, you have
assumed that some undesirable business will go away. Have you assumed something will
go away or very little?

FINAL

A - Morten HÃ¼bbe
What we have assumed, we have a business plan, which looks at the starting point run
rate. Then we have made assumptions on which agreements will have a similar volume as
before, which agreements would have a larger volume than before and which
agreements would have a slightly lower volume than before. Then all of that ﬂows into our
total plan. But we haven't really changed our assumption of those plans as described
because we believe the success of the agreements does not rely on the exclusivity. It
relies on the attractiveness for the partner and the union and us, on products, on pricing,
on innovation, on digital and then, of course, we have the tailwind and the help that we
add 8% bonus on top. And that's why we're quite conﬁdent that this is a key focus area to
be alert and keep partner and union agreements attractive. But that was a key focus point
already before the exclusivity question.

Operator
We have no further questions. I hand back for closing remarks.
