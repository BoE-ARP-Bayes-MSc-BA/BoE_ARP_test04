{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us today. Yesterday
evening we announced fourth quarter net operating income of a CAD1.63 per share,
driven by strong property and commercial results in Canada. For the full year, NOIPS
increased 15% to CAD5.60, bringing the operating ROE to 13%. Results for the quarter
include OneBeacon, which drove top line growth to 17%. Our Canadian businesses grew
north of 1%, tempered by our rate actions, pretty much in all lines taken ahead of the
market.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our operations are demonstrating their resilience and proving the beneﬁts of
diversiﬁcation. The overall combined ratio was 92.6%, with Canada at 91.9% and our US
operations at 97.4%. Results in Canada were solid despite the impact of unusually severe
winter weather, which began in late December and is still aﬀecting many parts of the
country.
Performance in personal property and commercial lines continues to be excellent and we
see ongoing beneﬁts from our rigorous expense management. Personal auto
performance remains unsatisfactory and therefore is undergoing robust corrective
measures.
We ended the year in a strong ﬁnancial position with a total capital margin over CAD1.1
billion and debt to total cap at 23%. Book value per share grew 12% in 2018 to CAD48.
When comparing ourselves to the industry, our combined ratio was better than the
industry by 6 points at the end of the third quarter, driving an increase in our ROE
outperformance to almost 600 basis points. We expect our ROE outperformance to
widen further in the near to mid-term and remain above our long-term objective of 500
basis points.
So, let's look in more detail at our results by line of business. So, starting in Canada,
personal auto growth was down 0.6% in the quarter, as our rate actions taken ahead of
the market resulted in top line pressure as anticipated. We're very comfortable trading
our top line to improve bottom line.
The combined ratio improved by 3.9 points over Q3, but at 101.2% was unsatisfactory
even if adjusted for normal seasonality. Physical damage inﬂation remains the main driver
of our current underperformance, but severe weather was also a factor this quarter. We
estimate that the combined ratio run rate is in the upper 90s at the end of the year.

FINAL

After more than 18 months of weakness in personal auto, it's fair to ask, are the actions
paying oﬀ as anticipated? Our view is that the initiatives implemented have achieved what
was intended. Indeed, we've meaningfully gained traction in rates adequacy, portfolio
quality and claims frequency and severity trends related to bodily injury and physical
injury or psychological injury.
However, cost pressures related to physical damage are more recent and that accelerated
in the past few quarters. That's why we have meaningful additional rate increases in the
pipeline across the country. We're also adding to our segmentation initiatives to continue
to improve the portfolio quality and claims management initiatives focused on costs and
the time taken for repairs are being ruled out.
We're executing with discipline on our action plan and remain committed to bringing
personal auto's combined ratio back to the mid-90s. We're conﬁdent this is a short to
mid-term issue and our actions should bring us back to our long-term track record of
performance in this line. It's important to keep in mind, we've operated personal auto in
the mid-90s for 7 of the last 10 years, and have averaged a combined ratio in the mid-90s
over 5, 7 and 10 years. So, we'll keep at it until we get there.

Bloomberg Transcript

When it comes to the outlook for auto, the industry continued to increase rates in the
fourth quarter across the country. We also see expansion of the industry risk-sharing pools
and double-digit growth in our non-standard auto business, supporting our view that the
market is ﬁrming from coast-to-coast. We expect this environment will support our
proﬁtability improvement plan for sure and we see mid single-digit growth for the
industry in the coming 12 months.
Historically, this kind of environment has translated into opportunities for Intact. In
personal property, premiums grew by 4%, as rate increases continued to be deployed in
favorable market conditions. The combined ratio for the quarter of just under 80% reﬂects
excellent underlying performance. For the year, we delivered a combined ratio of 89%
despite over 10 points of cat losses.
Our actions over time, I believe have been successful in this segment. We've delivered a
combined ratio just under 89% on average over the past four years. Personal prop is
performing and is positioned very well for the future. The industry outlook for personal
property remains unchanged. Elevated natural disasters this year again support continued
ﬁrm market conditions, with mid single-digit growth expected over the next 12 months, as
the industry continues to adjust changing weather patterns.
Looking to commercial lines in Canada, top line was up 2%, as we saw strong growth in
specialty lines and early signs of improving momentum in commercial P&C. This segment
continues to produce excellent results, with a combined ratio of 87.4% for the quarter and
86.5% for the year.
Our pricing and segmentation actions are paying oﬀ, and this business is positioned for a
sustainable low-90s or better combined ratio moving forward. In terms of outlooks for

FINAL

commercial in Canada, even though competitive, we see clear signs of improvement and
we expect low to mid-single digit industry growth in 2018.
Turning now to our expansion into US commercial and results for the quarter. So,
premiums of 307 million bolstered our growth. On an organic basis, excluding
discontinued lines, growth in this segment was 2%. The combined ratio at 97.4%
represents a good starting base to deploy our proﬁtability improvement plan and it is well
underway.
Beyond the two lines of business that have been exited at closing, we're applying Intact's
analysis and analytics, and segmentation expertise in select other lines. Our claims
practices are gradually being deployed in the US. Synergies are being realized as
projected, which we will cover in a minute. Our plan is on track to bring the US combined
ratio to a low-90s level within 24 to 36 months and in the exercise, deliver mid-single digit
run rate accretion to net operating income per share by the end of '19.
There is upside to come from expanding distribution for OneBeacon's proﬁtable lines and
from being able to serve new customers across borders, North and South. And on that
front, we've already begun to leverage OneBeacon's industry-leading expertise in
Canada, where we are now underwriting new entertainment and technology products.

Bloomberg Transcript

Looking at the industry outlook in the US market conditions, since the transaction closed,
are slightly better than anticipated, with early signs of upward pricing trends in certain
lines. Overall, we expect low single-digit industry growth for US specialty in 2018.
Turning to strategy, we continue to accelerate our customer-driven transformation in
Canada. We completed the rollout of telematics via mobile across the country, launched a
simpliﬁed home quick quote tool and added an enhancement to Belairdirect's app. We
also launched Canada's ﬁrst commercial auto quick quote engine in December.
On the people front, we were recognized by Aon for the third year running as one of
Canada's Best Employers, the key objectives we've set for ourselves. Building engaged
teams with a customer-driven mindset is a core pillar of our strategy and we're committed
to an employee promise, which attracts and retains top talent and experts. I want to take a
moment to thank all our people for their contribution to our success across our lands. So
in conclusion, '17 was a landmark year for IFC as we expanded our reach in the US. I'm
pleased with the underlying performance and continued momentum in personal property
and commercial lines. Personal auto, we are taking the actions necessary to bring the
combined ratio back to the mid-90s and the ROE closer to 15%. Our US franchise is oﬀ to
a solid start. This opens up a signiﬁcant growth pipeline for our business and adds to our
already diversiﬁed operation. IFC's ﬁnancial position is strong and we're gaining
momentum. And with that in mind, we're increasing our quarterly dividend by 9% to
CAD0.70 per quarter. This is the 13th consecutive annual dividend increase since our IPO.
I'm conﬁdent that the strategies we have in place, together with our various actions and
discipline position us well. We aim to deliver on our ﬁnancial objectives to outperform the

industry ROE by at least 500 basis points every year, and grow our net operating income
per share by 10% per year over time.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Louis Marcotte.

FINAL

Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles, and good morning, everyone. We reported solid earning numbers this
morning, with fourth quarter net operating income being up 11% to 236 million, and net
income up 36% to 232 million. These results were driven by the strong overall results in
Canada, the addition of OneBeacon's earnings and solid growth in distribution income.
The US tax reform and favorable capital markets also provided support to our results.
On a per share basis, after considering shares issued to acquire OneBeacon, net earnings
grew 26% to a CAD1.60 for the quarter, taking full-year earnings per share to 5.75, an
increase of 45% over 2016. Our ROE rose from 10% to 13% year-on-year, while the book
value per share grew 3% from the end of Q3 and 12% year-over-year.

Bloomberg Transcript

From a top line point of view, the addition of OneBeacon drove our Q4 growth to 17%, a
substantial increase to our premium base and a meaningful diversiﬁcation. The overall
combined ratio in Q4 was 92.6%, including OneBeacon's 97.4%. These are solid results on
both sides of the border, particularly while both personal auto and OneBeacon are still
undergoing proﬁtability improvement plans.
Let me provide some additional color on our Canadian results. In auto, the combined
ratio remains elevated, but our actions are bearing fruit. We were pleased to see
favorable prior year developments in the quarter, earned rates up 5.2% and written rates
up 5.3%. Despite this progress, the underlying loss ratio remains above our expectations,
mainly due to the higher prices for parts and the time needed to replace them. We will
continue taking actions to bring our combined ratio progressively towards a mid-90s
target.
Our actions to manage our overall expenses has also been successful. The 2017 expense
ratio declined 1.8 points, driven by lower variable cost and rigorous expense
management. 0.5 point of that improvement is structural and should continue in 2018.
Our distribution income grew 17% in the quarter to CAD28 million, bringing full-year
distribution income to 132 million, an increase of 19%. This just reﬂects the beneﬁt of
capital deployed in distribution and our continued focus on margin expansion. We expect
distribution income to grow by 10% in 2018.
On the US side, the underlying performance was healthy with a 56% loss ratio. We
recorded unfavorable prior year development of 4.6%. About half of the prior year
development represents our 20% share of losses ceded to the adverse development
cover. The remainder reﬂects the impact of discounted -- discounting those ceded losses.
As a reminder, the adverse development covers 80% of all losses for accident years 2016

and prior, up to a maximum of USD250 million. We used approximately USD25 million in
Q4.
Charles talked earlier about our proﬁtability improvement plans to bring the combined
ratio to the low-90s in 24 to 36 months, and achieve mid single-digit NOIPS accretion by
2019. These are well underway. Our Q4 results already include approximately USD1
million of realized synergies. However, the actions taken to date will deliver USD9 million
in synergies on an annual run rate basis. We expect to double the run rate by the end of
2018, leaving us in good position to reach our CAD25 million target within two years.
As of January 1, 2018, our seasoned investment management team has taken over the
OneBeacon investment portfolio. They are now working to optimize the asset mix, taking
risk, regulation, tax and capital factors into account. We don't expect signiﬁcant changes
to the overall asset mix.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net investment income was up 17 million in the quarter, mainly due to the addition of the
OneBeacon portfolio. Excluding OneBeacon, 2017 net investment income was unchanged
year-over-year as expected. We estimate 2018 investment income to increase by about 8%
or 9% over full-year 2017, after reﬂecting the addition of OneBeacon and the use of excess
capital to fund the acquisition.
At the very end of 2017, the US enacted its tax reform legislation, which led us to
recognize a non-operating tax beneﬁt of CAD27 million, or CAD0.19 per share relating to
the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities of OneBeacon. Going forward, the tax
reform will have a negligible impact on our results. On one hand, we will beneﬁt from the
lower tax rate and a faster recovery of tax losses. On the other hand, OneBeacon's
intercompany reinsurance agreements become ineﬀective.
Now, looking at capital in our balance sheet. We ended the year in a strong ﬁnancial
position with a total capital margin in excess of CAD1.1 billion. In Canada, our MCT was
205%, 4 points higher than at the end of Q3. And in the US, the RBC regulatory capital
stood at 459%, well above minimum required levels. Our debt-to-total capital ratio was
down to 23% at year end, ahead of schedule. We are well on track to get to our 20%
target in 2019.
With a strong balance sheet and conﬁdence in our outlook for growth and proﬁtability, we
raise our quarterly dividend by 9% to CAD0.70 per share. This represents a 12% annual
dividend growth rate since our IPO in 2004.
In closing, 2017 was a milestone year as we deployed capital in the US, expanding into a
new market to secure new growth pipelines for many years to come. With the diversity of
our underwriting businesses, investment portfolio and distribution assets, we have built a
highly resilient platform with signiﬁcant growth potential. With our strong ﬁnancial
position, we're in good position to participate in consolidation opportunities as they arise,
particularly in Canada where we are ready to act at any time.

We look forward to 2018 and beyond with increasing conﬁdence in our ability to execute
on our ﬁnancial objectives, to outperform the industry ROE by 500 points and grow
operating income per share by 10% over time.

FINAL

With that, I'll return the call back to Ken.

Thank you, Louis. In order to give everyone a chance to participate in the Q&A, we would
ask that you kindly limit yourself to two questions. If there is time at the end, you can requeue for a follow-up. So Krista, we're now ready to take questions.

Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Thank you, and good morning.

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Good morning, Pan.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

My ﬁrst question on the personal auto side. And if you roll back 12 months from now and
at that time, you said, so you're taking actions and expect the combined ratio to improve
in 2017. Now 12 months later, some of the actions actually have shown some results, but
new loss cost trend is just popping up. So, I just wonder, can you talk a little bit more
about your ability to anticipate that the loss cost trend were changes, make sure you are
ahead of the curve rather than keep chasing the curve, and what give you conﬁdence, you
can bring back to mid-90s and how long will you take?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Okay. Good. So, I think -- Kai, let me just take this one. 18 months ago, in the third quarter
of '16, the results in automobile insurance took a turn in a direction we didn't like. And at
that time, this was primarily driven by bodily injury as well as accident beneﬁt. Part of it
was reporting of larger claims from years 2013-2014, so late reporting, which when you
add to our forecasting mechanism, changed our view of the trend at that time.
So, when we realized that this was the case, Kai, we, of course, were very transparent with
investors. But at the same time said, hey, we're seeing this happening, new claims in large
part and we're changing our view of that environment, not only are we reserving for it but
we're pricing for it. And at that time in late '16, we started to roll out, laid actions across
Page 7 of 28

Date: 2018-02-07

FINAL

the lands pretty much, underwriting actions across the lands as well as claims action
across the land.
And when I look at the earned rate in the system, when I look at our multivariate scores
that track the prospective proﬁtability of the business, I mean, there is lot of traction that
has taken place. And I would say, when I look at the cost curve, when it comes to
psychological damages and bodily injury, we clearly have seen inﬂation in that front and
restored in large part, the proﬁtability of those coverages, per se.
What happened though over that period is that, in Q4 '17 or in Q4 '16, I should say, we've
noticed in the Ontario market, an increase in total losses for vehicle, which later in '17, so
this was a -- I would say, could have been a blip. But soon in early '17, after noticing that
total losses in the Ontario marketplace were up, put in place an action plan in claims in
particular to try to tame total losses. And what happened in '17 throughout Q1, Q2, picking
up in Q3 is we've seen physical damage beyond Ontario. The cost of repairs go up across
the land basically.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, you need a quarter or two to ﬁgure out whether it is something that is changing or
whether it's just a blip. And when we realize that there was pressure in PD, basically
launched a PD-oriented action plan which includes rates, which includes claims action,
risk selection actions and so on. And that's why, Kai, we have said last quarter that, while
we've made a lot of progress to improve the performance, the emergence of trends in PD
which was months old, quite frankly are largely driven by cost of repairs, largely driven by
technology, has driven a whole new set of actions.
When I stack the actions we've taken in '16 as well as in '17 with what's in the pipeline now,
we're saying, hey, we are getting back to our long-term track record this year. It is sort of
what we're shooting for, but we'll keep at it until we've tamed that trend. The other thing
that I think is important to point out is that, it should be easier to keep physical damage
under control from a pricing point of view than it is to keep bodily injury and accident
beneﬁt under control, which, I think we've gained a lot of traction on that front.
So, look, this might be a bumpy ride, but we're not going to let go until we're back to our
long-term track record in personal auto. So, I don't think there -- when I look back and I
can tell you, we look back and think about how we could have avoided some of these
bumps.
It's not like there have been trends building up, for which we have the information sitting
in front of us for many months, quite frankly. And I would say that, if you look at our top
line in personal automobile where we have basically -- look at Q4 again, shrunk our
customer count by 1.7%. I mean, we're basically oﬀ-cycle when it comes to the markets
read. So, I think if those trends are solid and real, we are at least 18 months ahead of the
pack, which in my mind translate -- and has translated over my career, for sure, in
meaningful growth opportunities, both organic and inorganic when the industry wakes up
to these trends. And I think, looking at the markets from coast-of-coast, we're feeling that
the industry is picking up.

FINAL

So imperfect answer, but that's sort of my view of things at this stage. And when I look at
our proﬁtability indicators, I'm seeing meaningful traction but this might be a bumpy
road. It might be appropriate, Kai, to ask Darren to give you a perspective on what's in the
pipeline and what's coming in '18 in terms of action and we may be we want to do the
same thing with Patrick because claims is playing a meaningful role in my mind in
improving those trends and that might give you a more fulsome perspective on what's in
the pipeline. So, Darren?

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles. So, as Charles indicated, our current run rate sits in the upper-90s. So, I
think it's important to recognize that Q4 obviously is a tough quarter from a seasonality
standpoint. So, when we normalize and look at our action plans over 2017 in terms of
where we sit today, we're in the upper-90s. So, that really is our starting point in terms of
our movement down towards mid-90s.
When we look at the actions that will ﬂow through the portfolio in 2018, the vast majority
are actually coming from actions that we took in 2017. So, whether it be in terms of rate
increases we continue to earn, claims actions, underwriting actions, risk selection, et
cetera, a vast majority of the impact of '18 actually is coming from '17, which is already
ﬂowing through.

Bloomberg Transcript

Obviously, as we indicated, PD is where the concern is. So, we're augmenting our actions
there. Just to look at some additional color there, in the quarter itself, as Louis mentioned,
earned rates were up 5.3% in the quarter. So, there continues to be strong momentum.
Written rates were also up as well.
As Charles indicated, when we look at our prospective quality measures, we're looking at
an extra 1 to 2 points of improvement coming in terms of improvements of quality of the
portfolio. So, we have lot of actions currently in play with a lot of strong momentum, but
obviously, the focus remains on the trends around PD. That's where we will continue to
focus our eﬀorts, and obviously, Patrick in the claims team as well.
In terms of additional rate actions in 2018, we are expecting a further 5% increase in rates
in 2018. So, this clearly will also give good momentum into 2019 as well. With respect to
our 2018 plans for rate increases, we've already received approval for additional rate
increases already to-date in 2018, and we have a number of further ﬁlings currently with
regulators for approval and we'll continue to evaluate and apply for further rate increases
as necessary and as per our plans in the remaining months and quarters of 2018. So, when
we look at where our starting point is, all of our actions ﬂowing from '17, additional actions
in '18, we are conﬁdent that we expect the combined ratio to be back in mid-90s run rate
by the end of 2018.

FINAL

Yeah. Well, as Charles, you alluded to, the drivers of the cost pressure on auto physical
damage is really on the severity side. So, with -- it's coming from cars being more
sophisticated because of technology. This translates into -- parts are more costly, the
repairs is more complex and take more time. So from a claims perspective, there is quite a
few things we can do about it and we have started the actions in 2017 and continue to
focus on that and we're focusing on three pillars -- our actions on three pillars. The ﬁrst
one is better tools deployed to our claims frontline.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

I said you already answered the question.

A - Patrick Barbea

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Pardon? Sorry. Okay. I continue.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Keep going, Patrick.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick Barbea

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

So, I was saying, the ﬁrst pillar is better tools that we deployed through the claims front
line staﬀ so that we take smarter decisions around the repair process and early on.
Examples of that are faster determination, if the car would be repairable or if it has to be
declared total loss. By doing so, we reduce the cycle time and eliminate cases where we
need to tow the car more than once. Another example is enhanced body shop booking
tool, to guide our clients towards the best shops depending on the types of car and the
types of repair that needs to be performed. So that's the ﬁrst pillar.
The second one is tighter controls around the process itself, around the estimation,
around the repair process and around parts ordering, working closely with our reliant
network. And ﬁnally, beside the actual repair, there is other cost involved in physical
damage. I'm talking about rental costs, towing fees, storage and service fees, and we
have adjusted many of our processes and continue to do so to minimize the cost there.
There are signiﬁcant savings that can be done on that front as well.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Good. Thank you. So, hopefully that (Multiple Speakers) long answer.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's plenty and very appreciate that. My second question on OneBeacon, if I may switch
to that. Is that -- if you strip out the reserved charges for the quarter and the underlying is
actually running at around 93%. That has been the case for the fourth quarter -- third
quarter as well at OneBeacon. So, you're making improvement actions over there. You are
really actually at low-90s, I would say, between low-90 and mid-90s. So, why would it take
another two or three years to get there?

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, I think that there are segments in the portfolio that need work and we want to be
smart about how we go about improving those segments. There are segments in the
portfolio that have had stellar performance and clearly, that's been the case in Q4 and we
want to grow those segments. But we're new to this market, we're cautious, we love the
new team that has joined Intact with Mike Miller and his team. And I think we want to
make sure that we improve the performance of all the lines that we've chosen to focus on
and that we give growth momentum to those lines who are already operating sub-90s.
But our game plan, Kai, is, risk segmentation is one thing and focus on the number of
lines that have been operating around 100%. But we have improvements we want to bring
from a claims point of view and that will take 24, 36 months. And the other thing is
synergies, which is also part of our plan. But clearly, exiting a number of lines, two lines
that were under-performing and that we didn't have much hope of bringing to the low90s really helps the starting point. There's no doubt about that. But I don't think we're
there yet.

income, I think you guys had guided to being up above 15% in 2017. It looks like it's up
more than that nicely in the fourth quarter, up closer to 19% in 2017. What's driving that
and how should we look at distribution income going forward?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

So, go ahead, Charles.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I'll ask Louis to comment on the performance and then we'll talk strategy after. Go ahead.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Sure. So, I think we guided to north of 15% for this year, came in at 19%. So, we're happy
with those results. It's a combination of investments we've done in the past in the
brokerage network, capital deployed in that stream and as well as working on the margins
Page 11 of 28

for the brokers. So, it's really those two elements that drove this year's results. And our
view is for next year, we expect the income to grow 10% oﬀ the 2017 actual results.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

FINAL

And why did it slowdown?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Well, actually, it's interesting. It really follows EBITDA capital deployment. So, you will
have seen a bump in 2015, capital deployment hitting us -- 2016, I am sorry. And then it
scales down a bit in 2017. So the growth will follow the investments we've done in the
past. Yeah.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So, Tom, I think the way I think about growing our distribution business at this stage, there
is obviously consolidation and therefore, capital deployment, which remains pretty
healthy. It's hard to predict where that will ﬁnish because we do it deal-by-deal, when it
kind of make sense to us. But we are all out on this front and have no intentions to let go
of that activity.
And then, I think the area of upside is that, we've now reached the size in distribution,
both with BrokerLink and brokers where we have joint partnership, where we can crank up
the organic growth of these businesses. And so in 2018, there'll be not only the
consolidation activity you've seen in the past, but greater focus on organic growth in
distribution as well. And so, I have a pretty optimistic view of the growth of these
distribution operations in the coming period. And I think that the margins are very strong
and stable in that segment, and a number of initiatives to expand those margins there as
well.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. And then a follow-up question is really just with respect to net investment
income. And if we look at slide 11 of your slideshow, Louis, would the net investment
income earned in the fourth quarter be kind of representative of a reasonably good run
rate now that you've got OneBeacon?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Yeah. So, I would take care of seasonality and what I've guided to in my remarks was
really, if you take the actual ﬁscal 2017 net investment income of 432 million and add 8% -8%, 9%, that would be my best estimate for the 2018 investment income.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Because annualizing the 121 million is 484 million, which is more like 12% growth. So, is
there something in the 121 million that you're not expecting to continue?

FINAL

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

So, there's some seasonality in our investment income. So, we have dividends that may
come in one quarter over the other. So, I'm always careful on the quarterly dividend
income, and that's why our guidance annually is a bit, I would say, more reliable.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And Tom --

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

How does the rising rate environment here help? I mean the book yields, I assume on the
OneBeacon portfolio was a little bit less but your book yields went up quarter-overquarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Yes. So, that estimates that guidance we're giving for next year, would not imply any
future rate increases. We do expect a bit of upside from extending the duration of the
portfolio on the OneBeacon side. That will be helpful. But we haven't taken any upside
from the potential yield rising. Now, you remember, we talked about this at the Investor
Day last year, 100 basis points yield rise represents about 20 million of investment income
but the accrual were a three-year period roughly. So initially, it's a small impact, and then
it grows to 20 million over a three-year period. So it's really in the ﬁrst year of the rate rise
though the impact is limited.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. And is that a 100 basis point rise in a ﬁve-year?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Yes. That's where we are building.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And Tom, we'll spent time on that at the Investors Day in March where I think, Wern, our
Head of Investments will talk about that. Given the addition of OneBeacon, as Louis was
pointing out, it gives -- it aﬀords interesting opportunities to better manage our portfolio
and the asset mix. And we will put the spotlight on that and we'll be [ph] crisper about our
guidance for '18 on the investment side.

Your line is open.

Q - John Aiken

{BIO 6329080 <GO>}

Good morning. Was a little surprised to see the prior year developments in OneBeacon's
being so stark right after you closed. Can you give us a little more color as to what factors
were underpinning that, and then how do you address any concerns about the level of
reserves on a go-forward basis?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

So, thanks for the question. The Q4 activity really related to a couple of large losses that
the company incurred. As you said, we closed the balance sheet on September 28th with
our best estimates. But there were some activity in the quarter that forced us to pick up
some unfavorable development. So it's really a couple of losses, a signiﬁcant one that
we've picked up and that we could not -- that was not -- the information was not available
before hand to reserve for, so it's really the development of those cases that has triggered
the adverse development.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Plus risk margin build-up as well. And so, I think if you look forward, the adverse
development cover is pretty good shield against any meaningful adverse development in
the coming periods, so not a big source of concern there.

Q - John Aiken

{BIO 6329080 <GO>}

No, understood. We can see that in the quarter, obviously with the 25 million that Louis
referenced. And then my second question if I may, do you guys see the issues that are
occurring in personal auto, potentially spurring on additional consolidation opportunities
within the industry?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. If I go back 15, 20 years, if you wait too much to take action in automobile insurance,
it can be painful for an extended period of time. And I think there's two things that
happens. One is that if you're comfortable with your rate position, which we largely are,
your appetite to grow organically and your ability to grow organically is pretty solid. There
is more business that comes to you than you actually want. So, that's good.
And then, I mean, a number of players are heavy concentrated in auto. Our personal
automobile portfolio was only 36% of our business, we have to keep that in mind. But we
have a number of competitors who are in the 60%, 70%, 80% of their portfolio, highly
concentrated in Ontario.

One has to keep in mind that we insure one out of three vehicles in Quebec, were tilted
towards Quebec, which is a short-tail physical damage province, which has been fairly
proﬁtable over time. But I think overall, those periods of pressure in automobile insurance
have been catalyst for change in the industry and we remain opportunistic in that context
but cautious with regards to automobile insurance.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Thank you. Charles, I'm just curious, I think you all mentioned that you have gotten
the approved rate increases your need for 2018. Is that true for Ontario also? And on that
context, do you anticipate any push back because the election is coming up in '18 and
trying to achieve rate adequacy in Ontario?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think, in Ontario, it's true for one business unit and there is one business unit that is still
under discussion. I think that our track record in '17 on that front is very good, our
relationships are excellent. And this is fact-based, so I'm not overly concerned by those
approvals that are not yet in. But the bulk of what we need across the land is pretty much
in the bag at this stage. So, that is point number one.
Point number two, when it comes to elections, I think, automobile insurance is not at the
top of the list yet, of issues that Ontarians are concerned about. This might become
political and it's, in part, why when we started to notice that there were performance
issues in the third quarter of '16, we raised to get increases across the land before having
100% understanding of what was pushing the trend. Because we know that, when
capacity is an issue, it can get political, whether there's an election or not.
And then getting rates becomes a little bit diﬃcult. It's not yet an issue in the marketplace.
We're seeing signs of tightening, but we're not seeing availability issues. And it really gets
political, Brian, when you have availability issues. When you are forced to be insured by
the residual markets, which are far more expensive, so then you get into capacity issues,
aﬀordability issues and so on. We're not in that stage. It's not to say that it won't get
political, but I wouldn't say that there is a red light on that at this stage.

Great. And then just curious, so down south of the border here, we've seen some big
improvements in claims frequency trends in auto insurance for the last couple of quarters,
which really helped drive proﬁtability for industry. I'm curious, what are you seeing up in
Canada from a claims frequency perspective?

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Claims frequency is ﬂat. And claims frequency, if you leave weather aside, has been ﬂat -largely ﬂat for the past -- a couple of years. And so we're not seeing improvements in
frequency but overall, fairly stable. So the whole distracted driving theme that everybody
is talking about, of course, is real, but we're not seeing an increase in frequency. And
indeed in the US, we're now starting to see for a few months, improvements in frequency.
Patrick, I don't know if you want to add anything there.

A - Patrick Barbea

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

No, that's really through the variations that we've seen over the past two, three years on
frequency and auto in Canada has really been linked to variations in weather.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick Barbea

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

When we neutralize for that, it's been ﬂat and then really our focus is more on severity.
The trends is on the severity side with the cost of parts. There might be a few factors. We
hear about distracted driving, but at the same time, cars are being safer. And for us at
least, the net of the two is pretty much ﬂat.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. And we've got a pretty substantial telematics base that we will work with and there
is no clear clues coming out of there at this stage.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Good morning.

FINAL

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

So, I want to try to quantify the cost inﬂation that's coming through on personal auto. So
the way I look at is, you realized 5 points of rate in Q4. But underlying current year loss
ratio was up 3 point. So, that would suggest to me cost inﬂation is running high single
digits. Is that a fair way to look at it and then, what would your expectation for cost
inﬂation be going forward over the next two or three years?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Yeah. I think when you're looking at the rates there, Paul, what we also have in play is a
little bit of a mix change happening as well, too, within the portfolio. So, when we talk a
little bit about sort of quality metrics and so forth, that's one of the things that we look for.
So, obviously, less new business, lower average premium. Because of that, the way the
retention curve is working relative to a higher rate increases.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, we obviously look to and we receive approvals on rate increases. We don't always
realize those because of the mix change. Now, those mix changes though have associated
quality metrics associated with them as well, too. So, if you don't realize the rate, you can
gain it obviously in the quality, which is what we're seeing as well, too.
When we look at trends -- relative to trends, we talk a lot about timing on AB and the BI
side, which we're comfortable with. On the PD, we are in sort of the upper single digit sort
of range from a PD standpoint. Now, obviously, a lot of our action is around taming that
trend. I think we'll expect to see some form of severity pressure moving forward, but
obviously, not to the same extent that we're seeing right now. And that will be very much
driven by not just what we're doing from a rate segments -- segmentation, risk selection
standpoint, but obviously, what Patrick is looking like to doing and has claims actions in
play right now.
So, PD obviously is only a portion of the total coverage. So, in totality, we are looking at
sort of the 3% to 4% range from a trend standpoint. We do get the beneﬁt of drift as well,
too, which is around where the vehicle ﬂeet is becoming -- is younger obviously, as
people buy new vehicles. So, we actually get a little bit of lift in premium from that
phenomenon as well, too. So, we're in the sort of 2 points to 3 points net of premium
trend range moving forward.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-on question to that would then be,
your expectation to raise rates by roughly 5% in 2018, the way I would look at that is, that
would sort of catch you up to roughly where you want to be. But I'm not sure it will get
you ahead of the curve for future cost inﬂation at 2 points to 3 points you just identiﬁed.
So, my assumption is, you are going to have take 5 plus another 2 to 3 to really maintain
the margins you want in that mid-90 level. Is that fair?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

No, Paul. I think this is where risk selection, underwriting and claims make the diﬀerence.
And so if I look at the prospective indicators that we calculate per customer across a
number of markets, if I look at the Ontario market and the Alberta market where we've
taken the more action, there is -- just in terms of risk selection and mix improvement, 2
points to 3 points more than rates in terms of prospective proﬁtability indication, if you
follow what I'm saying.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And so that is risk selection driven, primarily mix driven. I mean, just the fact that our new
business has shrunk meaningfully in relationship with the in-force. That in itself should be
a source of proﬁtability and it is non-negligible because new business tend to have a loss
ratio that is almost 20 points higher than mature business. So, when that mix shifts, you
should see a proﬁtability improvement, let alone all the other risk selection measures.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, when I look at our action plans, I think we're earning 2 points, 3 points of quality
improvement beyond the actions we have in claims. That's the ﬁrst point. And therefore, I
don't think we need 2 points, 3 points more rates to get to where we want to get. And
therefore, that's -- I think why one needs an action plan that goes beyond rates.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Understand. And then if I could just sneak one more and it would be related to
OneBeacon and the US tax reform. Maybe you can talk about some of the oﬀsets to that
tax that will be applied for captive reinsurance premiums.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. So, two questions. We're not going to answer, just kidding. I will ask Louis to take
this one.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Sure. So, I mentioned negligible impact overall, two oﬀsets. So, the rate reduction is
positive to the income in US. The fact that we will have more income in the US enables us
to recover taxes faster, the tax loss that we have available.
On the other hand, OneBeacon was a Bermuda-domiciled Company, had a reinsurance,
an internal reinsurance structure and that has to be unwound because it becomes
ineﬀective following the tax reform. So, that's a negative oﬀset by the lower rate, brings us
basically to a ﬂat outcome.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Your next question comes from the line of Jaeme Gloyn from National Bank Financial.
Please go ahead. Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. First question is just around some of the claims initiatives.
You spoke about tighter control on processes around estimation, repair, parts ordering.
Can you just elaborate on what you can actually do to ensure that you're getting, I guess,
a more precise process on that front?

A - Patrick Barbea

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yes. I'll give you a few examples. When we look at the technology, not all models and
makes are using the same technology. We see body shops that are getting more
specialized in some types of repairs than others. And when you can deploy to the front
line, clear indications on where to guide our clients, to get their car repaired depending
on the model, depending on the type of accident, you get signiﬁcant savings.

Bloomberg Transcript

That has evolved over time. When a few years ago, the body shops were more generalist.
You could -- you had body shops that were performing better than others from that
perspective. It's still the case, but not necessarily ﬂat across all types of repairs. So, that is
one.
The other one that I brieﬂy mentioned, but I could elaborate is there is a lot of cost in
physical damage that are outside the actual repairs. So, we're talking rentals, towing. So,
when you are able to be more eﬃcient in the repair process itself, you save signiﬁcant
portions of the cost under rentals, what we call cycle time. And we've seen already,
especially with the actions we've taken in Ontario that started earlier than the other
regions, we've seen a couple days of savings on the rental side that are helping us and
this will be -- will continue across Canada with our other actions.
The last one, I could maybe comment a bit more, the tighter controls on estimates. This
new technology involves new processes of repair. There are scanning involved that
requires diﬀerent equipment and by elevating our understanding of all those processes,
when we look at the estimates made by our body shops and by our people in the ﬁeld,
we can guide them better and save cost in the estimate itself even before we start the
repair. So, those are three areas that are already deployed and we continue to reﬁne them
across the land.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And I think that, if you look at the service center strategy, where we have deployed a
number of service centers across the land, part of the objective there is to improve the
customer experience when they bring their car to the garage or in our case, service
center. But we then are in a position to actually select where we send the car based on
performance broadly and then expertise, as Patrick, has played out.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thanks. And my next question is on the growth in the distribution. I spoke about
focus on organic growth. Can you quantify what the contribution of organic growth in
2017 of that 19%? And then how does that compare to the 10% growth outlook in 2017?
And what are some of the initiatives that you can do to help organic growth of the brokers
and BrokerLink?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So, with regards to the 19% growth, organic growth in '17 would have been in the low
single digit for our own channels, in part because Intact Insurance is an important product
of these distributors, and we've chosen to put ourselves in a less competitive position
because of what we were seeing in automobile insurance. And therefore, our distributors
were under pressure from that point of view.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think that what needs to happen is better leverage of brands and greater investments in
the brand, but certainly better leverage of the Intact brand and then the use of
technology. I think that we have made meaningful progress in leveraging online
distribution. We changed the structure of the organization late in '17 to really be able to
crank up our digital arm and obviously, our broker partners would be key beneﬁciaries of
greater focus on online distribution.
So, these are just two examples of areas of opportunities for organic growth. And I think,
when you look at a distributor that has options on the shelves, that is massive, that can
invest in technology and brand. You have a platform that over time should be able to
deliver organic growth well north of mid-single digit. We're not there and we're saying we
need to focus on that in '18.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Okay. So the 10% would be another low single-digit type organic growth with acquisitions
making up the balance?

Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Meny Grauman

{BIO 15238080 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. You talked about Ontario politics, but just a follow-up. Curious about
your interpretation of the document that was published in early December, the Fair Auto
Insurance Plan and when you read that, what were the implications that you understood
for your business in particular?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So the Fair Auto Insurance Plan that you're referring to, I think is a string of
recommendations to improve the product in Ontario, which we very much support. It
makes a whole lot of sense to move away from cash settlement awards care [ph] to
establish more rigorous assessment network.
I'll let Patrick give his perspective on this, but we view this as positive. I think it's important
to keep in mind that our action plan and our view on where the performance is going is
not dependent on future reforms or any expectations that government will bring a
speciﬁc contribution to this issue. I do think that with regards to psychological injuries and
accident beneﬁts, government can contribute if they choose to, but our action plan
certainly does not depend on them.

A - Patrick Barbea

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Fully agree. There were quite a few reforms in Ontario addressing those kinds of injuries
in the past few years. The most recent ones in June are starting already to show signs that
they will be producing the impact we're expecting, especially the catastrophic impairment
deﬁnition. This new Fair Auto Insurance Plan is following recommendations that were part
of the Marshall Report, in which we participated and commenting with industry. So, those
changes are also, in my view positive and we will continue to contain the costs around -especially the costs that are around the litigation.
So, having clear treatment plan and assessment centers being created. The next steps are,
there will be a panel in the coming weeks or months before the election, created to the -for the enactment and to guide the enactment of those changes. But overall, everything
that has been put on paper seems to be positive.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. And I think, to Brian's earlier question, given there is an action and given this report
was put on the table recently, I mean, the hopes of seeing anything on that front before
the election, I think is very small as far as I'm concerned.

Hi. Good morning. My ﬁrst question is, I know it's a small part of your business, but there
has been some news out here on ICBC with ﬁnancial issues. Some of the changes that
were announced yesterday and then you've also got the new Liberal leader talking about
maybe re-investigating whether or not we need to open it up to competition you share. I
just wanted your thoughts on the developments that we've had out in BC?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, I think that this is something we look at with interest. I think one of the key
ingredients of what was put on the table by -- in BC in the past few days has been the
introduction of a cap on pain and suﬀering award for minor injury. We think this is a great
idea. This is what the private markets have done 18 or 16 years ago.
So, it's good that BC sees this as a solution. We're operating in BC. We have a platform in
BC. We're cautious in that marketplace. But I think that there is no doubt in my mind that
competition, all else being equal would put far more options on the table for BC
consumers.
And if you look at automobile insurance, where companies produce billions of diﬀerent
price points, if you have 5, 10, 15 companies or even 20 companies like it is in private
markets, the odds of ﬁnding a better deal if you are a consumer are very, very high. And I
think that people would be advised to introduce competition, in particular in a period
where there is lot of pressure. So, I think, this -- not counting on that, obviously, but we
have a platform there. We will remain open to opportunities. And it's clear that
competition gives far more options and room for better deals for drivers.

Thanks. Just my second question is, in your MD&A, you made reference to upcoming
legalization of cannabis and that there is going to potentially be some impacts for various
lines of your business. Wondering if you can maybe give some of your thoughts as to how
that will impact? How you look underwrite and price that business that would be
impacted.

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Yes. I mean, obviously, we're watching very closely in terms of some of the experience
coming out of the US, where we actually have seen some pressure from a frequency
standpoint. So to the extent that we start to see potential pressure around the rate of car
accidents and so forth, we will be -- we can move relatively quickly on that.
We're very active in terms of -- with IBC and talking with governments around the policing
and so forth of cannabis usage and bringing a lot of parallels, obviously back to use of
alcohol relative to driving as well, too.
So, trying to put a lot of pressure on -- in terms of -- to ensure that level enforcement is
there relative to cannabis use, like it is around the use of alcohol. But it's the ﬁre, obviously
that we are watching very, very closely.

Your next question comes from the line of Mario Mendonca from TD Securities. Please go
ahead. Your line open.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Good afternoon. I'll try to be quick. Louis, the 25 million you referred to on OneBeacon, is
that your estimate of the gross PYD, taking into account -- adding back the reinsurance?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

That's right.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

That's what -- those are the losses that we incurred in ceded and then, take 20% of that as
being our share.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

I understand. So, there is still potential for some kind of recovery. Do I have the right that - because there is clearly more than 4 points. You are at 4.6, but to get to 25, it clearly

Page 23 of 28



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

wouldn't be 4.6, it would be more like 2%. So, what is that amount that can be recovered
once you hit your attachment point?

FINAL

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

So, let me be clear. The 4.6 here, half of it is our share, that's same as 20%. And the other
half is basically the risk margin, plus the impact of discounting the ceded losses. And so
that explains basically the other half, and this discounting is a big share because the time
at which we will recover those ceded losses is further out in the future, once we've begun
paying or exceeding the attachment point.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Okay. I think I misunderstood than originally. So, that is time value of money discounting,
not some other forms of discount?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Absolutely .

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Okay. That's understood.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Okay. And then going back to personal auto really quickly, the -- is there a change in your
outlook? Because I was always under the impression that you are expected to get to the
mid-90s in 2018, not at the end of 2018. Am I putting too ﬁne a point in? Was it always sort
of the end of 2018?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. That's sort of how we view it, Mario. I think we're aiming to earn all these
improvements to be solidly there by the end of the year. It might be a bumpy ride as we
get there, but it is -- you have to think about it as earned in the last part of '18. That's our
view today.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

But has that view changed or is that always been your view?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

It has changed last quarter when we talked about it, but I think it's largely been our view. I
think if we changed our view, we'd be pretty clear about it.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Then ﬁnally, and I know this is an imperfect way of looking at it. But I often look at
your direct written premiums on personal auto divided by the written insured -- number of
written insured risks, and try to use that as a gauge for pricing increases. And again, I
know it's not perfect, but that's only up 1% year over year. Is there something else that's
keeping that number from showing the signiﬁcant price increases you're putting in place?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. So, there is a mix change, which is -- the earned mix change in the quarter was 4%,
going the other way. I mean, that's essentially the reconciling item, Mario. So, where is this
mix change coming from? Well, you've got, for instance, the fact that there is less new
business in relationship with the overall portfolio coming and the fact that the areas that
are unproﬁtable have a higher average premium and our success where we're hitting
hard is obviously much less, plus a number of other risk selection strategies that we have
in place. And I think, our view is that this mix change on top of the rate change is not
diluting premium. It should expand proﬁtability, if your risk selection strategy is a good
one.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

So, would I be right in saying that, on a mix-neutral basis, that ratio I play around with
would be up above 4%?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Young from Desjardins Capital Markets.
Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Good afternoon. Just back to personal auto, Charles, I think historically, you said you
expected 3 points to 4 points improvement just from rate increases as that earns through
2018. Is that changed? And I'm just wondering what level of cost inﬂation you're baking
into that assumption?
And then the second part of the auto question is just, there was a mention of -- you are
able to direct clients to certain body shops as a way to save costs. I thought that's
something that Intact had already been doing. I will leave it there.

A - Charles Brindamour

Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

FINAL

Yeah. So, we are earning 5 points of rates today and we are writing 5 points of rates and
there are few more rate increases coming in '18. So, both the earned and the written in '18
will be above 3 points to 4 points. It should be at least 5 points, sitting here today. With
regards to body shop, indeed, it is something that we've been doing historically. Patrick,
maybe you want to comment on that?

A - Patrick Barbea

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yeah. The diﬀerence, Doug, is in the -- up to sometime in 2017, our models to guide
clients towards body shop are to oﬀer our best -- our Rely Network was based on
proximity, service and overall performance of the shop, which is still part of the model.
But with 300,000 car repairs that we do across the land at Intact, so that's 25,000 a
month. It's a huge database on which we have all the details on the parts ordering, the
process performed and we started to data-mine all of that data in much more detail
starting last year and implement those speciﬁcs into our tools. So, we don't only taking
into account the overall performance of the shop, but also the types of repairs, the makes
and models of cars to guide them to the most performing shops.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. And Doug, I think if you look at the history here, so we put in place those preferred
provider networks, I don't know, 15 years ago, something like that. Where today about
60% of automobile repairs, 66% would be in the preferred provider network called the
Rely Network and then in home insurance, we are around 70% roughly. And so initially,
historically, we encouraged our clients to go to the Rely Network. That was the ﬁrst phase
of pitching the network.
Then over time, we made sure that within the network, we directed customers where
quality was the highest, and then we've introduced the notion of availability and
proximity, so that we would shrink the cycle time. And I think, we're taking this process
now up a notch further, taking into account the physical damage trends that we're seeing
in, and a number of the elements that Patrick has been talking about. So yes, we've been
at it for a long time. Our thought process has evolved. And I think as I said, the service
centers, which we've rolled out in the past two years, I think is the ultimate sort of supply
chain, not the ultimate, but certainly a good step forward in terms of supply chain
management in that regard.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

And Charles, just on the 5 points of earned rates, when I think of how that rolls through
the combined ratio, are you assuming cost inﬂation stays where it is today? Are you
assuming within that there is some beneﬁt you're getting on the claim side?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

We're not -- I shouldn't say that beside, Patrick, but we're not baking in, in our view of
what we need in rates, major improvements in claims, right. Because this is operationally
far more diﬃcult to drive than increasing your rates, for instance, or changing your risk

selection mechanism. We'll act on it. I'm pretty comfortable we'll get the beneﬁts, but
we're not pricing for that.

Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Great. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. So, two quick questions. First, if I
understand correctly, the mid-90s combined ratio for auto by the end of next year
assumes a lower than normal level of new business and the associated penalty. How long
will it take until you can be at the mid-90s with -- I guess, whatever normalized level of
new business is? Is that another year?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No, I think that we're seeing a market tightening. We think that this will normalize likely in
the latter part of the year. And therefore, we're not really counting on less new business to
achieve the target that we have laid out. I have highlighted this -- I have highlighted this
as one reason why the mix to Mario's earlier question, was down 4%. It's not baked in as a
sustainable strategy because we would shrink to glory if that was the case.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful and better than I thought. Second question. So the -- what sort of the
adverse development in OneBeacon this quarter was the discounts associated with the
recoverables. Does that mean that, going forward, if there is no change to growth
reserves that the unwind of that discount will show up as positive reserve development in
that segment?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Yes. That's what we can expect. Yeah.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Is there anyway to quantifying that on a quarterly basis?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Page 27 of 28



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

Date: 2018-02-07

At this point, I think I would say it's probably not very material and it's -- because it's over
a long time. The duration of that ceded loss is fairly long. So, I don't think it would be very
material quarterly.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.
