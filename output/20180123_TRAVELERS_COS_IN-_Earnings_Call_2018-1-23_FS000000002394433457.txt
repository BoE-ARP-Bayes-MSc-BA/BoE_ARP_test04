{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Thank you, Gabby. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. This
morning, we reported fourth quarter core income of $633 million, generating a core
return on equity of a little over 11%. That brings our full year core income to $2.043 billion
and full-year core return on equity to 9%. The fact that we were able to generate that
level of profit and profitability, given the extraordinary catastrophe losses for the industry
this quarter and year, on top of a decade of historically low interest rates and several
years of a relatively soft pricing environment, speaks to the earnings power of the
franchise. It's the value of our competitive advantages, starting with underwriting
excellence and investment expertise.
For the year, catastrophe losses were manageable, and we generated an after-tax
underlying underwriting gain in excess of $1.2 billion and after-tax net investment income
Page 2 of 28

FINAL

of nearly $1.9 billion. Our results and strong balance sheet enabled us to grow adjusted
book value per share by 4% during the year after returning $2.2 billion of excess capital to
our shareholders. And as I'll share in a minute, we're encouraged about the outlook for
2018.
Overall, we were pleased with our underlying combined ratio of 92.6% for the year, which
was impacted by high levels of non-cat weather and non-cat fire-related losses relative to
our expectations. Underneath that, our commercial businesses continued to perform well.
For the year, Business Insurance delivered a strong underlying combined ratio of 94.9%.
Bond & Specialty Insurance delivered an impressive underlying combined ratio of 83.2%,
even after a charge in the fourth quarter for a single surety loss outside the United States.
In Personal Insurance, we were pleased with an underlying combined ratio in the quarter
of 90.4%, bringing the full year to 91.5%. Those results reflect continued success in our
leading property business, loss trends in personal auto within expectations, and the
continued successful execution of the pricing and underwriting actions we've been taking
in the auto business all year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Notably, our consolidated expense ratio was down 80 basis points for the year as we
grew earned premium by almost 5%, continued to invest in the strategic initiatives we
discussed with you at our recent Investor Day and delivered on our objective of improving
productivity and efficiency, which resulted in about flat G&A expense dollars.
Turning to the top line, we were very pleased with the success of our marketplace
execution, which resulted in full year net written premium growth of 5% to a record $26.2
billion. Importantly, in domestic Business Insurance in the quarter, renewal rate change
reached 1.4 points, doubling from the third quarter and renewal premium change reached
4 points. For both measures, that's the highest levels in about three years.
Brian will give you more texture on the execution underneath the headlines, including a
view by line, but I'll note that we achieved renewal rate gains in the quarter more broadly
across our product portfolio and our accounts compared to recent periods. It's an
acceleration of a trend and improved pricing we've achieved over the past six quarters as
the market started to reacting to two things: First, the hurricanes and wildfires in the back
half of the year; and second, and more significant in my view, declining margins generally
as interest rates remained at historically low levels and loss trend has outpaced rate and
exposure for a few years now.
As we've been doing all year and as I reiterated last quarter, we'll continue to seek rate
thoughtfully and in close coordination with our agent and broker partners with the belief
that our customers are well served by a stable and predictable market that keeps pace
with inflation as opposed to more dramatic price swings of the past. Given our sense of
the market and the fact that retentions remain at historic highs, we're encouraged.
Aside from the pricing environment, new business and domestic Business Insurance was
up in the quarter and for the year. We explained at our recent Investor Day that a number

Page 3 of 28



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2018-01-23

FINAL

of the initiatives we have underway are designed to create more top line opportunities
for us. It's still early days, but what we can see so far is positive.
Our marketplace execution in both Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance was
equally successful. In our management liability business, we maintained retention at an
impressive 88% throughout the year with stable renewal premium change and higher new
business volume. Surety premium was higher both in the quarter and for the year as a
result of an increase in large bond activity.
Personal Insurance finished the year with another quarter of accomplishing our objectives
of improving auto profitability while maintaining momentum in our leading homeowners
business. We achieved 11 points of renewal premium change in auto, enough to offset the
bodily injury severity we identified in the second half 2016 on a written basis, and
delivered policy in force growth throughout the year in our homeowners business.
As it relates to the market generally, there's been a lot of speculation about how
corporate tax reform will impact pricing. Stepping back, we price our products with return
objectives in mind. The tax rate is just one factor impacting the pricing we need to achieve
in order to reach our return objectives.

Bloomberg Transcript

Other factors, for example, include the adequacy of expiring prices, loss trends,
expenses, the cost of reinsurance, the impact of claims initiatives and so on. Speaking for
us, tax reform will help shrink the gap between where returns are trending and where
we'd like them to be trending but it doesn't completely close the gap.
Also not every participant in the marketplace will benefit from tax reform. And even
among those who do, the extent of the benefit varies. In short, for us, tax reform helps
but we still have ground to cover.
As I said a minute ago, we're encouraged about the outlook for 2018. We're well
positioned to benefit from continued improvement in the pricing environment, the
opportunities afforded by a more level playing field for domestic insurers as a result of tax
reform and the prospect of a strengthening economy.
With that wind at our backs and from a position of strength, we'll continue to invest in our
competitive advantages, focusing on extending our lead in risk expertise, improving the
experience for our customers, agents and brokers and enhancing productivity and
efficiency. We believe we're well positioned to continue to create shareholder value.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay.

Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Thanks, Alan. Core income was $633 million, down from $919 million in the prior year
quarter while core ROE was 11.1%, down from 16.4%. As has been the case all year, these

Page 4 of 28



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2018-01-23

reductions in core income and core ROE were not driven by changes in our underlying
performance.

FINAL

Our underlying performance remains strong and actually improved over the prior year
quarter, rather these reductions were reflective of a continued high level of cat activity
and the inclusion of an $82 million after-tax benefit in the prior year quarter from the
settlement of a reinsurance dispute.
The strength of our underlying underwriting results is evidenced by our consolidated
underlying combined ratio of 92.4%, similar to the 92% we produced in the prior year
quarter. Cat losses were $324 million after-tax compared to only $89 million in the prior
year quarter.
This $235 million increase was driven by losses from the California wildfires, a $426 million
after-tax, comprising $382 million after-tax for the October wildfires in Northern California
and $44 million after-tax for the December wildfires in Southern California, partially offset
by current year net favorable development of $102 million after-tax for catastrophes that
occurred earlier this year, almost all of which related to the third quarter hurricanes
Harvey, Irma and Maria.

Bloomberg Transcript

For both Harvey and Irma, the benefits of our underwriting actions over many years,
including management of overall exposure, limits and deductibles, resulted in more
favorable claim outcomes than we had expected.
For Maria, given that the storm occurred late in the third quarter and access to the
impacted areas was extremely limited, our estimate was based on an exposure analysis.
That initial estimate has come down due to our receiving fewer claims than we had
expected.
Net favorable prior year reserve development, for which I'll provide more details shortly,
was $192 million after-tax, up from $172 million in the prior year quarter. Net investment
income of $467 million after-tax, while continuing to be strong, was down $26 million from
the prior year quarter.
Non-fixed income NII decreased by $19 million after-tax due to lower private equity
returns, which, although strong, were not as strong as in the prior year quarter. Fixed
income NII, as anticipated, was lower by $8 million after-tax due to the continued low
interest rate environment.
And taking into account long-term bonds that are scheduled to mature in 2018, growth in
the size of our fixed income portfolio, higher short-term interest rates in the new U.S. tax
law, we expect that after-tax fixed income NII for 2018 will be $25 million to $30 million
higher quarter-over-quarter as compared to corresponding quarters in 2017, a significant
improvement from recent years.

FINAL

Relative to what several other companies have disclosed, the passage of the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act of 2017 had a relatively modest impact on our fourth quarter results. A $129
million charge reported as part of net income. This charge resulted mostly from revaluing
our net-deferred tax asset as of the enactment date using the new 21% tax rate and to a
lesser extent, providing for taxes on the deemed repatriation of our foreign earnings.
I should also mention that we executed some tax-related actions in the fourth quarter that
provided real economic benefits while having an insignificant impact on fourth quarter
2017 core and net income, but slightly increasing our fourth quarter consolidated
combined ratio primarily through the expense ratio by about 0.5 points.
Under the new tax law, muni bond investment income will continue to be taxed at 5.25%,
while all other US-based income will be taxed at 21% rather than 35%. So looking forward,
you should update your models.

Bloomberg Transcript

Consolidated net favorable prior-year reserve development was $293 million pre-tax
compared to $264 million in the prior-year quarter. Business Insurance's net favorable
reserve development was $244 million pre-tax compared to $221 million in the prior-year
quarter, primarily driven by better than expected loss experience and domestic workers'
comp and commercial multi-peril, partially offset by higher than expected loss experience
in domestic commercial auto.
Bond & Specialty's net favorable development was $42 million pre-tax compared to $79
million in the prior quarter, primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in
domestic management liability, while Personal Insurance had net favorable development
of $7 million pre-tax compared to $36 million of net unfavorable development in the prior
year quarter.
For full year 2017, we had consolidated net favorable development of $592 million pre-tax.
As in prior years, I'm providing you with some insight into what our combined 2017
Schedule P is expected to show when filed on May 1. Excluding A&E, on a combined stat
Schedule P basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years across all product lines in the
aggregate developed favorably, and except for commercial auto liability, which
developed unfavorably by $87 million pre-tax due to higher than expected bodily injury
claims in recent accident years, all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate
developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development.
Page 19 of the webcast sets forth information about our January 1 cat treaty renewal. Our
Corporate Cat Aggregate XOL Treaty continues to provide coverage for both single-cat
events and an accumulation of losses from multiple cat events with similar terms as in the
prior year, but at a slightly higher cost.
The treaty continues to provide $1.5 billion of coverage, part of $2 billion excess of $3
billion after a $100 million deductible per occurrence. It keeps the same broad peril and
geographic coverage and the same positioning of the coverage layer, providing a
significant buffer between earnings and capital. The treaty has a single limit with no

Page 6 of 28



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2018-01-23

reinstatement provisions and note that the total cost of this treaty and therefore the slight
cost increase are quite small in relation to our core income.

FINAL

Fourth quarter operating cash flows, which were impacted by the relatively high level of
cat claim payments, were $538 million, bringing total operating cash flow to over $3.7
billion for the year. We ended the year with holding company liquidity of almost $1.3 billion
and all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels.
Net unrealized investment gains were over $1.4 billion pre-tax or $1.1 billion after-tax, up
from $1.1 billion and $0.7 billion respectively at the beginning of the year, while book value
per share of $87.46 and adjusted book value per share of $83.36, increased 5% and 4%
respectively from the beginning of the year.
Consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy and despite the high level of
cat losses, we were able to return $549 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter
while maintaining our balance sheet strength through dividends of $198 million and share
repurchases of $351 million, bringing total capital return to shareholders to over $2.2 billion
in 2017.
And with that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian.

Brian William MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Thanks, Jay. Starting with this quarter's results in Business Insurance, segment income was
strong at $637 million, and the combined ratio for the quarter of 88.6% was flat to the
prior year. Income was down from the prior year, due primarily to the settlement of a
reinsurance dispute in the fourth quarter of 2016.
The underlying combined ratio for both the quarter and the full year was about 1 point
higher than 2016. In both cases, the increase was driven by the loss ratio with loss cost
trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing, while the full-year variance also reflects an
unusually high number of large non-cat fire losses in 2017.
The full-year expense ratio of 31.9% was 0.5 points lower than the prior year. As Jay
mentioned, the fourth quarter included the impact of some tax-related actions to the full
year as a better indication of our expense run rate.
Net written premiums of $3.4 billion for the quarter were up about 5% year-over-year with
domestic net written premiums up about 4% driven by continued strong production
results in Middle Market. International net written premiums were up 15%, or 11% excluding
the impact of the change in foreign currency rates. The growth in international was driven
by strong production results in Europe and Canada, along with some normal fluctuations
in the Lloyd's volume.
Turning to domestic production, we were very pleased with our results in the quarter.
Renewal rate change was 1.4%, and renewal premium change was 4%, and as Alan said,
Page 7 of 28

Company Ticker: TRV US Equity

FINAL

for both, the highest level in about three years. Retention remained at a historically high
level of 85%, and new business was strong for the quarter at $478 million, up 16% from
the fourth quarter of 2016.
Looking at the individual businesses, in Select, production remained strong with renewal
premium change for the quarter of over 5%, retention of 83%, and new business
premiums of $100 million, up 11% year-over-year. In Middle Market, renewal rate change
increased to 1.5%, up about 1 point year-over-year, and renewal premium change
increased to 3.6%. Retention remained at a historically high level of 87%, while new
business premiums of $298 million were up 17% versus the prior year quarter.
In terms of new business, the technology, tools and process changes we've been rolling
out over the last several years, and we discussed at our recent Investor Day, have allowed
us to be more active in our targeted industry segments. In Select, we're generating more
submissions and quotes and having success in closing those incremental opportunities.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Middle Market, we've been successful in quoting more while also closing more large
accounts than a year ago. While the normal volatility in writing large accounts was a factor
in this quarter's growth, we believe our initiatives are beginning to have an impact.
So the aggregate production results were very strong but as we have said many times,
the aggregate numbers alone don't tell the entire story. The detail of where we are
getting rate and what accounts we are retaining is key to evaluating the success of our
execution. And looking at the results below the headline numbers, we couldn't be more
pleased. For example, as you would expect, there was significant line of business texture
below the headline production numbers.
In terms of pricing, workers' compensation, a line that has had strong returns in recent
periods, had renewal premium change that was positive but lower than a year ago.
Conversely, commercial auto, which is a challenge from a return perspective line, had the
highest positive price change in the quarter well above loss trends.
What's also encouraging to us is that across all of the other major product lines, property,
GL, CMP and umbrella, renewal premium change was positive and up both year-over-year
and sequentially. And importantly, we were able to achieve these pricing increases while
maintaining strong retention and growing new business.
There was also a significant texture based on individual account performance. We
continued to be pleased that we are retaining our best-performing business as evidenced
by retention rates in excess of 90% for our best-performing Middle Market accounts.
In addition, pricing in the quarter improved across the continuum of Middle Market book,
most significantly in our poor performing accounts, where we achieved rate increases well
in excess of loss trends.

FINAL

Finally, in addition to what we're seeing in the numbers, we're also encouraged that there
has been some tightening of terms and conditions for catastrophe-exposed risks. So, all
in, a great quarter and end to the year. We were very pleased with our execution in the
marketplace and how we are positioned for continued success in 2018.
Before turning to Bond & Specialty, I want to comment on our outlook for operating
margins, which we include in our quarterly filings. Since our 10-K won't be filed for a few
weeks, I would note that we expect underlying underwriting margins in 2018 will be higher
than in 2017. And the underlying combined ratio will be slightly lower than in 2017,
assuming lower and more normalized levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses
and other loss activity. This is subject to the usual caveats and forward-looking statement
disclaimers.
In Bond & Specialty Insurance, segment income for the quarter was $112 million, down
from the prior year quarter due to the international surety charge that Alan mentioned as
well as a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development.
In surety, losses are episodic, and we remain pleased with the quality of our book. The
underlying combined ratio increased from the prior year quarter to 91.1%, reflecting the
impact of the surety charge.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net written premiums for the quarter were up 5% reflecting growth in both our domestic
surety and management liability businesses. Surety growth was driven by a higher level of
large bond activity in the quarter.
Turning to production, in our domestic management liability businesses, we continue to
execute our strategy of growing our profitable portfolio by retaining our best-performing
accounts and writing new business in return adequate product segments.
So we couldn't be more pleased that retention came in at a strong 88% for the quarter,
while new business was up 17% from the fourth quarter of last year. Renewal premium
change of 3.4% was up slightly from the third quarter. So Bond & Specialty results were
solid, and we continue to feel great about our market position.
In terms of outlook, for 2018, we expect that underlying underwriting margins and the
underlying combined ratio for the first nine months of 2018 will be broadly consistent with
the same period of 2017. And in the last quarter of 2018, we expect that underlying
underwriting margins will be higher, and the underlying combined ratio will be lower than
in the same period of 2017.
Turning to Personal Insurance, net-written premiums for the segment grew 8% in the
quarter, driven by higher pricing, primarily in auto and modest PIF growth primarily in
homeowners.
Catastrophe losses in the quarter were approximately $200 million after-tax above both
prior year and our normal expectations, resulting in a $50 million loss for the quarter and a
Page 9 of 28



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2018-01-23

combined ratio of 108.7%.

FINAL

For the full-year, despite pre-tax cat losses of more than $1 billion, Personal Insurance
generated $128 million of income. The underlying combined ratio in the fourth quarter of
90.4% improved by 3.2 points compared to last year's fourth quarter. And the full year
underlying combined ratio of 91.5% was about 0.5 points higher than full year 2016.
The domestic agency auto combined ratio for the quarter was 103% including a 1.1-point
benefit from catastrophe losses as we reduced our auto estimate related to Hurricane
Harvey. The underlying combined ratio of 104.1% improved by 8.1 points from the prior
year.
As you can see on page 15 of the webcast, 4.7 points of the decrease is due to last year's
fourth quarter having been elevated as a result of the year-to-date impact of the bodily
injury loss reestimation. The remainder of the improvement is primarily of the result of
earned rate from filing actions we have taken over the past year now exceeding loss
trend by several points, in line with the planned actions we outlined a year ago. I would
remind you that seasonality inflates the absolute value of the fourth quarter combined
ratio.

Bloomberg Transcript

As we have continued to take actions to improve profitability in the auto book, renewal
premium change increased to 10.6% in the fourth quarter. Retention declined modestly as
expected, given the pricing actions. And PIF growth has levelled out, again in line with our
plans.
We were pleased with the level of written rate in 2017, and looking ahead, we expect that
full year RPC for 2018 will be broadly consistent with the full year 2017 result as we look to
continue to improve the profitability of the book.
Turning to Agency Homeowners & Other, the fourth quarter combined ratio of 115.3%
included over 45 points from cat losses, driven by the wildfires in California. The
underlying combined ratio of 70.2% for the quarter was consistent with the prior year
quarter, as higher non-cat weather losses were basically offset by an improvement in the
expense ratio.
For the full year, the abnormally high cat result of 23.6 points drove the combined ratio up
to 100.7%, while the underlying combined ratio of 77.1% was about 1.5 points above the
prior year due primarily to higher non-cat weather losses.
Homeowners volume continued to exhibit momentum with healthy PIF growth throughout
the year finished up 5.5% compared to the prior year-end. We're pleased that our focus
on generating growth in this product line has enabled us to steadily increase property PIF
count, even as we have intentionally slowed the PIF growth in auto. We're also pleased to
have introduced our newest property product, Quantum Home 2.0 in three pilot states
during the fourth quarter with initial response from agents and customers in line with our
expectations.

FINAL

Overall, in Personal Insurance, while the headlines were all about the significant
catastrophe losses, we feel great about having achieved the goals we have established
entering 2017. In addition, we continued our ongoing expense discipline, which resulted in
slightly lower G&A expenses while delivering 9% growth in net written premiums for the
segment, reducing the full year expense ratio by 1.5 points. So for Personal Insurance in
2017, we were very pleased with the execution on the key elements needed to position
this segment for success in 2018.
Finally, as it relates to our outlook for the Personal Insurance segment as a whole, we
expect underlying underwriting margins in 2018 will be higher than in 2017 and the
underlying combined ratio will be slightly lower than in 2017.
So stepping back to the enterprise, we generated over $2 billion in profits in the year that
was dominated by the impact of weather and large losses. So we feel good about the
result, but more importantly, feel great about the execution across all our businesses and
our market position entering 2018.
With that, let me turn it back over to Gabby.

Thank you. Before we go to the Q&A portion, Alan has a few additional words.

Bloomberg Transcript

Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Thanks, Gabby. As bittersweet as it is, we have one last piece of business before we
open it up for questions. I just want to acknowledge and thank Brian MacLean who will be
retiring at the end of March after a spectacular 30-year career and after today, something
like 53 consecutive earnings calls. He'd never take credit for it, but we owe so much of
what we've accomplished over so many years to him. He's been a great colleague to so
many and he's been an important partner and friend to me. Thank you, Brian.
And with that, Pema, let's open it up for questions.

Certainly, sir. One moment, please, for your first question. Our first question comes from
the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.

Q - Kai Pan

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

And that doesn't count as a question. So my first question -- my first one is on pricing. So
there's an acceleration of BI pricing and you mentioned that your outlook for 2018 in BI is a
lower underlying combined ratio. But the 1.4% increase, do you lower your, like, general
loss cost trend of 3% to 4%. Just wondering sort of what's behind the scene. You expect
sort of the pricing to accelerate?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. Kai, good morning. It's Alan. Thanks for the question. It's all the things that we talk to
you about quarter-over-quarter in terms of our ability to pull levers and manage
profitability. And I'll remind you that exposure is a piece of that, and that a significant
portion of exposure contributes to it but so does selection and mix in the way we
segment, in the way we price the product, claims handling, risk control, expense
management, all of those things contribute to our outlook on profitability and the
underlying combined ratio.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Then my follow-up is on the tax rate. What's your sort of overall effective tax rate
for the corporation in 2018? And, Alan, from your comments, it looks like most of the tax
benefit will flow through to the bottom line.

This is Jay Benet. The reason I gave you the pieces is that the effective tax rate is always
going to be a function of the relationship of the tax exempt interest to the total interest.
So in whatever modeling you're doing, you need to come up with what you believe the
tax exempt interest is going to be, apply a 5.25% tax rate to that. And then everything
else that's U.S. domestic will be at the 21% range. So the effective tax rate is going to
move but again, that's the way of calculating it.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Hey, Kai, just reflecting back on your other question, you were talking about the pricing
outlook. And I would just remind you that as Brian shared with you, that assumes that in BI,
the non-cat weather and elevated fire losses and for that matter, in PI, that non-cat
weather will both return to normal levels by historical standards. Obviously, weather and
large losses are going to be what they're going to be, but the outlook reflects that as
well.
And in terms of the benefit from tax reform and what's going to happen to it, as I tried to
express in my prepared remarks, it goes into the mix of everything else that we used to
generate the prices we need. So, yeah, I do think that it will fall to the bottom line.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Hey, thanks. Just for Alan and a follow-up to Kai's question. Just thinking about the fact
that last quarter we had a 2018 outlook for broadly consistent margins and now three
months later, the outlooks do improve. I just wanted to drill down a little further on what it
is you've seen over the last three months. Because I think your outlook on pricing then
was also pretty positive. But I guess, over the last three months what's given you more
confidence to really think that margins will be better?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. You got to remember that when we talk about underwriting margins, we're talking
about dollars and in combined ratio, we're talking about, like, combined ratio points. And
that's a function of the written volume for example and everything else that goes into the
mix. So it's a combination of all the things that impact margins and the combined ratio. I'm
not sure how else to express that.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Okay. I guess, just on auto then, I think what you've said is you think that RPC will be at
similar level to this year as it was last year. And it seemed like this year it was several
points above loss trend.
If you could just talk a little bit about what you're seeing there because that sounds like a
decent amount of rate. I don't know if there's a severity uptick beyond what you've
expected or something along those lines. Thanks.

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Hey, Ryan, its Michael Klein. Thanks for the question. The short answer is no, it doesn't
reflect anything beyond what we expected. It's just the follow-on steps in our existing
game plan.
And I think when you think about pricing, sort of think of it in three pieces, right? So the
written rate we're going to achieve in 2018 is partly based on the rate we have already
filed in addition to the rate we'll file in 2018. And so that drives a lot of our rate outlook.
What I think you'll see as you look ahead to 2018 is the RPC in the first half of the year will
be higher than the numbers you see on the page from the first half of 2017. In the back
half of the year, it will be lower than the numbers you see for the back half of 2017.

Page 13 of 28

Importantly, on an earned basis, since written rate has accelerated through 2017, earned
rate will actually rise in 2018 relative to 2017. So that's sort of the way that we think about
it. But, no, the broadly consistent RPC outlook doesn't reflect anything unanticipated in our
loss experience.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks. Thanks and good morning. Maybe just staying on personal auto with Michael Klein,
you gave some good color on RPC. How should we think about the PIF growth from here,
just based on the fact that majority of your book is 12 months? When should we see some
change in that number down the road?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Amit. I appreciate the question. I think if you think about just sort of the broad
themes on auto, what we talked about in 2017, is our objective was to improve profitability
and manage growth, manage being reduced, right? As we think about our objective for
2018, it's really to try to achieve more balance between growth and profitability in auto.
And I think you can certainly see, as we talked about last quarter, we felt like we turned
the corner on auto profitability in the third quarter. You're seeing in the year-on-year
adjusted underlying combined comparison that improvement accelerating, but again,
consistent with our RPC outlook, still work to do there. And so, again, we're looking to
achieve a balance between profitability and growth in 2018. And then as that profitability
continues to improve, we'll look to resume growth. But we're right now trying to sort of
level off and then move it forward.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks. That's actually helpful. And my follow-up, switching back to, I guess, commercial
lines, and I know there was some good texture on the pricing change. I'm curious if we
were to step back and think about the active cat quarter for Q3 and Q4 and its impact on
the marketplace, would you say that it's early days for, I guess, a broad-based firming of
the small and middle commercial market, or is it more isolated? Is it more isolated nearterm?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Amit, it's Alan. We tried to give you a perspective by line to really address that because
putting workers' comp aside, and that is its own story, the price increases we were able to
achieve in the quarter were broader than just the property lines. And as I shared in my

prepared remarks, I think the more significant factor driving the pricing is where margins
were, certainly for us, and that's probably true relative to the industry. So I can't tell you
exactly what the industry's going to do or what's going to happen, but I can tell you what
we're going to do, and that's to thoughtfully and in close coordination with our agent and
broker partners continue to push for rate where we need it, improve the outlook and
trend of returns.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, thank you. Good morning. My first question, in terms of the margin outlook for Business
Insurance for next year, can you quantify the impact that non-cat weather had this year so
we know kind of what to adjust for when thinking about 2018? And in your margin outlook,
how are you thinking about the expense ratio versus the loss ratio as we think about you
potentially earning in better rate next year?

A - Gregory C. Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Hey, Elyse, this is Greg Toczydlowski from Business Insurance. In terms of your first
question, think about 1 point in terms of where large losses in non-cat weather are relative
to our longer-term expectations for 2017, and that would be a good way to think about a
going-forward perspective.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

And Elyse, on your question about expenses, we're going to try to resist the temptation
to break out the go-forward perspective on the loss ratio versus the expense ratio. We
give you an outlook on the combined ratio, at least qualitatively, because you get into
some judgments and a level of precision that is probably too further than we'd like to go,
at least for an outlook perspective.
Jay Benet did say in his opening remarks or maybe it was Brian that looking at the full year
was probably a better perspective on the outlook. And I will add, just following up on our
comments at our recent Investor Day, that productivity and efficiency are important
strategic initiatives for us. We've seen the benefit of that this year. We've got real
productivity and efficiency enhancements on the shop floor right now, and we think
there's more to come.

Page 15 of 28

Company Ticker: TRV US Equity

FINAL

And what that does for us? It's not necessarily that we're trying to dial in a much lower
expense ratio, what we're trying to do is create all the benefits that come from operating
leverage. So we can take those incremental dollars, and as I've said before, we can let
them fall to the bottom line. We can use it to invest in important strategic capabilities, or
we can put it into pricing, and it really is that flexibility that we're looking for going forward.
But in terms of the outlook, we're going to stick with the broader commentary on overall
margins.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then my second question, in terms of the pricing environment, going back to
Business Insurance again, you said in your opening remarks that you want rates to keep
pace with inflation. What are you pegging inflation at right now within your commercial
lines book? And when you make that comment, I guess that's what we should compare
when we think about the RPC going forward within Business Insurance?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. Elyse, we've said for a long time that our long-term outlook, and again, that's longterm perspective for all of Business Insurance is about 4%, and really no change on that.
There's some texture underneath, by line, for example. I'm not sure what your question
was about RPC, but rate contributes to margin, and there's a portion of exposure that's,
obviously, part of RPC that also contributes to it. So I'm not sure if that's the texture and
color you were looking for.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

I guess, what I was thinking about was your RPC was about 4% in the quarter and then
you're saying that kind of inflation is about 4%. But then to your commentary, it seems like
you are pushing for more price across your book of business from where we were at in
the fourth quarter. So I was just trying to tie those two comments together.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. So Elyse, I would say that of – think of RPC as having two components: one, pure
rate; and two, exposure. Of the piece that's exposure, a portion of that behaves like
margin, and there's a portion of it that has real loss content in it and doesn't.
So RPC needs to be above the overall loss trend in order for us to consider margins to be
expanding. And you could look at those numbers and you'd say, at least on a written basis
we're getting close.
Although I do think over time that insurance, like most other businesses, pricing ought to
keep up with inflation. But I would say that given where we are now in terms of the
outlook and trend for returns, we're looking to do a little bit better than just offset
inflation, we're looking to expand margins.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color.

Please proceed.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Good morning everybody. And thanks for taking my question. I guess, my first question is
with regards to the rate increases in Business Insurance. If I strip out commercial auto, I
think, if my calculation is correct, I get to roughly flat rates for the rest of the business. Am
I thinking about that correctly? Or are there maybe areas or lines where you are getting
more rates outside of the commercial auto?

A - Brian William MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Yeah. Yaron, yeah, I don't think you're doing the math entirely correctly. There's a lot of
different pieces underneath the net written premium change, which I think you're trying to
back into.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we're certainly, as Alan said earlier, very much focused on where some of the more
distressed lines are, automobile and the catastrophic exposed areas of property, but
we're also pushing ahead on all the products. So the math doesn't come out where we're
flat on all the other product lines.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. And I would just direct you back to Brian's comments, where he gave you a view of
pricing by line. So price is positive in every line and outside of workers' comp, higher both
sequentially and year-over-year.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

So we can follow up with you and walk you through the math if that's helpful.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Yeah, we'll do that. And then maybe one other question on tax reform, so, Alan, if I
understand your comments correctly, basically, you're looking at the results of – or you're
targeting a certain return and tax reform ends up helping that return. I'm just trying to get
a sense of are you expecting any change in investment allocation that would further boost
or decrease the effect of tax reform?

Yeah. Let me turn that over to Bill Heyman, ask him to respond to that.

FINAL

A - William Herbert Heyman

{BIO 3429455 <GO>}

I think it is possible there will be, over time, some reallocation. The elimination of
corporate AMT removed a ceiling in terms of the amount of municipals we can own
although that's very theoretical.
Every day, we look at what the market throws up in terms of, assuming roughly equal
credit quality, which is really the case, where is the highest after-tax return. I think more –
going forward that will more often in certain segments of the curve be in the taxables
rather than municipals.
It may even be that we buy taxables and sell municipals in certain parts of the curve. And
the reason for that is that for the first time I can remember, individual investors and
corporate investors have very different utility functions.

Bloomberg Transcript

So in many parts of the curve, the municipal is not worth as much to us as it used to be,
but it's worth more to an individual investor than it is to us. So there may be opportunities
to pick up after-tax yield on advantageous terms but, obviously, we can't guarantee them
or quantify them. But I suspect if you looked at the portfolio three years from now, the mix
would have changed.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler
O'Neill.

Q - Jon Paul Newsome

{BIO 3522950 <GO>}

I want to ask whether or not the outlook for M&A for Travelers has changed with tax
reform. Does it make it easier or more interesting to buy something outside of the U.S.
for Travelers?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah, good morning, Paul. What I can tell you is that tax reform for us and others who are
similarly situated, obviously, just makes us a more competitive buyer relative to a non-U.S.
taxpayer who previously had the benefit of some structural advantages – structural tax
advantages. Those advantages have gone away, so that levels the playing field. And so
relatively speaking, we're a more competitive buyer. So that's changed for sure.

Page 18 of 28



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2018-01-23

FINAL

What hasn't changed, Paul, is either our lens or our propensity to do transactions. And by
that, I mean, we are always looking for opportunities, both organic and inorganic. And
when we can make them happen on terms that are attracted to us, we're going to try
hard to do that.
And as I've said before and just to reiterate it, we're going to try to do deals when it
improves our return profile, lowers our volatility or provides us with other important
strategic benefits. So maybe our positioning relative to others changes, but our lens or
propensity doesn't.
And the other thing that won't change is our capital management strategy. We will
continue to think about and allocate capital the same way we have historically. I guess,
given tax reform and all other things being equal, there's, probably, higher earnings in
capital to put through that capital management filter. But our thought process around
capital management doesn't change.

Q - Jon Paul Newsome

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Thank you. My first question is on capital deployment in 2018. Should we still consider a
100% of operating earnings as being deployable for share buybacks and dividends
absent another opportunity emerging?

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Yeah. Hey, Jay, it's Jay. As Alan just said, the way we think about capital management
hasn't changed. So we're always going to try to fund growth. We're always going to look
for opportunities to create shareholder value. And to the extent that we continue to
create excess capital, we'll manage it the same way, returning it to shareholders through
dividends and share repurchases. And the driver of that is the earnings of the play, so no
change there. And what we've said in the 10-K and 10-Q all along with regard to that still
holds.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

I appreciate that. And then if I can try one on tax, if I – using your supplement, if I look at
the tax-free municipal income and apply the rate you mentioned, I guess I get kind of

Page 19 of 28



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The

driven down to a 15.5% to 16% overall effective tax rate. Am I in the neighborhood on
that?

FINAL

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

If the calculation you're doing is looking at the supplement, taking some view as to what
the average asset base would be for the munis, applying the rate that we show in the
supplement as the earnings rate on that, you'll get the pre-tax muni NII, apply 5.25% to
that, and you'll have that component of the tax accrual, and then the rest, whatever you're
assuming with regard to the non-muni income, not just NII but underwriting, apply the 21%
to, and you'll get an effective tax rate.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Thank you. Back-to-back Jays. A couple of questions. First is the surety premiums went up
and you said there was just more activity. I mean, do you see this being a function of the
economy? And should we expect the top line on the surety side to possibly expand,
especially if we've got more infrastructure spending?

A - Thomas M. Kunkel

{BIO 16615934 <GO>}

Jay, this is Tom Kunkel. Good morning. I think the way we're looking at the surety
production in the month is, it really can be episodic. And those are some very wellperforming businesses and accounts that we were doing that volume with. But I wouldn't
say that we, in any way, view it as indicative as an increase in activity for the type of work
that drives surety bonding. So as they say, a little lumpy.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Got it. Other question, on the commercial lines market, your effort to raise prices a bit
more aggressively has been met with a retention that has stayed at a historically high
level. It suggests the rest of the market is coming along as well. And I'm wondering if you
could speak qualitatively about what you're hearing from agents and brokers regarding
how your competitors are responding to the same pressures that you are.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Jay, it's Alan. We don't talk a lot to our distribution partners about the way our competitors
price. It's a competitive marketplace, and they do what they do, and we do what we do. I
will tell you that just in terms of our process, we do a lot of work, and we've got a lot of
talent out there in the field, and our underwriters are out talking to our distribution

Page 20 of 28

partners about accounts 90, 120 days out to make sure that we're working in partnership
with them and making sure that we're sharing with our customers why we're doing, what
we're doing. So we've got, I think, just a tremendous field organization, and I think that
they've done a great job.
Obviously, we do operate in a competitive marketplace. And so I do think that what you
see in our results is to some degree a reflection of the market. I've always thought that
there are probably two reasons that maybe we have a little bit of incremental pricing
power at. One is just the franchise value we bring to the marketplace and product
breadth and risk control and claims – unbelievable claims organization. And I think that our
agent and broker partners are proud to sell that and I think our customers see value in it.
And the other advantage, I think, we have to some degree is data and analytic s. It's
about risk selection and pricing. And we've been a pioneer for a long time in not just data
and analytics but delivering that data and analytics to the screen of the local underwriter
at the point of sale. So I do think those two things probably give us a little bit of an
advantage, but certainly there's a marketplace dynamic to what we're able to achieve.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks. Two quick questions here for you. The first one, I'm just curious, could we
parse a little bit Business Insurance as far as what's going on from a rate perspective?
And I'm just curious, one small commercial, not a lot of rate, it just doesn't need it, more
competitive pressures. And then also on your large ticket property business, that's one
that you had excluded a while from your rate calculations, which was so competitive. How
is that trending now and maybe relative to your expectation? And then I have one followup.

A - Gregory C. Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Yeah, Brian, hey, this is Greg. I'll start with the small commercial one. We've been focusing
on the small commercial business for a number of years now, really trying to get the
margins to a place where we feel very comfortable with them in.
We are very much within our target thresholds of where we want to be from a small
commercial. So we've had a deliberate set of execution around our rate plan there. So
Page 21 of 28



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2018-01-23

FINAL

that's the first element around why you see a smaller level of rate in small than middle.
The second one really is around our express business, which is, think of it as the straightthrough processing of small commercial, really has a more prescriptive like flat rating
environment. And so when we see some of the pressures of rate reductions and workers'
comp, given the extraordinary profitability on that line over time, we see that more
immediately impact that business. So those are two reasons that are driving the small
commercial.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

And on the property, large account property?

A - Gregory C. Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

What was your question on the large property? Can you repeat that?

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

I guess, just how is that – the large account property, how is that panning out from a rate
perspective right now? Is it – you're getting the rate that you kind of need in that area or
not?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gregory C. Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Yeah. Given that the hurricanes were in the third quarter, we're very pleased with our
agility one quarter in, in terms of what we've been trying to do on the National Property
side.
And as Alan said, we think franchise value matters, and we're seeing that inside our
numbers, where we've been able to push thoughtfully and at the same time, retain the
book of business.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great.

A - Brian William MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Yeah, Brian, this is Brian. Just one comment on top of that, and looking back over
significant cat events over the years, the impact in the large property book on rate is
usually two, three, even sometimes four quarters out, the peak of that. So we're
optimistic that there could be more to come, but that's just looking at the historical trends.

FINAL

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. And then just on personal lines and just on tax, I appreciate the comments on how
kind of it's going to fall to the bottom line. I guess, my question more on the personal line
space is as you look out, understand you need more rate to get to the right returns that
you really want that business, but should we expect that kind of your combined ratios,
where you'd like them to get, are going to be higher here going forward as a result of
tax?
And specifically, related to at least certain states have return on capital type benchmarks
they look at, they're going to be pushed back from those regulators on returns here with
a tax reform.

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Sure, Brian. It's Michael. Thanks for the question. I would say where you started is probably
where we start, which is we're not at target returns yet and we got work to do. I think
consistent with Alan's comments in the opening, a lower tax rate sort of helps move us
closer but doesn't get us all the way there.

Bloomberg Transcript

And so when you think about it from a filed rate and a regulatory standpoint, we certainly
see and actually have seen just this week news from some regulators on the fact that
they are thinking about the tax rate and looking to apply it in some of those conversations.
But generally speaking, it doesn't change the direction we need to move rates,
particularly in auto. We still have work to do there to get to target returns, and we're
going to continue down that path.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Right. It's just the magnitude you need going forward is probably less today than it would
have been before tax reform.

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

I would say all else being equal but, again, to Alan's point earlier, you've got expenses,
you've got loss experience, you've got investment yields, a whole bunch of things that go
into that mix, and it's just one factor that we need to consider.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. I don't know if I'm over thinking this but I guess I was surprised that the outlook for
2018 for Personal Insurance was only a slightly lower combined ratio with auto earned
rates likely to approach double digits. Am I missing something there?

FINAL

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Meyer, this is Michael. Thanks for the question. And appreciate it because Brian did give
you the overall outlook for the segment. There's a little bit of texture underneath. So if
you think about auto specifically, when you see the 10-K outlook, what you're going to see
is our commentary there is for improved margins and combined ratio. The home outlook,
on the other hand, is broadly consistent both from a margin and a combined ratio
standpoint, assuming more normalized levels of non-cat weather activity. When you put
those two pieces together, you get improved margins and a slightly improved combined
ratio in the aggregate. Part of that, I guess, the other factor is as auto premium is growing
more than home and auto, carries a higher combined ratio, mix impacts the adjustment in
the combined ratio.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks. Second, I guess, is a broader question, you've
talked a lot in the past about how some elements of exposure act like rate. Are those
elements more, I guess, reflective of the price of the exposures for the values that are
being insured, or of exposure unit growth or on a real basis?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

I'm not totally sure I understand the question, but I think it's more of a value than it is unit,
right? You increase the value of a unit, and it's that increase in exposure that behaves
more like rate. When you actually add another unit of exposure, you have another unit of
loss content. So I think that's the right way to think about it.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, perfect. That's exactly what I was asking.

Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan.
Please proceed.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. I just wanted to try one more on the tax rate. What would the pro forma
tax rate have been this year under U.S. tax reform?

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Actually, it's not something we actually calculate it. So I think we would suggest you do the
same thing, just look at what the NII was for the tax-exempt portfolio. And then for
Page 24 of 28

everything else, apply the 21% rate. But we haven't done the calculation.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Yeah, I'm coming up with some slightly different numbers than in the previous
question. So, I mean, if you were willing to disclose that, I think that would be helpful.

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Well, just to add, the information is in the supplement, so maybe it's something Gabby
can follow-up with you on.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Okay, great. Thank you. And then secondly, just on the auto insurance underlying
combined ratio, improved nicely this quarter, but it's still above 100%. How long should we
be thinking about it will take to get below 100% given some of the pricing actions you're
taking offset by the new business penalty?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure. Thanks, Sarah. It's Michael. I want to just put a point on Brian's comment earlier
about reflecting seasonality to start with. So if you're looking at page 15 and you're
looking at the 101% for the full year versus the 104% for the quarter, that is pretty
consistent with the seasonality we would typically see in the quarter.
In terms of how long it takes, I think we're certainly optimistic. And as we said last quarter,
we feel good about the progress we're making towards our target combined ratio and
see that continuing as we look ahead into 2018 and 2019.
I think with the outlook that we've given you for RPC, you can sort of make your own
estimate of what the earned rate will be, apply a loss trend and get to an earned
combined ratio pretty quickly. And, I guess, at this point as we look at our experience, we
don't see anything that would cause us to tell you to do it any differently.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Okay, great.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Just as a follow-up to your tax question, in terms of the going-forward approach to
calculating an effective tax rate, what I said is absolutely on point. There is a little bit of
foreign income that's taxed at a slightly different rate, but that shouldn't matter. That will
matter more this year than in the future because of today's 35% tax rate versus the
future.
But one of the other things that we should point out and you'll see it in the press release,
we did have a favorable tax settlement earlier in the year that would have affected this
year's effective tax rate. So if you're going to do a pro forma for this year, you have to
Page 25 of 28

Company Ticker: TRV US Equity

take that into account. And then in addition to that, I mentioned in my commentary that
we did some tax planning initiatives in the year that had some impact on the effective tax
rate as well. So really, the calculation you want to do is not about this year, it's about going
forward.

FINAL

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Okay, great. Thank you.

A - Gabriella Nawi

{BIO 2211991 <GO>}

Okay. This will be our last question, please.

Operator
Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg with Janney
Montgomery Scott. Please proceed.

Q - Larry Greenberg

{BIO 16478161 <GO>}

Thank you. If you can believe it, I still have a question to ask. So going back to tax reform
and a level playing field, aside from the benefits that might be there on the M&A side,
from an operating standpoint or from a business line standpoint, where do you think the
most concrete benefits might arise given the more level playing field?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

I guess the way we think about that is the tax line is an expense line, like any other
expense line that we work into our pricing models. And to the extent that we've got a
level playing field and aren't at a disadvantage in that regard, I think, again, on a relative
basis, from a pricing perspective, that helps. And I would say, after M&A and maybe even
before M&A, that's a significant factor in terms of level playing field.

Q - Larry Greenberg

{BIO 16478161 <GO>}

But in terms of Business Insurance, specific lines, there's none that necessarily jump out
more than others?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

I think the same math applies to all of our pricing models for all of our products. So I don't
think I would make a distinction there.

Q - Larry Greenberg

{BIO 16478161 <GO>}

Okay. And then just with better economic growth, perhaps, on the horizon, do you think
that, all things equal, small commercial premium growth should maybe catch up to the
Middle Market and maybe even grow faster in an improving economic environment?

FINAL

I'm not really sure how to answer that question. I do think across all of our businesses,
we're pretty well leveraged and pretty well positioned to benefit from an improving
economic environment.
In terms of, if you're asking about growth in GDP by small enterprise versus large, I don't
know that I've got a better view on that than you or anyone else. And if you're talking
about our own market position, small versus large, there's so many things that go into
growth and we actually don't think about it that way.
We execute, as you've heard us say many times, at a very granular level. So whether it's
small or large, we're trying to keep our best business, improve the profitability on the
business where we need to and do a lot of hustle and leveraging our competitive
advantages trying to generate new business.
And when that very granular strategy adds up to growth, we grow. So that's the way I think
about it, and we don't really think about the small differently than the large from that
perspective.
