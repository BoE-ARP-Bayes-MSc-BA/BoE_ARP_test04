Presentation
Operator
Good day and welcome to the Gjensidige Q2 2018 Results Presentation. Today's
conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms.
Mitra Hagen Negard, Head of IR. Please go ahead ma'am.

Mitra Hagen Negard

{BIO 3974076 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the second quarter presentation of
Gjensidige. My name is Mitra Negard and I'm Head of Investor Relations. As always, we
will start with our CEO, Helge Leiro Baastad, giving you the highlights of the quarter,
before we go on to Jostein Amdal, our CFO, who will run through the numbers in more
detail. And of course we will have plenty of time for Q&As at the end. Helge, please.

Thank you, Mitra and good morning and welcome everyone. 2018 started oﬀ with a harsh
and long lasting winter, also severely aﬀecting the ﬁrst part of the second quarter. Luckily,
we did not experience severing ﬂoodings in Norway as initially feared, since we had a
warm, but also very dry climate in the last part of the quarter. However, all in all, winter
eﬀects characterized the second quarter results, together with the continued deterioration
in motor proﬁtability in Norway.

Our results are summarized on page two. Proﬁt before tax amounted to NOK1.3 billion in
the quarter. The underwriting result amounted to NOK707 million. The combined ratio
was 88.2% and we had the premium growth of 2.8%. The underwriting result was
impacted by a signiﬁcant increase in the frequency claims level for property in Norway,
mainly driven by the long and harsh winter leading to claims being reported long into the
second quarter as well.
Areas in the south and south eastern part of Norway were hit to a larger extent than the
rest of Norway and it is in this part of the country Gjensidige has its strongest presence. In
addition, this is also an agricultural area, which is an industry where we have a very high
market share. Therefore, both private and commercial property portfolios were hit. We
estimate the weather-related deviation in the frequency claims level in second quarter
compared with historically second quarter average to be in the range of NOK150 to
NOK200 million. This means we have had the total of NOK400 to NOK500 million in
claims during the ﬁrst half year in 2018, related to the particularly harsh winter in Norway.
Large losses were also higher compared to the second quarter last year, partly due to the
heavy snow leading to damages on buildings. Aside from weather eﬀects, the underlying
inﬂation trend we have seen in motor insurance in Norway over some quarters now
continued into 2018, which I will come back to on the next slide.

Bloomberg Transcript

Outside Norway, we continue to deliver signiﬁcantly improved results. The ﬁnancial result
came in at NOK371 million, corresponding to a 0.7% return. Annualized return on equity
year-to-date was 14.2%. Jostein will revert with more granular comments on the numbers.
Then turning to page three, I will comment the Norwegian motor situation in particular. I
will start by saying that we are not satisﬁed with the proﬁtability development we have
seen over the past couple of years. As you remember back in 2014/15, we anticipated a 1%
claims inﬂation. Motor proﬁtability was very high with claims ratios in the 50s and as we
communicated, it was better than we -- than what we could normally expect partly driven
by a benign weather situation over several years.
From the second half of 2016, we started to see inﬂation increasing more than anticipated
for the reason we have discussed over several quarters now. Given the fact that we came
from a situation with a very high motor proﬁtability, the initial price increases were
modest. We took a deliberate choice to increase our competitiveness, at the same time as
we built the leading position in the car dealership channel by delivering a combined
product oﬀering on attractive terms together with the Gjensidige Bank.
The consequence, as inﬂation just continued to increase more than we anticipated almost
quarter-by-quarter, it is that price increases have been lagging the inﬂation curve and that
the accumulated eﬀect on this has increased over the past two years, resulting in a harder
hit on proﬁtability than we had foreseen. As previously communicated from the ﬁrst
quarter this year, we have increased prices beyond the expected and the line inﬂation of
around 6%.

FINAL

We are fully committed to stabilize and ultimately also improve the proﬁtability, meaning
that we are willing to sacriﬁce some volume to achieve this. What we see in our numbers
as shown to the right is that we are reducing our exposure towards customers with low
scores and high claims ratio after approaching this with the highest price increases.
Consequently, we then adjusted risk exposure in the portfolio, we will have lower realized
price increases, but also an improved book of business.
This situation is similar to what we experienced back in 2009 and '10, when we increased
motor premiums signiﬁcantly, and at the same time improve the overall quality of the
motor-book, supported by high quality tariﬀs. But, it is important to remember, General
Insurance is like a tanker, it takes 12 to 24 months to see full eﬀect from price increases in
our P&L. All in all, this means we expect the motor proﬁtability in Norway to marginally
decrease further before we will see a turning point during the ﬁrst half of 2019.

Bloomberg Transcript

You might wonder why we were not able to see the rapid change in the inﬂation curve
being the market leader in Norway. It is a good question and the best answer I can give is
that in particular the new situation in Norway with regards to highly incentivized electrical
and hybrid vehicles is unique, leading to totally new experiences both in portfolio mix,
driving habits and claims severity. In June this year, 62% of all new cars sold or leased
were either electric or hybrid in Norway. While we are the market leader overall in the
motor market in Norway, we have a number three position in the market for new EVs and
hybrids, reﬂecting a deliberate strategy to actually be more cautious towards these
segments for instance by pricing Tesla's high from day one.
To be honest, I don't think any of our competitor did foresee this rapid structural shift
either. And I know here competitors conﬁrming they see the same inﬂation picture as we
do. I'm conﬁdent we are better informed today to understand and predict inﬂation going
forward. The last 1.5 to 2 years of experience have been a learning experience for the
whole organization, leading to new insights into the interaction of terms, sales channels
and claims experience.
Going forward, we will be even more diﬀerentiated and much more agile in our risk
selection and risk pricing. And remember that overall, it is positive for the insurance
industry that the risk volume in the motor segment increases as long as we are able to
price the risk correctly and I know we are. All this said, it is important for me to remind you
that motor is still a very proﬁtable product for us both in absolute terms and relatively to
the whole book of business. My ambition is to continue securing a high and also
improving proﬁtability in motor going forward.
Then looking at page four, we continue to see a very high retention among our customers
in Norway. High retention means more products per customer and lower distribution cost,
which again is important for our overall very competitive cost position. In the Private
segment in Norway, the retention is as high as 92% among our aﬃnity and loyalty
customers, representing 85% of the premium volume. Likewise in the Commercial
segment in Norway, the retention is 90%. So how come, we succeed in holding onto to
our customers to such a great extent? Well, ﬁrst of all, our brand has unique standing in
Norway. We have the strongest brand awareness in our sector. And the brand awareness
is among the highest also independent of any sector.

Going forward, we believe brand strength will be even more important than before given
the destructive focus -- forces we are all facing these days. Secondly, we deliver superior
customer experiences throughout the whole value chain everyday through advanced
analytical CRM. We are able to be relevant in all touch points with our customers at the
right time, with the right customer oﬀering. This combined with advanced micro tariﬃng
and advanced digital solutions for self-service creates a win-win situation for our
customers and ourselves. Record high customer satisfaction several years in a row proves
to be are succeeding.
Last but not least, the customer dividend model is unique retention tool. Since the IPO in
2010, the Gjensidige foundation has paid more than NOK15 billion in customer dividends
to our General Insurance customers in Norway. These days, our customers have again
received back more than 14% of the insurance premiums they paid in 2017. Almost 80% of
our customers say the model contribute to their loyalty with Gjensidige and more than
one-third of the non-customers say they -- the model could make them become a
customer with Gjensidige.
Then turning to page ﬁve, let's spend some time on the bank sale announced on 2nd of
July. To understand the rationale for selling the bank, it is important to understand the
rationale for having the Bank in the ﬁrst place. I will spend a couple of minutes reminding
you. We established a bank back in 2006, simply as a defensive move to secure loyalty
among our private insurance customers in Norway, when several banks established their
own insurance operations. The bank has grown signiﬁcantly and contributed to earnings,
but not to capital generation. We have therefore said that if we could ﬁnd other and
better solutions supporting our General Insurance customers with banking products,
without owning the bank, we will look into that. And I'm really glad now how we have
achieved and excited how -- about what we have achieved with Nordea.
It is slightly kinder surprise achieving three things in one. First of all, we can continue the
loyalty-enhancing bank oﬀering to our insurance customers and the strong combined
foothold in the car dealership channel built through Gjensidige Bank only to an even
stronger extent than before through a partnership with the second largest bank in
Norway.
Secondly, the partnership opens up the opportunity to sell insurance to Nordea's
customer base. And last but not least, capital is freed up and can be put into work in less
capital intensive insurance operations. Even though the Gjensidige Bank has generated
earnings, it has not generated capital due to its relatively small size, combined with high
growth and a very high capital requirements for banks, meaning, it has been a drag on
our dividend capacity so far. Therefore, selling the bank will have an immediate positive
eﬀect on capital generation and increases the robustness of the dividend capacity for the
group.
Approximately NOK5 billion of capital will be freed up and our ambition is to put this
capital into work in less capital consuming insurance assets in the Nordic countries and/or
in the Baltics. Replacing earnings from the bank and resulting in an even higher dividend
capacity than the group would have had by owning a bank. If such assets are not found at

a decent price, we will distribute excess capital back to our owners as special dividends
over time.
And with that, I will leave the word to Jostein to present the Q2 results in more detail.

FINAL

Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Thank you, Helge and good morning, everybody. I will start on page seven, where you
can see that we report a proﬁt before tax of NOK1.25 billion in the second quarter. This is
down compared to the proﬁt we reported for the second quarter last year, driven by
lower underwriting and ﬁnancial results, partly oﬀset by an increase in proﬁt from
Gjensidige Bank. The decline in the underwriting result was mainly a consequence of
signiﬁcantly higher claims in the Private and Commercial segments and mainly impacted
by the long winter in Norway, with large amounts of snow in several of our largest regions.

Bloomberg Transcript

We estimate the weather related deviation in claims in the second quarter compared to
the historical second quarter average in the range of around NOK150 to NOK200 million.
The results in Norway were also impacted by the continued deterioration in motor
proﬁtability, as Helge as mentioned, aﬀecting both Commercial and Private. Results
outside Norway generally improved. The underlying frequency claims development in
Danish operation improved over last year, continuing the positive development we have
seen over the past quarters.
However, the reported underwriting result was down year-over-year due to more large
losses related to commercial properties. Sweden generated signiﬁcantly improved results,
also adjusted for higher run-oﬀs and lower large losses, reﬂecting eﬀective pricing and
risk selection measures. The Baltic segment also contributed positively to the
underwriting result, with ongoing restructuring programs continuing to show good
results. The pension business recorded the best ever quarterly result. Contributions from
the Bank were positively impacted by gains of NOK130 million on sales of non-performing
loans. Results adjusted for this were somewhat down year-over-year. The ﬁnancial result
from our investment portfolio declined following lower contributions from bonds and
current equities.
Turning to page eight, premiums rose 2.8% compared with the second quarter of 2017
and 2.7% [ph] adjusted for currency eﬀects. All the main product lines in the Private
segment recorded higher premiums during the quarter. Premiums for the Commercial
segment were up compared with last year, reﬂecting solid renewals. Reported premiums
in Denmark were ﬂat, but down [ph] adjusted for both local currency and more now
(inaudible) which was included in our accounts from May of last year. Decline is a result of
the ongoing portfolio re-underwriting and price adjustments in the commercial lines,
aiming at improved proﬁtability over time.
Earned premiums in Sweden declined. Our repricing strategy is on track, we focus on
generating enhanced results going forward. The Baltics reported a slight increase in
premiums, but the decline measured in local currency as a consequence of our portfolio
restructuring and repricing activities.

Turning over to page nine, we can see that the loss ratio rose from 68% to 33% year-onyear. Large losses were up resulting in a 1.1 percentage point increase in the loss ratio
compared with Q2 last year. Run-oﬀ gains somewhat higher than expected had a positive
impact of 0.7 percentage points in the loss ratio compared with last year, a higher
underwriting frequency claims level was the main driver for the increase in the loss ratio.
This was purely related to Norway as our operations in Denmark, Sweden and the Baltics
all reported underlying frequency claims developments. The deterioration in Norway was
twofold. The ﬁrst being weather related. The large amounts of snow in south and
southeastern Norway lasting well into Q2 caused melting and freeze damages for a
signiﬁcant number of Commercial and Private properties. And ﬁnally with respect to
weather-related claims, the settlement of some property claims in Q1 exceeded the
provisions made at the end of the ﬁrst quarter. The second main reason for the rise in the
frequency claims level is a deterioration in the motor segment as Helge as discussed,
reﬂecting the change in the region we had complete and related dynamics.
Let's turn to page 10 for an overview of large losses. Total large losses amounted to
NOK210 million, below our expected long-term average of 295 million. The losses
translate into 3.5 percentage points on the combined ratio. And the large losses were
mainly related to commercial property, with the majority in Norway and Denmark.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving on to page 11 to comment the run-oﬀ gains. Run-oﬀ gains for the quarter came to
NOK292 million, which is higher than our planned reserve releases of 250 million,
deviation of NOK42 million is due to random variations. The run-oﬀ had a positive impact
of 4.9 percentage points on the combined ratio. We maintained our estimate of
approximately 250 million in run-oﬀ gains per quarter for the rest of 2018.
Let's turn to page 12. The cost ratio for the quarter was 15.2%, reﬂecting continued good
cost control across the group segments. Our cost ratio excluding the Baltics was 14.4%. It
is particularly encouraging to see the positive eﬀect from our restructuring eﬀorts in
Sweden and the Baltics. Page 13 illustrates highlights from the bank and pension
operations. Gross lending in the bank at the end of the quarter was NOK48 billion. The
bank reported a pre-tax proﬁt of 218 million in the second quarter, the improvement from
the same period last year, driven by gains on sales of non-performing loans.
Proﬁt adjusted for this were somewhat down year-over-year, mainly reﬂecting increased
acquisition costs and loan losses, as well as lower gains on ﬁnancial instruments.
Annualized return on equity was 13.8%. The pension company recorded a proﬁt before tax
expense of 38 million. Assets under management in the pension operations amounted to
NOK30 billion, and 69% of the customers in our pension business are general insurance
customers as well. Annualised return on equity amounted to 13.9%.
Moving on to the investment portfolio on page 14. The investment portfolio of NOK52
billion yielded a return of 0.7% in the quarter, which we deem satisfactory. The Match
portfolio yielded a return of 0.6% on a portfolio of NOK35 billion, a large part of the
Match portfolio consist of bonds at amortized costs, which yielded a return of 1.0%. The
running yield in this portfolio was 3.8% at the end of the quarter and the average
reinvestment rate in the quarter was close to 3%. Unrealized excess value amounted to
approximately 1 billion. The free portfolio which amounts to NOK18 billion, yielded a
Page 6 of 19

FINAL

return of 0.8% in the quarter. The positive return was primarily driven by returns on
investments in property, equities, private equity funds, and convertible bonds, while other
ﬁxed income instruments had a small negative return.
Last but not least, looking at our capital position on page 15. The capital position is still
strong. The legal perspective gets a solvency margin of 160%, while our own calibration of
the internal model gets a solvency margin of 173%. Solvency margins would be 187% and
203% respectively, when adjusting the capital position to reﬂect best estimate reserves,
taking the planned runoﬀ gains into account.
Changes in the capital position in these two perspectives from last quarter are relatively
small. Eligible capital increases mainly driven by retained earnings, contracted somewhat
by several other minor changes. There is a stable development in the capital requirement.
We will continue to balance our capital structure in a disciplined way in order to support
long-term target return on equity of about 15%, while at the same time supporting our A
rating, stabilising regular dividends over time, ensuring ﬁnancial ﬂexibility for smaller
acquisitions and organic growth, as well as providing a buﬀer for regulatory changes. This
means the solvency margin should remain in the upper part of the target range. Given the
sale of the Gjensidige Bank, the pro-forma solvency margin as of June 30 was 236%. As
already communicated, we will prioritize exploring M&A opportunities before distributing
any excess capital as special dividends.
I will then hand the word back to Helge.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Jostein. To sum up on page 16, our second quarter results were signiﬁcantly
impacted by winter eﬀects. As for the Norwegian motor-book, margin deterioration is
now mostly behind us, with margins expected to reach the turning point during ﬁrst half
2019. This combined with the overall strong franchise in Norway and continued positive
development in results outside Norway make us conﬁdent the group is very well
positioned for continued solid value creation in the years to come.
Balancing cost eﬃciency measures with strategic investments into technology, people and
brand continue to be high on our agenda also during 2018. Our capital position is strong
and supports our ambition to seek value accretive M&A opportunities and if such
opportunities do not materialize, we will distribute excess capital over time in line with our
dividend policy. And ﬁnally, our long-term ﬁnancial targets are unchanged and we are
more dedicated than ever to customer orientation, aiming at delivering the best
consumer experiences in every customer touch point.
Thank you very much. We will now open for the Q&A session.

Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) We will now take our ﬁrst question from Jonny
Urwin from UBS. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hello. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, three from me today. So ﬁrstly,
Gjensidige's deteriorating underlying results have become a bit of an outlier versus listed
peers over the last 18 to 24 months. In motor, I think the peers are seeing claims inﬂation
as you guys acknowledge, but they don't see the sharp acceleration in claims inﬂation that
you've seen. In property, Gjensidige's 2Q results look like a bit of an outlier again and was
been a relatively benign period for large losses. I appreciate the commentary around
being over the way Tesla is in motor and agriculture and property, but I guess my
question is, is Gjensidige is operating under performance bad luck or is it bad
underwriting? And how conﬁdent are you in your systems and processes and is more
investment needed in the underwriting function? That's the ﬁrst question.
Secondly, I guess on a related topic, how conﬁdent are you in the 86% to 89% combined
ratio target for 2019 and 2020, given the level of underlying deterioration that we've seen
in the loss ratio. We've seen nine quarters in a row now of pressure and I appreciate
you're matching out claims inﬂation now on motor, but we'll probably still see another
three or four quarters of drift until they earn through. So what's the risk, when the loss
ratio stabilizes and is higher than the 89%. And then ﬁnally how are you thinking about
the sustainability of the ordinary dividend? Once the banking earnings are removed and
factoring in further pressure on the loss ratio, it looks quite tight the dividend covenant.
Now you've obviously replenished the capital buﬀers, so there is money there to pay the
dividend, but I'm just wondering about the split we should be expecting between
ordinaries and specials and have you had any change and thought there after the bank
disposal. Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Okay. I think we have -- on the ﬁrst question, on the -- is it look core or the opposite of skill
given the more trend on the property developments. I think as we have explained and as
Helge went into quite detail today on the motor side, we have been a bit behind the
curve on the pricing of the motor inﬂation. We are now pricing at least in line with our
communicated claims inﬂation. And as Helge said, a slight deterioration further in 2018
before we reach the turning point in 2019, which means that is not going to go down from
there and rather they are upset, that's the motor communication. And on the property
side, they -- as we have stated weather-related eﬀect, which we regard as one-oﬀs in the
Q1 and Q2 of 2018 and that means that for property as such we think proﬁtability will go
back to the previous level once you take away these one-oﬀ eﬀects.
There is whether we need to invest more than writing skills and I think that's ongoing a
variation that we make whether it's also a good or not, it is, yeah. So, no speciﬁc
comments on that. On the second question about 86 to 89 for 2019, we are obviously very
conﬁdent that we will be within that range for 2019. We have seen that there are one-oﬀs
that could lead us astray, but kind of given those special eﬀects on claims or weather
related large claims or weather related losses, we keep that -- the target for '19 .

FINAL

On the sustainability of dividend after the Bank sale, remember that the Bank hasn't really
contributed to dividend capacity ever and we have put more money into it, as it has
grown as capital requirements for the banking sector has increased, the dividend capacity
has always been within -- will come from the insurance part of Gjensidige. I think, I'll leave
it with that.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Just a comment on, you commented the competitors and the motor inﬂation and we
heard a couple of days ago, Tryg referred to 4% increase in repair costs in Norway. And
adding to that the structural increases in frequency they should see just the same overall
claims inﬂation as we do. So we actually see that the competitors that are commenting on
this level, they are commenting the same type of picture as we do.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

I guess the diﬀerence Tryg as they're not -- they haven't seen the curve that you've seen.
So obviously you know 18 months ago, you guys were talking about 1% claims inﬂation,
then it was 3 to 4 then it was 5 and it was 6, that's quite sharp deterioration, which I mean
I'm more focused on the actual curve than the overall quantum and I think that's why you
guys are telling quite a diﬀerent story to the peers.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I can really only comment on our own estimates and not Tryg's, but I think we gone
through, we have as Helge said today, we have underestimated claims inﬂation back in
2016 and that's the reason why the loss ratio has deteriorated. And we hope that and the
things that we are not correct with the 6% inﬂation estimate that we have and the pricing
according to that. Our communication and our actual practice has always been to try to
price based in line with the claims inﬂation and then -- but with kind of segmental
approach, so that we don't -- our price attractive segments within the Norwegian market.
So, that's kind of -- there is no change there, I don't think the changed is our claims
inﬂation estimates. Please also remind that when you compare to other companies that
have -- the majority of their operations outside of Norway and the the claims inﬂation
picture that we and they say outside of Norway is very diﬀerent from what they see in
Norway due to the composition of the car ﬂeet in Norway and in Denmark or Sweden.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

And it's also important to take into consideration, the starting point, what kind of
combined ratio had the diﬀerent competitors, if you go two years back. As I said, we
operated with loss ratios in the 50s and if you look at other competitors two years back,
they operated in a completely diﬀerent area actually. So, that's also important to take into
consideration.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Yeah, that's fair enough. Thanks guys. Thanks for your comments.

We will now take our next question from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca. Please go
ahead.

FINAL

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. So, just a few questions on motor again please, if you don't mind.
Just looking at the 1H '19 turnaround projection, could you just discuss, are there any risks
to that as well because I mean -- could it be that there is some trends in frequency that
could surprise, or just if you could discuss how you thought about that 1H, I appreciate the
12 month cycle. But on pricing, but what I don't know is what you assumed on frequency
and these habits of drivers, et cetera?
And then again, just on the page three, so thank you for the customer segmentation and
churn approach. Could you help us quantify a bit, because when I look at the weighted
average line, it seems to edge a bit towards the upper end of the chart. You said that the
proportion of the -- sort of the -- which I presume is not the good customers, is the
proportions bit very high and in line with that are you looking for a -- are you willing to
give up a lot of market share as well.
And just lastly, is there any again I've asked in the past, do you see the need for any
reinsurance solutions on this? And if I can sneak one more, if there are any diﬀerence in
private and commercial trends that you are seeing now in the motor area? Sorry, too
many questions, but I think there are four questions, sorry about that. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Okay, I will start. There is of course always a risk in the prediction and you might be
surprised, but given what we know and the measures we have in place, we are pretty
conﬁdent about this turnaround as we reach the turnaround in the ﬁrst half of '19. And the
risk here is that two way risk its -- it could be sooner, it could be later, it's not that it's the
most optimistic estimate that we'll reach in the ﬁrst half of '19. There is -- there's a number
of measures we are taking place, its not just pricing, it's also how we do loss adjustments
and the terms of the contracts and so on. So, it's a comprehensive package of measures
not just pricing that we are putting in place.
On the page three and distribution of customers and the diﬀerent customer scores, you're
right, that there is an old rate on the fee and that just because when you have a new
customer they came in -- they come in a fee and then they move either way over time. So,
there would naturally be a tendency to be a higher share there in the middle of that
distribution. And on three in need of insurance, no, we're not thinking about doing any
reinsurance on the motor business as such, we still view reinsurance as a capital
instrument to protect the capital position of the company and not kind of either way any
lack of underwriting proﬁt.
And for diﬀerence between Commercial and Private, there are of course diﬀerences in the
loss ratio because in the Commercial segment we have ﬂeet insurance and we have the
commercial -- sorry agricultural customers there as well. But I think on balance, there's a
slightly lower -- higher loss ratio in the commercial than in the private because of the ﬂeet

claims inﬂation picture as such.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. Two questions from my side, please. Firstly, could you elaborate a bit
more on the agriculture impact. You said that part of the reason why the weather impact
was big was also your exposure to agriculture. How big is the exposure to agriculture?
And how much of a risk could you also see now with the kind of very, very dry weather
and that impact also impacting Q3 underwriting proﬁt?
Then the famous slide number three on motor insurance, could you give us some kind of
quantiﬁcation on this. How much is the -- are the premiums in the motor side? How much
further negative pressure there is in terms of Norwegian Kroners before we see the
turnaround in the ﬁrst half, some kind of quantiﬁcation on this, the impact of the motor
turnaround and how much further pressure we will see in terms of Kroners? Thanks.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Just to start with agriculture, that's the history, Jostein [ph]. So, in Norway, we have 75%
market share for agriculture business and that's related to buildings, equipment and all
kind of our annuals [ph]. The winter eﬀect was related to buildings, private buildings and
also the typical agriculture buildings, that was of a claims related to agriculture business in
ﬁrst and second quarter. The dry weather know, that's more discussion between the
farmers and the government. We do not have any exposure to the situation that they have
a hit by the dry weather. And over time the agriculture business has been quite proﬁtable
for us and we have, as I said 75% market share.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

How much is that of total premiums roughly, the agricultural claims?

Sorry, we don't -- we don't disclose (inaudible) business that --

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

No, we don't -- but, it's small and medium farms in Norway. You do not have the same
structural situation in Norway as we have in Denmark, Germany and other countries. It's
small and lots of these farmers are typically working both on the farm and they have a
second job as well. So, it's much also related to private business actually, but we do not
release the ﬁgures for the agricultural business line.

A - Jostein Amdal

The second one the motor, we don't disclose having a disclosed eﬀect on in Kroners, that
our turnaround comments are related to the development in the loss ratio as such. But
you --

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Can you a bit talk about the kind of what has been the impact roughly when you talk
about the weather impact between 150 and 200 in the quarter. So -- but some kind of

We will now take our next question from Youdish Chicooree from Autonomous Research.
Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Hi, good morning everyone. I've got two questions please. Before related to the sale of
your Bank and the capital deployment, ﬁrstly, how much of the capital release of roughly
4.3 billion would you like to inject in the non-line business to improve the S&P ratio? And
how much would be earmarked for M&A opportunities? And secondly, I think you
mentioned if the M&A opportunities do not rise at the right price, the proceeds will be
returned by way of special dividends over time, but can you just help us understand what
time frame are you thinking in terms of ﬁnding the right M&A target in replacing the lost
earnings before you think about special dividends? Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Well, the ﬁrst question is that we are not going to inject any money to improve the S&P
rating. We have -- we are conﬁdent about that the capital level we have injected in the life
insurance business is suﬃcient to keep the A rating and the stable outlook. And maybe
Helge comment on the time frame.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah, it's -- it's the Board decision, everything related to dividend. And just to start with
M&A opportunities within the insurance, we believe size and scale will be increasingly
important in our industry to secure the capacity to invest in the right technology, attracting
the right people et cetera going forward. And we think we will see more consolidation,
observed market dynamics and the need for companies to prioritize their investment
budgets going forward to follow the technological and regulatory development make us
believe more opportunities will come. It's -- I will not be precise regarding the time frame.
But if we do not see opportunities and we will be patient and rationale and disciplined.

Page 13 of 19



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2018-07-13

And I think you also have seen that transactions in our industry the last year we haven't
participated when we think it's to be too pricey. But in the medium time frame, meaning,
yeah, I will not be very -- but we will not year-after-year have the same communication to
you. We think we will see some in the next couple of years actually, so --

FINAL

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay, ﬁne. I mean, historically, I mean, there has been a lack of M&A activity and generally
speaking, the targets have been very small. So, that's why I was wondering, whether you
believe there would be some major opportunities going forward, or probably as you say,
more will be reinvested in the business on digital et cetera, as opposed to the investment
made in the past?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I think we do invest quite a lot in digitalization and automization of our businesses, but
that will happen within the current cost ratio target of around 15%. So, these amounts are
not to be invested in the development of the non-life insurance business as such. These
amounts are either used for inorganic growth, or if that doesn't materialize over time,
hand it back to the shareholders.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay, great. Thank you very much.

We will now take our next question from Steven Haywood from HSBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you very much. I see, one of your competitors predict, announcing
a 106% combined ratio in its Norwegian business up from about 73% last year and that is
they say driven by motor, liability, health, and lot of other business lines here. And they're
also saying that the claims ratio in motor is increasing rapidly as well. So, I wonder if you
could tell us about any other peers that you may know about or have heard from that are
seeing similar kind of impacts from the motor businesses in Norway, as well because due
to my lack of disclosure in this sector, it will be very, very good if you could tell us other
ones that are seeing these sort of problems?
Secondly, once you sold the Bank, can you state whether your solvency margin target the
125% to 175% will that change? And then thirdly back on the motor again, sorry about this,
the 6% motor inﬂation now, do you still see that as the peak level going forward? Thank
you very much.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I can start with the motor, I was rather detailed when I went through the motor business.
And as you know, we are market leader and I also commented that on EV's and electrical
vehicles, we have a number three position, while we are number one for motor totally. I
Page 14 of 19

FINAL

think as I said that this is not a situation for Gjensidige, again the market leader, it's a
situation for the total market. And it's completely diﬀerent compared to what we see in
Denmark with very stable inﬂation for many, many years. And in Norway, all of us had the
winter eﬀects, as I commented, very benign winters for many years and then we saw a
very harsh winter now and you have to adjust for that.
When it comes to our competitors, I commented what Tryg have communicated, that's
the inﬂation around what we have seen. You saw maybe DNB yesterday, they have the
same type of communication related to property in second quarter due to the harsh
winter. Going forward, you have to adjust for the winter eﬀect. We think this is a peak,
because we have had the situation with EV's and hybrid cars for many many years now. So
we do believe this is actually a peak. In Norway, you also have the special situation with
the bonus scheme. You saw so maybe DNB commented that yesterday and we have said
that the change in the bonus system in Norway, we estimate that that's 1% points for
inﬂation.
So this is a market situation. And as I also commented, we have pricing power. We have
increased prices over time now and we do not see that this hurt our market share
signiﬁcantly. And at the end of the day, this is a positive situation when you manage to
meet these claims inﬂation situation with price increases, without losing customers.
Secondly, Jostein --

On the Solvency target?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

We'll look at our solvency targets again as we do regularly and it's about the solvency
target, solvency margin target and the minimal dividend payout ratio which needs to be
looked up, but we don't kind of pre-own of any changes, so that will be a Board decision
and an ongoing evaluation by the Board.

Very good morning. Jan Erik Gjerland from ABG in Oslo. Yeah, just coming back to your
strategic initiative on the expense side on IT investments, as you have previously stated

stay around 15 now then for years really, so that you can implement your long-term IT

(Operator Instructions) We will now take our next question from Wajahat Rizvi from
Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, good morning. Just a quick question on understanding your comment on turning
point for loss ratio during ﬁrst half of 2019. So, are you looking to restore proﬁtability at
sort of your, let's say, if you go back to 2017, sort of level? Or are you looking to maintain
the loss ratio once you get to the 2019 level? So, what is -- essentially I'm trying to get to
is, your price increases, are you just about matching claims inﬂation, or just pricing bit a
hedge. So, by 2019 you stay ﬂat at that level, or are you also looking to drive the loss ratio
down from that point. That would be the ﬁrst question.
The second one would be, once your, Gjensidige Bank earnings have now -- have gone
away, do you have room to lift the payout ratio and if you do, when should we expect a
decision on that? And then ﬁnally just on the weather losses, I recall, I think there was a
comment that there were some 1Q losses which were eﬀectively not reported then have
fallen into to 2Q numbers. So, just trying to understand, is there a delay in these kind of
claims, is there possibility that some of the claims from 2Q may actually now fall into 3Q as
well. So, bit more clariﬁcation on that would be very helpful. Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I can start on the motor side and Jostein will follow-up, but just to comment the market
situation in Norway now, we have seen recently more consolidation in Norway, that's
positive. We have also seen that some competitors really have weak motor business book,
both bank insurance companies, but also other companies. And we have also realized
that, that some of our main competitors communicate around the inﬂation just as we do,
that means that we will see the dynamic in the Norwegian market, which is positive for the
situation related to the motor business. As Jostein also said, it's lot of measures
implemented and it's new measures also planned, not only related to price increases, but
we have lots of measures ongoing and planned for the fall and going forward, that will
help us regarding proﬁtability for motor business.

FINAL

And I was very clear and I can repeat that, my ambition is to not only turn this point, but
it's to improve the proﬁtability going forward. To be more concrete than that, I think it's
not right to be, but I also commented and I think this is important to remind you that the
strong pricing power we actually have. So, I also commented the retention levels, so all-inall, I'm quite positive and we are oﬀensive and we have situation around this, which is very
positive to actually bring through all these measures now.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Okay. Moving over to the bank and just to remind you of our dividend policy which
remains ﬁrm, it is to have a high and stable nominal dividend. And if you manage to
increase underlying proﬁts, we will also increase the dividend. And as I also said that the
dividend capacity as such is actually improved through the sale of the dividend -- of the
bank, because it has been capital consuming down rather than capital generating for the
group. I don't think I will be more speciﬁc and oﬀer any changes in the ﬁnancial targets on
the either payout ratio or also on to margin targets than that.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the delayed reporting of weather related losses, every reporting period, every quarter,
the accrual departments makes an estimate of the amount of late reported claims, that is
just ordinary run of the business. And hence, they make a best estimate, but that might be
wrong from every time. And so we have seen that we have a slight overrun on from the
ﬁrst quarter to the second quarter. I do not estimate that that will happen again from the
second quarter or the third quarter, that's a way of business, we do operate with
uncertainties there, so it's -- there is a potential for either way that there could be lower or
higher than the actual estimate.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

If not only overrun, Jostein, because we also had actually winter in April.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yeah, speciﬁcally for a kind of, if there are delays, but as we mentioned, we had the winter
in April and we do also have customers kind of not or customers not seeing that they have
a loss until the snow melts for instance and then you see that there is actually a damage to
your house. So, that's natural delay, yeah.

Hi, good morning, everyone. Just going back on the sale of the Bank and the point on

you're looking at replacing the full earnings or the bulk of it, you'd be looking potentially

FINAL

at a deal between of a size between 6 billion and 8 billion. I mean, is that kind of deal
something you would consider? And also again assuming you wouldn't want to dilute
your ROE, you would be stretching your balance sheet quite signiﬁcantly. So can you just
talk to us, how you think about M&A, the hurdles, the ﬁnancials, what are the key
considerations here?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

As Helge already talked about kind of we don't comment speciﬁcally on what we think our
M&A targets, the balance sheet is very strong. So we have a potential now for larger
acquisitions than we have before the sale of the Bank. We also always have the possibility
of going to the market if we see a really large transaction coming up and we have our
supporting shareholder in the Gjensidige Foundation. But I think we have the capacity to
do larger deals and we could continue doing more small to medium size bolt-on
acquisitions, but I want to be more speciﬁc on that in terms of M&A going forward.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Thank you. Just want to follow-up on the inﬂation on motor. You said 1 percentage point
for the bonus change, I wonder if you could sort of especially tell us what sort of
percentage point would come from the falling Norwegian Kroner, how much sort of the
cost of importing parts has impacted the inﬂation here as well? Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Of the -- the remaining 5% after you take whether 1% point related to bonus scheme,
some part of that is related to more expensive parts. Some part is related to the fact that
actually electrical and hybrid vehicles actually just have more expensive parts current
suggested and take longer time at their workshop when they are -- when they have a
claim. The weakening of the Norwegian Kroner is a factor, they actually try to monitor
quite constantly which was -- it was one of the reasons why we underestimated inﬂation
back in 2016, but I don't have a speciﬁc number for you from how much is due to the
weakening of the Norwegian Kroner over the last two years, sorry.
