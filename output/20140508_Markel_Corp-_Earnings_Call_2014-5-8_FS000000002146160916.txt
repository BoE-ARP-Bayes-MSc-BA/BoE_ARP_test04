Greetings and welcome to the Markel Corporation First Quarter 2014 Earnings
Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-andanswer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being
recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Tom Gayner, President and
Chief Investment Officer for Markel Corporation. Thank you. Mr. Gayner, you may begin.

Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Thank you, Bob. Good morning and welcome everybody to the Markel Corporation first
quarter conference call. We're glad that you've joined us today. My name is Tom Gayner.
And with me today are Anne Waleski, our Chief Financial Officer; and my Co-Presidents,
Mike Crowley and Richie Whitt. Anne will go over the numbers with you, Mike and Richie
will update you on our insurance operations, and I'll finish with a few brief comments on
our investments and Markel Ventures' activities. Following that, we look forward to
answering your specific questions.
Before we do so though, I'm required to reiterate our Safe Harbor statement. So here it
goes. During our today, we may make forward-looking statements. Additional information
about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in
the forward-looking statements is included under the captions Risk Factors and Safe
Harbor and Cautionary Statement in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

We may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in the call today. You may find a
reconciliation to GAAP of these measures on our website at www.markelcorp.com in our
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

With that, let me turn it over to Anne.

Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Before I go over our first quarter results, I'd
like to provide some information on our new reporting segments. As we highlighted in our
2013 fourth quarter conference call and Form 10-K, we are now aggregating and
monitoring our underwriting results in the following four segments: U.S. Insurance,
International Insurance, Reinsurance and Other Discontinued Lines.
We believe this segmentation of our underwriting results provides the most meaningful
way to look at our performance in comparison to our peer group and provide the
reporting framework, which can be consistently used to more quickly integrate future
acquisitions into our financial reporting processes.

Bloomberg Transcript

To recap, the U.S. Insurance segment includes all direct business and facultative
placements written by our insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the United States. The
International Insurance segment includes all direct business and facultative placements
written by our insurance subsidiaries domiciled outside of the United States, including the
company's syndicates at Lloyd's.
The Reinsurance segment includes all treaty reinsurance written across the company.
Results for lines of business discontinued prior to or in conjunction with acquisitions will
continue to be reported in the Other Insurance Discontinued Lines segment.
As a reminder, the Form 8-K filed on April 22, 2014, provided a re-segmentation of our
previously reported results for 2011, 2012 and each quarter of 2013. The segment
changes have no effect on our historical consolidated financial results of operations.
Effective January 1, 2014, Syndicate 1400 was put in run-off and all legacy Alterra Lloyds'
business is now being underwritten on Markel Syndicate 3000. Likewise, since the
acquisition, some legacy Alterra U.S. property renewals as well as other new business
obtained from legacy Alterra producers are now written, so that it is difficult to distinguish
them from legacy Markel business.
For these reasons and the continued combination of underwriting platforms, systems and
product offerings, it has become and will continue to be more and more difficult each
quarter to separately identify and quantify legacy Alterra results. Increasingly, we're not
thinking legacy Alterra or a legacy Markel. We're just thinking our company. Since that's
where we wanted to be, we're glad we're here and we're glad that it's been a relatively
quick process.

FINAL

Now let's talk about our first quarter 2014 results. The year is off to a solid start. Our total
operating revenues grew 51% to $1.2 billion in 2014 from $820 million in 2013. The increase
is driven by the expanded underwriting platform and the larger investment portfolio
resulting from the Alterra acquisition. Other revenues were up just under 8% to $186
million from $173 million last year, primarily due to revenue growth within Markel Ventures.
Moving into the underwriting results, gross written premiums were $1.4 billion for the first
quarter of 2014 compared to $743 million in 2013, an increase of 83%, with each of our
three ongoing underwriting segments contributing to this growth. Net written premiums
for the first quarter of 2014 were approximately $1.1 billion, up 72% from the prior year for
the same reason.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net retention was down in 2014 at 84% compared to 89% in 2013. The decrease, which is
in line with our expectation, is primarily due to higher use of reinsurance on a number of
products in the Global Insurance and Global Reinsurance divisions. Earned premiums
increased 68% to $949 million for the first quarter of 2014. The increase in 2014 was
driven by the inclusion of a full quarter of legacy Alterra product offerings included in each
of our three ongoing underwriting segments as well as a full quarter from our Hagerty
business.
Our consolidated combined ratio for the first quarter of 2014 was a 95% compared to a
91% a year ago. The increase in the combined ratio was driven by a higher current
accident year loss ratio and a lower benefit of prior year loss redundancies, partially offset
by a lower expense ratio. The increase in the 2014 consolidated current accident year loss
ratio is primarily due to a higher current year loss ratio for our International and
Reinsurance segments, each of which have a higher proportion of premiums coming from
legacy Alterra product offerings than our U.S. Insurance segment.
During the first quarter of 2014, legacy Alterra product offerings carried a higher current
accident year loss ratio than our other product offerings due to higher attritional loss
ratios and applying our more conservative loss reserving philosophy. The consolidated
combined ratio for the first quarter of 2014 included $107 million of favorable
development on prior year loss reserves compared to $85 million in 2013.
The benefit of the favorable development on prior year loss reserves had less of an
impact on the combined ratio in 2014 than in 2013 due to higher earned premium volume
in 2014. The decrease in the consolidated expense ratio in the first quarter of 2014 was
driven by higher earned premiums in each of our ongoing underwriting segments
compared to a year ago.
Before moving on to our other results, I'd like to make a few comments about our actual
2014 first quarter underwriting results compared to the pro forma first quarter 2013
underwriting results. We have included these pro forma results in the Form 10-Q for
informational purposes only, but feel that the additional perspective that this comparison
provides is helpful given the fact that the actual results for the first quarter of 2013
included nothing for Alterra.

Page 3 of 18

FINAL

The pro forma results were prepared as if the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2013.
And, therefore, provide a full quarter of combined company underwriting results for 2013
in an effort to make the year-over-year comparison more meaningful.
On a pro forma basis, gross premiums written were down $33 million in the first quarter
of 2014 compared to a year ago, primarily due to lower reinsurance premiums driven by
several non-renewals and softening market conditions. This decrease is partially offset by
an increase in gross written premiums from the Hagerty business.
Net retention of gross premium volume was 84% in the first quarter of 2014 compared to
an 81% on a pro forma basis in the same period for 2013. The increase is primarily driven
by higher retentions on certain of our reinsurance products. Earned premiums were $949
million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to a pro forma $910 million in the same
period for 2013. The increase is primarily due to having a full quarter of Hagerty business
in 2014.

Bloomberg Transcript

The combined ratio was 94% for the first quarter of 2014 compared to a pro forma 92%
for the same period of 2013, largely due to our higher current accident year loss ratio in
2014. The increase in the current accident year loss ratio was due in part to applying our
more conservative loss reserving philosophy to Alterra's long tail of lines of business.
When we look at the underwriting results in this manner, we believe it is much easier to
see that we have retained a significant portion of the business previously written by the
two separate organizations and that we have been successful in achieving our target of
underwriting profit, while applying Markel's historically more conservative loss reserving
philosophy.
Now I'll discuss the results of Markel Ventures. During the first quarter of 2014, revenues
from Markel Ventures were $171 million compared to $162 million a year ago. Net income
to shareholders from Markel Ventures for the period was just over $1 million in 2014
compared to $3.6 million for the first quarter of 2013. EBITDA was $14 million in 2014
compared to $19 million in 2013.
The increase in revenues from our Markel Ventures operations during 2014 was primarily
due to our acquisition of Eagle Construction in August 2013, partially offset by a decrease
in revenues from our manufacturing operations. Less favorable results from our
manufacturing operations partially offset by Eagle Construction's contribution resulted in
the period-over-period decrease in net income to shareholders and EBITDA.
The results of the run-off life and annuity business acquired as part of the Alterra
transaction are included in the Other Discontinued Lines segment. Other expenses for
the first quarter of 2014 included $8.6 million of discount accretion determined as of the
acquisition date.
Investment income was $87 million for the first quarter of 2014 compared to $65 million
last year. Net investment income for 2014 was net of $18 million in amortization expense
from adjusting Alterra's fixed maturity securities to a new amortized cost basis at the
Page 4 of 18



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2014-05-08

acquisition date. The benefit of holding a larger portfolio was partially offset by its lower
yields.

FINAL

Net realized investment gains for the quarter were $17 million compared to $18 million a
year ago. There were no other than temporary impairments in either period.
Looking at our total results for the year, our projected effective tax rate was 25% in the
first quarter of 2014 compared to 24% a year ago. The increase in the effective tax rate in
2013 was driven by a higher projected earnings taxed at 35% rate in 2014 compared to
2013. We reported net income to shareholders of $88 million in the first quarter of 2014
compared to $89 million a year ago.
Comprehensive income was $230 million this year compared to $258 million a year ago.
And, as a result, book value per share at the end of March 2014 was $493.96 a share, an
increase of 4% since the end of 2013.

Bloomberg Transcript

Finally, I'll make a couple of comments on cash flows and the balance sheet. Net cash
provided by operating activities was $22 million for the first three months of 2014
compared to $56 million for the same period of 2013. The decrease was driven by higher
payments for income taxes, employee profit sharing and agent incentive commissions in
2014 as compared to 2013. Historically, first quarters are lowest cash generating quarter
based on the payment of the items I just mentioned. We would expect cash from
operations to improve in the second quarter.
Invested assets at the holding company were $1.1 billion at March 31, 2014, compared to
$1.3 billion at the year-end 2013. The decrease is primarily due to the timing of intercompany settlements.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike to talk about the U.S. Insurance segment.

F. Michael Crowley

{BIO 6836605 <GO>}

Thanks, Anne. Good morning. As Anne explained, the U.S. Insurance segment comprises
all direct business written on our U.S. insurance companies and includes all of the
underwriting results of our Wholesale division and our Specialty division, as well as certain
products written by our Global Insurance team.
The U.S. Insurance segment had an excellent quarter with gross written premiums
increasing 29% over prior year. This increase was due in large part to the Alterra lines of
business that are now included in this segment. Excluding these lines, premium volume
increased in the low single-digits over 2013, mainly driven by higher volume from the
Hagerty business which was new to us in 2013.
The combined ratio for the quarter was 96% compared to 91% in 2013. The deterioration
in the U.S. Insurance segment's combined ratio was due in part to adverse development

Page 5 of 18



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2014-05-08

in the architects and engineers lines of business and the higher current accident year loss
ratios on the lines within our Global Insurance division.

FINAL

Generally, these lines have higher attritional loss ratios than other products within the U.S.
Insurance segment. Additionally, we continue to build a margin of safety on newer lines of
business. This was partially offset by increased earned premium on the Hagerty business,
which carries a low loss ratio.
Our U.S. operations are focusing on two key areas that are critical to our results. First, our
executive underwriting team continues to execute our plan to exit underperforming
accounts and lines of business. This process was begun in 2013 and will continue
throughout 2014.
In addition, the leaders of our Wholesale and Specialty divisions are terminating
agreements with underperforming agents and brokers, those that place little or no
business with Markel. The streamlining of our agency group allows us to be more efficient
and to provide a high level service to those who consistently send us a strong flow of
submissions that meet our underwriting appetite.

Bloomberg Transcript

With regards to the rate environment, we're seeing decreases that in some cases are
significant on our large account business. Specifically, we are seeing these decreases in
our property, professional liability, and general liability lines for large accounts. We are
maintaining our underwriting discipline. And we'll walk away from business where we
cannot justify the pricing.
Our smaller accounts were experiencing rates ranging from flat to moderate single-digit
increases. During the first quarter, our senior management team met with a number of
our largest producers. The feedback we received was very positive with all of these firms
commenting on our expanded offerings, the quality of our service and the fact that we
integrated Alterra without any interruption of our service to them.
Finally, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Susan Swanson, President of our Midwest
Region for her service to Markel. Susan will be retiring in June of this year after 32 years at
Markel. She worked her way up from the ground floor to the regional presence role and
her leadership and enthusiasm will be sorely missed. We hope Susan visit us often and we
wish her a very happy retirement.
I'll now turn the call over to Richie.

Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In my comments today, I'll focus on our
International Insurance and Reinsurance segments. I'll start by discussing the International
Insurance segment's first quarter results and then discuss the results for our Reinsurance
segment and finish up with some recent pricing care trends and competition discussion.

FINAL

As Anne explained, our International Insurance segment is comprised of all direct and
facultative business written on any of our insurance company domiciled outside the U.S.
The segment includes business written by our Markel International division as well as that
written by our Global Insurance division.
In the first quarter, gross written premiums in the International Insurance segment
increased 25% to $294 million. The increase is primarily due to business written by the
Global Insurance division, which was created after the acquisition of Alterra.
The International Insurance segment finished the quarter with a 91% combined ratio
compared to 94% in 2013. The decrease in the combined ratio for this segment was
primarily due to more favorable prior year reserve releases in Marine and Energy,
Professional and Financial Risks and Elliott Special Risk units within our Markel International
division. This is partially offset by higher loss ratios on the professional and general liability
lines of business in the Global Insurance division.

Bloomberg Transcript

Lines of business written by the Global Insurance division generally have higher attritional
loss ratios than our other products included in this segment. Also, consistent with past
acquisitions, we are applying our more conservative reserving philosophy on these lines
of business. The segment's expense ratio was favorably impacted by earned premiums
from the Global Insurance line of business, which carries a lower expense ratio due to
lower acquisition cost.
Now, I'd like to discuss the results of the Reinsurance segment. Our Reinsurance segment
includes all treaty reinsurance programs written around the world, including that written by
our Global Reinsurance division as well as that written by our Markel International division.
Gross written premiums for this segment were $490 million in the first quarter of 2014.
This was up from $62 million a year ago. The increase in premium writings was primarily
due to products previously written by Alterra which are now part of the Markel
International division. Also, the Global Reinsurance division, which was created after the
acquisition of Alterra, contributed approximately $315 million of volume in the first quarter.
The combined ratio for this segment was 94% compared to 84% last year. Obviously, the
composition of this segment is very different year-over-year with the current year having
significantly more casualty reinsurance business, which carries higher loss and expense
ratios than the property reinsurance lines that made up the majority of the segment one
year ago. This is partially offset by more favorable prior year development coming from
property reinsurance lines.
Regarding pricing conditions and competition, the international insurance and reinsurance
markets remain extremely competitive. There's abundant capacity and there've been a
number of new entrants in recent months, with more likely in the near future. While
market conditions are becoming more difficult, Markel is well positioned to succeed.
As we've discussed in the past, we have tremendous diversification among our five
insurance divisions. We also have absolute dedication to underwriting discipline and the
Page 7 of 18



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2014-05-08

willingness and, more importantly, flexibility to put down the pen when pricing is not
adequate.

FINAL

We've seen less than ideal market conditions many times before. And, as Tony Markel
once famously said, this is not our first rodeo. We're confident we can navigate in a
competitive market.
Now, I'd like to turn it over to Tom.

Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Thank you, Richie. As promised in the intro, my comments will be very brief this morning.
As is always the case, we remain completely focused on the long-term growth in the
intrinsic value for the Markel Corporation. We measure ourselves on five-year rolling
financial metrics and the results of any one quarter can vary dramatically from our longterm upward path. That said, it's always more fun to give you report after a good quarter
than a bad one. And this was largely a good one.

Bloomberg Transcript

Here's the headline for the quarter. We made money in bonds, stocks and in Markel
Ventures. It can be easy to get stuck in the weeds and the details of any one spot within
the Markel Corporation, but I think it's important to keep a clear view of the big picture
result. When we make money in bonds, stocks and Markel Ventures, as we did this
quarter, all of those factors combine to amplify and turbo-charge the excellent results
produced by our underwriters. In a perfect world, we have that same headline every
quarter. This is not a perfect world though (22:24).
The good news is that we were able to give you that report in more quarters than not.
When you start talking about years, the ratio improves. And when you start looking at the
more important five-year type horizons we use to measure and describe our financial
results, we've consistently produced that same headline for years. We expect to continue
to do so.
Getting back to the beginning of 2014, the overall investment return in the first 90 days of
the year was a positive 2.0%, with equities up 3% and fixed income up 1.7%. We continue
to manage our investments in-house and effectively, as demonstrated by our long-term
performance, at very low cost with total investment management costs seen as singledigit number of basis points and with great tax efficiency that comes from our long-term
and low turnover ownership-oriented approach.
Abraham Lincoln spoke of four score and seven years when he tried to make a point
about time. I'll describe our long-term investment horizon somewhat differently, but in the
same period of time that you could have made two sequential batches of 12-year-old
Scotch whiskey and be a year into the third one, we've earned 12.5% per year on our
equity investments or 160 basis points above that of the S&P 500.
We continue to methodically and systematically add to our equity holdings. Equity
investments now comprise 49% of our shareholders' equity, up from the roughly 40%
Page 8 of 18

FINAL

level immediately following the Alterra acquisition. We continue to find reasonable and
productive investment ideas, but we also can be accused of driving the car with one foot
on the brake. So be it.
We think it is far more important to know that we can handle any upcoming curves in the
road rather than trying to race in it too fast. Over time and with good ideas, we'll
approach a more normal equity allocation of roughly 80% of our shareholders' equity in
equity investments. We'll move faster if markets give us the opportunity to do so, but we
won't be rushed by artificial targets.
In fixed income, we earned 1.7% during the quarter. We started the process of beginning
to extend the duration of our bond portfolio modestly the last few months. The duration
of our portfolio now stands at about 3.8. And over time, we would expect to move that to
approximately 4.5 and in line with the duration of our insurance liabilities. We can pick up a
modest amount of investment income as we do this. And we continue to predominantly
buy municipal securities as we go about this process.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Markel Ventures, we earned $14.9 million of EBITDA in the first quarter compared to
$19.3 million a year ago. First quarter results were below our expectations, but we are
optimistic that full year results will be better than what the first quarter might imply. Our
optimism for the full year stems from three reasons. One, our homebuilding and dorm
room furniture businesses are somewhat seasonal, and the first quarter is typically the
lowest level of profitability for those operations. We did not own the homebuilding
business in 2013. We did in 2014.
Secondly, manufacturing operations sell capital goods and they regularly experience large
swings in orders and deliveries from period to period. 2014 is off to a slow start in those
areas, but we remain optimistic about our full year and longer-term results.
Thirdly, we continue to fund some rapid expansions at certain operations and incur the
costs of doing so. All of those factors should gradually improve during the course of the
year. And we remain optimistic about the prospects of the Markel Ventures operations.
One of the beauties of Markel from a financial point of view is that we have proven,
successful, and recurring streams of profit from underwriting, investing and the industrial
and service operations at Markel Ventures. All of them together can and have historically
combined to produce resilient and ongoing positive returns for our shareholders.
We're glad for the channels to provide you with this regular update and we look forward
to doing so in the future. We're looking forward to it because we're optimistic that we'll
be able to continue to build one of the world's great businesses. And it's fun to be able to
share the news of doing so with our owners.
With that, Bob, if you'd be so kind as to open the floor for questions.

FINAL

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now be conducting a question-and-answer
session. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with Lafayette
Investments (sic) [SunTrust]. Please proceed with your question.

Q - Mark Douglas Hughes

{BIO 1506147 <GO>}

Hi. It's Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Tom, could you talk about your outlook for interest
rates here? You say you're slowly beginning to extend the duration of the portfolio.
What's your view on rates here?

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Well, I still think that rates are too low and they are unnatural. And we've had that point of
view for a while. And that – and the investment business is early enough to be confused
with being wrong. We've had a pretty substantial mismatch between the normal match of
our insurance liabilities to the investment portfolio. We're not rapidly – and to move this
kind of size of a ship around, it will be very gradual, to get that duration back in line. But
rather than let it continue to come in, which we're doing for the last couple of years, we're
just starting to nudge it out. And if we experienced a dramatically different interest rate
environment, we'd move fast to do that, but we'll be pretty methodical and just moving it
out.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mark Douglas Hughes

{BIO 1506147 <GO>}

Right. In the professional liability area – that was one of the segments you highlighted as
rates coming down meaningfully at the same time that you had adverse developments in
architects and engineers. Any more detail you can provide on what's going on there?

A - F. Michael Crowley

{BIO 6836605 <GO>}

Well, this is Mike. Good morning. It's very competitive in professional lines. And, obviously,
architects and engineers are just one of the professional lines that we write. We write a lot
of medical lines. We write lawyers. We write a number of different lines. Where we're
seeing the real competitive pricing is in the very large account business. And we don't
write really large architects and engineers firms. So, it's more in the medical and other
professional lines where we're seeing the rate decreases.

Q - Mark Douglas Hughes

Yeah. Good morning. A couple questions. Richie, you had talked a little bit about the
composition on the reinsurance book and you indicated that it was substantially casualty.
Can you just give us a broad general percentage of what portion is still property?

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

FINAL

What is it, Anne? North – you've got a rough.

A - Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Well, it's about 70% globally and 30% Markel International. So if you use that as a proxy -

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Yeah. It's probably about 60%/40% casualty today. And, obviously, the casualty carries a
much higher loss ratio. We had a first quarter with very little catastrophe losses, very little
to almost none, so a fairly low loss ratio there. But on the casualty business, you have to
start out very conservative and that's really what's driving that combined ratio up for the
segment.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That's fine. Thank you. The second question is kind of somewhat in the same vein. What
proportion of your business, I guess, in both the International and maybe in the
Reinsurance segment as well is exposed to currency risk? I mean I know that a lot of
what's at Lloyd's is priced and denominated in dollars, but what proportion has an FX
exposure?

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Mark, I'd be guessing to give you a number and we can go back and kind of look to help
you out. But you're absolutely right. A lot – what you find in marine and energy and what
you find at Lloyd's is a tremendous amount of business, even though it's foreign business,
is denominated in dollars. So, clearly, our South American business, there is some currency
exposure there, although a lot of those contracts are denominated in dollars. So we'll
have to get back to you with the number, but it's relatively low when you look at our
balance sheet. I'll guess and say 10% to 15%.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay.

A - F. Michael Crowley

{BIO 6836605 <GO>}

And one thing I would add to that, Mark, is the investment activities follow the form to
either reinsurance world deferred on, whatever, writing in the insurance business. So if
we're, I think, putting liabilities of our books in any foreign currency, typically, we will buy
investments in that currency as well to keep that economically matched.

Company N ame: M arkel Corp

Okay. Actually that's where my questions started. I was looking that you had a – I think it
was between 10% and 15% of your investment portfolio denominated in foreign bonds
and that's actually where I started. So maybe that's pretty close to the answer.

So that'd be 10% to 15%, that would equate to probably 10% to 15% of the reserves being
in those foreign currencies. The businesses – it's probably in that realm, in terms of the
original currency of the premium we're writing.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. The last question I had relates to the Abbey Protection business. I guess I found
somewhere in the Q that that business had about $3 million or so of revenues in the
quarter. And I think when we talked about it initially the annual run rate was in the $50
million to $60 million range. I guess that implies to me that there's probably a reasonable
amount of seasonality to that. I just hope that you could comment to just kind of help,
clarify how the revenue stream comes through on that one.

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. That's what I thought. The revenues for Abbey – Mark, revenues for Abbey show up
in two different places. The insurance business that we write is part of our gross written
and earned premium. And that's going to be the majority of that $60-ish million in
revenue. There is a service component to the business – professional services component
to the business. And that's what you're seeing – I guess that you're picking that up in other
revenues, other expenses.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Right.

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

That's the professional service component. $3 million for the quarter, $12 million or so
probably for the year is what we'd be looking for there. So that would be sort of the split.
The total of $60 million, $12 million or so of it coming from services, the rest of it earned
premium on insurance business.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

I see. That's helpful. Thanks. No more questions.

Hello, everyone. So, as a start to get comfortable with owning this – the Global
Reinsurance operation, I just wanted to get your high-level thoughts, especially Ritchie's,
on this. The Global Reinsurance operation seems like a departure from the way I've
always thought about Markel's sort of core skill set on the underwriting of bringing their
investment knowledge and expertise concerning specific risks. It feels to me like it would
be harder to price appropriately given the lack of knowledge of the underlying risks. And
so how do you get comfortable that this is something we can earn a valuable underwriting
profit on over the cycle? I mean after all I value the cost free flow pretty highly.

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Right. Well, couple things there. We have five insurance divisions. The Reinsurance division
is one of those. So we have quite a bit of diversification amongst the products. I like
reinsurance as a business. I like it even better if it's one of my five businesses, because
then I have the flexibility to lever that up and go down, quite honestly, when the markets
are not where we would like to see them.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, I think reinsurance is a business that can add value for us considerably over time. And
the fact that we've got the flexibility, the way we are structured, it really adds to that.
Obviously, with the Alterra acquisition, we picked up a team of extremely experienced
underwriters. And we talked about – when we did our due diligence on Alterra, we came
away feeling very comfortable with the expertise of the underwriters and the underwriting
philosophy, which is possibly even more important.
These guys are a very much – while we're writing treaty insurance, it feels very much like
individual account underwriting the way it's approached. So I have a lot of confidence in
our ability to get the pricing correct on the business. Now what that may mean in a soft
market like we're currently experiencing is we may write less and I fully expect that if
market conditions stay challenging in reinsurance. So, I feel very good about the
reinsurance operation as part of Markel.

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Matthew, I'd like to add. I think this is where the mindset and the culture of Markel is quite
relevant to this and in the way that all of our business that are unique and diversified parts.
We're willing to do more of the things where the profit opportunities are good and less of
the ones that aren't. And we have the ability, because we're diversified throughout the
company in different types of insurance, different types of investments, as well as Markel
Ventures, to hold ourselves to the standard that an owner would of whether it makes
sense to do it for the long run or not.
And reinsurance fits that to a tee, because there are times when you really want to write
as much of that business as you possibly can and there are times where you don't. But
you won't get any of the good stuff if you're not there and in the market and have
talented people making the decisions. And as long as there long-term owners and people
have a long-term time horizon, we'll be just fine with it.

Okay. And then, Tom, if you could just very quickly continue to – on that theme and from
your angle, how does the reinsurance float differ in terms of the length and sort of
volatility of the tail? And how does that impact your job in terms of managing the
portfolio?

FINAL

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Well, the good news is it doesn't differ at all in the sense that it's cash and we get to
invest it. Now what we'll do – and this is a discussion that we sort of coordinate with the
actuaries – we look at what the expected liabilities are. So if we're writing property
business, we'll keep that money pretty short. And if we're writing liability business, we'll
keep that a little bit longer. And that's really consistent with what we do for any piece of
float that comes in here, whether it was primary or reinsurance.

Q - Matthew Berry

{BIO 16846746 <GO>}

Okay. And then I have one final one which is just historically, you guys have split out
acquisition costs in your annual – from other underwriting expenses in your annual filings
on a per segment basis. I didn't notice that in the 8-K which you released with the new
segmentation. It is helpful to me when I think about Markel and I sort of compare you guys
against some of the other firms to think about how you go about acquiring the business
and to think about acquisition costs. And I just wanted to double-check that you were
intending to keep splitting out acquisition costs for me.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Matthew, I believe that the intent – and it was the case in the 10-K. I don't think we
intended to communicate vis-a-vis the 8-K that we were discontinuing that practice.

Q - Matthew Berry

{BIO 16846746 <GO>}

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America
Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Thank you. Thanks to you guys for giving us the historical data on the new format. That
was really helpful for our modeling. So appreciate that. I guess let me start with some
questions on the non-insurance piece. Tom, you had mentioned manufacturing had a slow
first – or – what products are we talking about? Is there any particular product where you
saw that sluggishness?

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Sure. There are three lines where we're in the manufacturing world. One, we make the
baking equipment for commercial bakers and those are major installations where a bun

FINAL

that you're going to eat a hamburger on at a fast food restaurant or a loaf of bread
you're going to buy at a store, those are multi-million dollar projects that go over multiple
years. So that's something of a lumpy growth business.
The other business that's lumpy is our dredge business. And we sell dredges that range
in cost from starting probably about $250,000 or $300,000, if you want something for
your backyard, up to something north of $10 million. The $10 million plus dredges, we
would hope – hope – to sell three of those in five years. So, in any one quarter, that can
distort the results quite a bit.
The other business that we have in that area that was affected a bit in the first quarter is
our business that makes truck flooring. Wood prices, in case you follow that, were up. That
compressed the margins a bit and it compressed it a little bit ahead of our opportunity
and ability to get some price increases. So we subsequently had some price increases
there. So that should – it's one of the reasons I'm optimistic about the rest of the year.
But those are the manufacturing businesses that were off to a bit of a soft start in the first
quarter.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That's great. Very helpful. Secondly, with the Abbey consulting business, which shows up in
this other business. There was, I guess, a net loss in the quarter. And I don't know if there
was a seasonality effect there. Or from an annual standpoint, should we expect an
earnings contribution from that business?

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Yeah. I think we would expect – well, first of all, that business supports – it supports the
underwriting business. So we probably aren't looking for massive margins on the
consulting business, because, in effect, it does support our ability to get the insurance
business. But I think, over time, we certainly want to at least cover our costs and make a
little bit on that consulting business. And actually we are looking to add consulting
services. So we would over time maybe even hope to expand the margins on that.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Got it. That's helpful. And then the other piece, which again lost money in the quarter, but
I know it can jump around quite a bit is the run-off business for the life and annuity
business. Can you give us any sense of what your expectation is for an earnings
contribution from that business?

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

And I might actually refer this one to Nora here, who is our Controller. The accounting for
the life business is you're basically amortizing off the discount. And so that number is
pretty set unless you change assumptions somewhere along the lines. So I think it was
about $8 million or so of expense in the quarter. Barring anything unusual, that's about
what we would expect it to be over the next three quarters. And you can – I think of it sort
Page 15 of 18

of like interest expense. It's just amortization of the discount on those life reserves – on
that life liability.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

And I guess the revenue associated with the assets in that business show up elsewhere in

Well, that was received years ago, keep in mind. You've received the revenue and put
them on the books and now you're just amortizing off the discount.

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

We do earn some investment income while we -

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Quite a bit. There is that.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

But the investment income is what I am saying. That shows up elsewhere.

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Q - Jay A. Cohen

there's no other questions, I'll buzz back in.

Operator
There are no other questions at this time. Jay, would you like to ask your additional
questions?

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yeah, if you don't mind. The question had to do with going through a process this year,
where you, I'll phrase it, rebasing the Alterra reserves to fit more with your own approach.
And I remember the exact same thing happening with Terra Nova. And that worked out
really well. Over time, you ended up moving the reserves out of that business. My
question is how long do you believe this process would take to get these reserves on to,
again, your approach for setting reserves?

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

FINAL

Well, Jay, that's, in some ways, unanswerable. And I know that's a non-answer. But the
issue you have is we did a lot of due diligence around the reserves on Alterra's balance
sheet when we bought them. And we felt that they were adequate, maybe even slightly
redundant, but not to the levels that we, at Markel, tend to carry. As we go forward, we're
building a margin of safety on the premium that we earn or we're attempting to build a
margin of safety on the premium that we earn going forward on Alterra.
The question is going to be, how do those reserves that were on the balance sheet on
day one behave? If they behave well, it will take us less time. If we have a little
development out of them, it will take us longer. In general, and if you remember back to
Terra Nova, it takes, I'll say, three to four years to really – on a balance sheet the size of
Alterra's, it will take, I would think, three to four years for us to feel good about those
reserves, the way we feel good about legacy Markel reserves.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yeah. And I seem to recall that three to four years playing out with Terra Nova. I guess I
thought possibly this might be shorter. In that when you bout Terra Nova, it was a very
difficult time in the industry, right. Reserves for a lot of companies were quite short where
I would have suspected that Alterra's reserves, given the industry conditions, were in
better shape than Terra Nova's were back in 2001 or whenever that was.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

I think that is a fair assumption. And we're a year into this. The deal closed May 1 a year
ago. Things have gone well in the first year. But some of these reserves are long-tail. And
I'd like more time to look at them. I hope you're right. And I'd like to see you be right in
that three to four. I'd rather under-promise and over-deliver. And if that happens, we're all
very happy.
