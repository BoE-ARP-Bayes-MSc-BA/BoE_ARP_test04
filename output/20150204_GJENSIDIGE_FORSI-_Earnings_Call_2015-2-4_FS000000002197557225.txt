FINAL

Thank you very much, Janne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for calling in. Yet
again, I'm pleased to present a strong set of ﬁgures, in fact, the best-ever fourth quarter
underwriting result for Gjensidige.
If you look at page two in the presentation, you can see the fourth quarter results where
we reported proﬁt before tax of NOK 1.159 billion and record high fourth quarter
underwriting results for more than NOK 800 million, NOK 807 million. The underlying
premium growth of 5.1% is an important contributor to this result, together with the
benign weather situation in the quarter.
Investment yield is increasingly a challenge. This quarter, the return was 0.7%. The pre-tax
return on equity ended at a solid 23.3% for the full year.
Moving quickly over to page three in the presentation, we will take a look at the year as a
whole. Summarized, we have had a solid growth in premiums and good proﬁt
performance, which had secured that we are delivering on or above all of the ﬁnancial
targets. We delivered a pre-tax proﬁt of NOK 5.4 billion and a strong underwriting result
of NOK 2.9 billion. This is actually the best ever both for pre-tax proﬁt and underwriting
result in Gjensidige.

Bloomberg Transcript

The board has proposed a divided of NOK 2.95 billion, which means NOK 5.90 per share
and a payout ratio just about 70%.
If you turn to page four, you will have – see further information about the dividend. You
know our dividend policy; we aim at delivering high and stable dividends, over time
representing at least 70% of net proﬁt. 2014 is the ﬁrst year this dividend policy is
eﬀective, meaning that the proposed dividend for 2014 should be seen as a starting point
for high and stable dividends going forward. The solid results I have commented and an
assessment of our capital position is basis for the payout ratio. Catharina will comment on
the capital position in more details in few minutes.
Now, on to page ﬁve, where I'd like to tell you about our evolving basis for proﬁtable
growth going forward. This slide is very important actually. Customer orientation is an
important priority for us. And seeing that our customer satisfaction scoring is increasing
means that we're doing something right. In turn, this gives more loyal customers, which is
important in order to keep the cost down. Our loyalty and aﬃnity customers in the private
segment in Norway had been with us for more than 15 years, on average, and hold more
than four products. We intend to keep up the good work to meet our customers'
preferences.
To attract new customers, we have had targeted initiatives in relation to customer groups
where we see a potential. This being for example, customers in the car dealership
channel, where we have unique combination of ﬁnance and insurance. In addition, the
customer dividend model has been marked especially towards those who are not
customers of Gjensidige to increase the knowledge and awareness of the model.

FINAL

In 2014, as you heard on the Capital Markets Day, we enter into a new partnership again
with the Norwegian Automobile Association, NAF, which enters into force from March this
year. NAF will sell Gjensidige products based on leads from Gjensidige, and NAF has a
membership base of 500,000 Norwegian customers, 200,000 of whom are currently
customers, leaving a quite large potential to customers base to work with going forward.
Then looking at renewal within the commercial segment, this is – it has been strong
competition, once again, but given this, we are comfortable within renewals once again.
Summarized, we have a solid platform for continued solid organic growth going forward.
In addition to this, we have continued to make smaller acquisitions through 2014 and in
the beginning of this year in Sweden and Denmark. The portfolio ﬁts in well with the
existing portfolio in these markets and also adds new competences to Gjensidige.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you know, Gjensidige has established a scalable platform, both with regards to group
functions, processes, IP system, pricing, et cetera. We are working on the integration of
new portfolios, adding them to this infrastructure. Then let me make some comments on
the announcement yesterday of the acquisition of PZU Lithuania with €50 million in
premiums.
This will, together with our existing operation, bring Gjensidige to number three position
in the Baltics and our pan-Baltic market share will move from 7% to 13%. In December, we
also decided to strengthen our initiatives in the Baltics; and with this latest acquisition, we
ﬁnally reached critical mass. We see the Baltics as an attractive market going forward due
to several reasons. There's a population of 6.3 million people there. In Norway, we have
just about 5 million people. The infrastructure penetration is low and expecting increase
in GDP going forward is relatively high, 67% compared to the Nordics and Norway, which
is signiﬁcantly lower.
In addition, there is a great potential when it comes to restructuring the distribution. The
three main players in the Baltics now will be PZU, Sampo and Gjensidige, listed players,
and we think this will drive the region going forward in a very eﬀective way. You will see
modern distribution and it will be front for Gjensidige and proﬁtable in the long-term to
take part of this market going forward.
We will implement group processes and best practice into the Baltic business in line with
what we have done in the rest of the group. We will work systematically with the
integration of the business, and we'll take out synergies within areas such as reinsurance
at once, distribution, IT, claims handling and support functions as well as pricing and
targeting.
The synergies are expected to be fully realized by 2018, so this PZU Lithuania is a
restructuring case, and we are conﬁdent that we will take up signiﬁcant synergies within
2018. Closing of the transaction is expected in the beginning of third quarter 2015.
So then, to sum up, you see we made continuous eﬀort to keep our existing customers
and to attract new (8:58) organic growth within – in the long run is expected to be in line

with GDP. In addition, we make acquisitions, which reﬂect our strategy to grow structurally
outside Norway; and in total, the new portfolios we have added into our business
throughout 2014, and now in the beginning of 2015 represents around NOK 800 million,
which is signiﬁcant.

FINAL

So with that, I'll hand the word over to Catharina to brieﬂy comment on the ﬁgures. Thank
you.

Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Thank you, Helge, and good morning, everyone.
If you turn to page (9:37) various contributions to the results. First of all, the underlying
results ended at solid NOK 807 million in the quarter. The strongest underwriting results
we have ever reported for our fourth quarter. And the result is also around NOK 50
million, better than in third quarter, which is quite unusual.
The strong underwriting result is due to good underlying risk selection and pricing, which
contributed to a favorable underlying frequency situation. In addition, the proportion of
large losses was relatively low with a low impact of weather and natural peril claims. In
addition to that, the run-oﬀ gains are higher than in the corresponding quarter in 2013.

Bloomberg Transcript

The Retail Bank and Pension and Savings also showed good underlying proﬁt growth. I'd
like to mention two issues aﬀecting the results in these segments. The bank proﬁt is
marginally weaker this quarter compared with 2013.
Increased revenues and the lower losses were oﬀset by increased costs largely relating to
growth, and the depreciation of IT systems, in connection with the new contract being
signed with a system provider. The underlying proﬁt performance in Pension and Savings
is still good, but was aﬀected by our run-oﬀ expense of NOK 28 million in the quarter.
Investment portfolio yielded 0.7% in the quarter, a satisfactory return given the prevailing
market conditions. The return is aﬀected by weak results for current equities, especially
because of a fall in value of shares in SR-Bank, which was partly oﬀset by a positive
development in property. That together with strong underwriting results the proﬁt before
tax expense came to NOK 1.2 billion for the quarter.
For the year as a whole, the proﬁt before tax expense amounted to NOK 5.4 billion, up
from NOK 4.6 billion in 2013. The main explanation for this development is the favorable
frequency and weather situation as well as higher run-oﬀ gains and that's the most lower
proportion of large losses.
So, moving to page nine; you can see that we have a solid combined ratio of 84.5% in the
quarter. This is a very strong fourth quarter result and also stronger than in the third
quarter where we have a combined ratio of 85.5%. This was driven by favorable weather
and run-oﬀ gains.

FINAL

The cost ratio was 15.3% for the fourth quarter and 15.0% for the year as a whole. We aim
to further reduce the underlying cost ratio. This will be used to increase our investment in
IT, the brand, and expertise in order to ensure our future competitiveness. Going forward,
the reported cost ratio will, therefore, continue to be around 15%.
The claims ratio improved by 7.7 percentage points compared to the fourth quarter in
2013. And the most important explanation for the improvement is a considerably lower
proportion of large losses in this quarter, which explains as much as the 5.4 percentage
points of the improvement.
On page 10, you can see the solid premium growth in – reported growth is as much as
9.4% with an underlying growth of 5.1%. Premium growth of 4% and 3.4% in the private
and commercial segments respectively shows that we are competitive despite the strong
competition in the Norwegian market.

Bloomberg Transcript

The Nordic segment reports growth as much as (13:35) when adjusted for currency
eﬀects. It is especially in the acquisitions, of course, that contribute to growth. In addition,
the conversion of one product in the Gouda portfolio in Denmark from net to gross
recognition had a run-oﬀ eﬀect in the quarter of around NOK 39 million, of which NOK 29
million was due to correction for previous quarters in 2014. Correcting or adjusting for
these eﬀects, the underlying growth is also a very solid 3.9% in the quarter in the Nordic
segment. A lot of the organic growth is due to new commercial customers.
As you can see from the illustration, the Corporate Centre also makes a positive
contribution of NOK 85 million to the growth in the quarter. This is because of
reinstatement premium of minus NOK 8 million was charged to the Corporate Centre in
the fourth quarter in 2013. That was a result of the very extensive natural disaster claims in
that quarter in 2013. Over time, we expect organic growth in line with GDP in our market.
Drop in oil prices in combination with lower interest rates, the weakened Norwegian
currency will aﬀect the Norwegian economy, it's still too early to say and there are forces
working in diﬀerent directions.
We have a limited direct exposure to the oil sectors, and this mainly relates to accident
and health and workers' comp product. If we are to see substantial workforce reduction
within the oil sector or increased unemployment in Norway, this is mainly where we will
see lower activities.
But according to statistics in Norway, we should not expect a signiﬁcant decrease in the
unemployment rate in Norway over the next years.
So, turning to page 11, you can see that we have had a lot of impact from large losses this
quarter, aﬀecting the combined ratio 3.8 percentage points versus the expected level of
5.1 percentage points. The biggest individual loss announced this time was the ﬂooding in
Norway in October, which aﬀected the Gjensidige's results in the amount of NOK 95
million. In the fourth quarter, the year before, large losses aﬀected the combined ratio
with 9.2 percentage points mainly due to several severe storms.

FINAL

It is worth mentioning that randomness can have signiﬁcant eﬀects, of course, on looking
at the weather and large losses. And in January 2015, Norway was hit by storm Nina. And
so far, the total market loss is estimated to NOK 450 million and Gjensidige's share of this
will be around 25%.
So, moving down to page 13, we had a run-oﬀ gain with a positive eﬀect of 4.5
percentage points in the combined ratio in the quarter. It is a relatively high run-oﬀ gain in
the private segment in this quarter. There are several eﬀects that kick in, but part of the
run-oﬀ result is due to the fact that we have used somewhat more conservative estimate
for the capitalization interest rate than what's ﬁnally situated by the Supreme Court in a
ruling in December, and the interest rate was reduced from 5% to 4%.
The illustration on the left hand side on the shares to run-oﬀ gains for the operational
segments, however there is also run-oﬀ gain in the Corporate Centre representing an
eﬀect of 1.2 percentage points from the combined ratio, and this is primarily due to a
reduced estimate from the natural perils pool for expenses related to ﬂows on funds in
2013 where we adjust our provisions correspondingly.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, on page 13, the most important message is that we have delivered on the target of a
cost ratio of 15% by 2015. There has been good cost control in the segment through the
year. The nominal increase in costs has primarily come from the Nordic segment. It is due
to a combination of currency eﬀects and acquired businesses.
So turning to page 14, let's take a look at the capital position. Looking at the rating
requirement from S&P in the graph on the left hand side, we have NOK 1.3 billion of
capital – in excess of the capital requirement and the tactical buﬀer at the end of the year
and that is after deducting the proposed dividend. This is an increase from NOK 1.0 billion
at the end of the third quarter.
Available cash ﬂow increased by NOK 400 million in the quarter and that is due to several
eﬀects. Firstly, the total comprehensive income after deducting the proposed dividend is
added, and this nets to NOK 800 million.
As you can see, the total comprehensive income is about NOK 400 million lower than the
proﬁt after tax, and this is primarily due to increased pension liabilities as a result of
signiﬁcant reduction in the current bond yield that is used when discounting the pension
liabilities.
And in addition, there is a higher deduction from available capital for intangible assets of
NOK 300 million, and that is because of the strengthening of the Danish kroner in relation
to the Norwegian kroner.
At the same time, the capital requirement has increased by around NOK 150 million,
evenly split between asset and liability risk. We have also have some changes occurring
after the balance sheet date. In the graph, on the right hand-side, you can see an
illustration of these changes and how they aﬀect the strategic buﬀer.

FINAL

Firstly, we have now received conﬁrmation from S&P that quantitative credit for the
internal outlook will be included when calculating the capital requirement. Elements in
the calculation used by S&P are conﬁdential that's based on our understanding and used
all the model. This will imply a reduced capital requirement of around NOK 800 million.
The main driver behind this ﬁgure is the diﬀerence between the capital requirement in the
S&P model and the capital requirement in the internal model with deduction (20:20)
Pension and Savings departments.
It is ﬁrstly share of this diﬀerence, which is given us credit in the calculation of the capital
requirements. Secondly, we have made two acquisitions this year: Mondux in Denmark
and PZU in Lithuania. The total capital eﬀect for these two acquisitions will be around
NOK 800 million. As these two events more or less oﬀset each other, you can see that the
net eﬀect on the strategic buﬀer is marginal.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then ﬁnally on page 15, I will comment the investment portfolio, which yields 0.7% in the
quarter. This is seen as satisfactory given the interest rate levels on the prevailing market
conditions. The matched portfolio yielded the return of 0.6% in the quarter that is down
from 0.9% in the third quarter. We have seen a signiﬁcant fall in interest rates in the
quarter and particularly Norwegian interest rates, but also damage interest rate. This
means that we must continue to work hard to ﬁnd good investment opportunities in the
future, but still within the same risk appetite and the same risk limits as before.
Despite the fall in interest rates, the average reinvestment rate for the bonds traded in the
Norwegian held to maturity portfolio was 3.9 percentage on average in the quarter, and
that is up somewhat from 3.3 percentage points in the third quarter. And that is due to –
as we managed to ﬁnd good investment opportunities at the beginning of the quarter,
thus the level has fallen signiﬁcantly since then.
At the end of the year, the excess value in the held to maturity portfolio amounted to as
much as NOK 2.2 billion and that is compared with NOK 1.7 billion at the end of the third
quarter, and NOK 1 billion at the end of 2013. This excess only means that the accounting
return on the portfolio continues to be relatively stable, and is falling more slowly than the
fall in the interest rate level would indicate.
The free portfolio yielded a return of 0.7% in the quarter. It was especially current equities
that recorded a weak result aﬀected by the negative development in the value of the
shares in SR-Bank. Disregarding the SR-Bank holding, the remaining equities yielded a
positive return of 4.9%.
Credit and private equity also showed a weak development. On the other hand, the
property portfolio yielded yet another strong quarter.
So in sum, this resulted in a return on the total investment portfolio of 0.7% in the quarter.
For the year as a whole, the investment portfolio yielded a return of 4.3%, which is on par
with the return in 2013.

And with that, I hand the word back to Helge, who will make some ﬁnal comments before
we open for Q&A.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you. Catharina.
Some very few ﬁnal remarks; if you take a look at page 16, you can see on the left-hand
side ﬁve strategic priorities we presented on to CMD in November. These are areas,
where we see an important to work with in audit to ensure competitiveness and target
achievements also going forward.
On the right hand side, you can see our ﬁnancial targets. Starting this year, the return on
equity target is 15% after tax. The other targets should be well-known. But I'd like to
remind you that we said on our Capital Markets Day in November that we expect to be in
the lower half of the targeted range on the combined ratio, driven by continuous work on
cost discipline and cost monetization. And also remind you that this has given zero in runoﬀ and a normalized level of large losses.

Bloomberg Transcript

Finally in December, I made some changes in the group management including
establishing a new technology and development unit. This was done to ensure that we
develop and improve our business processes, and implement best practice across the
group. In turn, I believe that this will reduce our time to market and hence, support our
competitiveness going forward.
So, with that, maybe I'll just start the Q&A, Janne or-

Janne Merethe Flessum

{BIO 19368607 <GO>}

Yeah. Operator, we are ready for the Q&A, please.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will pause for just a moment to allow everyone to signal. We will take now
our ﬁrst question from David Andrich from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. My ﬁrst question was on the
dividend and in particular, the dividend payout ratio. And I understand this is the ﬁrst year
you're going with the new payout target. And I was just wondering if you could give a bit
more color on the reduction in the payout ratio from 80% to 70% just in kind of the
context of having quite a comfortable capital buﬀer.

Page 8 of 19



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2015-02-04

FINAL

And as a follow-up question to that, I was wondering, are you going to place, I guess,
greater emphasis on the nominal level of the dividend then as opposed to the payout
ratio?
And then, I was just wondering, just sort of curiosity, but in terms of the recent acquisition
you guys did, I guess, how much did the reduction in S&P capital requirements kind of
play into your decision to go ahead with that? And I guess this is kind of a backward way
of asking, were you comfortable with a greater reduction in the strategic buﬀer? Thank
you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I can just start with a short comment, and I can see here that both Catharina and Jostein
can ﬁll in afterwards.
You asked the question if we focus on the nominal level; what we have said should be at
least 70%. But of course, we will focus on the nominal level going forward, but at least
70% and high and stable and nominal payout of dividend.
So, maybe Catharina or Jostein could take you through the reduction from 80% to 70%
and the question afterwards.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Okay. I can give some comment to the dividend payout ratio. Of course, if you look at the
dividend payout ratio in 2013, it was 79%, if you adjust for the write-down of the stake in
Storebrand. And the level of the proposed dividend for 2014 mostly then be seen in
relation to all new dividend policy having a high and stable dividend going forward,
nominal on the number level and also that we now have more optimal capital structure.
But we have paid out 80% since the listing reﬂecting that we had a – or a capital position
with excess capital. And we now wish to build more excess capital.
Today, we are having a more optimal capital structure and a new dividend policy where
the main focus, as you said, is the high and stable nominal dividend going forward. And
the excess capital will be paid out over time to our owners, if there is any, when we look at
the strategic buﬀer.

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yeah. You had a question also about the acquisition, David?

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Yeah, just on the strategic buﬀer. And I guess – I mean basically, I was just wondering how
much of the acquisition decision – or how did the reduction S&P required capital play into
Page 9 of 19



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2015-02-04

the acquisition decision? And I guess like I said, that's kind of a backward way of asking,
were you comfortable with the greater reduction in the strategic buﬀer from kind of the
NOK 1.3 billion level down to the NOK 500 million level essentially?

FINAL

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

You're right in starting the other direction. We had a strategic buﬀer in place to be able to
do these bolt-on acquisitions, and that we are operating in very consolidated markets
both in the Nordic markets and obviously in – as well as in the Baltic. And when we have
this opportunity, we allocated parts of the strategic buﬀer to this acquisition in line with
what we have said about the – where we want to use the strategic buﬀer.

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Okay, great. Thank you, very clear. Thanks.

A - Janne Merethe Flessum

{BIO 19368607 <GO>}

Next question, please, operator.

Operator
We will take now our next question from Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank. Please go
ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. It's Matti here from Danske Bank. Still on the dividend, I was just
wondering, you have awesome underwriting results and very strong buﬀers. So, the only
reasons I could think of that pay a dividend in the low range of – low end of the target
range would be either that you expect earnings to fall in 2015 or then you would like to
leave more room for acquisitions. Were these two things in any way in play when you
considered or when the board considered the dividend proposal for 2014?
Second question is what was the duration and the running yield on the bonds on
amortized cost in the match portfolio? Thanks.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Maybe you can start with the last question for Matti.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yeah. The duration in the portfolio is around 3.5 years, which corresponds to the duration
on the liability side. And so that's the answer to your question about that. If you look at
the running yield in the held to maturity portfolio, it's 4.7 percentage. But of course, the –
going forward as we have now invested at 3.9% during this quarter or during the fourth
quarter, we've seen the yields coming down.

FINAL

Sorry, 4.7% is the running yield in the held to maturity portfolio.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great, thanks. And then the dividend?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah. As we commented both myself and Catharina, we think that the starting point, it's
the right starting point. And it reﬂects a strong year and also the target that it's going to
be high and stable going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

You asked if it's reﬂecting any plans on the acquisition side or falling earnings going
forward. We are in strong position, competitive and that's wise as I commented both in
Norway. And we have strong earnings, and we think we will continue to deliver strong
earnings. It's lots of uncertainty related to regulation in Norway, and you know 2015 is the
year with lots of releases on that topic.
So, it doesn't reﬂect any speciﬁc plans on the M&A side. We think you also should see the
strategic buﬀer and the technical buﬀer slightly in connection going forward in short term.
So, we think actually this was the right starting point, given the strong year uncertainty in
2015, and we will know much more at the end of 2015 related to those other topics.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

When you talk about the uncertainties, is it the natural perils treatment or I mean-

Hi there. Just a follow-up there from Matti's question on the natural perils. I'm just
wondering if there's any update at all that you can provide at this stage. And the second
one was, sorry, Catharina, I missed the – some of the description on the reserve releases. I
heard a bit on the natural perils fund. But just really, if you could try and split out what
came from natural perils fund and what came from elsewhere, and what that – what were
the main drivers of the elsewhere component, I guess? Thanks.

I can start with the gain – the run-oﬀ gains.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you can see on page 13, there are positive run-oﬀ gains from all the segments this
quarter, and a small loss from the Baltic operation. What I commented was that part of the
run-oﬀ gains from the private segment is due to – that we have a more conservative
estimate for the capitalization interest rates. This has been a case that has been handled in
diﬀerent courts in Norway for some years now and the ﬁnal ruling from Supreme Court
came in, in December. The interest rate was reduced from 5% to 4%. And we have, as I
said, somewhat more conservative estimates in our reserves. And this is the kind of
uncertainty that we need to calculate in our reserves on, in – or part of our liability.
And I also commented one extra element, which is not – if you look at the slide, what you
see are the results from each and one of the operational segments. In addition, there
were also positive run-oﬀ gains coming here in the Corporate Centre, which is due to the
Norwegian natural perils pool. They reduced the amount that was relating to funds from
2013. And we just made an adjustment to other provisions correspondingly to the
adjustment that they made from the natural perils pool. We get our market share on the
natural perils events that happened in Norway, and we use the ﬁgures from natural perils
pool to the cost and the liabilities in our books.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I'll comment on the regulatory uncertainty, as you remember from third quarter, the bank
had three main issues. The natural perils fund, the guarantee provision and the possible
tax eﬀect from changes in the solvency regulation. There are no speciﬁc news on these
items compared to last quarter. We are still positive that the resolution will be positive for
us with all accounts. Natural perils fund and the guarantee provision is included in our
available capital ﬁgures as we present them. And we work towards the authorities to try to
get that outcome. That's all I can really say for now.

Q - William F. Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

So just to be clear, it's not that you've become more hopeful that the outcomes will be
favorable. You're kind of thinking it's exactly the same as we were three months ago?

We will take now our next question from Gianandrea Roberti from Carnegie.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good morning from me as well. I have three questions and the ﬁrst one is a little bit
on math that I was doing on your S&P model. I'm calculating – looking at the NOK 15.8
billion, which was the requirement of your S&P model at the end of 2014, dividing that by
the premiums earned of NOK 20.3 billion, you have an implied solvency margin, if I can
call it like this, of 77%, which of course it is very high and it has been discussed previously.
But I'm just wondering if I assume that you grow, let's say, NOK 1 billion premiums next
year, it doesn't really matter if it's right or wrong. But this makes me think that out of that
NOK 1 billion, there is around NOK 770 million, which is an increased capital requirement
in the S&P model, which is of course is very high and limit somewhat your dividend
capacity, if you don't decide to move any other lever there. That's my ﬁrst question.
The second question is regarding to your internal model, I think it was around – the
requirement was around 10.2 at the end of the third quarter and it's 10.8 now. And I'm
sure you have a slide with lots of moving parts. But if you can just recap what has changed
there, it would be interesting. But I also do remember that in meetings, you pointed out
to the fact that in reality, this 10.2 at Q3 was too high because you have added some
buﬀer. The real number was more closer to weight, and that was one of the reason why
you could unleash a little bit more sub debt. If you wouldn't mind explaining that again to
me that would be very helpful.
And the last question, I just want to make sure I understood correctly, is 2.9% the
reinvestment rate right now. I think, Catharina, you mentioned it before, but the line was
pretty bad. Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Okay, Gianandrea. I mean what's your ﬁrst question really if you're thinking of, correct,
around the 77% of capital as a part of premium or I got your reasoning, but I didn't quite
catch your question.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

I mean the question really – I'm just checking. So, all else equal, $1 billion of premiums
growth imply NOK 770 million on this capital model in S&P for you. So, all else equal,
that's what I'm looking at, because it's a very – I mean, it's a very high number so-

FINAL

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I mean, brief comment is that it is a bit too high, because if we have a portfolio growth of
NOK 1 billion, it doesn't – and we can ﬁnally start within our current equity. The amount of
asset-base doesn't grow proportionally. And the NOK 15.8 billion that we present includes
all the assets which are both handled (40:17) by reserves and equity. But it's an
exaggerated if you take those 77%.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Better is of course our capital growth and the capital requirement if we grow by so and so
much in premium. And you can take insurance base part of S&P, and then add something
about that for some asset growth, that's a more likely proxy for how much it costs us to
grow.
Your second question on the internal model, I think when we discussed the CapEx before
subordinated debt, we discussed that that capacity must be seen in line of the capital
requirement of Gjensidige Forsikring, also the parent company. And the ﬁgures of the
group, that's one diﬀerence. And the second one is that we and the board has decided
on a 20% buﬀer to the risk base perspective. That buﬀer is part of the legal capital
requirement. So, when we moved from 10.8 to what is the basis for calculating sort of the
capacity unit of just both those factors.
And as I pointed out, when you compare Q3 to Q4, there are lot of moving parts. And all
of these is that we have now included the NCB Pension Savings business integrated those
in numbers instead of using the current regime of capital eﬃcacy using the Solvency II
regime, using standard formula for NCB and Pension and Savings, which does something
to the numbers there. That's the main comment.

A - Janne Merethe Flessum

{BIO 19368607 <GO>}

And then – sorry.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Sorry. I just had one question, can you tell us, Jostein, what's the standard model capital
requirement for Gjensidige?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

We did present it in the third quarter. We haven't presented that for the fourth quarter.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Well, what was it on the third quarter, just to remind me?

FINAL

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

The excess capital was NOK 4.6 billion in the standard formula. That is the ﬁgures as of
the second quarter 2014. That is what we presented in connection with the third quarter
results. Yes.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yes. And then you asked about the reinvestment rate. It was 3.9%, not 2%. So, we
managed to do some very good investments in the beginning of the quarter. This was
3.9%, but we have seen rates coming down further after that.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

It's also timing that was just – yes.

A - Janne Merethe Flessum

{BIO 19368607 <GO>}

Next, operator.

Operator
We will take now our next question from Jakob Brink, ABG. Please go ahead.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Thank you. I just have a few follow-up questions. Regarding run-oﬀ gains, we have heard
from your Danish competitors, both Tryg and Topdanmark now stating that there's a great
likelihood that run-oﬀ gains will be higher than normal in the years to come, sort of 4% to
6%. Part of Tryg's at least is also from Norway. Are you seeing as well that sort of your
models are overshooting these days? Could you maybe give us some details on that?
And then secondly, coming back to the natural perils pool treatment; I think after Q3, we
discussed that kind of you're ending up in a sort of quite worst case situation, because
you can't issue more tier 2 capital if it's pushed down to tier 2. However, a lot of this
problem is, as Gianandrea just referred to that you have an NOK 8 billion capital
requirement on the internal model.

Page 15 of 19



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA

Date: 2015-02-04

However, would you now use the stand-up model of Solvency II rather than your internal
model? You could have actually room to issue even more subordinated capital. I know this
is kind of a stupid thought, but still it seems like the way you're doing it now is not
optimal. Could you maybe give us some details on that as well, please? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I can start with the run-oﬀ gain – question related to the run-oﬀ gain. As you know, we
have released positive eﬀects lately. It was a special situation in fourth quarter. We have
seen positive eﬀects from run-oﬀ gains last few years. That's partly relating to positive
development within the Norwegian accident and health products and also workers'
compensation in Denmark as you know.
Our policy is best estimate reserving, and that implies sale contribution expected from the
run-oﬀ; that's long term. And also that's important when we price our products. And I
think we also have commented that it's more probably with gains than losses in short,
medium term. So, I think that's the right comment on that question now.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

But you're not seeing any sort of increase to the potential positive margins?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

No, we don't have a comment on that beside what I have said. So, you have the history,
you know where we have had gains the last few years. The pricing of the products is
based on best estimates. Long term, it should be zero and it's more probably with
positive gains in the short, medium term than losses.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

And the answer to your second question is – I mean the short answer is that we feel intent
to apply for an internal model approval. I actually commented a bit in the report, timing of
that is a bit further out than we further expected, but it's not making any major shifts there.
We still think that having the internal model as our legal capital requirement as well will
give us long term beneﬁts around this company.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

But then, I guess my – I could follow up, is Tryg, for example, seems to be willing to even
go below the S&P A rating requirements on capital, if needed. It seems like they have got
sort of an improvement from S&P to do that. I don't know, it seems like you are again –
you're taking a very conservative approach both on the internal model and the rating
base. Yes, I'm just wondering, given that this natural perils pool is now being treated as to
two capital (47:37) most likely, which will then hit your ability to issue subordinated capital.
Shouldn't you maybe consider changing your – the way you're looking at capital?

FINAL

I don't have any comments on what Tryg does or what kind of relationship they have with
S&P. We use the same model. As opposed to Tryg, we can use partly our internal model
to set the capital requirement also from a rating perspective. And they use that as one
measurement of how much capital they need from rating perspective. We're not slaves of
that model (48:26) is really what I'd say.

We will take now our next question from Sami Taipalus from Berenberg. Please go ahead.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned the reinvestment rate
of 3.9% in Q4; it sounds quite high given where interest rates have gone over the year. I
mean I guess in particular it sounds strange at the time I wonder what it was in Q3. So, I'm
wondering just if you could tell us a little bit more about what you've been investing in.
Then second of all, just with regard to the movement in the oil price recently. If I
remember correctly, you've got some unrated bonds related to the Norwegian energy
sector in your balance sheet. Now, if I remember correctly, they're not actually related
directly to the oil sector. But I guess the energy sector will be aﬀected too. Is this anything
we should worry about? Thank you.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

I can comment on the reinvestment phase ﬁrst. It was 3.9 percentage points on average in
the quarter. But what I also said was that we did the investments in the beginning of the
quarter, and we have seen the rates coming down further after that.
So, it's about actually having good timing on the investment that we did in the hold to
maturity portfolio in this quarter. And it's Norwegian bonds, investment-grade bonds,
some municipalities, some real estate, but again, it's about the timing and the rates have
come down after our investment has been down.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Just – sorry, just on that; was it quite small volume of bonds, your investment?

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

Page 17 of 19



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA

We don't invest very much in every quarter. It depends on the, of course, the tactical
reserves or the increase, and also how bonds come to maturity during the quarter. It was
not very much, that's correct. We didn't have very high need for investments in the
quarter. And again, we were lucky with the timing.

FINAL

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Exposure on oil.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yeah. We do not have very much oil exposure in our investment portfolio. If I should point
to anything, it should be the private equity portfolio, part of it being exposed to the oil
sector. But other than that, that's where we'll ﬁnd the direct exposure towards oil.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Okay. In terms of the kind of – there are some hydro power plants and stuﬀ, there's
nothing there that we need to think about, no? Prices in that market will probably follow
oil prices to some degree.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I can comment brieﬂy on your question regarding unrated bonds related to the energy
sector. It's more energy, utilities, energy distribution than energy production. And energy
production have, it's still (51:38) hydro power and we don't really see a big – given that the
very high share of Norwegian energy supply is hydro power, it's not that sensitive to
international oil prices.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Okay. Fair enough.
