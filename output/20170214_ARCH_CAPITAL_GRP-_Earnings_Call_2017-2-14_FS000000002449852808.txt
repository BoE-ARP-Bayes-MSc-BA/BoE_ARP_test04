{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our
fourth quarter and year-end 2016 earnings call. We have a lot to talk about today, so let's
begin with our completing the purchase of United Guaranty Corporation at the end of
2016. The combination of Arch MI and United Guaranty Corporation not only creates the
world's largest mortgage insurer but, equally important, brings a culture of both
leadership and innovation to the mortgage insurance industry that we believe will benefit
our shareholders and customers for years to come.

Bloomberg Transcript

Merging two companies is no small task, but I'm pleased to say that the integration of
Arch MI and United Guaranty Corporation is progressing smoothly. Across our companies,
our employees are working hard to ensure that there will be no disruption to our
customer base in both the bank and credit union channels.
Now, let me turn to year-end results. We had a good quarter despite noise from
acquisition-related expenses and a few other items, which we will discuss in a few
minutes. Our reported combined ratio on a core basis – Mark Lyons will define in a
moment what core means – increased by two points over the fourth quarter of 2015 to
88.8% as cat losses added four points to our accident year results for the quarter.
For the year ended 2016, our combined ratio was essentially flat at 88.2% compared to
88% for the full year in 2015. The full 2016 accident year, excluding cat, improved to 93.4%
on a core basis versus 94.4% for the 2015 accident year. Accident year results were
roughly flat in both our insurance and reinsurance segment despite a softening market
where our mortgage segment improved its accident year combined ratio year-over-year
to 64% from at 84.2% in 2015 year, due primarily to improving profitability at Arch MI.
Even before considering the acquisition, our mortgage segment went from representing
6.4% of net earned premiums on a core basis in full year 2015 to 8.4% for full year 2016. In
the future, these will continue to increase based on our own growth in the business and
the acquisition of the United Guaranty Corporation.
Loss reserve development remained favorable in each of our segments which in the
aggregate reduce our combined ratio by 6.4 points for the fourth quarter and 7.7 points
for the year ending 2016. There were no significant changes that we see in the property
casualty operating environment for the quarter. Marc Grandisson will elaborate on what
we see in each of the markets in a few minutes.

FINAL

On an operating basis, we produced a return on equity of 9.4%, while on a net income
basis, we earn a return on equity of nearly 11% for the full year 2016. Net investment
income per share for the fourth quarter was $0.56 per share, up $0.03 sequentially from
the third quarter of 2016. On a local currency basis, the total return on our investment
portfolio for the quarter was a negative 166 basis points primarily due to the significant
increase in interest rates on our very large bond portfolio. For the full year 2016, again, on
a local currency basis, our total return was a positive 235 basis points.
Our core operating cash flow was $279 million in the fourth quarter as compared to $99
million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our book value per common share at December 31,
2016 stands at $55.19 per share, a 3.5% increase sequentially from the third quarter of
2016 and 15.8% increase from the fourth quarter of 2015. Mark Lyons will give more details
on the components of the change in book value per share in just a few minutes.
Before I turn the call over to Marc Grandisson, I would like to discuss our PMLs which are
essentially unchanged from October 1, 2016. As usual, I would like to point out that our cat
PML aggregates reflect business bound through January 1, while the premium numbers
included in our financial statements are through December 31 and that the PMLs also are
reflected net of all reinsurance and retrocessions we purchased.

Bloomberg Transcript

As of January 1, 2017, our largest 250-year PML for a single event remains the northeast at
$492 million, or 6.6% of common shareholders' equity. Our Gulf of Mexico PML stands at
$427 million, and our Florida tri-county PML decreased slightly to $394 million.
I will now turn the call over to Marc Grandisson to comment on our operating units and
make some remarks on market conditions. Marc?

Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Thank you, Dinos. Good morning to all. First on this 14th day of February, I would like to
wish my wife and daughter the Happy Valentine's Day.

Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

You're such a great father and a great husband.

Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Thank you. As Dinos mentioned, the integration of UG into Arch is going very well.
Culturally, we are finding that the UG team is basically cut from the same cloth as the Arch
team. They have been creative with capital solutions, and we share a pricing philosophy
based on risk assessment and also a dedication to analytics and technology development.
The combined entities, abilities provide us with a strong and we believe sustainable
platform in the U.S. private mortgage insurance space. For the fourth quarter of 2016, Arch
U.S. MI excluding UG had new insurance written or NIW of $8.8 billion, about the same
level as of third quarter's. On a combined basis, we estimate our primary U.S. market

Page 3 of 27

FINAL

share at approximately 25% to 26% for the fourth quarter including UG, which is line with
the third quarter of 2016.
In addition, we continue to lead in the U.S. GSE risk-sharing transactions with
approximately $2.2 billion of risk-in-force at the year-end 2016. Our Australian mortgage
insurance relationship continues to generate good volume. However, we've increased the
level of our Australian quota share retrocession to 37.5% from 25%, for those of you
keeping track, which explains the healthy amount of premiums ceded in the segment this
quarter. With the acquisition of UG, we have multiplied our U.S. primary risk-in-force by
more than 5 times with over 87% of the exposure written up to 2008, a period in which
the underwriting quality of the insurance written has been at its peak. The MI data
containing the quarterly supplement reflects the quality of the combined primary
portfolios with average FICO scores of 743 and a low-90s loan-to-value ratio.

Bloomberg Transcript

We continue to see favorable reserve development from both legacy MI portfolios, and at
the end of the first quarter, we will provide you with more clarity on the progress we're
making with the integration process and fully-combined U.S. MI statistics. Switching over to
the P&C insurance world; the level of rate decrease had slowed somewhat, but it's still
broadly negative. This is especially true for the larger accounts. For that reason, both our
insurance and reinsurance groups continue to move towards less-competitive smaller
accounts and more specialized areas of the market. We continue to move away from lines
such as excess liability, E&S property, and property cat, while focusing our efforts in lessvolatile and specialized lines such as travel, differentiated programs or reinsurance of
agricultural business.
In our primary U.S. P&C insurance operations, we had margin erosion of 40 basis points
for all lines in the fourth quarter and above 100 bps for the full year 2016. For the full year
2016, our controlling and low volatility segment, which represents about 70% of our
primary insurance portfolio had rate increases of 210 bps, while our cycle managed
business, the remaining 30%, experienced 410 basis points of rate decrease. Our UK
insurance operation has experienced similar pressures from a rate level perspective. Rate
decreases across all our product lines were 7.6% this quarter, and just as we have
discussed in the U.S. we continue to shift to smaller accounts.
On a group-wide basis, we had modest growth in the quarter in our insurance segment's
construction, national accounts, travel and alternative markets line. Our executive
assurance, E&S property and casualty businesses are areas where current rate levels lead
us to a more defensive strategy. Turning over to reinsurance; it's a similar story to our
insurance group in that we continue to focus on opportunities with relative rate strength
and more favorable return such as facultative, agriculture and motor, while the more
commoditized segments such as property cat, excess liability and marine continue to
experience rate decreases, and we accordingly are shrinking in those lines. Overall, we
estimate single-digit rate decreases across our reinsurance portfolio. At the heart of
Arch's long-term success, there are two factors. First, we focus on seeking favorable
returns across industry cycle, and then we practice prudent capital and risk management
towards maximizing risk adjusted returns.

Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2017-02-14

As we enter into 2017, we continue to do just that. Within our P&C units, we are defensive
and shifting our risk exposures to relatively more attractive area. With MI, we have made a
strong commitment to one of the best return opportunities available in its specialty area.
And we have also improved the diversification of our risk portfolio. Our corporate culture
and platform of specialty businesses, we believe, allow us to pivot or to move towards
markets where we can earn appropriate returns, while shying away from markets or
business lines where the volatility around expected returns requires a more cautious
approach.
And with that, I'll hand this over to Mark Lyons.

Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Great. Thank you, Marc. And, as Dinos alluded to, there's a lot of ground to cover this
quarter. So on today's call, I'm going to depart from the usual commentary structure and
focus more on the unusual accounting impacts, driven largely by the UGC transaction.
First, I'll highlight just a few items about this quarter, but, as a reminder, the usual quarterly
topics that we usually talk about and comment on, can be found in the earnings release
and the associated financial supplement.
Okay, so now for some summary comments on the fourth quarter, all on a core basis and
as a refresher, as Dinos alluded to earlier, the term core corresponds to Arch's financial
results excluding the other segment, which is Watford Re, whereas the term consolidated
includes Watford Re. Okay, so losses recorded in the fourth quarter from 2016
catastrophic events, net of reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement premiums, was
$34.1 million or 4 loss ratio points compared to 1.9 loss ratio points in the fourth quarter of
2015 on the same basis. The activity was primarily driven by Hurricane Matthew, the New
Zealand earthquake and the Tennessee wildfire.
We believe this continues to highlight our property cat underwriting discipline, as actual
reported losses on cat event continue to correlate with the exposure reductions that have
been implemented over the last several years. As for prior period development,
approximately $55 million, a favorable development, or 6.5 loss ratio points, was reported
in the fourth quarter, led by the reinsurance segment with approximately $42 million of
favorable development, the insurance segment with about $8 million, and the mortgage
segment providing nearly $5 million of favorable development.
The calendar quarter combined ratio on a core basis was 88.8% and when adjusting for
cats in prior period development, the core accident quarter combined ratio was 91.2%
compared with 93.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The reinsurance segment accident
quarter combined ratio, again, excluding cats of 91.2% showed modest deterioration of
110 basis points compared to the fourth quarter 2015, while the insurance segment's
accident quarter combined ratio excluding cats remained flat at 96.3%, but saw an
accident quarter loss ratio increase of 90 basis points offset by a corresponding expense
ratio reduction of 90 basis points.

FINAL

These competitive conditions were more than offset by the continued improving
profitability of the mortgage segment, amplified with their net earned premium being a
larger proportion of the total. The mortgage segment's accident quarter combined ratio
improved to 59.5% from 83.1% in the fourth quarter of last year. And their net earned
premiums represented nearly 10% of the total core net earned premium, compared to
only 6.9% in the corresponding quarter of 2015.
Now, moving on to some of the unusual financial statement impacts this quarter, I'd like to
focus on the UGC transaction as it affected, among other things, reported corporate
expenses, financing expense, book value and our capital structure. The transaction closed
at 11:59 PM on December 31. So, UGC is reflected in our year-end balance sheet, but not
our income statement.

Bloomberg Transcript

As for non-recurring expenses, the company incurred $25.2 million of such expenses
related to the UGC transaction in the quarter, arising primarily from investment banking,
bridge financing and credit facility fees, along with the usual legal, rating agency,
accounting and consulting fees with such banks.
Given the non-recurring nature of these expenses, we have excluded them from
operating income as they are not relevant to our true underlying performance. However, I
would like to provide some alternative insight into our operating income per share by
providing results on three basis, which we feel is important to distinguish: the official
reported operating income per share; and then two alternative pro forma views, which I
will define now. First, we view the official reporting of operating income per share as in the
earnings release as being a hybrid. And by that, we mean it excludes the non-recurring
UGC transaction expenses, but includes the UGC financing cost since we did raise that
additional capital and are obligated to incur interest expense and pay additional preferred
dividends per the terms of those instruments.
The first alternative pro forma view of earnings that I'll get into is as if the UGC transaction
did not occur. This view provides a clear comparative picture to last year's fourth quarter
and the third quarter of 2016 and is likely most representative of views from the Street.
This first alternative pro forma view excludes the UGC transaction expense and excludes
the debt and preferred stock financing expenses and excludes the incremental
investment income gained as a result of raising that additional capital.
The second alternative view provides for this quarter's operating income would include all
non-recurrent expenses and the financing cost and the additional investment income
associated with the transaction. So, the official operating earnings per share to common
shareholders as reported in our earnings release is $1.13 per share. The first alternative
pro forma view, which completely excludes the UGC transaction as respects transactional
expenses, financing costs and additional investment income is $1.16 per share. The second
pro forma alternative view, which reflects as discussed above, all UGC transactional
expenses financing (20:17) costs and investment income is $0.96 per share.
Hopefully, these three views will provide useful information for your analysis of this busy
quarter on the different basis as defined. Okay. So, rather than going through the mind-

Page 6 of 27



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2017-02-14

FINAL

numbing annual and incremental fourth quarter tax rates on a pre-tax operating income
for each of the three views discussed, I will instead provide a 2017 forward-looking tax
rate since the fourth quarter reflects so many unusual impacts and is not indicative of what
could be expected on a run rate basis.
As we have previously discussed, 2017 should provide on an expected basis, higher
mortgage segment income and a different taxable income mix by jurisdiction. As a result,
we anticipate that the expected tax rate for pre-tax operating income in 2017 to be in the
low to mid-teens range without giving any consideration to evolving tax changes,
potentially emanating from the Trump administration. This preliminary range is primarily
driven by varying jurisdictional profit assumptions, cat loss assumptions and varying loss
ratios.
Having said all these, the annual tax rate on pre-tax operating income for 2016 as
reflected in our official earnings of $1.13 per share was 5.2%, which caused a fourth quarter
incremental tax rate or pre-tax operating income of 2.1%. This reflects an approximate $5
million true-up tax benefit for the first three quarters of the year or nearly $0.04 per share
to achieve this 5.2% annual tax rate.

Bloomberg Transcript

Since the 2016 fourth quarter results only partially reflect the additional effects of the UGC
financing transactions, it makes sense to provide a run rate for interest expense as well as
for preferred dividends. Total interest expense for 2017 is expected to be $24.9 million
per quarter. This reflects new and prior debt issuances, as well as borrowings under our
credit facility.
Similarly, the run rate for quarterly preferred dividends also from new and prior issuances
is expected to be $11.4 million per quarter. This does not contemplate any potential
actions being taken on our $325 million of series C preferred that becomes redeemable
beginning in April of 2017.
Lastly, as a result of the UGC acquisition, we took the opportunity to conform accounting
standards between the segments as a respect to deferred acquisition expenses. As a
result, book value was negatively impacted by $0.31 a share due to the charging off of
previously capitalized deferred underwriting-related expenses, largely through
shareholders' equity with a small portion through the income statement.
As a respect to our capital structure in connection with the UGC transaction, we raised
capital in 2016 as reported on last quarter by issuing $450 million of 5.25% non-cumulative
perpetual preferred. And in December, we raised $950 million of debt by issuing 10-year
and 30-year vintages.
We also tapped our credit facility for $400 million and utilized roughly $384 million of
internal cash resource. We also issued series D convertible preferred common equivalent
shares to AIG at a fair market value of approximately $1.1 billion.
Before I get into our updated capital structure ratios, it's important to understand how
we've accounted for the new equity issuance. There are no restrictions to ownership of
Page 7 of 27



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2017-02-14

FINAL

these shares by AIG, except for the passage of time as a respect to certain lock-up
provisions. And these shares rank equally in all material respects to our existing common
shares.
The series D convertible preferred common equivalent shares are being treated in our
calculation of book value as if they are common shares. Therefore, the approximate $12.8
million common equivalent shares issued to AIG are added into our common share
account to determine book value per share now totaling 135.6 million shares.
GAAP common equity at 12/31/2016 is approximately $7.5 billion and total GAAP capital is
approximately $10.5 billion. On a GAAP basis, our total debt to total capital ratio is 21.3%
and total debt plus preferred to total capital is 28.7%. Accordingly, December 31, 2016
book value, as Dinos has mentioned, per share is $55.19 which represents 3.5% increase
over the prior quarter and nearly 16% over year-end 2015.

Bloomberg Transcript

Book value per share primarily grew as a result of the $1.1 billion of series D common
equivalent shares issued to AIG as mentioned earlier. We issued those shares at a priceto-book multiple of approximately 1.61x. And accordingly, our book value gains in
immediate accretive benefit of approximately $470 million at issuance.
Now, since we made commentary today about operating income per share excluding the
impact of the UGC transaction, it's only fitting to provide the corresponding impact on
book value per share as well that excludes the series D common equivalent issuance to
AIG, eliminates the debt and preferred financing costs, the UGC non-recurrent
transactions, investment income differences and other conforming adjustments. So,
basically, as if UGC hadn't occurred. Book value per share excluding the UGC transaction
would have fallen by 2.1% or a $1.12 per share.
We did not repurchase any shares during the fourth quarter of 2016 and don't anticipate
repurchasing any during 2017. Our remaining authorization which was due to expire on this
December 31 has been extended to 12/31/2019, but the amount remains the same at
$446.5 million.
Additionally, as a respect to the acquisition, we recorded approximately $189 million of
goodwill on the books or $1.39 per share and have established an additional $507 million
of intangible assets as of December 31, 2016. $480 million of which are subject to
amortization. We anticipate that this associated amortization to be the highest in calendar
year 2017 at approximately $110 million, then decline thereafter such that approximately
75% of the amortization will be recognized within five years. I refer you to page 7 of the
earnings release to see more information about these intangible assets.
So, with these exhausting introductory comments out of the way, we're now prepared to
take your questions.

Hi. Good morning.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Hi, Sarah.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Now that the United Guaranty acquisition is closed, I wanted to get your thoughts on the
potential for any additional expense savings or upside on the earnings accretion. I know
the accretion of over 35% included some expense savings, but if you could provide any
more exact numbers on that, that would be very helpful.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, first and foremost, let me remind everybody that we didn't make the acquisition on
the basis of expense savings. As you probably will know, that with any merger of two
companies, there is significant redundancies which we're going to experience over the
next two years as we put the companies together.
Our focus is mostly on making sure that our customers don't get disturbed, so we
continue to provide the service together, bringing the two companies together with an
eye that if we can improve the expense ratio by saving, we will do it and we will continue
reporting to you on a quarterly basis what those savings are.
I don't like to make projections, because sometimes when you make projections, you
might make your predictions come true and make the wrong management decisions. I
rather have our people free to make the right decisions as we bring the companies
together on a week-by-week basis and that's the basis we're going to run the integration.
Mark, you want to add to it or...

A - Mark D. Lyons

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Okay.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Okay. That's fair. Thank you. And then also, how should we be thinking about the size of
the combined premium base for the company taking for United Guaranty and AIG's
Page 9 of 27



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2017-02-14

mortgage business, taking into account how much will be non-renewed as well as the AIG
quota share?

FINAL

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Okay. Well, there's two points here. One, there will be some actions on our part. Mostly
what we said in the past that I think probably a participation in singles will probably get
reduced a bit over time. Having said that, there might be some action by our customers,
because they might feel that the combination of the two companies might create some
overlay and significant exposure. Based on our analysis, the latter doesn't seem to be a
problem. It seems that there wasn't a lot of overlap between us and United Guaranty. So, I
don't expect that to be much. And then, I believe that long-term as we said before, we
expect our market share to come down in the low 20%s, it can be anywhere from 22% to
24%, we are at maybe 25%, 26% today.
I don't see a significant change in that, that it will be dramatic quarter-over-quarter. It's
implementing our pricing strategies that we're going through now in combining the riskbased pricing of the two companies together. And don't forget, a mortgage business is
more global in nature, you're only focusing on the MI (30:59) in the U.S. So, we take how
much we're going to write in mortgage from a global point of view, including the bulk
transactions, our Australian business and our European business.
So, Marc, you want to elaborate a little bit further?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

One thing I would echo on this is also the 2016 was a bit higher in the last half of the year,
because of the refinancing slew (31:21) that we got. So, the market overall expect a slower
market in 2017. That's something you need to keep in mind. So, generally, the way we
look, the high level look at the premium that can be generated by the portfolio is you take
the insurance in fourth which we provide in our supplement and you can ascribe a 50 bps
roughly rate to it. And that's what gives you the run rate as to what kind of premium you
get per year. And you could put some persistency around it which you've heard on other
calls as well, 75%, 76%. And then, this is how you sort of get to the run up of the portfolio
and then you ascribe some new written for this year based on your view of the market,
which really at this point in time is very, very difficult to see, have any clarity on.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thank you. That's very helpful.

Operator
Our next question comes from Quentin McMillan with KBW.

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks very much. I just wanted to talk about the mortgage
business and the Australian contract that you have ceded. It looks like the net-to-gross in

Page 10 of 27

Date: 2017-02-14

FINAL

that portfolio dropped down the last two quarters in kind of a 60% to 70% range. And I'm
kind of just curious whether that was sort of one-off because of the Australian contract or
do you expect to sort of retain a little bit less of that business as UGC earns in? And
potentially, would you look to maybe retain a little bit more of the Australian when it
comes back up for renewal if the terms look attractive again next year?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, I mean, the terms, they're attractive in Australian business, otherwise we wouldn't
be there. But our attitude is we look at all of our business. I don't care if it's insurance,
reinsurance, mortgage insurance and we have a risk management perspective about
aggregations, how much we want to have either in a particular territory, et cetera, et
cetera. Our desire or ability to reinsure part of the book, it comes out of that process
when we sit down internally at the senior management level with our chief risk officer and
his team and we look at all of our aggregations, we make those determinations.
So, we purchase, as Marc said, 37.5% quota share going back to inception for our
Australian book, and that was a judgment that we made – that judgment might change in
the future, but it's a decision we make on a lot of stuff here including how much
retrocession we buy in our reinsurance book, on our cat book, et cetera. It's part of our
risk management methodology. So, Marc, elaborate a little more on this.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. The quota share goes back to May of 2015, and it's on for three years. So, the panel
has been set and the reason we had more session this quarter was because of the catch
up. We went from 25% session to 37.5%, so that 12.5% additional premium ceded has to
be retroactively ceded back to our partners. And this is exactly what we did this quarter.
We have also good partners with us alongside bring some value in terms of knowledge of
the markets and capital and are helping us, as Dinos said, just right-size the overall risk on
the balance sheet. At this point in time, there is no plan to change. If somebody else
would want to take more of it or help us provide some structure, we are, as usual, always
interested entertaining such things. But, right now, there's no plan to change.

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

And, Quentin, let me just – just for clarity, given what Dinos and Marc have said, neither
the third nor the fourth quarter of this year are indicative in a run rate basis. Both of them
had the retroactive cumulative catch-up as Marc alluded to. So, on a go-forward basis,
assuming there's no changes to that in a multi-year nature, any new premiums arising in
2017's first quarter, you should expect a 62.5% net arising from those out of Australia and
a 37.5% ceded.

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

All right. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then, moving to the investment portfolio, I asked
this last quarter as well, but you guys last quarter had about a 2% yield and expecting the
UGC portfolio to earn in at about 3.5% yield. Is the assumption sort of similar now and
how much impact might that have and what are your sort of expectations to what you will

do with the portfolio over the next couple of quarters as that higher yielding book earns
in?

FINAL

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

I think, a couple of things. First off is the composition of that portfolio was markedly
different than what Arch had natively. It was longer duration in nature. It was made up
much more heavily with municipals and corporate credits and lower rated corporate
credits. And that will be changed over time. It's going to be a little bit – in fact, some of
that's already occurred in the beginning of this year. And that will take a little while to do,
because a lot of it's onshore. So, there's tax consequences to everything. So, you've got
to be mindful on how it's done. But, I think over time it will conform a lot more closely to
the Arch portfolio in the regard. Dinos?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yeah. The only thing I will add is there is a tax component that we have to be mindful of it,
especially having more income emanating from the U.S. which is taxable at a very high
rate depending what happens with the tax law. And we might not change the municipal
component, which is giving us some tax relief, so all that is being considered. We have our
teams in the investment department and our finance and tax people looking at
restructuring the portfolio. But, over time, it's going to look more like the Arch portfolio,
high credit quality, probably a shorter duration. But having said that, we got to take also
into consideration the tax considerations.

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

Thanks, guys. If I can just sneak one more modeling thing in, just you gave a lot of
guidance there. In terms of integration costs, do you have any updated estimate of what
that might be for 2017?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Let me reiterate what I just said before. Integration cost, you have cost upfront and then
you have significant savings later on. We didn't do this transaction because we had some
spreadsheet that says this is going to be wonderful and you're going to have all these
kind of savings. We did it because it made a lot of sense going forward, buying a business
that it has tremendous potential for earnings. It fits. It's a specialized product that I think
we can create value with it.
Having said that, our teams, they're going to look at maximizing synergies, like I said,
without affecting customers and volume as we go. So, depending how much we do, you
will have the expense upfront and then the savings that come commensurate to that. But I
want our teams to have freedom to make the right management decisions and we'll let
the accounting take care of itself.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

At a high level, though, it's a timing issue really. As Dinos pointed out, we will have some
synergies that we'll be able to extract some cost from, but I think the best thing I can tell
Page 12 of 27

FINAL

you is depending on the glide path that you think we'll be able to execute on, the longterm ratio of rate of expense of a typical MI company is a 25% to 30%. So, that's probably
what I would use as an endpoint, depending where that endpoint is for in your mind, as to
how well and how quickly we can execute. But again, the speed of execution is not going
to come at a cost of losing customer and losing culture and losing the spirit of our
company.

So I'm assuming the priority would pay down some of the debt. And also, absent like
what's your comfort level in term of debt-to-capital ratio, as well as if you're going to 2018
when the buybacks come, would you be prepared to do the buyback in sort of like a
common preferred or more in the open market?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, let me start with 2017. 2017, we did say to the market and to the rating agencies, we
will not buy back shares. So 2017, it will be a year for us that we're going to take the
earnings, we're going to retain those earnings, and basically we're going to start
rebuilding some firepower on our balance sheet. Having said that, I don't know where
2018 is going to be. When I see the year-end 2017 numbers, we'll make then some
decisions.
We want to maintain very good relationships with the rating agencies. They've been very
fair with us in analyzing not only the transaction with us but the future plans, what we will
need to do over the next three years. From our past history, you will know that we try to
maintain a conservative balance sheet without a lot of debt on it, so we can have
firepower in case markets change so we can take advantage of it. So that's the overall
strategy now. With that, I'll turn you over to Mark Lyons, who has more of the details. He
does that analysis for all of us on a day-to-day basis. So Mark, go.

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Sure. I think, Kai, on an overall basis, we said this publicly, is that over a three-year period,
we expect to be south of 20% on Moody's adjusted leverage ratios, which, as you may
recall, our preferred catastrophe treatment's a (43:02) 50% equity credit, so when you go
back and noodle it, you can see how we're thinking. So that's going to be accomplished
by a shrinking numerator and an increasing denominator. So both of those are going to
go, and because we pulled $400 million out of the credit facility, which is more flexibility,
that's likely the target area that if we're going to differ and have the ability to pay back
sooner than planned, it'll go to that area.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Lastly, if I may, is on the U.S. tax reform. And just want to get your guys
perspective on banning both a lower corporate tax rate and border adjustability, and also
the new bills in the Congress. How would that impact your business going forward?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, I mean, first, let me start with the first one. A lower tax rate, it's good for business. I
mean, at the end of the day, I'm in the minority, but I strongly believe that corporations
should pay zero tax and let their shareholders pay the tax when eventually corporation
Page 14 of 27

FINAL

has to distribute it through dividends or through shares, funds to their shareholders and
they're all full tax payers, so let them collect their tax on that basis. But put that aside, a
reduction in the corporate tax rate is positive, especially with the United Guaranty
Corporation acquisition, which is going to increase our domestic or U.S. earned income. So
that's a positive.
The other two, they're hypothetical. The border adjustment tax, I don't know what's going
to happen, and if it will influence transactions between reinsurers. To me, reinsurance
transactions cross-border is more exporting risk rather than importing capital. So at the
end of the day, without knowing the details, very, very, very hard to project as to what the
effect is going to be. But the kneel wheel (45:18) has been around for a long time. I don't
know what's going to happen, but we have alternatives to that. We're multi-faceted, and
we're global in nature. So at the end of the day, depending on this hypothetical, we'll
react to it if it happens.

Q - Kai Pan

Our next question comes from Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Market.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Good morning.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Hey, Chuck.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Hey, so just like some thoughts on – you talked about risk management, I think in the past,
you guys have talked about mortgage now really feeling out kind of three legs of a stool.
But mortgage has got a different risk profile than us P&C people are used to thinking
about with PML, and maybe greater exposure to economic risk. As we think about the
mortgage business here, how do you think about it from a risk perspective and what's the
ability to grow, be it globally, be it from GSE transactions? Is there still capacity to expand
it, or do the other leg of the stool need to expand some further? Just how the
relativeness between the three divisions and the relative size on a risk basis, and how you
guys are thinking about that?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

FINAL

Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2017-02-14

Well, let me start with the premise that our brains work in a fashion that, I don't care what
you do, you have to understand what your PML is. And you've got to be comfortable on
the basis of the balance sheet you have, and are you comfortable with the setting of how
much PML you can take within the balance sheet. The fact that, historically, MI companies
might have not looked at it from that perspective is not relevant to us. So the task that I
have assigned all of our teams, and I personally work with them, because that's a
significant bet we're making in another line of business, we should have a methodology of
calculating PML. And we do within the third iteration of the model that calculates the
aggregation of risk, including both underwriting risk within a mortgage business and also
macroeconomic risk, changing unemployment, housing prices, et cetera, et cetera, and
we stress-test that to see as to what kind of outcomes we have and how much of that we
are willing to take within our balance sheet.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, we have also brought other tools that they were not traditional, and some of the
other MI companies, they're starting to use them as well. You don't have to retain all the
risk on your balance sheet. There is reinsurance transactions you can bring. There is capital
market transactions you can bring to bear to manage the risk. So that's the concept that
we have. We use it with our cat business. We use it with our P&C and our reinsurance
business. We tie retro in different segments. It could be marine. It could be aviation. So we
use the same approach because that's our DNA. Our DNA is bring in the risk, understand
how much you're taking, risk manage it to the point of comfort, and see if you have more
than what you want than either reinsure it out or use capital market transactions to bring it
down to an acceptable level. It's the old saying. I use the expression my father taught me.
He said, son, I don't care how good the meal is, don't eat too much because you're
getting digestion. So we're not a company that is going to over line on risk to the point
that I can't sleep at night or, Marc and Mark cannot sleep at night. We sleep like babies.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Will you guys be willing to provide – so in your traditional P&C businesses, you talk about
tri-county, you talk about northeast, we think about wind exposure and PMLs on 1 in 250 or
1 in 100. Will there be some kind of basis for you to explain to us how these metrics are if
it is on unemployment, or on GDP or on interest rates so that we can have some
comparability on risk?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yeah. We might do that in the future. And the reason I'm hesitant is that, it's not because
we don't like to disclose to you guys a lot of stuff we do, but we don't want to wake up
our competitors to understand what we're doing either. And to tell you the truth, we're
still in the process with the rating agencies of going back and forth in them understanding
all of our methodologies and all the good work we've done. And we haven't come to a
complete agreement with that as of yet in those discussions. So we're hoping that this
year may be we sooner than later, we'll get to some understandings in sharing our
thoughts and our methodologies. And some of the methodologies actually we're using
we're taking from them. We look at how they look at mortgage risk, and we try to bring it
in.

Page 16 of 27



FINAL

Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2017-02-14

But the basis of our PML analysis it goes to both; one, things that we can control,
meaning, underwriting quality of the mortgages we insure and the pricing we apply to
them, and what those potential outcomes are; and second, microeconomic factors that,
what if the unemployment rate goes to 15%, what if housing prices collapse by 25%, by
30%, and how rapidly they collapse, and we model all that and then we come up, and
there is a lot of other factors. We might share with you maybe some of our
methodologies at our investor conference. This way you know our deep thinking into
these issues, but I'm not ready yet to be start putting our PMLs out for our competition to
know.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

That's fair. I guess, just a follow up on the mortgage, I guess, any thoughts on new
Treasury Secretary, commentary about getting Fannie and Freddie out of government
ownership, will the expectation for you guys be that the speed of GSE derisking would
accelerate for those companies to come out? Is that how you guys think about that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, there's two constants that I think, in our thinking is; first and foremost, there is
pressure by Congress to put more mortgage risk to the private markets. So that's a
constant. The other constant is. I think there is a recognition by our elected officials that
securitization without the ultimate guarantee of the federal government is not possible.
So those things we don't believe they're going to change. Now, are the GSEs privately
owned and/or controlled by – I don't think, those two factors, they're going to change. So
at the end of the day, for everybody who is involved in the mortgage guarantee business,
it's positive because there is, independent if you're a Republican or Democrat, there is a
movement to put more risk into the private hands and eliminate the tax payer who've
been the guarantor of these mortgages. The exemption to that is the FHA who still, I want
to remind you guys, it has probably between the FHA and the VA, they got more than
what 55%, 57% of the market. So in essence, we do have the tax payer funded facilities
competing in the private market. So that to me is more of a concern than what we do on
the private side. But I think the future is pretty bright. Marc?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. The indication that we get, Charles, from talking both the GSEs, and certainly
there's various projects and various products that you've heard that were initiated this
year, it has more on the horizon. Clearly, the mandate from the GSEs is to be utilizing
more of the private market. Absent – we've heard that the new world order in GSE is for
five years or six years now. I guess, we'll get to a landing at some point, but I echo what
Dinos has said. There's clearly no stopping them trying to leverage their positioning, and
utilizing the third party in a private capital to help make that a vibrant market. It's clearly
pointing in our direction.

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

And Chuck, I would just add on the GSE because you were asking a pretty broad question.
On the GSE credit risk transfer side, when you look at the balanced score cards that are

Page 17 of 27

out there and what the Congress expects of the GSEs, there's no dropping off of that. It's
a good signal of a continued transfer.

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Hi, Jay.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Hey, Dinos. Two questions. The first is on the tax rate that was very helpful to give the
2017 number. I know you're not giving an 2018 number. But directionally, and let's assume
for a second that the corporate tax rate doesn't change, so kind of an as-if basis, as you
get into 2018 and 2019, would you expect the tax rate to come down because of things
you will be doing internally?

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Wow, that's loaded. If I could forecast the P&C underwriting cycle, I'd be a gazillionaire. But
keeping everything constant, if there is no change at all, there should be minor drift in the
aggregate effective tax rate because there should be incrementally more mortgage
income associated with it. But that is a very rough and lack-of-confidence number. To the
extent that there's changes in any submarket, we're going to allocate and put capital
there and that'll change our effective tax rate. And if it's cat, for example, it's going to be
Bermuda-centric which is going to drive it down. So that's the best I can tell you.

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

No, that's helpful. I just didn't know if there were things you will be doing internally to
affect that tax rate just structurally in term of reinsurance or something?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

There might be a few things we do on the investment side. I mean, it's all – it's part of the
restructuring of the portfolio, maybe there is a little more municipal exposure on the
investment side because it eliminates some of U.S. tax. But that doesn't move the needle
Page 18 of 27



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2017-02-14

that much. You're probably talking about a point or so. It's the difference between 11 and
12 or 12 and 13 (57:38) so...

FINAL

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

Got it. And the other question was, one of the things the new administration did was they
suspended the price cut on the FHA premium. This wasn't a big deal when they were
proposing cutting it, but how do you see that affecting you?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, it affects the market in general, right? The FHA is and the VA is competing with the
private markets. And don't forget, they have a tremendous advantage. Their capital
requirement is 2%, so they, in essence, they're writing 50:1 where we're at 15:1 or less. So,
it's very, very tough sometimes to compete with Uncle Sam. But to us, that's positive
because that reduction in our view we would have put more pressure on eventually the
taxpayer and by – yes, reducing the cost to the consumer, but also, I'm not so sure that
those rates with those kind of risk, it was sufficient to cover the exposure.

A - Marc Grandisson

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

There is some movement, Jay, right now that the GSEs are sort of – the FHA's purpose is
really to get home ownership to people that otherwise wouldn't have access to, so
there's clearly a response on the GSE with Home Possible. There's a couple of programs
that they're putting in place and are starting to implement that will hopefully try and
attract and address that specific segment, so it's a bit away from the FHA to try to get
into that segment as well which is, again, good news for us because it would be – most of
it would be conforming and needing private MI attached to it. So overall that, to echo
again what Dino just said, that move was seen possibly by us, but again we want to
caution everyone that we're always one decision away from one of these directors to –
yet again, put some other rate decrease, but that's the nature of the business that we're
in.

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

That's okay. I can handle it. I'll compare notes with you next time I see you. See how good
my guess is. You can grade me on it. I do sit in the back of the room, but I take good
notes. Just on that topic, as we're talking about disclosures for UG, would it be possible to
give us some time before next quarter's earnings, say, a four quarter trailing pro forma
mortgage insurance segment? I know it's possible. I guess I'm asking is it realistic.

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yeah, I...

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

We could discuss offline if you like, but that's a request.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Well, literally it's the starting point because of the debt and the preferred that we had to
issue for the prospectus has the actual UGC information in it that can use as a baseline,
because, as you know, this segment on the prior owner reporting was beyond UGC to
take back...

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Right.

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

... their quota share (01:03:35). So, that, I think is a useful starting point. Yeah.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Okay. And then just lastly, on the comment on the tax of low to mid-teen, does that
assume that you will have a 50% quota share on the entire U.S. MI business including UG?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

It does.

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

It does.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

FINAL

Forward. Yeah.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Right. Okay. And, I guess, this isn't an issue for 2017, but if you want to go out to 2018 or
2019 or whatever, if there were a change in U.S. tax rules where something like the Neal
Bill happened, any sort of sense of what the sensitivity of that tax rate is?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, without knowing what the bill is going to say, I can't model it for you. But tell me what
the bill is going to say and then I'll model it.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Fair enough, fair enough. Okay. I guess I wondered are there the same opportunities that I
think you've hinted at with the P&C business, could they be applied to the MI business as
well? Or was that really something that only would work on the P&C business?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I don't totally understand the question.

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

What do you mean, it's sessions from P&C versus MI?

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Right. I mean, are there are other places you can send stuff to I guess, other balance
sheets you could use like that?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

So look, believe me, my door is breaking down by people that want to get a piece of our
MI business as reinsurance. Depends how – what kind of terms you negotiate. Do you
share in the profit or not, it's a lot of alternatives. We react to what the actual law is and
we abide by the law. And then we maximize for our shareholders the potential outcomes.
So, not knowing that, is so very hard. But there is alternative, yes.

Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi. Yeah. Thank you. Just a couple of quick questions, first off, the intangibles that we were
just talking about, the $110 million, are those going into net or operating earnings?

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Well, since that's a 2017 item, in all honesty, we are debating the alternatives, but I believe
you can count on us being more transparent, more likely having it itemized in a way that
lets you flip it however you choose to look at it.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

So, when you guys talked about the deal, I guess the accretion 35%, was that including or
excluding the amortization?

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

It was including.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then in terms of the PMLs, I know, Dinos, you had mentioned how you guys are
talking about kind of calculating the aggregate risk including the mortgage exposure. So,
as we think about potentially a harder market on the cat side, obviously, it doesn't seem
like that's anything you guys are expecting. I guess the right assumption would be that we
would never really see 25% of your capital going to cat business because now we have
this greater mortgage exposure that you're also counterbalancing against your capital.
How are you guys kind of, I guess, thinking about how that kind of all comes together?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, my authority and the senior management authority from the board is, we can't
expose more than 25% of our equity capital on any line of business. That will include MI.
So, that's the maximum we can take on a PML basis. If we want to take more, we have the
opportunity but it will be, I bet you, a very, very long discussion with our board. And then,

Page 24 of 27

jointly, we'll make a decision. And if we make a decision to be something different, we will
tell the market about it. So, right now, that's what we are operating under.

FINAL

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then one last question on the, I guess, the pricing side. As we think about
higher inflation just overall for the industry, I mean, kind of where you guys pointed to, it
seems like still kind of deteriorating on the primary insurance side. Do you see people
starting to think about pushing for more price, as we think about higher inflationary levels
or you're thinking it will kind of be like what we've seen in prior cycles where as we get
companies pushing for price after inflation shows up within margins?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yeah. Unfortunately, we don't see price increases. I'll give it to Marc for more color. But I
think there is a time delay. And basically, I think is, it's the other metrics that usually cause
us to – all the other industry, I'm not talking us specifically, but the industry to change is
when loss cost inflation, which is not always correlate with the economic inflation starts
showing up in the numbers, how well the reserves are behaving. Those are the kind of
things that cause adjustment to pricing.
For now, I'm not sensing any adjustments to pricing. You saw we reported that for some
of our business, we're getting some price increases, but for a lot of them, we get
decreases. And in the aggregate, we're negative not positive. So, Marc?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I think that the difficulty that we're running right now is most people are looking at our
portfolio and we've had a very benign trend for the last five or six years. And a lot of your
projections or the way you will price your business going forward is dependent on the
historical not on the forward-lookings. It's very, very hard to predict what the future
inflation will be.
There's a tendency for an underwriting unit or an underwriting company to sort of assume
the same old trend will carry on for a little while. That explains why it – the delay and the
lag in recognizing trend. And it's especially acute if you are on the excess of loss, if you're
excess of a certain threshold, say $3 million, $4 million, $5 million or $10 million. This will be
further delayed.
So, unfortunately, we're not seeing big reaction to this. I would also add, a lot of people
are expecting yields to pick up and interest rates to increase more, possibly more
investment income in the future. So, they're sort of buttressing a little bit that rate
deterioration that we're seeing in the moment.

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Elyse, I'll just throw something as well. We're more concerned with loss cost trend.
Sometimes that's frequency-driven, sometimes that's severity-driven. And your question
was more severity-driven. But the sense that it's that class-rated business isn't primary, its
Page 25 of 27

frequency tends to drive it and you can sharpen your pencil a lot more and so do the
competitors. What is long-tailed, long duration, excess in marketing sample, rationalization
takes over. And it's not necessarily correlated as much.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thanks again.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

And don't forget, traditionally, the markets don't turn on these technical analysis and
evaluation. The market turns when you have more fear than greed. It's the two emotions
that determine the market. We have excess capital. There is a lot of people accepting –
meet single-digit returns. They view that as acceptable for the risk business, which I think
is insanity, in my view. And at the end of the day, I don't see fear in the market yet. When
you start seeing fear in the market, that's when you're going to see rates move up. And
we don't see it yet.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And thanks for the answers. And congrats on getting the deal done at 11:59.
