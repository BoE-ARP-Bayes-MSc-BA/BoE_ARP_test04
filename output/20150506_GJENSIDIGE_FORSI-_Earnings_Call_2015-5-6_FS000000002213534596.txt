Thank you, Janne. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for listening in today. I'm
pleased to present a strong set of ﬁgures once again and a solid start to the year. I will
comment very brieﬂy on the results and then give one update on the largest segments
Private in Norway, Commercial in Norway and then the Nordic segment.
If you turn to Page 2 in the presentation, we reported solid proﬁt before tax expense of
NOK987 million and underwriting result of NOK417 million. The premium growth was
4.3% in the quarter and the combined ratio was 91.9%, and this is discounted 89.9%.
The proﬁtability was a bit better than can normally be expected in the ﬁrst quarter. This is
mainly as a result of a favorable weather situation. The ﬁnancial result was NOK521 million
and annualized return on equity then was 13.5% after-tax. Catharina will come back to the
ﬁnancial results afterwards.

Then turning to Page 3. I'm very pleased to conﬁrm that we have continued our strong
competitiveness in the Norwegian retail market. We are able to combine good
proﬁtability with a high degree of customer satisfaction. And as you can see, Gjensidige's
total market share in Norway in the past three years has stabilized at around 25% in a
competitive market with a steady increase of new players. And the Gjensidige continues
to be the insurer contacted ﬁrst by most for a quote. Within the retail market in Norway,
we experienced the same stability in market shares. We report an underlying to a 2.5%
growth in premiums in the private segment.
As previously communicated, premium increases continue in line with long-term claims
inﬂation, but selective market initiatives in an attractive segments mean that average
premium increases are lower at the moment. And as we have communicated before, the
long-term claims inﬂation estimate is between 1% and 3% for motor, and around 4% for
property.
Every day, we do targeted initiatives towards selective customer groups, such as the
(03:24) customers and families with small children among other things through value
adding services, ensuring that Gjensidige is relevant in the customers' everyday life. And
this builds loyalty and preference.
Furthermore, strategic cooperations with partners such as the Norwegian Automobile
Association and Toyota strengthened our distribution power. We have taken a big step
together with the bank in the car dealership markets, where we are now the largest player
within insurance products in that channel.
Then moving to the Commercial segment on Page 4. We experienced a somewhat
increased competition. In general, over time, we expect organic growth to be more or
less in line with GDP growth in our markets. According to statistics in Norway, the growth
in the Norwegian economy is expected to slow somewhat down throughout 2015, with
some increase in unemployment.
There is increased cost focus among companies, and unemployment rate appears to be
increasing somewhat faster than ﬁrst predicted by Statistics Norway. This is no dramatic

FINAL

shift neither in the unemployment rate, nor GDP growth in the years ahead. As for
Gjensidige's business in the Commercial segment, I'm pleased to report a solid growth of
4.5% in the ﬁrst quarter. The macro environment, however, leads to somewhat lower
growth expecting going forward within workers' comp and group life insurance, also
driven by lower growth in the national basic amount for social welfare, the GE.
In general, we note considerable and broad competition as regards accident and health
insurance. We also see a general price pressure on the large accounts. Gross premiums
written grew by 1.4% in the quarter and this is an indication of somewhat lower growth
going forward.
This said, proﬁtability continues to be more important than growth in the Gjensidige. This
is a statement you have heard over time. Pricing discipline combined with measures to
further streamline operations are key priorities. We've focused on our core segments –
SMEs, agriculture, partnerships, continuing to develop robust and proﬁtable customer
portfolio.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then ﬁnally, turning to Page 5, I will address the development in the Nordic segment.
I'm very pleased with an underlying growth of 4.4% combined with strong proﬁtability in
the marketplace, where competition also is tough. The positive signs we see in the Danish
property market are good news for Gjensidige, given our distribution model in Denmark.
House sales in the ﬁrst quarter were 36% higher in 2015 compared to last year. And in
addition to the cooperation with cooperation with Nykredits our agreements in the real
estate agent channel cover about 45% of the market. So the signs we see in the Danish
property market are very good news for Gjensidige going forward. As far our Swedish
portfolio, proﬁtability is weak. Focus now is on re-pricing the portfolio and gradually
shifting to less volatile exposure, in addition to improving distribution, integrating smaller
portfolios acquired during the past years, and realizing synergies.
And with that, I leave the word to Catharina.

Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Thank you, Helge, and good morning to everyone from me as well. Please turn to Page 7. I
will start oﬀ by commenting brieﬂy on the main elements contributing to the ﬁrst quarter
proﬁt before of NOK987 million. First, to our general insurance business. The underwriting
result ended at NOK417 million, which is a solid result for our ﬁrst quarter. Top line growth
combined with higher run-oﬀ gains are the main explanation for the improvements from
the ﬁrst quarter last year. In absolute terms, the results was better than normally expected
from our ﬁrst quarter, mainly driven by good risk selection and pricing and a favorable
underlying frequency claims development.
Moving on to our Retail Bank, volume growth and lower ﬁnancing cost resulted in 26%
increase in proﬁt before tax compared with the ﬁrst quarter of last year. In a highly
competitive market, GJENSIDIGE Bank managed to increase its lending by as much as
19% in the last 12 months. The proﬁt performance in pensions and savings was ﬂat in the

FINAL

quarter. Finally, the investment result was NOK521 million in the quarter, down from
NOK762 million in the ﬁrst quarter 2014, mainly driven by a weak return on private equity.
So, let's move on to the combined ratio on the next slide. The group combined ratio
ended at 91.9%. Two main drivers positively aﬀecting the combined ratio was the good
underlying frequency claims development as well as somewhat higher run-oﬀ gains. The
cost ratio ended at 15% in the quarter and the loss ratio was 76.8%, down 0.8 percentage
points from the corresponding quarter last year and this can be explained by higher runoﬀ gains.

Bloomberg Transcript

Apart from the two large storms in January and February, we have experienced favorable
weather conditions in the ﬁrst quarter. This contributed to a level of proﬁtability for multiprivate above what should be expected in a more normal mid-quarter and on par with a
good proﬁtability in the ﬁrst quarter last year. The property product shows a better
frequency claims developments than in the ﬁrst quarter last year due to fewer hires and
other medium-sized claims. While the two storms aﬀected the overall loss rate for the
property product this year, the ratio last year was aﬀected by two large ﬁres. And the
accident and health product continues to produce good and stable results as they have
done for several years now.
On the next slide, Page 9, I will focus only on cost development as Helge has already
commented on the solid premium growth. All segments have demonstrated good cost
control in the quarter. There are two main explanations for the nominal increase in cost of
NOK21 million. Firstly, there was somewhat higher sales commissions in the commercial
segment in the quarter. And secondly exchange rate eﬀect for the Nordic segment, which
also is the case in Baltics.
The next Slide, Page 10 shows that large losses are slightly higher than expectations. The
total proportional large losses in the quarter amounted to NOK297 million. This
corresponds to 5.8 percentage points of our combined venture (11:05), which is slightly
higher than the expected ﬁgure of NOK283 million. The two storms mentioned earlier
accounted for around NOK235 million an eﬀect of the combined ratio of 4.6 percentage
points. In the corresponding quarter last year, large losses amounted to NOK291 million
with commercial being aﬀected the most.
Now, please turn to Page 11. This slide shows the run-oﬀ gain of NOK149 million in the
quarter. This corresponds to a positive eﬀect on the combined ratio of 2.9 percentage
points compared with 1.3 percentage points same period last year. As you can see, the
run-oﬀ results in the individual segments are about the same in this quarter as the
corresponding quarter in the last year. The run-oﬀ results mainly driven by continued
adjustments to our accident and health product.
I'd like to turn (12:09) capital position which is summarized on Page 12. Our strategic
buﬀer amounted to NOK1.8 billion at the end of the quarter. This represents an increase of
NOK500 million since the end of 2014, driven by lower capital requirements. It's main
drivers was reduced requirement of NOK900 million due to the quantitative credit eﬀect,
partly oﬀset by an increase requirement NOK400 million mainly due to growth.

FINAL

Adjusted for the allocation of NOK800 million made the two acquisitions that not yet
implemented, the strategic buﬀer amounted to NOK1 billion. Remember that total
comprehensive income year-to-date is not included in the calculation of the available
capital.
These results that we in the second quarter will change the currency hedging strategy or
investments in subsidiaries and branches abroad. Previously, we have been stabilizing
equity and return of equity. While going forward, we will reduce the volatility in the
strategic buﬀer.
Finally, I'd like to comment in some detail on our investments returns that is on Page 13.
The investment portfolio yielded a return of 0.9% in the quarter and amounted to
NOK58.1 billion at the end of the ﬁrst quarter. The decrease from the corresponding
quarter in 2014 where they yielded a return of 1.3% was mainly due to a combination of
the low interest rates and a weak result in the private equity portfolio. First let me
comment on the match portfolio. The portfolio amounted to NOK35 billion and yielded a
return of 0.6% in the quarter, the same level of return as in the previous quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Norwegian interest rates remained stable during the quarter while Danish interest rates
continued to fall across the whole curve. This reinforces the challenges relating to the
return on the match portfolio going forward. We will continue to look for good investment
opportunities that's within the same risk appetite and the same risk limit as before. And in
the Danish part of the portfolio, we are looking at increasing liquidity and credit risk
somewhat to increase the running yield somewhat going forward.
We have made one small investment in Norwegian held-to-maturity portfolio during the
quarter. As a result, I don't have statistic for you for the average reinvestment rate for
Gjensidige in the quarter. However, we see a return of around 2% to 2.75% for bonds of
the same credit quality and the duration we invest in.
At the end of the quarter the excess value of the held-to-maturity portfolio amounted to
NOK2.1 billion, about the same as year-end 2014.
Now, I'd like to move on to the free portfolio which amounted to NOK23.1 billion and they
yielded a return of 1.3%. Credit yielded an acceptable return driven by a slight fall in
international interest rates and somewhat lower credit margins. Current equities delivered
well and were positively aﬀected by the development in the value of the shares at the
bank, notably NOK99 million.
Our private equity portfolio showed a weak development in the quarter that is due to
substantial fall in the net asset value of some of the funds, particularly those exposed to
the oil and oil service sector. Other funds have developed satisfactorily. Adjusted for a
bankruptcy in one of the funds in the ﬁrst quarter, the fall in the net asset value was
approximately 10%.
The property portfolio delivered a satisfactory result. There have been no changes in the
yield in the quarter, but we have seen a slight increase of around NOK10 million overall in

the value of the properties as a result of adjustments made to certain properties.
Before opening up for questions, let me simply repeat three main messages. First,
Gjensidige delivered a solid start to the year, better than that can be expected for a ﬁrst
quarter. Two, Gjensidige's well positioned in all segments, but competition is tough and
the macro environment (16:4) somewhat lower growth throughout 2015. And three, low
interest rate continued to be a challenge as we continue to look for growth opportunities
within our existing risk appetite.
And then we open up for questions. Operator?

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions from my side. First
of all, it sounds like there's a bit more pricing pressure in the Commercial GI and I guess I
was just wondering for the other lines, are you – in terms of the pricing environment, do
you see some room for increasing underwriting proﬁt to oﬀset the pressure on investment
income that you're seeing? And I guess where do you see that potential and I guess
where do you see a bit more competition coming through?
And then I was just wondering if I could get a bit more color on the Baltic area. It seems
like you're focusing on proﬁtability, writing more proﬁtable business, reducing volume a
bit. But it also sounds like the reduction in volume is impacting the proﬁtability. So I was
just wondering if you could maybe give a little bit more guidance on how you see that
developing and what you're doing to turn that business around? Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I can maybe start and Catharina can ﬁll me out regarding the investment portfolio
afterwards. As we commented, long term, we see unchanged potential for GDP growth
organically. So what I commented related to commercial business in Norway is more
short-term eﬀects of slightly increased unemployment rate and its related to group life
and personal products.
In the other areas, it's more or less the same type of competition as we have seen for
many quarters, actually. In the private segments, of course, it's competition all over the
area, but we have a very good competitive position. As I commented in the private lines,
we have stable market shares. We've managed to increase prices long term in line with
inﬂation, short term slightly below and that's tactically and we have done that for some
quarters now.

I also commented long-term inﬂation in private model, it's more between 1% and 3%, and
in property I commented 4%. The same type of competitors as we have seen before, it's
the large companies (19:36) it's not that much bank insurance as we have seen a year ago.
Within group life and the personal policies also the life companies. Regarding Baltics, I
can take that after your answer on the second question, Catharina.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yes. If I understood your question correctly, you asked if decreased return from the
investment portfolio with the increased underwriting proﬁt or the focus on underwriting
proﬁt...

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Yes. Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yes. Yes. And I think at least from our side, when we see that – or when we comment that
we are concerned about the proﬁtability in the investment side, our response is to be
even more discipline on the underwriting side. And what we have said before and it's the
same situation today, we have a combined ratio target of 90% to 93%. Our aim though is
to be in the lower part of that range. We are also looking at taking down the cost further
and we have a cost ratio target of 15% just to remind you about that And when we talk
about taking down the costs further, the underlying costs, what we do is that we create
room for investing into our business and make sure that we can increase relative of all the
strong competitive position that we have in the Nordics, so it's important for us to invest
into the business and investing to our competitive position, but I think the overall answer
is that, yes, at least from our side lower investment return means that we are even more
disciplined on the underwriting side.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Regarding Baltics, it's – as you can see also from the report and the ﬁgures, it's tough
competitions, especially within the motor area. And we do now work with the plans for
integrating the PZU business and the main takes of the ﬁrst quarter is that it's encouraging
what we see and we will use their IT systems. We have met a very professional
organization. So it's actually a very positive thing from the dialog with PZU in Lithuania. It's
rigorous integration and synergy plan, and we will take over this in I think more
September third quarter. And we have used, I would say, more resources from the
group's side into the Baltics area over the last six months compared to what we had done
actually several years before. So it's actually positive thing from the Baltics area, but the
competition within the motor area is tough.

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

We will now take our next question from Matti Ahokas of Danske Bank. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. It's Matti Ahokas from Danske. Two questions, please. Firstly, I know
it's probably diﬃcult, but could you try to quantify especially in Private Norway, well, how
much more favorable in terms of claims was the ﬁrst quarter compared to a normal
quarter, if we exclude the storms?
And then the second question is regarding the Nordic segment. It's actually generating
now underwriting proﬁts almost as big as Commercial Norway, I know there was some FX
eﬀect there, but how much better than a normal or how much better is this that we should
expect as a normal run rate going forward on this segment that seems to be doing
extremely well?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Matti, you commented the question yourself, it's quite complicated. I'll pass it to
Catharina.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

I think we don't quantify it on the quarterly basis. What we communicate is that we have a
combined ratio target of 90% to 93% that is an annual target. We see that especially ﬁrst
quarter it normally hits the most by winter eﬀect and it could be above the corridor and
that could also happen in the fourth quarter while usually the third quarter and then the
second quarter are the most proﬁtable quarters. But we do not quantify within the year
what a normal combined ratio every quarter should be like. But we see that the frequency
– the typical winter frequency is lower this quarter than that we expect and that was more
or less the same picture that we saw ﬁrst quarter last year as well.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

In Nordic...

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yes. Again, the combined ratio target is a group target. We do not specify at segment
level. So, it's again – it's a group target and I'm not detailed into targets for each of the
segments.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

As a follow-up, may I just continue, was it that Helge mentioned that the Swedish business
is still loss-making in the Nordic segment or did I understand it correctly?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

That's right. It's loss-making. Small part of the Nordic segment. If you look at ﬁrst quarter,
we had premiums of NOK1.250 billion in the Nordic area and NOK250 million of them
was in the Swedish area. What we do there is actually to try to, of course re-price contracts
Page 8 of 15



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

and also gradually turn the portfolio to less volatile business, meaning less large claims
exposed portfolio if you want.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

FINAL

So the Danish part of the business was then extremely proﬁtable in the ﬁrst quarter?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

We are very satisﬁed with the Danish operation in the ﬁrst quarter, yes. What we are going
to do, going forward, I commented that we have used more group resources into the
Baltic area. We will do just the same type of process related to the Swedish business, use
more of an expertise from Norway and group level. And we will also be more coordinated
into Sweden and look what we have to do to secure that this will be in line with our other
Nordic business going forward.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great. Thanks.

Operator
We will now take our next question from Jakob Brink of ABG. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Thank you. I have two questions, please. Firstly, could you maybe talk a little about the
run-oﬀ gains? It seems to be have been sort of above what I would say is a normal level
for the past three quarters. This is pretty much what we are seeing at least from your
Danish competitors as well. Is this something we should expect going forward as well?
And second question, I've got three questions, please. The second question is about the
Norwegian price increases. And I know Tryg was out talking about higher claims inﬂation
in Norway and hence the necessity to raise prices. How you're looking at the spread in
Norway? I know, we discussed it already, but a bit more detail, please.
Then secondly, just a small one regarding your free portfolio and the private equity funds.
I know it's a relatively competitive group pre-tax proﬁt for full year small number, but I
think you've said before that your exposure to oil and gas was pretty limited. So I was a bit
surprised to see this loss. Could you maybe just give me the number of what is the exact
exposure to the exposures like the ones that caused a loss in Q1. Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I can start with the second question regarding the competition in Norway in pricing and
Catharina can take the ﬁrst and third question afterwards. And what we commented, we
have had a favorable frequency development both in the ﬁrst quarter this year and also
last year. We haven't seen any signs as we saw that both D&D (28:07) commented and
Tryg regarding the frequency developments. It's favorable frequency development going
forward.

Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

Regarding price increases, I would say that the communication from our side is just what it
has been for many years now, actually. We have to increase prices in line with claims
inﬂation. And the starting point is the long-term claims inﬂation. And as we commented at
the Capital Markets Day, the long-term expectations now is more between 1% and 3% and
before we had 3% to 4%. Shortly, on the short-term, we also have some market initiatives
in very proﬁtable segments meaning that we can see slightly lower price increases in the
short-term. But long-term price increase expectations from Gjensidige is in line with
claims inﬂation. And we do not see the same type of signals as we saw from our
competitors.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, turning to the run-oﬀ gain, yes, it was 2.1 percentage points eﬀect on the combined
ratio this quarter, which is high. What we have said that of course in the long-run, you
should expect it to be zero. We have for some period now seen positive development
especially within the personal products.
And also there are certain vintages within the Norwegian Commercial segment that we
have especially seen (29:47). At least there has been fewer claims ﬁled than we expected
when we set the reserves originally. We don't see that – at least in the short run, we see
that it's possibly, slightly higher possibility that there will again run-oﬀ gains going forward
than run-oﬀ losses. But again in the long run, this should be zero expectation and the
level. So, there is no change in that. But short term, we have been surprised by few –
much fewer claims being ﬁled than expected.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

If we compare a one-oﬀ in the ﬁrst quarter to ﬁrst quarter last year and adjust for the loss
in corporate sense, it's more or less just the same.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

And I think it's also relevant to refer to the total size of the reserve, which is NOK33 billion.
So, compared to that, it's a minor adjustment, actually. Back to the free portfolio, the
private equity. If you look at the report, you can see that the book value for the private
equity portfolio is now NOK1.4 billion, which is – it's only in the private equity portfolio
where we have the oil exposure around 50%, around NOK700 million is exposed towards
oil and oil-related service out of our portfolio of NOK58 billion. So, it's actually relatively
limited exposure.

Okay. Thanks a lot.

We will now take our next question from Paris Hadjiantonis of KBW. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

Hey guys. Hi, good morning from me as well. If I go back to your free portfolio, I've seen
there that the average duration of your ﬁxed income investments in that portfolio and I do
anticipate that it's quite small compared to what you're doing in your match portfolio, but
that part of that portfolio has increased duration from about 0.6 years in the full year stage
to 2.9 years. So there's an obvious increase in duration for ﬁxed income in your free
portfolio. I was wondering if you can explain that.
And then second, more general question would be about your stake in SR Bank. That
stake now account for about NOK1.5 billion. If and when you're going to sell that, what do
you expect to do with those funds, are those funds going to be useful to do add-on
acquisitions or do you plan to return those funds to the shareholders through a special
dividend or some other way? Thank you.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. If we start with the duration in the free portfolio, remember that in the free portfolio,
that's where we do the overall risk management for the group and that's also where we
do technical adjustments or allocation and where we can to market bets to technical
allocations. So that's the answer. And these positions can change very fast based on our
view on the market.
The second SR Bank, well, it's the same communication regarding that it's up for sale. We
will sell that one if the timing and pricing is correct. When it comes to how we will spend
the fund that is something that I expect that the board in Gjensidige and will discuss
normally during the ordinary or Special (33:43) that is done once a year. It's part of the
total discussion of the capitalization of the group, which is done again on annual
operation – our discussion in the board.

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

So when you say timing and pricing is correct, can we assume that the price constraints
are not too diﬀerent to what they were last time, so about – so February 2014 we tried that
thing at NOK63? Thank you.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

No comment to the pricing.

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

FINAL

Yes. Good morning from me as well. I have three questions. The ﬁrst one is back to the
Swedish business, Helge, where you mentioned before that basically you're trying to
move the portfolio towards less large claims expose. I'm just wondering perhaps it's a silly
question, but when you book this business, did you know exactly what it was in there, it
seems like it's more exposed to commercial lines as opposed to being private lines and
how easy it's for you to move around this business basically at this point?
And the other two question is basically literally just some comment that I pick up, and I
just want to understand that, Catharina, there was something on the capital position
where you say that you proceed some – or you have done some quantitative assessment,
which has freed up some capital, but I didn't capture the number. So if you can just
elaborate on that that would be great. And also the last question on the – you mentioned
something on the reinvestment rate right now, which I didn't pick it up. So if could also
elaborate that would be great. Thank you.

Yes, Sweden ﬁrst. Yes, I think we knew what we bought, Gianandrea, when we bought
Tennant. The situation today is that we have a limited total premium in the Swedish
market, it's 50-50 between Commercial and Private. And as you know, we do not have the
same type of distribution system or model in Sweden compared to what we have in
Norway or Denmark. We have also bought some small retail portfolio lately in Sweden,
which is very important for us to build up a retail distribution system with partners.
But the 50% we have within Commercial it's broker business more or less only. And then,
we have to look into this portfolio and try to one, re-price the contracts and two, maybe
tilt towards less volatile business. So that's what we are doing. And it's many years since
we bought the Tennant business. So it's also organic growth, since we bought the Tennant
business until the situation we have today.

Yes, ﬁrst question was to elaborate on the ﬁgure. It's NOK900 million at the end of the
ﬁrst quarter. It's – we commented last quarter that we were now able to use part of the
internal model when we calculate the capital requirements under the S&P model. So that
ﬁgure is now NOK900 million, it was NOK800 million last time we gave this ﬁgure. The
reinvestment rate today as we see it now and within the credit quality and the duration
that we normally invest in the Norwegian held-to-maturity portfolio, just to specify that, it's
around 2% and 2.75%

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Sorry, between 2% and 2.75% you just said, right?

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Okay. Can I have a follow up on capital? How are the discussion with S&P going on,
meaning should we expect something more apart from this NOK900 million or is there
anything changed in there or...

This is something that they look into I think once a year when they do their adjustment, so
their ordinary rating adjustments and that's the only communication. They are kind of –
they don't disclose too much about this and the eﬀect. So we hope that this is stable
going forward.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick follow up on a couple of
previous questions around pricing and claims inﬂation. It's helpful to know that pricing
increases are matching oﬀ claims inﬂation; the underlying margin is broadly stable. I'm
thinking sort of hypothetically two years, three years out, do you think you need to go
further than allowing the combined ratio to the lower-end of the target range and do you
think you need to put more pricing through to oﬀset the step down in investment returns
to achieve that 15% ROE target by 2018? I mean it – all my numbers are rolled out, the
current reinvestment rate and current pricing trajectory it looks like that, that comes under
a bit more pressure. So any comments around that would be much appreciated.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yes. I comment that. Of course looking at the ﬁnancial targets is something that we –
relative to every year and we have to take into consideration what we see going forward,
and of course both claims inﬂation and macro environment interest rate level will be taken
into consideration, but as of today our ﬁnancial target is set and was revised by the board
in October last year.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Yes, hi. Just one ﬁnal question on the natural perils pool, do you have any update on the
situation or when can you expect some communication from the FSA?

FINAL

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Unfortunately, we don't have any update. I think it's probably the Department of Finance
that will comment on it. FSA they will come up with the ﬁnal ruling, but unfortunately, as I
said, we don't have any more information about the timing.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, good morning. Just a quick follow-up question on the private equity exposure. You
mentioned it's now around NOK700 million of NAV. Is there any update you can give of
how this performed after the end of the quarter and what kind of risk you see for the
remainder of the year – clearly returned to the oil exposure? Thank you.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

The NAVs are set at the end of each quarter, so I don't have any updated ﬁgures relating
that private equity portfolio.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

It's normally – the NAV always are set with one quarter – or they are delayed with one
quarter. What we do is that we – we also adjust for non-events and we also test for
impairment and that's how we value the private equity portfolio on an ongoing basis.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Okay. Very clear. Thanks.

As there are no further questions in the phone queue, I would like to hand the call back to
the speakers for any additional remarks.
