(audio in progress) -- Issued by the Company just a few minutes ago and which is
available on the Website. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session. Gerald,
the ﬂoor is yours.

Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Thank you, Andrew. And good evening to everybody. Before moving to the Q&A, let me
give you a quick recap of the main ﬁgures for this quarter.
Overall, I would say that the trading conditions were quite positive, with total revenues up
2% on a comparable basis. I would like to remind you of the strong ForEx impact
compared to last year, the euro, the strength -- the euro strength and against the yen, the
US dollar. And other Asian currencies.
It explains, again, the diﬀerence between the reported and comparable basis. You will see
that the year has started with further improvement in product mix across all segments. We
are continuing to be very selective in the business. We are right in line with our Ambition
AXA strategy.
Let's start with life. From the life side, the revenues are up 1% to EUR15.8 billion, APE down
6% to EUR1.6 billion, mainly due to the product repositioning Switzerland and some
exceptional sales in the First Quarter of 2013, principally in Germany and the UK.

In the quarter, NBV was up 1% to EUR0.5 billion. And our NBV margin continued to
increase up 3% to 33%, driven by the improved product mix.

FINAL

One feature of the quarter was a decrease in protection and health NBV, largely due to
the repositioning of our Group Life product mix in Switzerland towards pure protection
products with lower premium and higher NBV margin.
These declines were partly oﬀset by continued increased volumes in France, US, MedLA.
And high-growth Asia.
We remain conﬁdent about our overall growth momentum for the year 2014. And we are
well positioned to increase our life and savings APE compared to last year.
Let's speak now from the P&C. On the property and casualty side, revenues were up 3%,
mainly driven by 2% average tariﬀ increases and higher volumes in high-growth markets
plus 10% and direct plus 8%. Personal lines grew by 2% and commercial lines by 4%.
We believe that this good momentum should continue through the year and translate into
higher growth in 2014 versus last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

On asset management, revenues were up 2%, thanks to both AXA I mean and
AllianceBernstein. Net ﬂows amount to plus EUR1.5 billion for the period with plus EUR4.8
billion inﬂows at AXA I mean and minus EUR3.3 billion outﬂows at AB.
AXA IM beneﬁted from strong net inﬂows in ﬁxed income, while AB had limited outﬂows
driven by the loss of two large contracts in the institutional channel, partly oﬀset by net
inﬂows in the private clients channel.
Note also that our economic solvency ratio continued to improve during the quarter and
was estimated to be around 210% as at the end of March.
So overall, we had a strong quarter with revenues up across all segments, good
performance across the board in P&C and a further improved product mix and a higher
NBV in life.
We did see a decline in life APE due to the product repositioning in Switzerland and the
nonrepeat of exceptional sales in Q1 2013 in Germany and the UK.
As I said, we are conﬁdent about the gross momentum for 2014 and expect to increase
both our life and savings APE and P&C growth compared to last year.
I'm happy now to answer your questions.

FINAL

Q - Paul De'Ath
Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of questions,
please. Firstly, looking at the performance of Changping because I know this isn't actually
included within your numbers due to the change in the accounting methodology and
would be good to get an idea of how that business is operating.
And second point is just on the US variable annuity buyout here. I know in the release that
a large part of the outﬂows that you're seeing come from that, from the buyout. And just a
bit of an update, please, on how that's going. Is it now ﬁnished? And kind of what level of
pickup did you get overall on that project? Thanks.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Okay. The ﬁrst point about Changping, Changping is not in these ﬁgures. It's not
consolidated.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second point is about the net inﬂows. Net inﬂows amounted to EUR1.8 billion. But you
are right. That means that the buyout of the of the VA explains minus EUR0.9 billion, which
means that, excluding net elements, we would have -- we'd have net inﬂows of EUR2.7
billion, which is quite a good number.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Okay. Thanks. And just on -- and I register that Changping's not included in the numbers.
But if there's any kind of at all comment you could make on how that business is going?

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

No. It's going well, in line with our expectations, nothing speciﬁc to mention. It's -- the
proﬁt is quite nice.

Q - Paul De'Ath

Yes, hello.

FINAL

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi there. So ﬁrstly, you're talking about (being) -- APE growth for full year. Can you explain
what's going to get you there, given that you have the FX eﬀects and (adverse others) that
you've already seen in Q1, if -- because it's comparable to later in the year, or is there
something else that you point to that's concrete?
And in particular, I noticed that your new business margin in the US is up quite a lot. That's
before interest rate adjustments year to date. So I was wondering whether you're still
willing to be more aggressive in growing in the US. But that -- so, just (growth) is one
question.
And second question, you talk about your mix being better. But protection and health has
been very weak, the APE. So just kind of wondering where you see that going. Thanks
very much.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Okay. Let's be clear. What I said is -- clearly, is that our APE are expected to be positive for
2014. That's what I said.

Bloomberg Transcript

You are absolutely right saying that protection and health is at minus 15 from the First
Quarter. But besides that, it's due to one-oﬀ elements that are not expecting to be
recurring during the year. Let's explain why.
The ﬁrst element is due to Switzerland. As you know, we have two type of -- you know
that, in Switzerland, the most important part of our life business is protection. It's group
pension. And we have two diﬀerent type of contracts, two protections. That means that we
are covering biometric risk plus investment risk and semiautonomous, which means that
we are covering exclusively biometric risk. That is death and disability, excluding savings
part.
What we decided to do, as you know, in Switzerland, we have the SST, which is the Swiss
solvency test, which is Solvency 2. But even tougher. And that means that, in a low interest
rate environment, reinvesting as we did in the past CHF3 billion to CHF4 billion a year is
some -- in a low interest rate environment, it's something which brings (inaudible)
dilution, which is not favorable for the policyholders but also for the shareholders.
So what we decided is that, for no change, I would say, on the traditional (inaudible)
agent side because it's mostly full protection that we sell there. But on the broker channel
where we deal with medium and large companies which are exposed to, I would say,
price competition, there, we decided mostly to move to the semiautonomous part.
Why? Because it saves capital. And the return is better. And that explains why the
Switzerland case explains most of the negative performance of the APE.

FINAL

On top of this, we have Germany. And in Germany, in fact, what happens is that we had -remember maybe that, last year, we had a strong production in health due to the
nonrepeat of -- and we had -- and we didn't repeat the strong sales for the First Quarter.
Why? Because there was a change in regulation. And during -- up to mid-2014, we had
strong sales due to the anticipated switch to unisex tariﬀs.
Last but not least, we had strong one-oﬀs or strong production I would say, new business
in the UK due to the pension -- what we call pension (tips). So these three elements
explains most of what I would call the seasonality eﬀect plus some one-oﬀ eﬀects in the
First Quarter. And that's why we are conﬁdent in our ability to post a positive APE growth
for 2014.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

And just going back on the US business, some of your competitors, who are making very
strong margins in the US, see this as a good sign to grow. And what's your attitude toward
the VA market right now and willing to grow?

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. What I can tell you, Farooq, is that, in the First Quarter, annuity grew by 8%, which is
quite strong. And it's -- and life was down 19%. And life is not much smaller. So that means
that, yes, on the annuity side, we are growing. And we still expect to grow during the
whole year.
That means that we -- the US posted a plus 5% growth on an AP basis in -- no, it was 4%,
sorry. We posted plus 4% on an APE basis. And that means that our NBV margins went up
from 24% to 22% -- 32%, plus eight points. And this compares with an average NBV
margin for 2013 of 27%.
So you can see that we are growing, point number one. Also, this growth is slowed down
because the life business is not so proﬁtable. So we prefer to be down in life. And the
proﬁtability is going up quite strongly.
And as you can imagine, last point, most -- we had a very strong growth in products like
(inaudible) (Stone), which are accumulator type of products, VA type of products. But
which are less (diﬃcult) to hedge because we beneﬁt from (inaudible) propose a viable
guaranteed (interest rate).

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks very much.

Hello. Thank you very much. Yes. A couple of questions. First one is just coming back on
the variable annuities. A lot of US players are backing away at the moment. And just
interested if you could elaborate a little bit more. I know you've given some commentary
on this already, on the risk-reward proﬁle that you see in this business.

FINAL

Is it, do you think, an opportunity to get back into the top ﬁve in that type of product, or
are you more sort of circumspect about the risk appetite?
Then, secondly, just on France, just looking at unit-linked production, you've been making
progress there. And I just wondered what scope you see to really improve unit-linked
production further. Do you think there's a sort of level above which you can't go in France
because of cultural sort of references, or do you think there's quite a good story for the
unit-linked possible in France going forward? Thank you.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Nick, answering the ﬁrst part of your question related to the US VA sales, of course,
we manage a certain level of risk appetites. That means that what we did in the past. And
we have been among the ﬁrst ones to go -- to revise the conditions of the products, to
update them and so on and so forth. It's not (in order) now to go back to the top of the
link table of the VA sales, not at all.
That means that we have strong growth. But as I mentioned before, answering Farooq's
question, we take care that we -- our growth is on less risky products. Also, they are
extremely proﬁtable. So we are combining growth, monitored growth with high
proﬁtability. But our intention is not to be back, as you said, in the ﬁrst ﬁve, for example.
And nevertheless, we still are quite ambition in our global growth of the US.
About France, as you know, we are at the level of unit-linked, which amounts to 30% of
our savings, which is a good level, not very fast on twice the average level for France. And
last year, we were much lower. So that proves that we have gradually an improvement.
Do we see a limit to this? I would say that depends also on the ﬁnancial markets. But
globally speaking, we are encouraging -- including with our commissioning, we are
encouraging our sales force to sell more unit-linked because the proﬁtabilities are much
higher.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

And Gerald, just on that point, is it still correct that proﬁtability for unit-linked is about
three times higher than for traditional?

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

No, because we improved the proﬁtability of the traditional. I would say that it's -- today,
it's -- we could say that it's between 1 to 1.5 and 1 to 2, something around this because we
think it (deﬁnitely) improve because you know that -- keep in mind that, in a country like
France, we kept our expenses ﬂat during the last years, which means that, gradually, when
Page 6 of 15

you have growth, we beneﬁt from a unit cost which are going down. And even for the
general accounts, this makes -- this is quite helpful. And it enhances our proﬁtability.

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Yes, yes, hello.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. Good evening. A couple of small questions from me. Can you talk about the
unit-linked net ﬂows? I think there was a EUR2 billion swing from one year to the next.
Now, obviously, half of that is the US. Can you just talk about what the other half is? Does
it relate back to these exceptional items you talked about?
The second question is Japan, quite a lot of volatility in the volumes there. Is the EUR82
million you've printed for Q1 2014, is that a good run rate for the business going forwards
now?
My third question is, just looking at the Mediterranean region, volumes up. But margins
quite heavily down. I just wondered what's going on there if you can comment on that,
please.
And the ﬁnal question is in the P&C business. I see that price increases are starting to
come down from the level we saw last year. I just wonder what impact, if any, that's going
to have on your growth strategy in P&C. Thank you.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Okay. Let's start with Japan. And I'll cover all your questions. Let's start with Japan. Your
question is, are you satisﬁed with this level. You know the decline in Japan is mostly
explained by the lower sales following the redesign of our -- some of our protection
products, which is long-term life products. And it was in April 2013. So we had strong
sales in the First Quarter of 2013. So the reference is pretty high.
Does it mean that we are -- that we expect during the whole year to be at the level which
is so much down because, as you know, we had APE, as you said at EUR82 million, minus
15% compared to last year? The answer is no.

Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity
Date: 2014-05-06

FINAL

And we consider that this (NCCP) high sales volume in the First Quarter of last year means
that, there again, it's -- we have a seasonality eﬀect that should disappear during the year.
On the MedLA region, which was your third question, on MedLA, yes, you are right. You
said -- your remark was to say that we had APE growth which was quite strong but NBV
margin which was down. It's just -- look at the relative level of sales. That means that we
are still at high level of proﬁtability and that -- mostly due to the fact that it's due to the
business mix. That means that, at the (seal) of MedLA, last year, we had a level which was
low. And the business mix meant that we moved down from, on average, 32% NBV
margin to 28%. But no worry on that side. We still are focusing (inaudible) on protection
and unit-linked.
The P&C pricing increase, yes, indeed, we can say that the price increase was 3% last year.
It went down to 2.2% in the First Quarter. But I would say that it's -- I would say that the
P&C outlook is quite good. As you remember last year, we were at zero in the mature
countries. We are plus one. And we consider that price increases at 2.2% is an absolutely
good level. So we are quite positive, as I said, on the P&C. And we don't consider this
lower price increase as (poor) news.
What was your ﬁrst question? Yes. It's mostly in the UK. So that means your question was
about the net inﬂows in unit-linked. It was the US and the UK.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Can I come back on a couple of those, please? So -- .

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

--Yes, sorry -- .

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

-- Japan, I wasn't implying that you'd be down 15% for the full year. I'm just wondering, is
the EUR82 million, is that a good run rate in absolute terms going forward? That doesn't
look to be a huge amount of seasonality in Japan, looking over the years. There's some.
But not huge amounts. Just wonder -- that was my question more on Japan.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Yes. But you -- I believe I answered your question. But (sorry for that), no, that means that
we -- I cannot consider that it's a good run rate. And you can see on the -- I believe that, in
the appendix, you can see that the -- it's in currency. Yes. You can see in the appendix the
run rate and you asked the -- that's the revenue. So it's not the APE. But we could oﬄine
give you a bit more detail about this. But the run rate -- I hope that the run rate will be
higher, yes.

FINAL

Okay. Thank you. And on the MedLA, sorry, I just didn't quite get what's actually changed
in the year. You've had volumes up but margins down. I don't think there's -- unless I'm
wrong, there's not been any change in the product strategy over that time, has there? I
would've thought that, just naturally, with volumes going up, your margins should be
going up, assuming the product mix is staying the same.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

We had a relative higher share of (GA) savings, mostly in Italy and in Portugal. That's the
reason why. So we had GA savings which was extremely low in the past. Why? Due to the
economic situation, especially in Italy.
So on a relative basis, no speciﬁc change. What I meant in my answer was that there was
no speciﬁc change in our philosophy and in our approach. But on a relative basis, there is
a bit more GA savings.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, Gerald. That -- and ﬁnally, sorry, just on P&C pricing, is the 2.2%, is that
enough to cover or to oﬀset claims inﬂation at the moment?

A - Gerald Harlin

Yes.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. A question on the outlook for life margins, please. You reported
33% NBV margin in Q1, which is healthy. I just wondered what the outlook was for this
number for the remaining of the year 2014.
Basically, what is the -- in what -- in which geographies do you expect to potentially raise
this number and in which business lines? And I guess the other question is, to what extent
are you worried by the current interest rate environment? And how could current interest
rates impact this number?

Page 9 of 15



Company Name: AXA SA

Date: 2014-05-06

And as a follow up, I would like to know if you release an internal rate of return for Q1.
Thank you.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

FINAL

No. We don't. And ﬁrst of all, we don't release any internal rate of return. We do it once a
year.
The second point is, at the NBV margin, my comment was more to say that the -- I was
expecting the top line to grow NBV margin at 33%. Last year, we had 35%. So it's already
an excellent level. What I'm expecting is and the message I wanted to convey is the fact
that we were not expecting to be on an APE basis at minus 6% for the year. But that we
would be positive.
And your question was, where do we expect growth? We expect growth in the US, we
mentioned already. So we're starting the year at 4%. But we can expect to be higher for
the whole year. Southeast Asia, China, the UK as well, in France, we will be -- we should be
positive. And Japan. Japan, as I explained, answering a previous question, we started at
minus 15%, which is quite low. And we expect to be positive this year in Japan. So that's
mostly.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the reverse, I could say that the situation I described for Switzerland, since as you
know, most of the signiﬁcant part of the new business is slow during the First Quarter,
we'll still be signiﬁcantly negative in Switzerland for the reason I explained before, i.e. the
fact that we move for some part of the contracts to semiautonomous products.
And also, in Germany. But we can expect that, progressively, it will -- the eﬀect of this First
Quarter and the high sales in health in the First Quarter due to change of the regulation
will go (fading). So that's mostly it.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Okay. And on the current interest rate environment and the potential impact on margins?

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

I don't -- what I said is that, of course, we don't publish margin. But in the First Quarter, we
don't publish our earnings. But what I can say that we are still managing a long duration.
It's more than seven years in life. We didn't change. So that means that we are quite well.
We don't have a mismatch between assets and liabilities, which means concretely that I
don't expect that this might have a small eﬀect. But I repeat a small eﬀect. I'm not
expecting a large eﬀect on this low interest rate environment, at least for this year. We'll
see after.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks very much.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi there. Thanks for taking a follow up. Sorry to prolong this. But just wanted to know,
ﬁrstly, going back again to the growth questions that you think APE will be up in -absolutely in local currency terms. Is that going to come from protection and health that
you -- you've obviously, you've given some regions. But what about products?
Secondly, can you tell us what your early thoughts are (AO) stress test? Thanks.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Okay. Two diﬀerent questions. On the ﬁrst one about -- my comment on the global APE is
valid for protection and health. That means that we expect protection and health APE to
be positive this year.
On the second question, it's on the stress test, I have no speciﬁc worry for the stress test
of the AO (parcel). It's part of the exercise. We did it last year. So no worry.

well thought out. But you obviously seem comfortable. So that's ﬁne.

A - Gerald Harlin

Yes, no, we still have discussion on the test, on the curve, on the yield curves. We have
some open questions. But again, I don't have any speciﬁc worry.

Good evening, Gerald.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Hello, Andrew.

FINAL

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Couple of questions. One, if you look back over the last seven years, on the life net ﬂows,
over half the net ﬂows in the year appear in the First Quarter, which suggests a level of
seasonality there. In fact, do you see that as likely to recur this year, or do you think that
there are special factors this year which may change that pattern?
And secondly, going back onto the AO stress test, the more you've looked at your own
economic capital of (sort of) (inaudible) base relative to the Omnibus 2 stuﬀ, which was
provided at the back end of last year, do you think there will be -- if you were to do your
economic capital on the -- for the current long-term guarantees, do you think it would
change the numbers and then -- and the coverage signiﬁcantly?

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. On your ﬁrst question relative to the net ﬂows, I would say that, if I exclude the US
impact and the 0.9 I mentioned before, we would be at EUR2.7 billion. Last year, we
posted 1.1. And excluding the exceptional, last year, we were at 4 -- slightly above 4. I can
expect this year to be better than last year in term of net inﬂows. But it's a bit premature to
tell you exactly where we will be.
But on your second question, which is a question on (QIS) -- .

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

-- Yes.

A - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Could you repeat your question, Andrew, perhaps?

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Yes. The capital coverage ratio which you publish is -- doesn't bake in some of the
Omnibus 2. So long-term guarantee issues. What I was wondering -- I know I may have
spoken on this at length, what would happen to your economic capital coverage if you
were to sort of bake in all the sort of newer -- ?

A - Gerald Harlin

-- Okay. I see your question, which is an important one. But I remind you that I cannot
precisely answer your question yet. I know that Alliance mentioned 20 to 30. And I'm sure
that you are referring to this, a 20 to 30 points impact.

FINAL

As I said in (one and one) (inaudible), my initial feeling was that it was high. But I cannot
be more precise. As you know, we will review our models with the (SAPR). We'll review
our models in -- by the end of the year. And we'll get a full clarity I would say next year,
most probably mid of next year.
So I have no -- I'm not at all anxious starting from a position of 210. No doubt that there
will be some adjustment. And adjustment which concerns all the companies. And you can
see that, starting from a comfortable point, that level, that 210, is that I'm quite
comfortable for the future.
On the magnitude of these adjustments, unfortunately, it's too early.

Yes, good evening. Just on the group life business in Switzerland again, I'm a bit
surprised about the timing of your (inaudible) product oﬀering (inaudible) is growing the
(inaudible) strongly in 2013. And interest rates were quite a bit lower. And since then, the
SST has rather been (relaxing for price). And so, why did you plan the repositioning right
now? And did the proposed pension reforms or (inaudible) play a role there as well?

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

I would say that, as you know, our proﬁtability is quite good. I remind you that we have, on
average, an IRR in Switzerland which should be around 13%. For a country where rates are
below 1%, it's quite good. That's on average.
But as you can imagine, the marginal impacts. And we take care of the marginal impact of
the new production. And what we said is that we have two type of business, as I said. We
have the business with the (inaudible) (agents). We have the business with the brokers.
And the margin on proﬁtability of business with brokers is lower. And that explains why
we prefer to optimize our capital.

FINAL

Such type of decision is absolutely in line with, I would say Ambition AXA and what we
call selectivity. That means that -- and more and more going forward, we will have to take
care of capital and marginal return on capital. And that's the reason why we decided this
year to do it.
It doesn't mean that it's impressive because you have a decline in the APE ratio. But you
know -- keep in mind that the semiautonomous type of business makes that the NBV will
be above 100%. NBV margin will be above 100%. So this explains why.
And beyond Switzerland, we could expect in the future to be faced in the Solvency 2
world research type of move, which will be aim -- which will aim at optimizing the return
on capital. And from time to time, it's at the expense of the top line. But what is important
is the bottom line and the return on capital.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

It's just I assumed that the returns were probably quite a bit lower last year. And you took
this decision early this year.

No, no, it's only because, progressively, you know -- look -- I mentioned that, among the
reasons that I mentioned just before, we have also the fact that, progressively, we have to
invest at lower interest rates.
So that's mainly the point. And keep in mind as well that some part of this business of the
investment part will be done with AXA IM. And on top of this, we will beneﬁt on this new
(improved) business at AXA IM.
