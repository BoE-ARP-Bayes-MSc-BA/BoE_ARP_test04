Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I'll open the call with a brief overview, then I'll
turn the call over to Jeff to go over our financial results, then I'll come back on and speak
in more detail about our business and the market.
Last night, we released our first quarter earnings, where we reported an ROE of 11.8% and
an operating ROE of 6.1%. We had positive results in our Catastrophe segment, which
benefited from low loss activity, and our Lloyd's segment, which had an especially strong
quarter. Our investments portfolio also performed relatively well. And while our casualty
and specialty business experienced some unusually large loss activity resulting in a
breakeven quarter, they delivered strong growth and otherwise performed within
expectations.
As discussed on the last call, the market remains difficult, and we continue to see
reductions to rates. While we cannot change this environment, we can define our strategy
and execute it well. And I promise that we will continue to exercise the same levels of
discipline, as we have in the past. This disciplined approach to capital and risk
management is why we continue to be the preferred partner for a wide range of
companies on both sides of the risk transfer equation.
As others are becoming more risk-tolerant, we are becoming less so. For example, we
shrank the size of our property cat book by eliminating underpriced business. In addition,
we managed our risk profile by increasing our ceded purchase in all three of our
segments, most notably, in specialty.
We've also diversified our risk and improved our overall return profile by building our
casualty and specialty business. The breakeven results for this quarter do not alter our
perception of this business or the correctness of our overall strategy. Several eventspecific losses affected our results, which Jeff will explain in greater detail.

FINAL

These low-frequency, high-severity loss events were not a surprise but a characteristic of
the portfolios from which they emanated. Assuming our customers' volatility is what we
do and from time-to-time, will result in a bad quarter or even a bad year. The losses we
experienced over the quarter are idiosyncratic and not something I expect to continue.
Over the long-term, our record of profitability speaks for itself.
This year, we will focus our attention more than ever on building and enhancing our client
relationships, recognizing the changing market dynamics where a number of our clients
are centralizing their purchases of reinsurance. While our team has been disciplined and
pulled back from business that did not meet our hurdles, we have also demonstrated
market leadership by bringing unique and value-added services to our clients.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Kevin. And good morning, everyone. I'll cover our results for the first quarter, and
then, as always, update you on our top line forecast for the remainder of 2016.
While, the first quarter was again a relatively quiet in terms of Catastrophe losses, we did
experience higher claims incidence in our Specialty Reinsurance segment. Alternative
asset results from our private equity portfolio were also depressed during the quarter.
However, the decline in interest rates and credit spreads resulted in strong mark-tomarket investment performance that helped our reported net income and book value
growth. Year-over-year top line growth comparisons are skewed by the inclusion of
Platinum's results only after the close of the acquisition on March 2nd in the year-ago
period.
Moving on to the financial results. We reported net income of $128 million or $2.95 per
diluted share and operating income of $66 million or $1.51 per share for the first quarter.
The annualized operating ROE for the quarter was 6.1%; and our tangible book value per
share growth, including change in accumulated dividends was 2.6%.
Let me shift to our segment results, beginning with our Lloyd's segment, followed by
Specialty Reinsurance – or by – the Cat segment, then followed by Specialty Reinsurance,
and Lloyd's. In our Cat segment, managed cat gross premiums written in the first quarter
declined by 9% from the year-ago period, driven by price reductions and our decision to
pull back from risk that no longer met our thresholds.
Recall last quarter, we had highlighted our decision to cut back significantly our
participation in the assumed retro business at the January 1 renewals. As a reminder,
managed cat includes the premiums written on our wholly-owned balance sheets, as well
as cat premium written by joint ventures DaVinci, Top Layer Re and Upsilon.
Net premiums written for the Cat segment decreased 15% from the prior-year period,
reflecting increased purchases of retro reinsurance relative to a year ago. The first quarter

Page 3 of 24

FINAL

combined ratio for the Cat unit was 27.5%. Catastrophe losses were benign, and net
favorable reserve development totaled $6 million in the quarter.
In our Specialty segment, gross premiums written increased by $245 million, relative to
the year-ago period. There were two main drivers of this growth. First, as I mentioned
earlier, there was a timing difference between the year ago-period, only reflecting
business written by Platinum during the month of March. The other driver was significant
growth in our credit book, primarily reflecting increased mortgage reinsurance
opportunities that we had also highlighted on last quarter's call.
Our top line in the quarter included $139 million of credit-related premiums, principally
reflecting a few large mortgage reinsurance deals. While we booked premiums written
for the mortgage reinsurance deals at inception, they have a long duration, and
consequently, are often earned over a period of approximately 10 years.

Bloomberg Transcript

As we've grown our specialty book, we have also increased the use of ceded purchases
to enhance overall returns. Consequently, we are actively managing the net retained risk
across our casualty and specialty book, and particularly, in the newer credit lines, where
we've been growing.
The Specialty Reinsurance combined ratio for the first quarter came in at 100%, which was
essentially breakeven. Attritional loss trends have remained generally benign. This
segment reported net adverse development of $3.5 million in the quarter. Continued
favorable reserve development on attritional losses of $17 million was more than offset in
the quarter by approximately $21 million of net unfavorable development on six eventdriven specialty claims. Those events included a bankruptcy surety claim, two train
derailments, a dam failure and an energy loss.
Our practice for Specialty events, which have low-frequency, but high-severity loss profiles
like these is to put up additional case reserves against the loss. Thus, of the total eventdriven reserve strengthening this quarter, $19 million related to ACRs, which is well above
the reported loss level for these events. The expense ratio of 40.9% in Specialty
Reinsurance was five points higher than in the year-ago quarter, principally due to higher
acquisition costs related to the credit lines.
In our Lloyd's segment, we generated $133 million of premiums in the first quarter, an
increase of 2% compared with the year-ago period. Our growth rate is lower than we had
indicated in our guidance for the year and is reflective of a generally competitive
marketplace. Net premiums written at our Lloyd's unit are down 19% for the quarter.
Recall, we have meaningfully increased our sessions at Lloyd's to manage the risk profile
of the business, as we have grown in recent years.
The Lloyd's unit came in at a profitable combined ratio of 90.4% for the first quarter,
reflecting generally benign loss experience. The unit reported $1 million of net adverse
reserve development in the quarter. The expense ratio at 46.3% was slightly higher than a
year ago but better than in the fourth quarter. The expense ratio continues to be
impacted by the use of ceded purchases relative to our top line growth.

FINAL

Turning to investments. We reported net investment income of $29 million in the first
quarter. Recurring investment income from fixed maturity securities totaled $36 million for
the first quarter. Our alternative investment portfolio generated a loss of $6 million in the
first quarter, reflecting $9 million of negative marks on our private equity investments,
which were slightly offset by positive performance on other investments.
Performance in our private equity portfolio was weaker than anticipated, with a few funds
posting mark-to-market losses during the quarter. The annualized total return on the
overall investment portfolio was a solid 4% in the quarter. A decline in treasury yields and
credit spreads for many investment classes resulted in strong unrealized gains on
investments.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our investment portfolio remains conservatively positioned, primarily in fixed maturity
investments with a high degree of liquidity and modest credit exposure. The duration of
our investment portfolio remained relatively short at 2.2 years and is stable to where it has
been in recent quarters. The yield to maturity on fixed income and short-term investments
was slightly lower at 2%. Our capital and holding company liquidity positions remained
very strong. During the first quarter, we bought back 769,000 shares for a total of $85
million. We have not repurchased shares since the end of the quarter. As we look forward,
any decision relating to share repurchases will, as always, depend on our view of business
opportunities, the profile of our risk portfolio and evaluation of the stock.
Finally, let me provide you with an update to our top line forecast for 2016. At this time,
we are maintaining our prior top line guidance for each of the segments. I'd remind
everyone, as always, that premium estimates of this nature are subject to considerable
risk and uncertainty, and our goal in providing them is to give you our best estimates at
this point in time.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin.

Kevin J. O'Donnell
Thanks, Jeff. As Jeff just mentioned, our property Cat segment performed well with the
combined ratio of 27.5% for the quarter. Like everyone, we are facing a very competitive
rate environment in the cat market. So, while we cannot control rates, we can control the
amount of risk we take. As I discussed earlier, that risk is down year-on-year.
The major renewal for the quarter was Japan, which was, again, competitive. But despite
another round of price reductions, pricing for Japanese earthquake risk remains higher
than prior to the Tohoku 2011 earthquake.
So, we are quite pleased with the portfolio that we constructed and even found a few
opportunities to grow with good customers in adequately priced layers. As we approach
the June 1 renewals in Florida, many of the major trends from prior years continue to
resonate. Overall, while there are many moving parts, demand in Florida looks like it will
be roughly flat. However, we continue to expect pricing pressure of this renewal due to
ongoing abundant supply, although we anticipate that price decreases will be more

FINAL

muted than in prior years. We believe, however, that we can continue to construct a
market-leading portfolio. As always, we will exercise discipline and ensure that we are
paid adequately for the risk that we are assuming.
For primary companies operating in the Florida homeowners' insurance market, premiums
are down and loss ratios are up. Florida insurance companies are still profitable for the
most part, but this is not a positive trend. These deteriorating conditions have implications
for both the health of our clients and the post-loss social inflation environment, so we're
watching them closely.
Turning to our casualty and specialty book. As I discussed at the beginning of the call, we
recognized some losses within the casualty and specialty portfolio in the first quarter. As
Jeff mentioned, these are event-specific losses and, we believe, are not indicative of any
underlying trend. While it's not customary to speak of events in casualty and specialty,
perhaps because of our property cat roots, we sometimes discuss the book in these
terms.

Bloomberg Transcript

In looking through some of our reinsurance treaties, we identified a few events that we
believe needed additional ACR. What this means is that we increased our loss reserves in
excess of what the clients reported, as we have thought these events were subject to
greater uncertainty than generally appreciated. This is strictly a retroactive adjustment and
does not inform our current book or any expectations for our reserves more broadly.
Overall, the reserves for the affected classes have developed in line with our
expectations of loss emergence. The unusual aspect of this quarter is that the loss
emergence appears in somewhat of a cluster. There have been other quarters where we
have been fortunate to be on the other side of this volatility of loss emergence. But
gauged over a longer timeframe, these portfolios are performing as expected.
Even though the marketplace remains competitive, there were signs that ceding
commissions may have topped out, which is welcome news after several years of
increasing generosity to cedents. Unfortunately, there were also signs of increased rate
competition on the insurance books that we are protecting. And with that, we expect to
see higher loss ratios and less margin in this business over time.
We continue to see select growth opportunities in casualty and specialty. Although these
are primarily in the financial and credit lines, we renewed strongly in the mortgage
reinsurance space. Mortgage reinsurance has the type of business profile that we like,
one in which the market needs our capacity and is looking to transact with only a select
number of well-rated and highly respected reinsurance counterparties.
In general, we always look to grow our business with core clients in areas in which we are
able to generate the best returns. The characteristics of this market match well with our
three competitive advantages of customer relationships, risk selection and capital
management. And we are optimistic there will be more opportunities to deploy capital in
this area.

FINAL

Moving to our Lloyd's business now. Our Lloyd's unit had a profitable quarter, delivering a
90% combined ratio. We are seeing steady progress in the growth of this business, which
continues to develop as a winning franchise with great potential. We believe that we are
building an efficient portfolio in Lloyd's and look to that segment to be a meaningful
contributor to our profitability over time.
Results for the quarter were substantially better than for the previous quarter. While we
are very pleased with Syndicate 1458's performance, we should remain mindful that
results for this business will average out over the long term. And as discussed last quarter,
one should not be overly focused on a good quarter or a bad quarter. On the gross to net
side, we've constructed an attractive gross portfolio, and the capital efficiency of the book
was improved by virtue of our ceded strategy.
Finally, I'd like to briefly discuss a few of the losses that occurred after the close of the
quarter. Let me start with the earthquakes in Japan and Ecuador. While it's too early to
actually estimate the losses from either of these earthquakes, our initial expectation is
that due to the way in which the personal and commercial risk is covered, and also the
types of business our exposure emanates from, our losses will be limited.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Japan, the excess of loss covers purchased by Japanese companies are not likely to be
materially impacted, and therefore, by extension, should not affect the retro market.
While the Japanese proportional covers may result in losses to reinsurers, we are not a
significant writer of this business.
In Ecuador, we anticipate that our loss will be low, given the level of insurance penetration
in the country. Similar to Japan, we don't see Ecuador impacting our retro book. And as
you will remember, we reduced our exposure to this area significantly at the January
renewal. I
In addition to the earthquakes, Texas is experiencing volatile weather, including significant
hailstorm losses. As with any large U.S property cat event, we will likely have some
exposure. While we're in the preliminary stages of evaluating the losses, we think that the
hail activity will likely result in some losses to the lower end of regional covers but will be
retained by the national primary carriers. With that, while we expect some loss – and to
flow to us in the reinsurance market generally, but for the most part, losses will be
retained by cedents.
And with that, I'll turn it over for questions. Operator?

Good morning. Thank you. And just first question is, want to get a more detail on the
reserve addition in the Specialty line. What were these – like, those clients, was it region
offshore or region in the U.S.? And also, what's the reason behind – you have to add it to –
(22:03) late reporting, or you have additional information you added to it? And I just
wonder, will that change your reserving process and practice going forward?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Thanks, Kai. So, I think, in – I think, maybe anticipating a couple of questions around this.
Maybe, it'd be useful to provide a – maybe expand on Kevin's description a little bit of the
– on the numbers, the process, and then any conclusions that we draw from these
developments. So, as we said in the prepared remarks, the segment only had about $3.5
million of adverse development. And it's important to bear in mind that, that's relative to
$1.8 billion in casualty reserve. So, it's relatively small. It does mask the fact that there was
$17 million of favorable development on attritional losses. And then as, I think, I mentioned
in my remarks, there's $21 million related to the specific events.

Bloomberg Transcript

To answer your first question in terms of the geography for the events, somewhere in the
U.S., somewhere in – somewhere elsewhere in the world, so I wouldn't describe them as
concentrated in any one geography. Given our process – maybe talking about our
process, just a minute, as Kevin said, historically, I – and I suppose it's – given our cat roots,
we tend to look at these kinds of large industry losses as – more as events, almost similar
to a cat event. And this is consistently how we've looked at events in the specialty book
over time, that include the subprime crisis, the Madoff fraud, LIBOR rigging, scandal, the
VW situation, and more recently the Tianjin explosion in China.
So, we look at these events, and our underwriters working with our finance team, and
actuary make a judgment about whether or not the – we have more information that
makes us want to – or indicates that we – perhaps this event is larger than we anticipated,
it would be. And I think that's the case in these six particular events, that we got new
information that caused us to revaluate the size of the event overall. So, lots of times, we
have to make an assessment of the size of the event, our potential exposure before we
have reported losses from clients. And to some degree or another, that's the case in this
instance.
And then I think in terms of what conclusions do we draw from anything that happened in
the quarter, I think, as Kevin said, given that these six events aren't related to one another
in almost any way that we can think of, geography, peril, line of business, we don't take
away any trend in these, and thus, don't see any need to change our process. And our
process this quarter was no different than in any previous quarter.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. Just add-on to that – a follow-on to that. In the past, if you look at these events,
more like a cat event, but your track record is showing that in your property cat business,
you tend to be more conservative, initially booking the losses, and then gradually, it can
be released through years. What's different here?

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

FINAL

I wouldn't characterize the – I think, to your point, I think we have a very strong track record
of reserving across all of our businesses, and that's certainly the case in cat. We don't look
at these any differently and thinking about the industry loss than we would, as if it were a
cat event.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. Then...

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

So, I try not to talk in terms of conservative or anything other than that. It's – we try and
make our best judgment at the time we put up reserves against any loss. And I think,
overtime, we've evidenced a pretty good track record in that regard.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. That's fair. If we – stepping back, if you take out this $200 million considered one-off
reserve addition, and then if you normalize your private equity fund return to like another
$20 million, and this quarter, the ROE would've been probably around 10%. I just wonder,
is this the new normal in the low cat quarter, like a low double-digit rate charge.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I think that's a great question. And I think you're taking a couple of things out of what's
actually a pretty complicated quarter. So, I think if we talk about what's in the quarter, we
can get a sense as to the moving parts that we're experiencing.
I'd say, other than the fact that we are several years into a soft market and returns are
down, I'm not sure there's a lot of signals than what I'm seeing in the quarterly report that
we've put out. Looking at cat, we've talked about it being a competitive market. And as
you'd expect, we are writing a good portfolio, and we are de-risking it, as rates are down
and our risk tolerance is up.
Looking at Specialty, I think, I would really try to determine whether the book – at the
highest level, the information that we have with the losses is whether the book is
adequately priced or whether the book is adequately reserved. Our view is that we've
written a good book and that we're continuing to position it to where the rates are best,
hence the growth in the financial lines and, specifically, the mortgage.
I think the pressure on ceding commissions and the fact that, that's beginning to abate is
good news. On the other side of it, we're beginning to see some rate tension and some
rate competition in the primary books that we're protecting. Our underwriters are trained
to monitor that and to evaluate that and something that we're working – we're watching
closely. I think with – and so thinking about it, I'm not sure there's a ton of signal in the way
to think about our returns only and the fact that there's a lot of moving pieces within the
cat book and the specialty book.

Page 9 of 24

FINAL

Additionally, we had the investment performance this quarter, which had both mark-tomarket loss – gains on the fixed income portfolio and then some marks on the private
equity. And again, our strategy on that book is the same. And our perception of the ability
– or the earning capability of that book is what it has been. So, I feel like what we're doing
is the right things in recognition of a soft market. And there's a lot of moving pieces
around. It's hard to isolate, and then try to extrapolate forward.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. That's good. That's very helpful. If I may, last question is that – on the buybacks. It
looks like buybacks is a little bit smaller than your net income for the quarter. Are you still
committed to return more than your earnings through the year?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Thanks, Kai. Yeah. As I think I said on last quarter's call that we anticipated the volume
more than we earned in the year. And that's – that our point – at this point in the year, we
don't see any reason to alter that guidance to you.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. And I just want to make sure. The earning you're referring to, because there is big
delta this quarter, is the net income or operating income?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Try not to focus on any – it's more than we earned, however, you measure that, yes.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

Operator
Your next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Sterne Agee. Please, go ahead.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. So, I just wanted to follow up on the adverse development. So, would it
be fair to assume that the underlying business really hasn't changed, that's the reserving
on the underlying business, and that still is trending in the right direction? You said, $17
million?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yeah. That's – on both accounts, that's correct. I think, Jeff, what we're trying to do here is
provide a ton of transparency. And in thinking about the $17 million with attritional loss
development on our curve and then thinking about the fact that we added additional
reserve to some specific events is really just us trying to put more transparency around
the loss that we have in the quarter, which ultimately, is $3.5 million. We've not changed
our view of our risk. And we think that if you're looking at signals coming out of the
Page 10 of 24



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2016-04-27

reserves, a stronger signal comes from whether you have – the frequency of your loss
emergence is changing, not whether you have, what I'll call, as an unlucky quarter with a
cluster of larger events coming in.

FINAL

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure. And also just curious about whether this adverse development tells you anything
about the book of business that you wrote. So, first of all, it would be helpful to
understand whether this came from the Platinum business, number one; number two,
RenaissanceRe is growing pretty significantly in Specialty, and so curious as to whether this
reserve addition adds color to the growth that you've had before?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
So, again, good questions. I think, the – traditionally the way that I think the quarter would
be reported, from an actuarial standpoint, would be that we had $3.5 million of adverse
development against $1.8 billion of total reserves. We are bringing in the other information
to get some transparency. And the reason we want to give that transparency is we
believe there's not a signal in the reserve development we've had for the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, we do have a slightly different process than many, and that we think about things in an
event, from an event mentality, which allows us to put the loss up when we hear about it
similarly to what we did in Madoff. And then over time, we'll determine whether it was the
appropriate reserve as the rest of the curve runs out.
I think the other question I have is between whether it's the Platinum book or the
Renaissance book. We're a fully integrated organization, and we don't think of us, as
having a legacy Platinum book or a legacy Renaissance book. I would say, the books of
business that are most affected by this, really come in to the excess casualty. We have
some surety in financial lines and a little bit of a general casualty stock that comes in. So,
it's reasonably spread, it's written across multiple platforms, and it's coming in from
different types of loss into different types of lines. So, it's hard to categorize it as one or
the other.

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

The only thing I would add, Vinay, is that – related to that is that our reserving process is
across both the legacy Platinum organization prior to – or what would have been prior to
close. And RenRe have been synced up since the day of the close. So, we've been
operating our reserving processes, and they've been synced up since the close, so – and
then the only other thing that you touched on, I don't know whether Kevin mentioned, just
to close it off, we don't think this reserve additions, at all, inform any view of the
profitability of the in-force book, or the areas in which we've grown over the last year or
two years.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. The second question is on the profitability, actually, the reported
profitability within Specialty and Lloyd's. The accident-year loss ratio actually was

Page 11 of 24



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2016-04-27

significantly better than the prior three quarters. Was it something special this quarter, or
should we expect this level of profitability for the future?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

No, I think, from an accident-year perspective is just relatively benign loss experience.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. And then one last one, if I may. The ceded reinsurance increased significantly both
in Specialty and Lloyd's. Should we be thinking about that moving forward too, or was it
just a one-quarter issue?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

I think looking at the Lloyd's, we had a bigger increase, and we talked more about it
probably in the fourth quarter than we did in the first quarter for the Lloyd's increase in
Specialty. The ceded Specialty is one where – we're doing that to enhance the returns of
the portfolio. So, for instance, one of the places that we're continuing to see a lot of
opportunity to grow is in the financial lines and credit lines, most specifically, in the
mortgage. So we're buying more ceded in that area, because it allows us to construct a
better portfolio, as we continue to grow it.
It allows others to leverage off our expertise and access the business because of our
strong ratings. So we're exchanging risk premium for fee income. So, the opportunity – we
will continue to increase our sessions in that, matched up against the opportunity we have
to write that business. To give you some sense of scale at this point, we're ceding and
representing other capital for about 50% of the business that we're writing right now.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Your next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Please, go ahead.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

A couple of quick numbers. First, the guidance then based on 1Q results would seem to
imply that you would expect Specialty to shrink for the rest of the year, and Lloyd's to
grow to sort of make up for 1Q. So somewhere in the neighborhood of like 30% a year. I
mean, is that directionally, effectively, what you're saying?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
So, starting on the Cat, I think our guidance of down 10% seems reasonable. On the
Lloyd's, some of the things that we anticipated growing were lightly represented in the
first quarter. So I think we will see – or we hope and anticipate that we'll see better growth
as we go through the year.

FINAL

With Specialty, I think, Specialty still continues to be on the lumpier side. I think we are
seeing better opportunity, and there's a very good pipeline of mortgage deals,
particularly from the GSEs, coming down the pipe. So, we won't stop accepting Specialty
business, because we have guidance out. If our ability to write profitable business is
greater than our guidance, we'll revise it over time.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay. Got it. And then the items – sort of loss items you mentioned in the quarter, did that
impact Tower Hill in the quarter as well?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
The Tower Hill – from the reinsurance that we write for Tower Hill, that's predominantly
property cat stuff. The type of AOB loss that is coming in is not something that would
affect those reinsurances. The piece that it would affect is that we're an owner of Tower
Hill, and Tower Hill's profitability has been affected by the assignment of benefits claims in
Florida. I think they are increasingly sophisticated in the way that they're handling those
claims. And I hope that over time, it'll become a lesser story than it is right now.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Got it. And then just one other quick one. On the Specialty then, the expense ratio
that ticked up in the first quarter, is that – just given the mix of the business and how
you're growing, is that where we should think about that? And then on the operating
expense side, should we be thinking about that in terms of notional dollars or a
percentage?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Yeah. I think on the specialty expenses, the operational expenses and the acquisition
expense, the expense ratio overall – for the operational expenses, I think what you're
seeing there is really three full months in this quarter versus last quarter, and the
increased head count in that segment. It is the largest part of the Platinum integration that
got integrated, moved into the Specialty platform. So that's not surprising.
I think on the acquisition expense, that's a function of both the increase in the level of
premium and the change in business mix from a little more proportional business and the
increase in the mortgage business, which carries higher acquisition costs. So, to the extent
that that business mix is roughly consistent going forward, I think that's a fair assessment.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. And then just one last one if I could sneak it in. I mean, sort of picking up on Kai's
question. I guess, looking at your historical results, in light cat quarters like this one, ROEs
were – those are your best ROEs, just because, even though with soft pricing, a lack of
activities the two sort of move together and those are the years where book value grew
the most, and margins were your best, and ROEs were the best.

FINAL

I mean, I guess, in this market, is it right to compare what we got today to your average
historical, or is it right to compare this to, again – and this is adjusting for investment the
shortfall in investment income. I get to about that same sort of 10% ROE number if we
sort of normalize those out. Is it better to compare this to your average historical or to
kind of those peak years when you've benefited from a lack of cats?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
It's a good question, and it's a hard one to answer. I think looking at the book of business,
I think our cat portfolio performed well. I also think we're a different company today than
we were before, where we do have the diversity coming in, in most quarters from the
Specialty business. I think the other thing to think about is just – or what I'd like to convey is
the way that we think about the business, which is we're not trying to build the best
portfolio in a low-cat quarter, we're trying to build the best portfolio against all outcomes.
If we wanted to optimize our returns in a no cat quarter, we would just write more, we'd
expose more capital, we'd buy less. And everything that we're doing is trying to come up
with the most efficient portfolio. So, we've got guidance out of down 10%, we're writing
less. We're reducing risk and exposing less capital, and we're buying more ceded. So, I
think it is hard to compare exactly what we've done in the past, but it's 100% rationale to
think that rates are down significantly after several years of the soft market. So, it's a little
bit of a mix bag as I would think about it, I'd say.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Yeah. The only thing I'd add to what Kevin said is, I think, it is difficult to compare, because
the facts and circumstances in prior years don't compare well with these. And the way we
run the business, in any point in time, might not compare with that in terms of the level – is
it a risk-on, risk-off year? As Kevin mentioned, we've been buying a lot of ceded
protection and reduced risk in, really, all three of our segments. And then, there's the
interest rate environment, which is historically low by any comparison.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Correct.

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

FINAL

Hi. Good morning.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Good morning, Sarah.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Following-up on the capital position, your premium to equity of 35% is near all-time lows,
even though your book is less cat-dependent. So, is it correct to think that you could
probably double your operating leverage, and you have nearly $2 billion of excess capital?
And if, so why hold so much capital?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I don't think premium to equity in our business is probably a terribly useful metric, just
because it – there's a lot of different ways that we take on economic risk. And so, I
wouldn't necessarily use that term. That said, even based on what I said, I think we have a
very strong capital position. And as I think we've tried to say in previous calls, we always
look to return what we don't think we can use after we've looked at the risk in the book.
And admittedly, I think the risk in the book, relatively speaking, is lower.
But we also look at potential opportunities and other ways to deploy the capital and hold
some amount of capital for that. That said, as I noted earlier, I think we're in an extremely
strong capital position. We look at the share price in terms of a consideration as well as to
when and how much we buy back shares. But, yeah, I think as we said at the beginning of
the call, it's – we intend to buy back more stock this year than we earned.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And then just on the net investment income, what's the right run rate to be
thinking about there, and have the private equity investments rebounded so far in the
second quarter?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Well, putting a pause on the second part of the question, I mean, I think if you look at the
recurring net investment income in the quarter of about $36 million, that's actually pretty
consistent through time. We've been earning roughly that on the fixed income portfolio.
That's reflective of the duration, the yield on the book at its current size. So, I think, that
run rate is likely to hold for some time.
We've had a rather sharp rebound in the equity markets since the end of the – or during
the last couple of months. I'm certainly hopeful that private equity returns are higher, but
that's one that we don't get a lot of inter-quarter information about, so we make our best
estimate of the value of those funds on a real-time basis at the end of the quarter. We'll
Page 15 of 24

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

...prepared remarks, there's two parts of it. It's big growth on a dollar basis. It's two parts.
It's the credit-related deals that we've been doing and the Platinum growth.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. Makes sense. And then, just another quick – just accounting. Where does the fee
income hit that you get on those mortgage insurance deals? Is that going to be a credit to
your acquisition costs or be somewhere else?

To some degree.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yeah. I think it'll take some time, because it'll be based, in some degree, on the
profitability of the portfolios.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. Okay. Great. And then last question, just – Kevin, you mentioned, and looking at
the Specialty business, that you said, competition increasing some of the primary lines
that you're seeing, and you expected maybe some margin compression going forward.
Just curious, could you be more specific on what lines are you seeing the increased
competition?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yeah. I think, if we were looking at, I'd say, it's probably more in the Specialty lines than in
some of the more traditional casualty lines. Like an extreme example would be, like, we
have a very small airline account. There's been a lot of aviation competition. On the
positive side, we're seeing good opportunities in the mortgage, as we discussed. I think
the general casualty is more of a mixed bag, where we're seeing some – it's more of an
account specific. I think it's hard to draw that conclusion for the market at this point, but
when you see some price deterioration in some accounts, it's not crazy to begin to think
that the whole market will begin to become more competitive.
I would – it's more specialty than in the traditional causality lines. And within the casualty
lines, it's more on specific accounts, which, again, we're watching closely to see if it
becomes more of a market level competition. I actually don't want to point out some of
the professional lines. We're seeing increased competition, I'd say, more broadly as well.

Your next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please, go ahead.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. Repeating some of the points earlier, but just trying to clarify, the loss
events seen this quarter higher frequency than normal, are these widely distributed
throughout the industry? And we've only had a few reporters, but it doesn't seem like
those companies that have reported so far have the same amount of concern that you
Page 17 of 24



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2016-04-27

guys do. Do you think that these were one-offs that you took a large piece of, or do you
think that as more reporters report their numbers, we'll see that this is a bigger issue for
the industry, in general?

FINAL

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
So, I think that's a good way to think about it. These – we are a very small percent of the
insured loss on this. And it's coming through a lot of very different books of business. The
– so, I think these are industry events. I think most of these events have been on the cover
of the paper, when they occur. So, I do believe it's affecting people more broadly.
I think the unique thing about us is just the way that we talk about these losses, where
going back to the previous comment, I think, net, I think, someone may – a traditional way
to talk about this is you have $3.5 million of adverse development, and wouldn't get into
the specifics of the moving parts. We're trying to give you a little bit of more clarity as to
how we're thinking about it. And then secondly, I think our cat-biased background naturally
pushes us to think of these in terms of events with the rest of the market. We'll think of
them as already in current reserves.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. That's a perfect answer. And one thing which was probably been asked six ways
from Sunday for years, following upon what Sarah had asked about capital, is there a way
to think about how much less risk your balance sheet might be bearing for catastrophe,
than it might have been doing so four years ago?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Again, I think that's a great question. And it's one that – it's different by region, and it's
different by loss level, which always makes it complicated. I know we've talked about that
before. I would say – I would look potentially at what our session is and look at our growth
cat premium to our net cat premium. And you'll see that there's a lot of premium that
we're representing on behalf of other capital.
The most specific example I can give on that is thinking of the FACF (52:26) line that we
put out last year. At the end of the day, we brought 19 sources of capital to that. So, it's
hard to be really specific as to how risk is represented on our balance sheet today as
compared to how it is represented years ago. But I'd say that we are being very
thoughtful and aggressive in thinking about constructing our net portfolios, using
traditional and non-traditional sources.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

All right. Well, I mean, if you ever decide you want to give – if you have better
understanding how to think about that, I would – I'll be first in line to listen.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Appreciate that. I think it's one of those that the way we think about it is in such an
interrogated way across the risks that we're taking, that it's difficult for us to come up with
Page 18 of 24



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td

a simple metric that represents the risk in a material way.

And it makes complete sense. It's just hard for yokels like me, as you probably imagined.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell

communicate about it that didn't push out too much information to our competitors.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. I just had a couple of other questions. Outside of the main thing we've
been talking about, your corporate expenses, those obviously have jumped around as
you had some integration expenses in there. Are they still inflated because of the
integration with Platinum, and where would that settle out, do you think?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Thanks, Jay. It's – so we had corporate expenses in the quarter of about $8.2 million. Of
that amount, roughly, $1 million related to the severance for one of our employees, and
then we had an additional $1.6 million related to continued integration expense in the
quarter. So, if you think of the $8.2 million, less those two amounts, that would have been
about $5.6 million. We're going to incur about $1.3 million, I think, in integration expenses
over the remainder of 2016, and then only about $300,000 in 2017. So, net-net, I – the
way I think about corporate expenses kind of landing in a range is probably somewhere
between $5 million and $5.5 million on a quarterly basis.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

That's really helpful, Jeff. Thank you. The second question on the Lloyd's business. I think,

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. I know this is unanswerable, but you mentioned in the Specialty Reinsurance, that
there was sort of attritional reserve development that was favorable, and I'm wondering
why we're not seeing that sort of trend in the Lloyd's segment as well?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
So, I guess, your first part of the question was operative; it's unanswerable. I think, the
way I think about it, they're different businesses that we're building up. It's a smaller book
within Lloyd's, and it's a book that includes both property and specialty. So, I think there's
a couple of pieces to it. But we do have a traditional – within the casualty that we write,
and within the specialty that we write, in particularly the casualty and specialty that's on
more than one of our platforms, they reserve the same way.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Understood. With regard to the – and again, here in Specialty Reinsurance, with
regard to the mortgage insurance, I understand that the acquisition expense ratio is
heightened because of the expenses associated with that. Are there any start-up
expenses that are associated with building up this book of business, or is this a good run
rate, assuming that this mix of earned premium and DAC asset amortization continues?

Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. My question, do you anticipate the changes
to A.M. Best, BCAR, best capital adequacy ratio, to that methodology? Do you think that
those changes will drive an increased demand for property catastrophe reinsurance?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yeah. I think – looking back, the last time A.M. Best changed the model, it created a big
opportunity for us to sell additional cover. I think, this time, the conversations we've had
with A.M. Best are much more measured in that their analysis of the change in the model,
it doesn't materially change people's capital requirements. My guess is there'll be some
exceptions to that. But at this point in time, we don't have enough information to have
real clarity as to what it means to our portfolio. But if what we're hearing is accurate, it
shouldn't be – unfortunately, it probably won't create much of an opportunity for us, but

Page 21 of 24



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td

and mutuals by aggregates, is there risk between the Q1 and Q2 events that we're going
to see aggregates max out, maybe even blow out in the top to these companies?

FINAL

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yeah. I think that's a great question, and it's something that we're looking at now. They're
definitely going to be impacted. So now, the question is by how much? So, even if the
aggregates are only eroded, it changes the profile of your risk exposure going into wind
season, so it's something we're looking at now. The other thing is it's been volatile. There
was activity last night, actually. So, I think we're kind of in the – it's almost like a live cat right
now. But the point you're raising is really important point to focus on, not only as to
whether we'll have losses from these events, but how it changes your exposure profile
that the aggregates are materially eroded.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Got it. Got it. That's what I was wondering. Okay. Great. And then not to beat a dead
horse by I thought I'd ask things I don't think have come up yet on the specialty losses.
First, given there are 15 events, where these all Q4 events that you just didn't have
enough information on, or were they spread out throughout 2015?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
It's a mix of things, actually. It's actually six events. We've thrown so many numbers at you
it's hard to keep track, but it's a mix of things. I'll give you a specific. One of which is the
Amtrak loss that happened between New York and Philadelphia. And one of the things
that we've seen is the cap that was applied has been increased. So, we're adjusting our
reserve based on the fact that there's a retroactive increase in the liability cap associated
with that event. So we can't be that specific on this sort of stuff. Other stuff is more
difficult to assess, but we're making an assessment that is materially more volatile than
what the market is assuming.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Got it. Okay. And then the other aspect, I think going through the list, most of them, if not
all of them, were non-property. I think there's a number of casualties mentioned assurity.
Does that suggest any – I guess, I think what's surprising to people, right, is we're kind of
used to you guys always having the small events be releasing down the road. But those
are all properties, there's something that suggest casualties is a little bit harder – as you
go into it casualty we might see more of this sort of – the volatility might go both
directions as opposed to usually going just one direction, because casualty is different
than property reserving?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I wouldn't read into it being more volatile. Certainly, that not my expectation. I think, some
of these losses have a property component to it. So there's a property element, but we
think there's liability associated with either the companies involved. An example of a
combined event like that could be something like people are going to (01:02:10). It's not
of one of the ones we're talking about today.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Okay.

FINAL

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
But, in general, we're writing an excess casualty book. I think excess casualty, in particular,
is exposed to large events and some volatility. I think the real question then comes back
to how one reserves for it. We have more of that cat mentality. We think of it as an event.
For many others, say, I've got an expected loss ratio against this book, and what I'm
seeing as – even though it might be a shock loss, it's contained within the normal
reserves. So, it could be simply just a fundamental difference in the way people think
about the same losses. None of these losses we're the only one exposed to.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

No. Of course, because I was just wondering if there was something where – I mean, I
think you mentioned most of this is ACR. If I think of, say, a tornado event, or a hail event,
or whatever, you guys are actually pretty – have such robust data that you kind of, I think,
probably know what the right ACR should be before the cedent does, right? And I just
didn't know if it's just a little harder to get that right, and that – maybe what I'm trying to
ask you is – it feels like maybe I'm interpreting this wrong, but that these increases sort of
surprised you, right, that whatever you thought the initial exposure was turned out to be
more. And we're on prop, I guess, it seems you guys seemed to have an information
edge on most and not get caught off-guard. Is that fair, or am I interpreting what you're
saying, wrong?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
It's an interesting way to think about it. What we – let me explain what we do on property.
In property, we do a top-down, bottom-up analysis. Top-down, we take a very -- we take a
view on the industry, we run data, and then take a view on individual accounts based on
market share and some other non-specific elements. Then we look at the individual
account and run it from the bottom up and determine what that loss is, and then we can
factor it to the right number using those inputs.
Within casualty, I think, the loss is different, where over time, you learn more. And the loss
can spread among seasons, and it can spread to new lines. So, we can go from a
property loss to a D&O loss and kind of across different categories. So, I think, there are
differences in the way we think about it. We can't bring a market share approach to it, so
we do take a more traditional actuarial view, which I think is a healthy way to think about it.
And then, we take more of an event view, which is more unique to us and probably, again,
an extension of our cat roots. So, I don't think, I would point to it as being more volatile.
But I think, I would point to it is as, us just having a different process and how to think
about it.
If we go back – like we put up an event loss for LIBOR, again, we're certainly not the only
one exposed to LIBOR, but I would imagine that others are looking to see how that
develops over time and determining whether it's in attrition. We looked at it and said, we

think, this is more of an event, we'll put it up, and over time, hopefully, come to the same
place.

FINAL

Got it. Got it, makes sense. I'll cut it off there, because I know we're running long. So,
thank you.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
That's okay. Thank you.

Operator
There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr.
O'Donnell.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Thank you, everybody. I know, there's a lot of moving pieces this quarter. We tried to give
you as much transparency as we can, and we hope that it was helpful. Thanks again for
tuning in, and looking forward to talking to you next quarter. Bye.
