MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call of Everest
Re Group Limited. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening
remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice
President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Elizabeth B. Farrell

{BIO 1986541 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Everest Re Group's second quarter earnings
conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company's President
and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, the
President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, the President of our
North America Insurance Operation.
Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include
extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note
that statements made during today's call which are forward-looking in nature, such as
statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the likes are subject to various
risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or

expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in
connection with such statements.
Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.

FINAL

Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Thanks, Beth. Good morning. We're pleased to report this morning another favorable
quarter, particularly during a period where there has been a number of global cat events
for the industry. Despite these events, we posted $3.67 of net income per share for the
quarter. On an operating income basis, earnings were $3.17 per share compared to $5.03
for last year's second quarter.
This difference is primarily due to cat losses with a net impact of $105 million after
reinstatement premiums and taxes. Also impacting the quarter were foreign exchange
losses of $27 million or $0.44 per share after tax. Excluding cats, the underlying attritional
combined ratio is virtually the same at 86% in this year's second quarter versus last.

Bloomberg Transcript

Furthermore, the attritional loss ratio has actually improved year-over-year. This highlights
the changes to business and product mix that have been achieved. You will hear later
from the business leaders describing some of those changes, but it is worth emphasizing,
as we have in the past, that the flexibility and nimbleness of our business model continues
to yield good outcomes.
Of course, offsetting the decreased loss ratio is an increased expense ratio, as we invest
in our insurance build-out. As I mentioned in the first quarter, this will moderate through
time, thereby allowing the improved loss ratio to work its way into the overall combined
ratio.
This moderation is already occurring as you note the decrease in the expense ratio from
the first quarter to the second quarter. Notable, however, is that the total expense ratio
for the insurance segment, coming in at 28.3% for the quarter, remains several points
lower than our competitors. And we intend to maintain this advantage as we expand the
operation. That expansion is well underway.
Growth in the insurance book is beginning to take hold as gross premiums increased by
32% in the quarter. On the other hand, somewhat offsetting this is the decline in the
reinsurance segment. Rate levels and foreign exchange continue to affect this sector.
Nevertheless, as John Doucette will later detail, we continue to move our capacity to the
better risk-adjusted business and new product areas, particularly credit-related. I am
always encouraged by our ability to remain bottom-line focused.
Another item of interest in the quarter was the recovery of investment income in the
lower than expected first quarter due to improvements in our limited partnership
investments.

FINAL

On a year-to-date basis, we are still slightly off of last year but given the continued
interest rate levels, this is completely within our expectation. The impact of lower rates will
diminish over time as older maturities come in.
While overall returns on capital continued to face pressure, we remained as one of the
top performing companies in the industry. In an environment where the so-called risk-free
rate is low-single-digits, our returns are quite strong with a 9.4% ROE and growth in book
value per share of 7% in the first six months.
Our book value per share growth also benefited slightly from our continued share
repurchases during the quarter. However, this was less than anticipated due to a pause in
buying when cat events began to emerge during the quarter. This was not a concern over
the amount, but just the fact that we had knowledge of events affecting the quarter.
Finally, I would like to address our other announcement regarding our crop insurance
business. As you may have seen, we have received the letter of intent for the purchase of
Heartland, our crop MFA from CGB Diversified Services.

Bloomberg Transcript

This transaction creates an opportunity for us to more quickly expand and diversify our
exposure to this business on a more efficient basis. In the short-term, there will be no
appreciable premium impact. However, it will now be recorded as reinsurance rather than
insurance.
In addition, we will see an expected improvement in margin due to the benefit of a lower
expense structure. Buyers' scale creates a more efficient deal for us and given their
growing presence in the market, we should continue to benefit as a result of our strategic
alliance.
In summary, we believe there're many great initiatives underway at Everest. Yes, there're
many challenges, but we continue to work through many of them successfully. My
colleagues will next (06:18) some further details on the progress we are making. I look
forward to your questions after that.
Thank you and now with Craig for the financial details.

Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Thank you, Dom, and good morning, everyone. Everest had a solid quarter of earnings
with net income of $156 million. This compares the net income of $209 million for the
second quarter of 2015. Net income includes realized capital gains and losses. On year-todate basis, net income was $327 million compared to $532 million for the first half of 2015.
The primary differences were catastrophe losses and foreign exchange.
After tax operating income for the second quarter was $134 million compared to $225
million in 2015. Operating income year-to-date was $357 million compared to $554 million
for the first six months of 2015. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $234
Page 3 of 24



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2016-07-26

million for the first half compared to an underwriting gain of $307 million in the same
period last year.

FINAL

In the second quarter of 2016, the group sold $149 million of current year catastrophe
losses net of reinsurance. Of that total, $90 million is related to losses from the Canadian
wildfires, $36 million related to Texas hailstorms, and $23 million related to the
earthquake in Ecuador.
The 2016 cat losses were partially offset by $25 million of favorable development on
prior-year cat losses primarily from the 2011 Japan earthquake. The net impact of these
losses after reinstatement premiums and taxes was $105 million. This compares with $23
million of catastrophes during the same period in 2015.
The overall current year attritional combined ratio for the first six months was 85.7%, up
from 84.5% for the first half of 2015. This is primarily due to the one point increase in the
expense ratio. Our year-to-date expense ratio rose to 5.7% as we anticipated with the
build-out of the insurance platform and our Lloyd's Syndicate, but it was below first
quarter 2016 expense ratio of 5.9%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Foreign exchange is reported in other income. For the first half of 2016, foreign exchange
losses were $31 million compared to $44 million of foreign exchange gains in the first six
months of 2015. Both of these results are unusual and represent a $75 million pre-tax
swing year-over-year. The 2016 foreign exchange losses primarily reflect the weakening
of the British pound during 2016 related to the Brexit vote.
The foreign exchange impact is effectively an accounting mismatch, since it's offset in
shareholders' equity for translation adjustments and unrealized gains due to the positive
impact of holding foreign investments that are available for sale.
Overall, we maintain an economic neutral position with respect to foreign exchange
matching assets with liabilities in most major world currencies. Other income also included
$3 million of earnings and fees from Mt. Logan Re in the first six months of 2016
compared to $7 million of income in the first half of last year. That decline essentially
represents the impact of catastrophe losses during the first half of 2016.
On income taxes, the 11.9% year-to-date effective tax rate on operating income was lower
than the 13.9% tax rate at this time last year. This was primarily due to the foreign
exchange losses and the higher level of catastrophe losses in 2016.
Stable cash flow continues, with operating cash flows of $674 million for the first half of
2016 compared to $532 million in 2015 which, in part, is reflective of our strong reserve
position compared to actual paid losses.
As for loss reserves, last week we released our sixth annual global loss development
triangles for 2015. There were no major changes since the 2014 release. Our overall
quarterly internal reserving metrics continue to be favorable.

FINAL

Shareholders' equity for the group was $8 billion at the end of the second quarter, up
$377 million or 5% over year-end 2015. This is after taking into account capital return for
$186 million of share buybacks and the $97 million of dividends paid in the first half of
2016, which combined, represent a return of 87% of net income. Our strong capital
position leaves us with capacity to maximize our business opportunities, as well as
continued share repurchases. Thank you.
And now, John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.

John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Thank you, Craig. Good morning. Despite a very active quarter for the industry with
property catastrophe losses around the world, our reinsurance book performed well with
$97 million of underwriting profit. This outcome highlights both strong underwriting by our
experienced underwriting teams and the benefit of a mature, well-diversified book of
business. We maintain a highly diversified portfolio by line and geography around the
globe, which allows underwriting profits in one part of our book to offset losses that might
arise in another part of the book.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our sub-90% combined ratio for reinsurance for the quarter demonstrates the value and
robustness of this strategy despite all the cat events. For our total reinsurance segment,
net premiums were $771 million, down 8%. On a constant currency basis, they are down
approximately 6% as we carefully manage our net reinsurance book with hedges, higher
attachment points and reduced exposures on deal with less attractive risk-adjusted
returns.
Our reinsurance underwriting profit was $80 million lower than the underwriting profit in
Q2 2015. The difference driven predominantly by the $85 million in cat loss in this quarter
in the reinsurance segment compared to $27 million of cat losses in Q2 last year.
Underwriting profits were also impacted by lower net earned premium and exchange rate
fluctuation. Drivers of lower net premium this quarter were non-renewables and
reductions on some property pro rata treaties, which did not meet our risk adjusted return
requirements. The attritional loss ratio this quarter is 53%; two points below Q2 last year
and in line with Q1 as well as the full year of 2015.
Business mix and deployment and capacity in profitable areas such as mortgage and
credit, helped us maintain strong loss ratios despite tough reinsurance market conditions.
The Q2 attritional combined ratio of 82.1% is up slightly from the 2015 full year 81.8%, but
down one point when compared to Q2 2015.
The improvement was largely driven by a four point year-over-year improvement in U.S.
reinsurance which had been impacted by higher level of attritional losses for weather and
large risk events last year.
The International segment also improved with lower commissions in the quarter. The
Bermuda segment though experienced a higher attritional combined ratio, primarily due
to commissions and changes in business mix.

FINAL

Now some color on our June 1 and July 1 reinsurance renewals, which reflect
approximately 10% and 15% respectively of our full-year reinsurance premium. June 1
renewals are mainly quartile (15:54). Changes in programs varied, but the renewal process
was orderly. Some of the largest programs shrank, as we expected and we reallocated
capacity to larger and new layers per preferred client. Rates were up by low-single digits.
The Florida renewal market felt like it had found the floor with more treaties not fully
placed and more shortfall covers coming to Everest. We are pleased with the overall
results of our June 1 renewal. And with the reunderwriting of some underperforming
treaties, we head into the wind season with somewhat reduced net PML for southeast
wind compared to last wind season. At July 1, the U.S. property market also felt as though
it had bottomed out and the rates were closer to flat. This provides a good start to the
upcoming 1/1 renewal discussions.

Bloomberg Transcript

Outside the U.S., the July 1 market conditions for short tail were less rosy and still very
competitive in Europe and Latin America. However, Asia and Australia renewals were
better, as we found more attractive places to deploy our capacity. In Canada, the Fort
McMurray wildfire loss is the largest insured loss in Canadian history and reinsurance rates
were up substantially. We seized the opportunity to deploy more capacity at higher
pricing, particularly with the demand for backup covers in this region. The other loss
affected areas around the globe also had increased rates at July 1.
The market for 7/1 casualty business also felt as though it was finding a floor with several
programs renewing as expiring, more resistance by reinsurers to broaden terms and
conditions. And some high profile treaties with low take-up were either pulled from the
market or repriced with more favorable terms.
Anecdotally, we have heard some broker conversation is now shifting to managing client
expectations on renewal pricing, terms and conditions. We continue to find pockets of
attractive long-tail reinsurance, including auto liability business. And we also continue to
provide meaningful capacity in the mortgage space where there remains a robust
pipeline of attractive business.
In recent months, we continue to add strong talent to our reinsurance underwriting bench.
In Europe, U.S., Latin America, Singapore, Canada and Bermuda, as well as further
expanding our footprint into one-off structured risk solution. These deals are complex,
difficult to source and require a broad set of underwriting, accounting, actuarial, legal, tax,
contract, awarding and structuring capabilities to execute them successfully. These
opportunities are diversifying and much more shielded from the broader market
pressures and therefore provide meaningful margins and strong risk adjusted returns
adding to Everest bottom line.
We are also seeing several reinsurance opportunities driven by macro issues including
capital and solvency requirements created by the market turmoil including Brexit, Solvency
II, Dodd-Frank and related regulatory changes around the globe; profit and expense
pressures at large clients who are now motivated to buy more reinsurance; Florida and
other clients looking to expand geographically and the additional reinsurance capacity to

FINAL

support their growth; and some global clients are buying down retentions for individual
risks or territories. Even in the midst of a tough market, these and other demand drivers
provide accretive opportunities for Everest to capture as the leading global reinsurer.
In Mt. Logan, we increased the number of investors, opened new fund and raised
additional capital from existing investors. Overall, AUM is about flat compared to last
quarter given some redemptions. We expect long-term growth and interest by investors
to continue given the unique Logan Everest value proposition which has resulted in bestin-class returns every year since Logan's launch.
As we have reached Logan's third anniversary, new types of investors, which we have
been engaging with for some time, opened up to potentially invest in the platform.
Through Logan, and additionally Kilimanjaro cap-ons, traditional reinsurance and ILWs, we
continue to optimize our net book which remains well within our long-standing group risk
appetite.
We are pleased with the outcome of both our quarters' underwriting results in the phase
of several cat losses and large risk losses and the outcome of our June and July renewals
despite the current market conditions. And we are well-poised for a solid finish in the back
half of 2016.
Thank you. And now, I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operation.

Jonathan M. Zaffino

{BIO 16652236 <GO>}

Thanks, John and good morning. Everest Insurance continued its expansion in the second
quarter as we've made steady progress on our core strategic initiatives. We experienced
another quarter of solid growth across our global operation, marking the sixth consecutive
quarter of underlying growth with contributions from each insurance business unit.
Echoing earlier commentary, our North American division results, our largest insurance
division were impacted by cat activity within the quarter. Despite this, our underlying
attritional performance was solid and in line with our expectations. As announced
yesterday and discussed on this call given the sale of Heartland, I will share 2016 numbers
with you excluding this operation. All results including Heartland are outlined in the
financial supplement release yesterday.
Our global insurance operations inclusive of the North American division and Lloyd's,
gross written premium increased 23% quarter-over-quarter to $405 million, while net
written premiums grew to $343 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter.
Looking at the first half, again, excluding Heartland, we produced gross written premium
of $764 million, an increase of 17%; and net written premium of $652 million, an increase of
12%.
As mentioned in previous call, net written premium growth slightly lags gross written
premium growth primarily due to a marginally more conservative reinsurance strategy in
our U.S. operations as we add new businesses. The insurance segment GAAP combined

Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2016-07-26

ratio for the quarter ex-Heartland was 109 impacted by 13 points of cat activity or $38
million. This was attributable to exposure with our U.S. and Canadian property portfolios
from the Texas tail events in April in the Fort McMurray wildfire.

FINAL

On an attritional basis, the calendar year combined for the quarter improved to 95.7%,
while the attritional loss and loss expense ratio for the quarter improved 130 basis points
over the comparable prior year period to 66.9%.
I'll now turn to the performance of our major insurance segments, provide an update on
market conditions and also briefly comment on the strategic expansion of the Everest
Insurance platform. Although the quarter was impacted by cat activity in the U.S. and
Canada, we remain very encouraged regarding our progress in the buildout of our global
insurance operation, a result of the underlying portfolio and the opportunities ahead.
Within our P&C operations, both our U.S. and Canadian units demonstrated solid growth in
the quarter. Gross written premium was up nearly 18% in the U.S. and up 22% in Canada.
Further our Lloyds Insurance operation contributed nearly $11 million in gross written
premium in the quarter to this segment which we expect to accelerate in the months
ahead. Nearly, every underwriting unit contributed to these results. Although similar to the
first quarter, the growth varied across units in line with the business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Of note in the second quarter, we were pleased to see a meaningful contribution of 5%
of premiums from our various new North American underwriting units launched principally
over the past six months. Again, it is early in the growth base for these businesses and
we've remained optimistic about their trajectory.
Our A&H group experienced another strong quarter of growth, registering a nearly 42%
increase quarter-over-quarter. Our efforts to enhance our platform via expanded product
and distribution capabilities are proving successful and opportunities in certain Medical
Stop Loss markets headlined this quarter's growth.
Turning to the rate picture, the second quarter evidenced many of the same dynamics
and challenges as those in the first quarter. While we did experience marginally more rate
pressure in the second quarter, actual results were mixed by line of business. As noted
earlier, our attritional loss ratio continues to improve despite this pressure due to changes
in our mix of business and various underwriting actions taken on select portfolios and the
achievement of positive rate in various areas mainly commercial auto.
Further, we continue to believe that for the majority of lines, we are operating within a
relatively tight range, plus the magnitude of rate volatility is limited. In the U.S., the
property market overall continues to see low double-digit rate decreases on average.
However, there are signs of moderation as the market seeks a bottom. Clearly, pressure
from recent cat activity in the quarter is having an impact, but it's too soon to quantify this.
Additionally, we are also noticing some select tightening in terms, particularly in states
prone to convective storm activity. Third-party casualty lines are mixed with slight pressure
or even flattening for both general liability and excess casualty line, once again offset by
Page 8 of 24

FINAL

positive rate movement in commercial auto. As in the prior quarter, management of
professional lines continued to experience mid-single-digit decreases overall. There
remains more intense pressure on excess layers with the rate reductions moderating on
the primary.
The work comp market also experienced moderately more pressure in the second
quarter with low to mid-single-digit decreases being common. The remaining pockets of
opportunity across classes, segments and geographies, although we continue to note
new and expanded competition in this market, and we'll watch this closely in the month
ahead. And within the A&H market, the Medical Stop Loss segment remains competitive
other than for accounts with challenged and loss experience.
Turning to Canada, the liability market mimics that of the U.S., slight rate adjustments are
noted, yet remained essentially flat year-over-year. The property market likewise remains
relatively flat. Coast of Fort McMurray loss, there had been some pockets of increased
rate adjustments within various territories and class of the business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Although early, we are not seeing any wholesale forming across lines, we will keep a close
eye on the market to see the tone changes as we near the 1/1 reinsurance renewals. So
again, a mixed market landscape depending on the many factors influencing the various
lines of business. That stated, due to our increased product depth across geographies,
we are able to seize profitable growth opportunities despite challenging market
conditions.
Final plot regarding the strategic expansion of our global insurance operations. We
continue to capitalize on the dislocation within the commercial market to build out our
global specialty insurance capabilities with the new and enhanced products, additional
leadership and underwriting debt and expanded geographic reach. Each of our
operations are making excellent progress on their 2016 goals, and we anticipate
increased momentum from actions executed over the past year.
With that, let me turn it back over to Beth for Q&A.

Please go ahead.

FINAL

Thanks so much. Maybe to start a bit on the insurance book and the growth there; clearly,
a very nice growth. Are the dynamics in the markets that you're growing in, is there a
shortage of capital that is allowing for you to pursue growth and continue to see
profitability improve or what other dynamics are at play just because I haven't seen a lot
of growth in insurance from some of our other companies so far? So I'm just wanting to
get an understanding of the dynamics there. Thanks.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Michael, I don't think it's a case of capital. We all know that this industry is awash in capital. I
think it's really taking the opportunity to – there's certain markets in particular (30:12).
Companies are changing and the marketplace is always in flux, and I think brokers are in
particular always looking for highly rated carriers to come into the space to either replace
markets that are reshaping their own portfolios or their distribution for one reason or
another or changes in their own teams. In addition, perhaps upgrading some of the credit
quality of markets that they offer to their customers. So, it's not about capital, it's more
about taking advantage of opportunities from what I would describe as dislocation and
the offering that we can make to brokers of top quality paper.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. Okay. So these are opportunities that you're not winning on price. Specifically,
you're able to come into the market to help fill the gap based on the profile of
reinsurance counterparties, your – the brokers are the insured ones. Is that (31:21)?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Good, good. I thought, what I was answering was an insurance question, I thought that's
what you were referencing, correct?

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Yeah. You're insured. So, either brokers that you're placing – you said that brokers like
your rating and profile. And so, I would think that either the brokers wants you there, and
that's part of the reason why you can write the business at attractive profitability or the
insured themselves want you there? Was that...

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

What I was specifically addressing, that was the insurance segment, not the reinsurance
segment, although some of the same qualities are there as well. And also, remember
that on the insurance side, we've hired some notable talent in the industry, and with that
comes relationships and business flows that way as well.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. I mean, I was saying, insured, not insurance. But okay, that's fair. And then, I guess is
it possible to give us a little bit more color on the impact of the sale of the Crop business?
How much premium should come out of the insurance segment? How much should we
expect to come into one of the reinsurance segment, I guess, in U.S. reinsurance? Just

Page 10 of 24

any context on – and was there a dollar amount for the sale or was it all kind of part and
parcel of an exchange of the franchise for a reinsurance agreement on the back of that?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Well, we're not at this point, since it's just really a letter of intent, we're not
disclosing...

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

... (33:06) transaction. But I can tell you that there will be no material impact of gain or loss
from the sale of the company. As I mentioned in my comments, that the premium impact
at least in the short-term for the group will be minimal. It would be about the same, in
other words. So, right now, we have approximately $200 million of premium in insurance
base, that will transition forward to and can be reflected in the reinsurance segment.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, it'll be about the same, at least in the short-term. And then, of course, going forward,
our participation with the buyer on reinsurance arrangements could – and their expansion
could make that the reinsurance premium go up over time. But with other (34:00)
significant premium change to the group, it's just basically shifting it from one segment to
the other as of what we think has improved profitability.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. Okay. Great. Thanks, Dom. And then just on the prior year development of
attritional cat, I just wanted to understand, was there a reason that number, the 2011
development didn't go into a prior year category and why it ended up in – anyhow, it was
just accounting, but why that ended up in the current accident quarter attritional cat load?

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Mike, this is Craig. We show cats on one line. That's the only reason we don't breakout
prior year cats and current year cats. That's the only significant. That's the reason we
broke it out in our discussion topic for the call.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

(34:50)

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

(34:52) originally. So, it flows through the same line item, if you will, on the second quarter.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. Okay. So, in the past, when you've had reinsurance prior development, that's been
casualty development or underlying loss ratio development but not catastrophe

development. Is that the difference?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

FINAL

That is correct.

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

That is correct.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thanks so much.

Operator
Our next question is from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. I think there was a fair amount of concern going into the second quarter
around the catastrophe loss exposure especially in Canada. When you think about the
end result of roughly 10 points of earned premium and still generating around a 9% return
on equity on an operating basis in the first half. How does that check out relative to what
you would have thought of a catastrophe of these magnitudes in the quarter?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

How does that translate into earnings?

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

No. I mean is it – would you expect it to be this size or when you go to your risk
management process, would you expect it to be a bigger impact or maybe that's just kind
of jumping off point where you can talk about the risk management framework?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, I think this loss and how it impacted our results was kind of what we would have
expected. We always speak to kind of writing business with the best risk adjusted return.
So, as an example, in Canada, we tended not to write reinsurance bill to the (36:36)
heavy personal lines exposure. So, that obviously had some benefit to it. In addition, at
least for last renewal season, we tended to be in higher attaching layers. So the lower
layers where – did not meet our risk adjusted return characteristics.
So, yes, it kind of translated into what we would have expected and not – given our
presence in Canada, we did not experience any kind of an outside loss generally because
we're directing our underwriting to those areas that we feel give us the best return. I
don't know if that's frankly what you're asking about.

FINAL

It is, yes. That's helpful. Thank you. My next question was on the International Reinsurance
segment, the 14% premium growth in the second quarter. Can you give us some insight in
terms of what was driving that and whether we should anticipate growth at that level
going forward?

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

I think that was adjustments due to some large transactions (37:49)?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Right. So, this is 2016, here it's more consistent with what you would expect to see going
forward. There were accounting adjustments made in 2015 which is closing that
comparison.

Q - Jay Gelb

Okay. So, just to clarify that 14% growth is normalized for international?

A - Jonathan M. Zaffino

Hi, Jay, it's John. I think the way to think about it is, look at the entire six months of last
year and compare it with the entire six months of this year. And that is a more appropriate
comparison because it was basically kind of when we talked about it on the last quarter
and it kind of washes over the first six months of the year.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Okay. So, normalized down high-single digits, gross?

Thanks very much guys. Just a quick numbers-related question. Dom, I think you had
mentioned $27 million in FX losses. I just wanted to ask about Mt. Logan. Is the remainder
of the other income expense bucket, the $28.4 million, is that all just a small loss from Mt.
Logan basically?

FINAL

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

No. Mt. Logan actually had $3 million of income year-to-date for – the number $27 million,
by the way, was after tax. Right?

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

No.

A - Dominic James Addesso

Pre-tax (39:29).

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

But – okay. I'm sorry.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

My apologies. So, the $28.4 million is a $3 million gain from Mt. Logan and then like a $31
million pre-tax loss in FX, is that about right?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

$3 million of gain was for the year, Quentin.

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

Oh, for the year. I apologize. Okay. Well, just for the quarter – okay. I think the rest of the
numbers are actually on 1Q, so I can break it out that way. Okay. Thanks.
Secondly, just, John, thanks very much for – sorry, I was just talking about the cat-related
losses in the quarter, just wanted to sort of understand a little bit more. It sounds like you
are saying they came from Canada and then from the Texas hailstorms, but the $38
million is a lot higher than we've ever seen out of that portfolio. Can you just talk to us
about sort of why there might have been elevated property losses in the cat line this
quarter? Should we expect to sort of a higher cat load in the insurance segment going
forward?

Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td

Yeah. Quentin, I don't think it's really out of line from our perspective. You remember,
we've been steadily growing our E&S Property Book over the last several years. It's been
incredibly profitable for us. We do manage all of our accumulations at the group level. So,
in relation to a number of different benchmarks we looked at, first and foremost, group
accumulation of our cat model. But secondly, also, our representative market share, and
any given market. The nature of the underlying event, both obviously to extreme events
here with Fort McMurray and the Texas hail. So, the number might seem bigger than
you've seen in the past. But in relation to the depth of these books of business we think
it's very much in line.

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

Okay. So, if I could just say that slightly different way is, sometimes the wind doesn't blow
your way, this might have just been a little bit of an outsized quarter correct?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

I think that's fair.

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. And then just last question, Dom, you had mentioned in the first quarter the 11%
growth rate in the insurance segment was a little bit below what we should expect for the
full year, but the 20% you had previously mentioned may be not quite in that level. Given
the strong growth in the second quarter, is it safe to assume that you guys are targeting
more of a 20%-plus-type growth rate or still sort of no real change?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Our growth rate in the insurance sector will certainly be in the high teens. I don't know if
we'd readily admit to over 20%. But again, that's going to be based on what the market
opportunity presents to us. If pricing continues deteriorating to any great degree, then
perhaps we pull back in certain areas. But we've got a number of new initiatives that we're
just getting off the ground. So, I think the growth rate should be solid teens.

FINAL

Amit, we did not – we really don't go around really that way. That certainly can be one
methodology. But we obviously had people on the ground assessing what was going on
there as well as report from our clients. And it's a little difficult with this type of event, that
the models (43:21) aren't necessarily built for wildfires. So, basing an estimate off of an
industry loss is in our view very difficult and frankly not really appropriate. You can use that
as a benchmark. But at the end of the day, it really is about being on – within the site as
well as talking frequently to our clients and getting reports in from our clients.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Got it. That's a fair comment. And was Mt. Logan impacted by these cats?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

A little bit. Yeah, sure.

Q - Amit Kumar

And the reception, I know that you're talking about the reception from investors. Did that
change? Because as you mentioned this is not a modeled peril.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, not to my knowledge. We have not heard any negative feedback from investors
about these kind of events.

A - John P. Doucette

Hi, Amit. This is John.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Okay.

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

I think, we communicate a lot with them on a regular basis (44:29) and talks about the
types of losses and exposures that they have. And the Logan investors get access to a
global portfolio and frankly expect to get losses all over the world, not just from hurricane,
not just from earthquake.
And but again, from given the returns that Logan had seen, Logan investors have seen,
it's really our best in class. I think it just highlights the strength of the diversification and the
value of the mouse trap – the value proposition of the mouse trap that we built between
Logan and Everest. And I think that the investors, there was nothing out of line for the
investors tied to the Canadian wildfires.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

That's very helpful. And just moving on to capital management, I know you talked about I
think buybacks were blacked out for maybe a period. How many days were you sort of
Page 16 of 24



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2016-07-26

blacked out? Because I'm looking at the buyback number, it's higher than Q1. And just
trying to reconcile that and asking myself, is dilution still attractive to ramp the buyback
during the wind season or should we think differently about that?

FINAL

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, first of all, it's not technically a blackout period. What I mentioned was that because
we possessed material non-public information about cat events and the fact that those
reports of what those losses might be were streaming in. It became frankly a little difficult
for us to be in the market. Not because of the size of the events, but more because we
were in the possession of material non-public information. But I don't know if that would
technically be called a black out period.
As Craig pointed out earlier, we returned almost 90% between dividends and share
repurchases, 90% of income. So, frankly, that's not out of line with what we've said we
would do in the past. So...

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Got it. That's helpful. And then just finally wrapping up, I know there was this question on
Heartland, and I appreciate it's difficult to share all the mechanics, I'm curious what led to
the decision, was it a function of scale or was it A&O payments? What prompted it and
was it sort of chopped around (47:05)? Maybe just some background on that would be
very helpful, because we've seen other companies also do these kind of things. I'm just
curious as the background. Thank you.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

As we've said in response to questions about our crop operation for a long time that
we're always looking at strategic options. Those strategic options, in the earlier days, a
month ago were more about how we could build scale and how we could diversify
because those were the two things that we needed to do to be successful as a primary
MPCI rider.
And folks at Heartland, put – certainly they put towards (47:49) a great effort. But given
the market dynamics, it was very, very difficult to, as we found out, to grow it organically
and to diversify it. And when we were presented this opportunity, this option from (48:10),
it was something that, as we looked at it, we said, well, this would be a way, given their
scale, they're already there in the space and we can immediately get the diversification,
the scale that we need. And that's what led to the decision to move in this direction. But it
was always with an eye towards wanting to grow it and diversify it and recognizing that it
needed to be a scale business.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.

FINAL

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. I was just hoping to talk a little bit more about the insurance books,
although it's pointed to about (48:59) a 96% kind of attritional combined ratio ex the crop
business. Is that the right kind of margin to assume on that book kind of on a go-forward
basis? And then just tying into that, in terms of your just expense ratio, you did mention
that it came down a bit sequentially, is that something we should expect to continue to
see as we go forward through the rest of this year?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

So, the 96% I would expect overall to frankly improve a little bit more from there as we
grow the Lloyd's operation. The Lloyd's premium has been slow to book it's because of
the accounting that takes places in our Lloyd's operation. And frankly, if you look at the
attritional without Lloyd's, it's more like a 95%. So, as Lloyd's begins to prove its
economics, which it will do through the balance of the year, that attritional combined ratio
we would expect to move even lower.

Bloomberg Transcript

The improving expense ratio, as I've said in the last quarter, I would expect that to
continue to moderate over time. But compared to historical levels, it will probably still be
above those for certainly probably the next 12 months, at least, but trending downward
towards a more normalized level.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then in the reinsurance commentary, you guys mentioned some one-offs
structured (50:28) solutions. Is there kind of a way to quantify kind of the impact of that on
the top-line? Was that a Q2 comment, or was that more about, when you guys were
looking forward towards the rest of this year?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

That's really – those kinds of transactions generally are pretty lumpy. And so, no, there
really isn't any way to quantify that frankly on the top-line basis. And I think to the value in
mentioning that was more of a strategic choice and direction that we're taking relative to
our bottom-line focus. These are transactions that require a lot of time. And so there
really isn't any smoothness to the premium that we can outline for you.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And then last on, just the capital management. You guys – last year at
the Q3 was actually when you were the most active in terms of capital return. Is there any
thought process behind slowing down repurchases surrounding hurricane season, or is it
kind of a similar philosophy the last year where just depending upon opportunity?

Page 18 of 24

what's your outlook there going forward?

FINAL

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, I do think that it does appear in that certain sector that we are kind of hitting a
bottom. I'm not though, here predicting that next quarter or the quarter after that we'll
see some uptick. Perhaps, we'll be at this bottom point for a while. But I do think that at
these levels, there really isn't any room to go lower if you want to maintain any semblance
of adequate returns on your capital.
So – and I think those are the pressures that we all face and you do – you are seeing some
discipline in the marketplace for now. But I'm not – I'm certainly not predicting any major
uptick at this point. So, there's still opportunities. You are seeing some areas that are
showing rate increase in the loss effected regions. So, those will be the opportunities to
think about going forward.

Thank you and good morning. The first question is a follow-up on the Heartland deal. I just
wondered from the experience for the last few years buying a business (54:26), does that
change your appetite, how do you think about the acquisitions?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, Kai, as you know, we have not been that acquisitive. So, I'm not – it doesn't
necessarily change my appetite. You always have to be very mindful of any kind of
acquisition, what it's going to do to the business, is it strategic, what are the integration
concerns, et cetera.
In this particular case, the acquisition was done because it was around a skill set that we
didn't have. The marketplace was changing. But then it changed again on us and we were
really unable to really get the scale and the diversification we needed. But no, it doesn't
necessarily change our appetite for looking at transactions that are – that can be
strategically important to us. But having said that, we are not a very acquisitive company.

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. That's fair. I was just curious because this is a rare deal you've done in the past few
years. It didn't turn out as well as you had hoped for. Then for – if the (55:49) business,
$200 million transfer from the insurance to reinsurance. You mentioned better combined
ratio, the insurance segment I think in the past, you were targeting 95%. If you look at the
reinsurance, they're running at the low 80%s. Is that a magnitude of difference in term of
profitability?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

No. I mean, the crop business doesn't run to the low 80%s on an expected basis. It's
probably more high 80%s, low 90%s kind of business.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. And then the – on the foreign exchange losses, I just want to make sure this is like
mark-to-market, so basically if the exchange rate stays the same, you will not see big
movement in the third quarter?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

That's correct. It's quarter-to-quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Great. And lastly, it's just philosophically, if you look at insurance segment,
you're growing pretty fast. What – is there any risk you worry about growing that business
that fast? What could be the downside there? Because if you look at the history of the
insurance operation, the probability of it has been like near breakeven and what gives
confidence by growing at, like, high teens and at the same time you can have – actually
you can improve on the combined ratio you're already having right now.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well. The insurance model today is much different that it was about 10 years ago, all right?
Which was mostly a program-oriented model. So, that's number one.
Number two, I think we've offered or added an awful lot of great talent to the
organization that's focused on the underwriting of business. So, it's risk-by-risk, if we think
gives us potential for better outcome as well as, kind of, a reengineering if you will of our
program business.
So those two things, we think we'll help dramatically. In addition, keep in mind, that we're
not growing at this kind of percentage in one line of business and one territory. It is a very
diversified play across a wide distribution network. And so, it's that I think will also ensure
that we have good outcome.

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

The challenge with Canada was that the number was moving around quite a bit. And we
did have a number early on. And in fact as we got more and more information, that
number frankly got a little better, but it kept changing. And we did not have – because of
the question I was asked earlier, we didn't think it was appropriate. We weren't getting a
right answer by using kind of an industry loss estimate times market share, given how we
participated in that particular event with those particular clients.
It wasn't a simple matter of taking an industry loss estimate and a market share. We had
to have reports from clients as well as on the ground investigation. We didn't know that
frankly until relatively late in the game, probably two weeks ago of course (01:01:20) that
we were comfortable with the number.
In the meantime, as we have said in the past, we generally look at is an event or a series
of events going to be within our expected cat load, and we, kind of, thought that this was
probably going to come in at the expected cat load and therefore a release on the event
was not required. That's kind of what we said in the past. Had we felt that this was going
to be materially above our expected cat load, then probably would've had reconsidered
whether to put something out.

of cats for us. So, that's a testament to our numbers. Our insurance initiative, as we've
mentioned is going well and with crop moving to the reinsurance segment. Improved
underlying performance of this book should become more apparent on a go-forward
basis.
On the reinsurance side, we continue to manage through the cycle. And as noted in some
areas, our PMLs are down, pricing does appear to be bottoming and we are wellpositioned to shift when warranted. So again, thank you all and talk to many of you in the
weeks ahead. Thanks again.
