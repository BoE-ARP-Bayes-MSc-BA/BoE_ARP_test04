{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Okay. Good morning everybody. Welcome to Saga's Interim Results for the six-month
period that ended July 16. As you probably have worked out by now I'm Lance Batchelor,
the CEO of Saga. And to my left is Jonathan Hill, the CFO. We're going to do a bit of a
double act and then we'll do a Q&A at the end of our session.
It's amazing how time ﬂies, it's been 2.5 years since we IPO'd, this is our ﬁfth set of results
as a listed company. And for the ﬁfth time, Saga has delivered a really robust set of results.
Proﬁts are up again, and I'm particularly pleased with our strong cash generation, which
has a focus on its customers, in fact we probably know about the needs of the over 50s
than anybody else, but we're always looking for ways to improve and to push our insights
harder, and there is a signiﬁcant opportunity for us to take our knowledge of our
customers a stage further, to make the most of the great brand awareness that we've got
and the customer loyalty that we've got.
And over the last six months or so, we've been doing a signiﬁcant amount of work within
our database of 2.7 million customers to segment it in a more granular way than we have
ever done before. So we now have a much better view of what segments there are within
our database, where we really make our money, exactly who our high-valued customers
are, what journeys they traveled as they became high-value customers, what products and
services they buy from Saga and perhaps most importantly, we've got a better feel for
what a potential high-value customer looks like than we've ever had before. That means
we can focus our marketing spend on attracting the right kind of customer and develop
the right kinds of products for them.

FINAL

So, in the months and the years to come, our deeper understanding of the customer base
is going to allow us to save money on what could have been wasted marketing, to spend
that money on really tightly targeted acquisition of potential high-value customers. Our
product development will be directed at meeting the needs of high-value customers and
potentials. And we'll be looking for ways to say thank you to our loyal customers to meet
more of their needs.
Now, in one sense, all of this is what we've always done. But modern data mining
techniques and marketing tools, like Adobe Analytics and Adobe Target and Adobe
Campaign, allow us to create much smarter and more targeted oﬀers than we've ever
been able to create before.
This is probably the most exciting and the biggest potential project going on at Saga right
now. Yes, we're building a wonderful new ship. And yes, we have an eﬀective motor panel
up and running. And yes, we continue to pilot a home care solution and to develop a
fresh strategy for the money sector looking forward. But getting really close to our highvalue customers is a major opportunity for Saga.
Now, I'm now going to hand over to Jonathan who'll take you through the numbers in
more detail. Thanks.

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

Thanks, Lance, and good morning, everybody. Looking on, it's very pleasing to be able to
report another strong set of results for the ﬁrst half of 2016. We delivered a solid
performance across the group, with PBT on an underlying basis up by 3.9%, excluding
those derivative movements, and up overall by 8.5%. Continued strong cash generation
has allowed us to further deleverage from 2.4 times at this time last year to 2.3 times at
the year-end, and 2.2 times at the half-year point.
Our strengthened solvency position gives us conﬁdence of further deleveraging in line
with our medium-term target. Based on this performance and our future expectation for
the business, we have done what we said we were going to do, and we've increased our
dividend at the interim point by 23% to £0.027.
Now, looking at the group P&L. Revenue from continuing operations did decrease by
8.6% to £437 million, reﬂecting the accounting impact from the introduction of the quota
share arrangement in motor insurance. And I'll cover that in a bit of detail later on in the
presentation.
Excluding this accounting adjustment, revenue would have been up by around 2% on a
comparable basis.
Trading proﬁt was ﬂat in H1 against the comparable period, but this is after the proﬁt
impact of the scheduled maintenance for the Saga Sapphire, which costs us around £5
million in proﬁt in the ﬁrst half of this year. Finance costs fell signiﬁcantly as we better
managed our facilities, as well as some reductions in LIBOR.

FINAL

These lower ﬁnance costs were a key contributor to this 4% underlying PBT growth,
excluding these derivative gains. And then with the beneﬁt of these derivative gains, we
end up at an 8.5% increase in PBT. These fair value gains and derivatives relate to hedges,
where hedging accounting cannot be used, particularly on the forward hedging of the
fuel for our cruise ships. Proﬁt after tax increased by 12.8% with H1 in the prior year
incurring a £3 million loss on discontinued operations.
Our core Insurance and Travel businesses have performed strongly across the ﬁrst half
delivering an underlying trading proﬁt growth of 2%. We have done this despite seeing
variable market conditions across our business. For example, we have beneﬁted from the
hardening of premiums in the motor insurance business, that have been impacted in the
same way as everyone else by the tough market conditions in home insurance. This
performance is proof of the Saga model as we beneﬁt from the wide portfolio of
businesses and our ability to drive proﬁt across the group even with diﬀerential market
conditions.

Bloomberg Transcript

You will notice that the Insurance comparative did change slightly. At the year-end, it was
noticeable that year-on-year expenses have moved materially by segment. And having
reviewed the basis of allocation, we have moved from what was a more revenue-based
allocation to one that's more activity-based, and therefore, going forward, that expense
allocation should be more accurate and should be less volatile between segments. A
breakdown of this movement is included at the back of the interim statement. Clearly, the
overall proﬁt in the Insurance business remains the same. This is just about getting better
on those allocation of expenses on an ongoing basis. I will now look at each of the
businesses in turn.
In motor, trading proﬁt increased by 10%, beneﬁting from the earn through of the higher
motor rates combined with strong claims experience, as well as from the introduction of
the motor panel and the ﬁrst full six months of Bennetts. Motor revenue decreased by
23% to £120 million from that quota share impact and I'll cover that later, partially oﬀset by
the trading in Bennetts business that was acquired on the 1st of July of 2015.
Core policy numbers increased during the period primarily from the inclusion of Bennetts
for that six-month period. And excluding Bennetts core motor policies grew by around
2%. Overall the motor market remains highly competitive and whilst we saw rate rises,
strong rate rises year-on-year in Q1, these will somewhat come oﬀ in Q2 and slowed
signiﬁcantly. However, we have maintained our focus on achieving the right balance
between growing customer numbers and delivering proﬁts.
So, this slide shows the motor underwriting business excluding the eﬀects of the quota
share which I'll cover on the next slides. This is trying to look at the business on a purely
comparable basis. We've had a very strong six months in motor underwriting with the
underlying proﬁt from the core underwritten motor business increasing by 15% to £57.3
million. That was (8:43) about 7.3% improvement in the pure combined operating ratio.
This improvement is due to two key factors. Firstly, that beneﬁted the rate increases
combined with our strong claims experience has improved the pure underwriting proﬁt.
And secondly, we had some beneﬁts from the introduction of that arrangement fee.

FINAL

Net earned premiums were lower by 7% due to two factors. Firstly, the introduction of the
panel has led to a lower number of underwritten policies and lower average premiums.
The lower premiums reﬂect the fact that a larger share of the higher-risk business is being
taken by third-party underwriters, which is exactly what we expected when we set the
panel up. Secondly, we have the introduction of the arrangement fee which is reported in
other income.
Okay. So, this table shows the accounting impacts of this funds with our (9:44) quota
share arrangement. I'm going to say while the accounting impact on the income
statement of the quota share is signiﬁcant on a line-by-line basis; the important number
on this page is the net impact on the trading proﬁt of £0.9 million. As guided at the time
of prelims, the full-year impact of this quota share arrangement on proﬁt is roughly 1% of
overall proﬁtability.

Bloomberg Transcript

For comparability purposes, we have calculated these ratios at the bottom including both
net earned premiums and other income given that change in the recognition of the
arrangement fee. This quota share arrangement will allow us to gradually release capital
from AICL supporting the continued reduction in our debt ratio and our progressive
dividend policy.
In terms of the reserve releases, continued favorable claims development experienced
during the six months to 31 July 2016 has enabled us to maintain a consistent level of
releases in the ﬁrst half with no deterioration in the reserve margin. This is being driven by
large and small PI, personal claims primarily, resulting in consistent overall motor releases
in the ﬁrst half of this year versus ﬁrst half of last year of around £40 million. The releases
in the second half of the year are expected to be lower than the comparable period last
year.
On Solvency II, we remain extremely well-capitalized. And as expected, our coverage ratio
has increased at the half-year point as a result of the reduced SCR due to the impact of
the quota share and also the reduction in best estimates. This positive movement
supports our decision to enter into this agreement, this quota share agreement as we
continue to move towards a more capital-eﬃcient, broker-orientated business model. And
the strong position also supports our ongoing deleveraging in H2.
Okay, on home insurance, in line with our competitors, we reported the market conditions
continue to be highly competitive with no evidence of premium inﬂation. Revenue
decreased by 6% due to a reduction in the proﬁt share in our New India arrangement and
also a small fall in our average premium compared to the ﬁrst half of last year. With
inﬂationary increases in operating expenses, this resulted in trading proﬁt decreasing by
around £4 million to £30 million.
While the panel continues to perform strongly, we believe that we are operating very
eﬃciently. And therefore, margin improvement, as Lance has said, will be driven less by
the net rate decreases coming through.

FINAL

Revenue in other insurance lines grew at £47 million with increased travel insurance
volumes and improved margins on private medical. Trading proﬁt was £1.7 million higher
with strong PMI performance. And also, the prior year, we had the impact of the
marketing on Saga Legal Services. This is partially oﬀset by increased costs in line with
increased travel insurance volumes.
The Travel business has another really strong six months of trading oﬀset by that
scheduled maintenance of the Saga Sapphire cruise ship. In our three tour operating
businesses, revenue has increased with a shift in average revenue per passenger upwards
as that product mix continued to shift to more long-haul and third-party cruise products.
And actually, our proﬁt across the tour operating business, as you see in the interim's
release, has increased to £8.5 million from £8.3 million.
In cruising, the Saga Sapphire was out of operation for that scheduled maintenance for a
total of 63 days between April and June, which impacted both obviously the revenue and
the trading proﬁt. As a result, cruising revenue fell by 12% to £37 million. And trading
proﬁt decreased by around £2 million in cruising to around £0.50 million. But excluding
the impact of that, both our revenue and our proﬁt would have been up both in cruise
and certainly across the whole travel business.

Bloomberg Transcript

In our Emerging Businesses, these obviously include our Saga Money and our home care
business. Revenue was relatively consistent with the prior year at £14 million. The overall
trading loss was slightly up, but that really reﬂects the investment both in Saga Investment
Services and our healthcare business.
Our cash ﬂow performance during the ﬁrst half of the year continued to be strong with
the Group achieving an available operating cash ﬂow of £97 million equating to 73% of
trading EBITDA. Cash ﬂow did decrease compared to the ﬁrst half of last year by £42
million. Firstly, there was a lower payout from our restricted business as the travel
business obtained more cash to pay the deposits on the new ship.
Secondarily, working capital in the ﬁrst half of this year is much more normalized and is
much more in line with the full-year expectation. And thirdly, the ﬁrst half of this year also
includes the payment to Acromas of £7.6 million for those tax loses that we have
purchased from them, the beneﬁt of which was recognized in last year's tax expense.
Overall, this means the cash ﬂow in the ﬁrst half of the year was more consistent with what
you should expect to see for the full-year outturn.
So at the interims last year, we obviously announced this net debt-to-EBITDA target of 1.5
times to 2 times for the medium term with the dividend payment ratio at 40% to 60% of
net income. We then moved that ahead at the time of the prelims to 50% to 70% really
reﬂecting the beneﬁt of what we expected to come from the quota share arrangement.
And given our continued strong cash generation and our Solvency II position, we remain
comfortable with our medium-term debt target range of 1.5 times to 2 times, net debt to
EBITDA. And you should expect that distribution to shareholders will be by way of
ordinary dividends in line with our guided dividend.

FINAL

So stepping back a bit, 18 months into business, the business really is in great shape.
However, it is important that we continue to work to ensure the eﬃciency and the
eﬀectiveness of our systems and processes for the future.
To this end, we have decided to modernize our retail brokers' insurance sales and
administration platform over the next three years. The implementation of this new eﬃcient
and ﬂexible platform will help to future-proof our activities whilst considerably improving
the customer experience. The cost of this will be covered in our usual run rate of CapEx
expenditure.
We're also in the process of introducing a new claims system which will improve the
process for claims for customers as well as reducing our costs associated with claims
handling. And this system is actually currently in advanced test phase.
We've started the reorganization of the back oﬃce of our Travel business to improve both
eﬃciency and reduce our costs in that business. And we have put in place an enhanced
group procurement function to drive cost eﬃciencies and procurement best practice
across the Group.

Bloomberg Transcript

So given the strong trading performance in the ﬁrst half of the year, the Group still
expects to continue to deliver proﬁt growth in the core businesses. After continued
investment in our emerging business and with the beneﬁt of lower ﬁnance costs, we are
conﬁdent of delivering growth in PBT of between 5% and 7% for the full year.
With our cash generation attributes and our enhanced solvency position, we are conﬁdent
that we can deliver on our dividend policy while continuing to reduce our debt ratio
towards our medium-term target range of 1.5 times to 2 times.
Thanks. And I hand back to Lance.

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Thanks, Jonathan. So I could read these out to you, but I hope that you'll be pretty familiar
by now. Those ﬁve points summarize what Saga has done in the last six months. And as I
say, I hope they are very consistent over the two and a half years that we've been talking
to you.
What do they mean to me? What they mean is we have a strong and a growing core
business. It means that we're generating lots of cash. We can pay the debt down and we
can invest in the future whilst supporting a dividend policy which is progressive within the
payout ratios that we announced back in April.
So thanks very much for your attention and time. I will now open it up to questions. We
don't have a mic to hand around. There are roof mics in here. So I think what we'll do is
ask you to raise your hand. And then when I pick you, if you could state your name before
asking your question, that'd be very kind. James. State your name, James.

Q&A

FINAL

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hi. It's James Shuck from UBS. I have three questions, please. Firstly, just on the – this is
the ﬁrst year you've had the – or the ﬁrst period you've had the (19:43) shared. So I'm just
interested to know what the proﬁt share commission was that was booked in the ﬁrst half
of the year as in what line I see that coming through. And then the second question is
around – on page 11 on the broking/other, so the revenue that's shown in here, £32.8
million at H1, that includes contribution from Bennetts. So could you just separately
identify within that £32.8 million, what comes from Bennetts and what exactly comes from
the motor panel, please?
And then thirdly, I guess the question is around the modernization over the three-year
period. Now, you're quite clear that that's running within your normal capital expenditure
for the year. And I guess my question is kind of what is that normal capital expenditure
with any one year. In previous periods, we've asked about the potential for modernization.
And you've been quite clear that you think that there is no big investment that's needed
and that seems to be consistent with what's happening here. But nevertheless, it is a kind
of step up, I would suggest, from what you were initially planning. So any insight into that
capital expenditure and how long it's likely to drag on (21:03) would be helpful.

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And in answer – well, I'll take those three. So you -

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

(21:08).

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

Sure. In terms of your ﬁrst question, where is the proﬁt share commission shown; you'll
ﬁnd it in the release on page 12 in the other income line and the quota share there. So it's
clearly identiﬁed there. And the second question is that Bennetts makes up just over £10
million of the revenue within the broking and other.
And the third point, I think there's a broader point here. Every business has an ongoing
requirement to evaluate that its systems are ﬁt for purpose at any point given the
developments that are going on in the worldwide market of technology and how that
relates to its various businesses. As you'd expect, we do that across our businesses on a
regular basis to ensure that we have the right systems for the future and where we are,
how (22:03) the system which can be improved both in eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness terms,
that we're moving towards that right system. So I don't think anything we've said in the
past – we don't see a big whizbang requirement to suddenly spend tens or hundreds of
millions. We are looking at this as a natural evolution of a system which has been in the
business for, I think, around...

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

And it's not illogical that at a certain point, we were going to come back and face into that
and look at a new system. So we are in advanced discussions with a couple of parties in
terms of ﬁnalizing a position going forward over the next three years to put in place a new
system. So your question then was around underlying. I think you can see that we've got a
relatively consistent run rate of CapEx across the business. It moves up and down in the
£5 million to £10 million (22:59). I am comfortable that what we have guided in terms of
our deleveraging takes into consideration what we need to spend across the business on
the assets that we have and on improving the systems that we need in the business.

Q - Nick Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

Morning. Nick Johnson from Numis. Just two questions, please. First of all, on the motor
footprint. I'm just wondering if there's been any change at this stage in the ratio of
customer inquiries to sales as a result of the panel coming online. I think previously, you
said that you would kind of (23:40) three out of four customer inquiries, but you weren't
able to quote in-house. I'm just wondering if that metric is beginning to change due to
the panel being there. And then secondly, in terms of motor broking proﬁtability, which is
up sort of I think around 20% in the period against an increasing core broking customers
(24:04) travelled I think. I'm just wondering if the proﬁt per customer has a new run rate
now or is that some...

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

I'll cover that in a sec. Yeah.

Q - Nick Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

...sure.

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Well, I'll take ﬁrst of that. So we don't publish the (24:18) percentage or the ratio of inquiry
to sales. But what I will tell you is that the panel is working pretty well for us. I will also say
that most of the panel volume is on renewals. And we would expect that to be the case
(24:32) customers that we already have that we know well and where those panels will see
their (24:38). But what's interesting is you see them, as we expected, taking the higher-risk
proﬁle customers because Saga's core competency is around the lowest risk customers.
But we always believed and are now seeing that the panel is taking the higher risk proﬁle

in relative terms – compared to the whole market, they're still pretty low risk – but they're
the higher risk ones on our panel.
And obviously, that means we either make more margin if we choose to on those
transactions or we can put that back into price in order to drive retention. So the panel is
doing exactly what we want it to do. Over time, as the panel (25:13) and more members
come on, we expect to see the footprint continue to grow as well. And again, we're not
going to publish the proportion of conversion that we get. But I will tell you that it has
improved.

Q - Nick Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

Okay, thanks.

And in terms of the proﬁt from broking and other, there's three major components within
this year's half-year numbers. There's the ﬁrst material element of the motor panel.
There's the six months versus one month of Bennetts. And we also have our credit hire
and repair business reported through this line as well. So actually, in terms of the
underlying proﬁt, we had a couple of million coming in from Bennetts. We had over £1
million coming in from the panel in the ﬁrst half. And we had some one-oﬀs in that credit
hire and repair line, which set us back about £1.5 million, half-year-on-half-year. So
actually, both the panel and Bennetts are contributing positively in the ﬁrst half of this
year. We just have some one-oﬀs which haven't been repeated in the credit hire and
repair lines.

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

(26:16).
Yes, going back to the panel. Could you please lay out what you mean by this new
insurance or insurer-hosted pricing mechanism and how it works within the panel? And
secondly, how long would it take to reach your optimum pricing potential within the
motor panel? You've reached that down (26:40) home I think within three or four years.
Yeah.
But what would the pace be within the motor panel? Have you seen some evidence for
that competitive pressure reducing that (26:51) price?
Well, ﬁrstly, the insurer-hosted pricing basically means that we'd get a real-time feed back
and forth through the underwriters so that each time a quote comes in or each time a
customer comes in; almost in real time, we can put that opportunity out to the whole
panel. And then you want to (27:07) use the insurer-hosted pricing and can then run the
algorithm and decide what they're willing to price at. That's obviously much more
granular than just receiving a ﬂat ﬁle once a week that tells us what price proﬁles they
want to work to. The more granular it gets, the more keenly they can price if they choose
Page 9 of 17



Company Name: Saga PLC
Company Ticker: SAGA LN Equity
Date: 2016-09-21

to. So that gives – over time, as more and more of our underwriters move to that insurerhosted pricing structure, that should give us more and more keen pricing (27:33) on the
panel.

FINAL

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

We actually were getting monthly fees. But you can imagine what an underwriter wants to
build in as a caution element if it can't adjust its price for a full month. So by getting IHP,
they're able to move those prices and get more comfortable to put those prices more
keenly.

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

And then on the second half of your question, it's very hard to answer the question when
would we get to full eﬃciency. It's obviously going to depend on how rapidly new
panelists join. And the proﬁle of motor is very diﬀerent than home. So on the home panel,
we didn't see high levels of eﬃciency until we had a dozen or so underwriters on the
panel. You don't need that many for motor because each motor underwriter can cover
much more of the market. And so already with ﬁve underwriters including AICL on the
panel, we are seeing some gains. And we can see who the next one, two or three
panelists are likely to be. And we can see that they will add competitive tension to the
panel and also that they'll add footprint as well to the earlier question.
Thank you.

Ravi.

Q - Ravi Tanna

{BIO 16926941 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. Ravi Tanna at Goldman Sachs. Three questions, please. The ﬁrst one
was just on your motor claims commentary. And I think you referenced (28:51) in the
proﬁle of your drivers. But the claims inﬂation you guys reference at about 5% seems
pretty consistent with most others in the market. So I was just wondering what disconnect
– if frequency is running a bit lighter, severity running stronger or is there any kind of
noticeable diﬀerence in what you're seeing (29:13)?
And the second question – and it's very a small number that (29:17) the earnings being
down a little bit. And I was wondering, again, given that rates in the market have
increased; what (29:26) maybe that could be a bit stronger. So I was wondering if there's
particular within that. Third was really a point of clariﬁcation on the dividend. And you've
got a one-third (29:38) policy over the last year. I think the interim versus ﬁnal was (29:42)
of how we should think about that dividend policy. If I may, a quick thought on the
solvency ratio. You spoke about two areas of beneﬁt, one being the quota share and the
second being best estimates reduction. And I was wondering if you could quantify how
much each of those has contributed to the solvency ratio increase.

Yes, please.

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

Well, the frequency is about how much our drivers are driving relative to where or how
much they used to drive previously. So the frequency number itself is driven by behavior.
And what we are clearly saying is that we are not seeing a change in our behavior. I think
the severity in the inﬂation is driven by what's happening in the market, what's happening
in the legislative environment. So that's what drives inﬂation. So it's not something that is
related to our driver behavior. It's related to the market and the overall environment. So
that's why I think why the two things are driven by diﬀerent factors. But we're very clear in
that we are still not seeing a change in our drivers' behavior in terms of driving patterns.
And therefore, we're not getting that change in frequency.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the ancillaries, I would say, I'm assuming that you're pleased that our resilient highquality earnings are increasing. And what you might view as less high-quality earnings in
terms of ancillaries, which is often quoted, is decreasing in (31:16) the proportion. What
we're seeing is as the market inﬂates, you get people undertaking sales calls. And how do
they ensure that they try and ﬁnalize some of those sales calls? So I think when you see an
inﬂationary environment, you may see across the piece ancillary rates and add-on rates
coming under a little bit of pressure.
And I think we said historically, approximately one-third, two-thirds in dividend. We will
stick with the word approximately. And that was a rough guidance rather than a
mathematical rule. We haven't given the (31:55) quota share and best estimates. What we
clearly said was that quota share would gradually provide a reduction in the amount of
capital we needed in the underwriter. What we said at the year-end was if we're increasing
our dividend payout ratio while maintaining our deleveraging by circa 10%, if one
assumes that today's proﬁtability was to carry on and we were increasing and paying out
that full 10%; you could equate that roughly to an incremental £45 million of capital
release gradually over time. We haven't given the split at the half year and we're not
intending to.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thanks. It's Blair Stewart from BofA Merrill. Two or three questions. Firstly, could you give
(32:43) of where you're pricing in the whole market (32:48) stabilizing. And equally in the
motor market, you've clearly bettered from the price increases (32:54). And the ﬁnal
question really just related to the customer database work that you're doing. And you've
seen a small pickup in the active customers. Is the intension there to get a greater
proportion of active customers versus the total number of customers on the database? Is
that the longer-term intension? How do you see that playing out?

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Well, look, on both of those – ﬁrstly, on pricing, we've all seen a fairly persistent decline in
home pricing over several years. We tend not give details out on what we see. But I will
tell you that broadly we've seen the stabilizing of pricing in the home insurance sector. So

it's stopped dropping as precipitously as it was. And on motor, I think Jonathan covered
in his presentation, earlier (33:46) we saw a rise in the ﬁrst half and it's stopped now.

FINAL

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

I think what some of the commentators – particularly if you look at the AA stats of Q2 rates
being – I think they quoted somewhere around 2% is the quarter-on-quarter. We're not
fundamentally seeing something diﬀerent than other market commentators in Q2, but
obviously Q1-on-Q1 a year earlier was showing very strong growth as commentated on by
a lot of those external indices.

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

And then on your database question though, I mean, I think the way to look at this is – that
kind of IPO'd two-and-a-half-years ago, we were very focused on how many names did we
have on the database, which was about the most granular and useful measure we had at
the time. What's happening is we're gradually zooming in more and more on the
customers that matter.

Bloomberg Transcript

So for the last two years, we've talked a lot about the number of active customers that we
had, which is an important metric of course as to how many people out there have some
kind of a relationship with Saga.
I think the direction of Travel, I think you'll see us over the next years start to move in to
how many higher value customers do we have, for example, how many products per
higher value customer have we got, what's retention like amongst higher value
customers. So, yes, of course, we want to drive up the number of active customers on the
database, but not at any cost. It doesn't make sense to buy customer volumes in a very
disruptive way.
What makes sense is for you to take a customer and migrate them up the value curve, so
that they buy their second, their third and fourth product from Saga. They become truly
embedded in the brand so, hopefully, multiple decades relationship, and those are the
high value customers, where we make a lot of our proﬁt.

Q - Ben Cohen

{BIO 1541726 <GO>}

Thanks. Ben Cohen with Canaccord. I have two questions. Firstly, on the cross-selling part
which you had announced, sort of the most important initiative. When are you going to be
able to sort of put some numbers to that and the impact that that would have on the
growth in the business? Or should we sort of see that as part of that kind of longer term
5% to 7% proﬁt avenue (35:53) growth, the growth that you're looking for?
And then, again, I'll try and ask a question on the Travel side, in terms of the impacts of a
weaker sterling, so you're saying that kind of customer plans aren't really changing. If
that's the case, would sterling being weaker including the majority of these holidays
being in (36:18) currency, should we see a pickup in growth (36:22) in the second half and
then into next year because of that currency eﬀect?

FINAL

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Lance here. I'll take the ﬁrst and then hand over to Jonathan, who's thinking about the
second one. So look, on cross-sell, internally, we are starting to develop really quite
detailed metrics as to what we wanted to achieve. And that will drive itself all the way
down to segment level where we decide for individual clusters of customers, what crosssell number we are chasing. We are unlikely to publish that level of detail externally. And
to pick up on your question, I would view that as part of our portfolio of options and how
we drive sort of good proﬁt, growth number each year, a long view.
We have eight diﬀerent businesses, and then the way I view it is overlaying those eight
businesses. We have no database, and all of the opportunities that we have within that
database. And we see all of that adding up to our ability to deliver consistent proﬁt
growth, consistent solid cash, deleveraging, and a stronger dividend. And I would rather
focus the story of that level then drill down into individual customer segments and then
cross-sell. There's a lot of work going on in that space.

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And I would reiterate the last point is that, what we are aiming to do as a business is work
with the portfolio of businesses and products that we have to drive stable, solid, robust,
sustainable growth in this business while generating good cash ﬂow to be able to delever
and pay strong dividends. We haven't given any medium-term guidance. We've given
one-year guidance. But we are very clear that everything we are doing adds up
collectively to us to try to deliver that strong, stable, reliable growth going forward.

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Which you're now seeing for ﬁve sets (38:11) and six months and going on. (38:12) And our
goal is to move the levers as required in order to deliver. Clearly cross-sell is a part of the
story.

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

And the second question, in terms of Travel. Obviously, in our main tour operating
businesses, we hedge forward a fair distance. We're pretty much 80% hedged forward in
our tour operating businesses for all departures for next year. So, what you'll ﬁnd is that
anybody booking today and anybody who wants to book in the next weeks or months.
And anybody here is welcome to join, and will get the same price as the pre-Brexit level
of the exchange rates.
Clearly, there will come a point where we'll have to start pricing product outside and in
the period after that, 80%. And then, we'll have to see the impacts on the pricing for the
end customer as we work through that.
So clearly, an exchange here would (39:11) stay exactly where they are today than the
pricing to the end customer will go up. But we don't believe that that will stop customers
traveling. We just think it may make them, if they're sitting on a certain budget, choosing
something slightly diﬀerent than they may have chosen in the ﬁrst place.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you. James Shuck from UBS. Just three follow-ups, if I may. Let's see, the proﬁt
before tax growth guidance, you gave us a 5% to 7% for full year, that you're reiterating
now this half-year. I'm not so much concerned of the 8.5% that you delivered at the H1, but
just more the H1 has beneﬁted from a very high level of reserve releases, again, enables
Saga to really sort of gain on this.
So I guess my question is, why are you still going to stick in to 5% to 7% for the full year
story, (40:01) all other things being equal, we should be above that. I kind of connected
with that point. I just don't think you should start – your point around the guidance, you've
only given one-year guidance, not multi-year. I mean, my understanding is you've given –
you used to have an EBITDA guidance that's multi-year of 5% to 7% which has now moved
down below to PBT level, which one could argue is actually a little bit less than the 5% to
7% and as you projected further (40:26), Could you just state whether you do have multiyear targets and so on?

Bloomberg Transcript

And secondly, on the customer segmentation on the high-value customers. I mean, that's
– it's interesting to us and you've talked a little bit about some of the KPIs around
retention and product developments and also improving the kind of the customer
journey. You seem to indicate that was a kind of multi-year approach before you'd see
tangible signs of that beneﬁting earnings. Is that the right take on that or were there kind
of things you're doing now that will actually – going to be impactful and you can actually
show us KPI and things working?
And then just ﬁnally on the Solvency II ratio. 196% for the full year. I don't know that you've
given a target range, but do you have one? And just to refresh my mind, I think you talked
about £40 million, I think being released from quota share. Is that – that's just coming
through (41:17) over time as the book unwinds, but does that have an impact on the
Solvency II ratio coming down as well?

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

In terms of the ﬁrst part, we are aiming to delever underlying PBT growth. So, you can
take that when I refer to underlying, is excluding derivatives, because we can't control
derivatives. If the exchange rate moves signiﬁcantly and the fuel rate moves signiﬁcantly
between now and the year-end, I'm not going to have a moving target up until the last
day depending on what derivatives are doing. So, underlying compared to the 3.8% that
we talked about today is underlying PBT growth that is the one that I'm aiming to get to
5% to 7%.
Secondarily, you have to remember the reserve releases are reducing in the second half
of the year. So, do I think we are undercooking our target? No, I don't. Secondly, we are
very clear in the prelims that we were guiding on one year at 5% to 7%. We have a range
of diﬀerent products, as I've already said, which behave in diﬀerent ways with diﬀerent
market circumstances. I'm not giving a multi-year target on a 2% range. We do not know
what markets are going to do. In the ﬁrst half of this year, we've had motor up; we've had
home being diﬃcult.

FINAL

Everything we do is subject to market, subject to market conditions. So, we're not giving a
multi-year target. We're very clear, our aim is to deliver solid, sustainable, underlying
growth year-on-year, right, subject to underlying market conditions that we will not tie
ourselves to a 2% range without any subject to. Anybody who does that, good luck to
them.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Well, you did do that?

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

We didn't do that at the full year. And if you'd ask that question at full year, I've given you
a very clear answer. This is a one-year target, and you will ﬁnd very, very few businesses
that are quoted giving multi-year 2% ranges on proﬁt targets.

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

That's not to say that we are lowering our internal notable (43:13) ambition. We know what
we're aiming at as a management team and – but we've agreed with our board. What
we're saying is that it doesn't make sense to target your entire existence on a 2% range
and put that action to the public domain in a multi-year way; because it can drive a city for
ages (43:30).

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

And potentially, as a proﬁt forecast as well, which I don't think we're in the business of
doing either.

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Yeah. So, segmentation by value customers, KPIs, et cetera. The work is under way now.
We are seeing beneﬁts now. We are already spending our marketing dollars smarter than
we were before in a more targeted way. We are already testing and learning in individual
segments that we didn't know exist a year or two ago to drive better cross-sell result.
We've seen really interesting and encouraging results.
There is a question around how many KPIs we choose to put out into the public domain.
My concern is that we end up micromanaging ourselves in front of you and reporting on
the outputs of very small groups of customers on individual tests or even that we give
away a lot of commercially useful skills and so on to outside world. But this is not – it is a
multi-year program. It will continue – if I run this company for 10 more years, it will
continue through the whole of those 10 years. But we are seeing beneﬁts already coming
through and we expect to see those continuing in the months to come. But it's not as if
we're waiting three years before it switches on.

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

And in terms of Solvency II, we did expect the full year at – we weren't giving a range, but
170% was at the upper end of where we'd expect to be at the full year. We obviously have

FINAL

waited to see the ﬁrst six months of quota share impact actually coming into the numbers,
because we really wanted to work that through methodically to really – to see how that
was actually coming through in the SCR. So now that we've seen that, we understand that
better how it's working through mechanically. You should expect that 170% will be at the
upper end of where you should expect us to be going forward.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

And just to be clear, (45:18) really one-time or we need to just reset the 170% on yearend?

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

We're not going to reset to a number. We will continue to manage within a sensible range
which we have internally, of which 170% is at the upper of. But the quota share itself
gradually gives us an impact of releasing the amount of reserves we have to hold. And as
that comes through, then that enables us to take dividends out of that underwriting
business and to the group, which enables us to free up cash to be able de-lever and pay
dividends. That's the way it works.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Anymore questions in the last couple of minutes? We have one (46:01).

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Just one sort of – it's Blair Stewart again. Just on the reserve releases, regarding those
things (46:06) over the last year, that we will reduce them further. They've remained quite
high in the ﬁrst half of the year. You're saying that the reserve prudency is more or less
unchanged. How should – if you can help us trying to model that number it's a signiﬁcant
number. And how does that – how should we think about not moving over the next two to
three years?

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

We haven't – I mean, I will reiterate what we said before. It will start to step down this year.
I've already said that it will be lower in the second half of this year than it was in last year.
And then it'll gradually step down over the next few years. But as quota share kicks in,
we'll actually – eﬀectively have less and less historic reserves which are there. So, I think
I'm not going to give speciﬁc guidance on that. What you should expect is that, it's a
gradual reduction over several years. And oﬀsetting that, you should see the beneﬁts of
the panel and the ongoing beneﬁts of the eﬃciency driver we deliver within our services
business that helps to oﬀset that, meaning we can still drive that good level of proﬁtability
within our Insurance business.
