{BIO 2301941 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the presentation of Tryg's Q1 results. Here's Lars
Moller and with me today I have our CEO Morten Hubbe and our CFO Tor Lonnum. And
with this short introduction I will hand over to you, Morten.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you, Lars. And if we start with the highlights on slide 3, we show again continued
improvement in our technical result, which improves 5% year on year despite an increase
of DKK150 million on large claims, mainly in the corporate segment. Combined ratio
improves a bit more than 1 percentage point to 89.2% in Q1, which is traditionally one of
the weaker seasonal quarters of the year, the improvement clearly driven by our savings
program, which improves both claims and costs.
Investment clearly below last year due to equity markets. We see a slight improvement in
our top-line trend, which dropped 2% in this quarter compared to minus 2.5% in the First
Quarter last year. 1.2% of that decrease is due to Sweden and the lapse of the Nordea
agreement, whereas it's important that we see an improvement in the private lines area
where last year's drop of 2% in the top line has been improved to a drop of 0.5% in this
First Quarter.

FINAL

Now if we move to slide 4, we have implemented a new split between corporate and
commercial, which is expected to improve focus and service but also reduce cost. We
have implemented a number of changes in our Nordea banking concept in Denmark and
Norway and improved our IT solutions in the branches selling our insurance products.
And as a result we are starting to see a 10% higher sales in Q1 banking compared to last
year. And bear in mind that these are high-quality customers and a distribution cost which
is mainly consistent of proﬁt sharing.
We have also acquired the renewal rights of a rather small agricultural portfolio from
Codan, which we're now in the process of renewing in the Tryg books.
And we continue with an extremely strong focus on making sure that our DKK1 billion
eﬃciency program continues to improve results and, as we see, has reduced the nominal
costs in Q1 by roughly 2%.
On slide ﬁve we show the four business areas. Three of the four business areas have
combined ratios below 90% and a strong improvement in the reported combined ratio,
but clearly also aﬀected positively by higher run-oﬀ gains.

Bloomberg Transcript

Private lines improved from 90% to 88%. Sweden improves the combined ratio by
roughly 6 percentage points to a combined ratio of 88.7%. Clearly the strongest result
we've seen in a Q1 in Sweden. Commercial with an unusually low combined ratio of 81.9%
and a technical result of DKK190m. While the negative impact comes from corporate, with
a combined ratio of close to 99% and large and weather-related claims having an impact
of 22.5% compared to 5.7% in the similar quarter the year before.
If you look at slide six we see a continued positive impact of our DKK1 billion eﬃciency
program. That will be the main driver of earnings improvement both in 2014 and 2015,
and it had an impact of DKK90 million in the First Quarter split by DKK25 million of costs
and DKK65 million on claims improvement.
If we move to slide eight we see the development in both top line and technical result of
the various business areas. We see clearly that private has an improvement of the
technical result of 11%, including higher run-oﬀ gains, but also, as I said, an improved
trend in the top line from minus 2% last year to minus 0.5% this year.
Corporate improves the top line, but clearly the large claims result in a high combined
ratio.
Commercial we see an impressive improvement in the technical result, while the top line
is still challenged, mainly in the Danish market while we're starting to see some
improvement in the Norwegian commercial market.
Then I guess clearly a strong improvement in the technical result in Sweden, while we see
a signiﬁcant negative trend on the top line given the lapse of the Nordea agreement. But
bear in mind this was an agreement that resulted in signiﬁcant losses in the Swedish

portfolio and we should be willing to let top line go that has no positive impact to the
bottom line.
And over to you, Tor.

FINAL

Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

Thanks Morten. If you move on to the next slide and look at customer retention, you can
see that it's a relatively stable development, relatively small ﬂuctuations this quarter.
There's a small improvement in commercial in Denmark and there's a small decline in
private in Denmark. I guess the competitive pressure is still on for the Danish market, but
as you can see, a more stable development in the retention level here. In terms of the
Norwegian market, it's a ﬂattish development.
If we move on to the next slide and look at the development in terms of the average
premiums, you can see that for the Norwegian market it's a continued growth in average
premium and reﬂecting the underlying indexation of the product.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we look at Denmark you can see that there is negative development in motor insurance
and it's a continued development since what we look -- since the last quarter. I guess it
reﬂects two things. One is the change in covers for the motor product, but it also reﬂects
the fact that we get newer cars into the portfolio, where we see that there's a higher level
of safety equipment and slightly lower prices. If we look at the housing product you can
see that there is a 0.6% increase in the average premium, which reﬂects the indexation of
the product but also an increased share of aﬃnity distribution in the product.
If we move on to the next slide and look at Sweden, the retention has been stabilized,
although at a relatively low level, and is still signiﬁcantly impacted by the Nordea portfolio
that Morten mentioned. We can see that the performance in terms of proﬁtability is
relatively strong. And I guess we feel that we do have selective measures in terms of topline development related to gross sales and also the partnership with Danske, which
should help us turn the revenue stream around, although not in the nearest quarters.
If we move on to the next slide and look at the underlying claims ratio, there is an
underlying improvement of 1.2% in the quarter, of course down from the 4.4 percentage
improvement you saw last year, but still it reﬂects the continuous improvement from our
eﬃciency and procurement programs. We see improvement in private and corporate,
slightly weaker in commercial and Sweden, but from a very low level.
If we move on to the next slide and look at large claims, weather claims etc., this is really
where we have the signiﬁcant impact in Q1. And you can see that large claims are up by
3.3 percentage points. There's no particular pattern in terms of the large claims, but we
have seen some relatively signiﬁcant large claims in this quarter in the corporate segment.
So you can see that it also -- it is also higher than our own expectations of 3%.
If you look at the weather claims, it's more or less in line with last year, slightly lower. One
should perhaps have expected an even lower level, but I guess it's important to
Page 3 of 15

FINAL

understand that it's also impacted by the extreme weather that you had in, the extreme
winter weather that you had in Norway in Q1, among other things the extreme growth that
you had in the ﬁrst month of the quarter.
If you look at the run-oﬀ this quarter, clearly it's signiﬁcantly higher than what you have
seen previously. It does, however, reﬂect the fact, and we did mention this in Q4 as well,
that we see -- we saw, actually saw a strengthening of our reserve position throughout
2013. So it reﬂects in our mind a very strong reserving position. The reserve releases are
particularly coming from workers' compensation and motor TPL.
If we move onto the next slide and look at the expenses, you can see that there is slightly
lower impacting cost ratio this quarter. It's only down by 0.1 percentage point. Of course
it's impacted by the reduction in top line that Morten mentioned, but also a slightly
diﬀerent phasing in terms of expenses. So we will see an impact in the coming quarters.

Bloomberg Transcript

You can see that the number of employees has been reduced, particularly impacted by
the outsourcing agreement to Accenture this quarter. Nominal expenses, as Morten said,
are down by 2% in ﬁxed currency. And I guess on this slide it's also worth mentioning that
we are looking into some additional expenses related to the IT transitional agreement,
which probably will have an impact on the Q2 numbers. It does not -- it means that we will
see a one-oﬀ in terms of expenses but it will not mean that we change our overall targets
for the year, although it may have an impact on the cost ratio all year.
If we move on to the next slide and look at the investment return this quarter, it's
signiﬁcantly lower than the same quarter last year, particularly impacted by the equity
performance. Equity performance this quarter, as you can see, is at 1.8%. We have seen
strong performance in terms of high yield and emerging market debt this quarter as well,
which has been the signiﬁcant contributors to the results.
We have also tried in terms of reporting of opening up a bit more, so you can see that
there is a more granular breakdown of revenues in the investment side this quarter, and
it's in order to try to give you a better overview of what's going on, on the investment
side.
Finally on the next slide, if we look at the capital structure, there has also been some
signiﬁcant changes in terms of capital. You can see that the capital requirement has
increased by some DKK350m. This is due to the new registration in Denmark where we
are moving towards the Solvency 2 regulation. The main drivers for the DKK350 million is
related to the reserves and to workers' compensation.
If we look at the available capital, you can see that that has increased by DKK450 million
and thus keeping the surplus capital at more or less the same level that what we have
seen before, slightly above 50%. And the reason for the increased capital is that the
haircut on this accounting has been reduced in terms of capital allowed for the individual
solvency.

And I guess ﬁnally I'd like to make the comment that we have now done about 21% of our
buyback program and it's progressing according to plan.
And with that I will hand it back to you, Morten.

FINAL

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you, Tor. And on slide 19 we basically repeat the unchanged ﬁnancial targets.
I guess to summarize, we are very pleased that we again are able to improve our technical
result this quarter by 5% despite the DKK150 million increase in large claims. And I guess
that in our opinion shows the robustness of our current business to be able to manage
that. We're also pleased that we continue to see the positive impact of our eﬃciency
program, resulting in some DKK90 million in the First Quarter and an improvement in the
combined ratio of 1 percentage point, an improvement of the nominal cost by roughly 2
percentage points.

Bloomberg Transcript

We expect to continue a strong and positive development in our results and we're
pleased that we're able to see the ﬁrst small signs of a slow and gradual improvement to
the top-line trend. We see that our price diﬀerentiation work mean that our selection in
new sales is stronger and the quality of our new customers and the expected claims ratio
of those new customers is stronger. And we're pleased to see a slight improvement in
private lines trends but, as Tor said, we should expect to continue to see a negative
impact on Sweden and a negative development in top line during 2014.

Thank you, Morten and Tor. Now we're ready to take questions, so operator, please?

Questions And Answers

Gianandrea Roberti, Carnegie.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. I have three questions. The ﬁrst one, actually just picking up on where
you left, Morten, on the top line. I suppose it surprised quite a few of us somewhat
negatively. Probably most of it is due to currencies. The Nordea portfolio in Sweden was
left. But also clearly in the commercial lines you lost quite a bit of top line there. Also you
commented that we should expect a top line negative in 2014 and I guess everybody,
more or less, was expecting that. But would it be fair at this point to expect a back ﬂat if
not even a tad negative top line also going in 2015? If you can just expand a bit on the top
line it would be interesting.

FINAL

The second question is more on eﬃciency. I was actually looking at the number of
employees you had at year end 2013 and benchmarking that versus Gjensidige. Probably
Tor can tell me something about it. But Tryg seemed to have around DKK300 million
more full-time employees than Gjensidige at year end. It's a good 10%. And I'm just
wondering what should drive that or if your goal is to reduce it, how much would you go
down?
The last question is really a bit more a big-picture question. I understand that under
European Union rules all new cars being sold from the second half of 2015 are to be
equipped with something called eCall, which is a device that, if I understand correctly,
allows a direct call to emergency services when a car crashes. And there is a big
discussion out there on the use of telematics in insurance and how much can be done
and how much can improve tariﬀs and everything, and it would be just great if you can
share some comments on that. Thanks.

Good morning, to you Gianandrea. I guess you're right that the top-line development is
impacted by currency, and I think we should start by taking that out because clearly a 7%
diﬀerence, of which 5 percentage points is currency, of course nothing that we can either
do anything about or want to do anything about. The real debate is the 2% drop in top
line.
Clearly we see this in probably three diﬀerent buckets. One is Sweden, where of course a
drop of 12% is signiﬁcant. But bear in mind the Nordea portfolio in Sweden had a
signiﬁcant negative bottom-line impact. And I think the fact that we've been able to
improve the combined ratio now to 89 is a signiﬁcant improvement.
We see now that the non-Nordea portfolio in Sweden is actually increasing in number of
customers. We also see that our current sales in Sweden is now as high without Nordea as
it was before with Nordea. But we are not yet able to compensate for the higher Nordea
lapse of existing customers. And it will take a while, and I think both in 2014 and 2015 to
close that gap in the Swedish market. So that will be a negative driver in both 2014 and
2015.
The second bucket is really our priority and those private lines. Private lines is by far the
biggest part of our business and the biggest part of our earnings. So to turn gradually
around a negative development in private lines is important. We're seeing now a slightly
net positive development in number of customers and private lines in Norway. And we're
seeing improvements in the Danish private lines, but not yet a positive development in
number of customers. But clearly we have higher sales now in both Denmark and Norway
on private lines. And you see as a result also the ﬁrst trend that the top line improved from
minus 2% to minus 0.5%.
And I guess the third bucket is really commercial, where we're starting to see
improvements in the Norwegian market, where we have higher sales and a more positive
customer development, whereas the real challenge is that our current sales in Denmark is
too low. Retention rates are good. But we have been -- we have seen that the big changes
Page 6 of 15



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2014-04-10

we've done between the commercial and corporate segment, where we have changed
some big parts of the portfolio and the roles and responsibilities, has meant that the
activity level and the new sales in commercial has been lower than expected.

FINAL

And as a result we will see negative top line in 2014 and some of the drivers will be
negative also in 2015, but we will start to see some of these positive initiatives have
positive impact also in 2015.

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

And just to give an additional supplement to Morten's comment, which is an issue we
have discussed before as well, but I guess it's important to know that we are in the
process of doing portfolio conversion related to the price diﬀerentiation in Denmark. And
of course that is a process that will continue in 2015. So as Morten said, there are some
positive drivers in terms of top line that we expect to have an impact. And there are also
some uncertainties related to the portfolio conversion.

Bloomberg Transcript

I guess if I try to answer your question, Gianandrea, in terms of the eﬃciency program and
the benchmarking that we have done, the fast and easy comment is that since we are
down about 50 persons since year end I guess that will give you 250 left.
But joking aside, it's clearly there is -- I think it's diﬃcult to do that kind of benchmarking
on the overall level. What's important is really to look at our own eﬃciency and the
opportunities that we see in terms of eﬃciency gains. And clearly we do not feel that we
are sold out in terms of eﬃciency gains. We do see that there are signiﬁcant
opportunities, and that is something that we will continue to focus on going forward.
The last question I guess is --

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I guess it's correct to say that more automatic braking functions in new cars is positive. It
will help safety and will lower risk. And I guess in the last couple of years we have seen
that the newer cars have better safety equipment and lower risk and as a result also a
slightly lower insurance premium. We are currently working on a new motor tariﬀ, where
we will decide how much of this we will take into account. But clearly I guess for both the
people driving and the people insuring, that is positive.

Hi there. Good morning. Just on the large corporate losses in Danish corporate, which
you have mentioned, I was just wondering, this is -- we heard you mention this in Third
Quarter. At that point it was mid-size corporates and now it's some large. And I'm just
wondering if is there any plans to reconsider the reinsurance or any others? And the
reason I'm asking is that I keep asking whether there's a normalization of claim frequency
on the horizon, but is this something you're considering on the reinsurance side?
Second thing is, obviously you also clariﬁed that in commercial volumes are down in
Denmark. But the redemptions is quite remarkably up. I note you mentioned it's only
slightly up in this quarter, but over the last few quarters there's been slightly more
improvement in the redemptions. So could you just clarify what is driving this volume
pressure? Is it that the exposures are reducing and that's why the premiums are falling or
is it that new customers are not coming in?
And in this context, you've also been introducing new products. Is that -- how is that
working out, if you could just clarify? Thank you.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well I think if I take your last question and Tor can comment on the ﬁrst question. You're
absolutely right that on the commercial Denmark we have seen a strong trend in the
retention, which is very positive, and I think longer term a driver of more stability and
positive development in the top line.
But I guess we've made a large number of changes in commercial. Just during the
autumn we have changed the whole distribution organization in commercial from a
Nordic setup to a Danish/Norwegian countrywide setup. So the entire distribution
organization has been changed. And after that, we have changed the split between
corporate and commercial where close to 80% of the number of customers in commercial
-- in corporate in Denmark and Norway has moved to commercial. And on top of that we
have done a number of changes to which lines of business and which geographies the
various employed agents are allowed to sell to.
And I guess the current challenge has been that we've seen that as a result of these many
changes the number of new sales per employed agent has dropped. We expect that that
will pick up more during the year and together with positive trend that you mention on
retention that will improve the development in a number of customers on the top line. But
it has taken a while and there has been an impact, and it will take a slight while more
before we see that settle at a more stable and higher level. But clearly the retention will
help and the new sales needs to come up in Denmark in commercial.

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

Yes. Then I guess on the large claims, yes, clearly there is more volatility related to the
large claims. On the other hand, it's important to understand that when we do our
reinsurance program we try to aim to protect the capital and we try to do that on an
overall basis for the full year where we try to protect our equity. So some volatility should

Page 8 of 15

FINAL

be expected between the quarters. On the other hand, you can see that that has been to
a certain extent at least aligned by the reserve releases that we had this quarter.
I guess there is -- in our mind it doesn't seem to be a trend in terms of large corporate
claims. We have one large claim -- it's actually in a milk factory in Denmark -- and then we
have one large claim in Norway, which is the signiﬁcant contributors. And I guess that a
part of the year, the game really related to the corporate segment. So in our mind it
doesn't seem to be a trend. As you said, we did adjust upwards our full-year estimate for
large claims and we don't think that we should need to reconsider that at this point in
time and date.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Thanks. Can I just quickly follow up on the -- you mentioned Norway had some ﬁres and
some weather losses slightly higher in the winter, but I still see a 90% -- 89.8% combined
ratio. It was some of the reserve releases also in Norway?

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

Yes, deﬁnitely, so reserve releases both in Denmark and Norway. And you're right. It was -the combined ratio for the Norwegian market, as you say, is still below 90%, is really very
healthy for a Q1 which typically, as Morten said, due to seasonality should be a bit weaker.

Q - Daniel Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. I have three questions. The ﬁrst one is on the Nordea portfolio, the
second on weather losses and there's a third one on your individual solvency model.
So just beginning with Sweden, you mentioned that you're likely to continue seeing a
close on that portfolio for some time. Can you just give us a feel for how far through we
are on that process? And can you just conﬁrm again the size of that portfolio in relation to
the overall Swedish premiums?
Then again, perhaps related to that, could you just remind us again of when the new
distribution agreement with Danske is set to begin in Sweden?
Secondly, on weather losses, which came in a bit higher than I was expecting, could you
just give us some insights into the where is that coming from on a geographic basis? As I
understand it, you've disclosed that 0.8 percentage points came from the ﬁres in Norway,
but if you could just comment on the remainder, that would be very helpful.

Page 9 of 15



Company Name: Tryg A/S

Date: 2014-04-10

And on individual solvency lastly, quite a bit of recalibration during the quarter. Can we
expect any more of this going forward or have the main areas of uncertainty been ironed
out by now? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Good morning, to you, Daniel. I think on the ﬁrst question we can say that currently
Nordea contributes some 19% of our private lines portfolio in Sweden and I guess some
of that will remain with us and some of it will leave over the next few years. And as I said,
we've really had two challenges there. One was to replace the distribution capacity and
the second was to replace the gap from the higher lapse ratio.
And we have, by now we have increased our number of outbound sales force in Sweden
from zero in Malmo to 114 people. So we now are distributing as much without Nordea as
we were with Nordea before. And we are currently building up further with Danske where
the agreement started in March and where we will gradually build more distribution. And
we're also negotiating with several other partners to ﬁnd additional distribution. But it will
take a while to also close the gap of the higher lapse of the Nordea portfolio. But 19% is
the current number.

Q - Daniel Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

And so the weather-related claims, I guess I mentioned the ﬁres this quarter. They
accumulate to about DKK40m. So the remainder of weather, reported weather claims this
quarter is about DKK100m.
And I guess it's important to understand that although you have had a relatively benign
quarter, as I mentioned, you have seen weather on and oﬀ, in particular in the Norwegian
market, which means that although the weather is relatively mild, you do see winter
coming and going. And of course that means that you will see some increased frequency
in terms of on motor, you will see some increased frequency in terms of housing etc. So I
think, yes, it's at a relatively low level, but it's not just looking at the temperature outside
and see that that's how you can interpret the weather.
If you move on to the question about the capital model, yes, relatively signiﬁcant changes
this quarter. We do not expect any signiﬁcant calibration going forward for the remainder
of the year. But keep in mind that there is ongoing discussions with the FSA and of course
it means that legislation and things may change during the year. One of the things that
we're still anticipating, for instance, is the level of gearing that we should be able to use in
our balance sheet.

Q - Daniel Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. Okay. That's very clear. Thanks very much.

Q - Jacob Pedersen

{BIO 2260641 <GO>}

Yes, hi gentlemen. I just have a single question regarding your Norwegian activities.
Could you try to explain the eﬀects from the First Quarter of 2013 to the First Quarter of
this year with regard to drop in your technical result?
And also it's quite obvious that almost the whole technical result in the Norwegian
business is run-oﬀ. Could you talk a bit about what's happened? It seemed that the
income from this business last year was of a better quality than this year.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I guess I heard your interpretation in terms of run-oﬀ, which I don't think is the correct
assumption. I guess the main impact and the signiﬁcant change that you see here is
related to the currency because when you look at what's going on in terms of the
diﬀerence on the top level, i.e. between the 2% in ﬁxed currency and the 7% in nominal or
in ﬂoating currency, you can see that of course that is signiﬁcantly impacted by the drop in
the Norwegian krone. And that is of course the main driver here related both to the top
line and to the technical result.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Hi, yes. Sami Taipalus from Berenberg here. Yes, just two things please. First of all, could
you just give a quick comment on the agricultural insurance portfolio that I think you just
said you've got the renewal rights from Codan?
Then the second thing, you mentioned about the motor average premium already and
the slow progress in that, but actually if you look at the chart it looks like there's a small
uptick between Q1 and Q4. Admittedly it is very small, but is there anything that's
changed there? Thank you.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think ﬁrstly on the agricultural portfolio, we've seen over the last couple of years that
Codan has stopped writing new agriculture business, and also that they have kicked out
the larger estates and the larger accounts from agriculture. And what we've agreed with
them is that we have taken over the renewal right of their remaining mainly smaller,
medium-sized agricultural portfolio, which is some 1,600 customers that paid a premium

FINAL

of around DKK70 million in Codan. We are taking over only eight employees and we have
to take over customer by customer. So we will not take over the entire portfolio, but we
will renew a large proportion of those customers.
And that process started a bit more than a week ago and is progressing well. And I guess
the industrial logic is that we believe that we can run our small-to-medium-sized
agricultural business at some 5 percentage points lower cost ratio. And as a result of that
we believe that we're able to turn a proﬁt on that portfolio and therefore it makes sense.
But as you can hear from the numbers, it's a fairly small portfolio. It's not something
dramatic that will change our number, but it's a sensible small add-on in a portfolio that is
improving strongly, but is currently selling a bit too little.

Thank you.

And just to add to that, I guess it, as Morten started oﬀ, it also contributes to balancing
our own agricultural portfolio so I think its, overall it ﬁts in very nicely with our business.
Number two, related to the motor average premium, I guess that is perhaps slightly a
hiccup in the graph. You can see that it's down 0.9% in Q1 and it was down 0.7% after Q4.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

But that's a year-on-year number. I guess what I was asking about was the quarter-onquarter number.

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

I don't think it's fair to say that there's an up-tick in terms of the average premium. So I
think we'll just have to look at that.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

It was just on the date on the line in the graph. Okay. Thank you.

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. This is Christian from Nordea in Copenhagen. I think most of my
questions have been answered, but I have two follow up detail questions. First is one of
the change of IT provider and you're now saying that that could lead to extra costs in
2014, but that will still help you reach your below 15% in 2015 target and then you add that
it'll reduce expenses even more. Should this be expected or understood in the way that

2014 will be hit by extra expenses, then there'll be a bit of extra expenses in 2015 and that
it'll be much better later?

FINAL

And the second question is just a reminder, if you could remind me why you increased
the expected level of large claims during the full year? Yes. What was the change that led
to that at the time? Thank you.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I can answer the ﬁrst question and then perhaps you'll have to repeat the second. But I
guess, yes, what I was trying to say is that there will be some additional one-oﬀ expenses
related to IT in 2014 due to the change of IT operations provider. We don't expect any
additional expenses in 2015, and what I was aiming for was really to say that we do think
that that will contribute to lower expectations of expenses in 2016 and beyond. So it will
contribute positively.

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

Your second question was on why we increased the expectation on large claims.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Yes. And that is really due to the exposure in the portfolio and due to the growth in the
Swedish portfolio, and also related to the guarantee book.

Q - Niccolo Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Morning everyone. I have one question on the outlook. Sorry to do so much in the detail
on the wording, but you do mention the 20% ROE as a medium term target. You hadn't
used the word medium term since a while in your outlooks, while you had used the words
at all times for the level of capital that should always be in line with that objective. So I just
wanted to hear your thoughts on whether you still see that as achievable in 2014
speciﬁcally or how we should read these medium term words, if we should be worried
about that at all? Thank you.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

We have made no deliberate change to the wording on that target whatsoever. So if
there's a change in the wording we need to check that. I don't think there is, but if so, it's
not intentional. So we'll check that and you should not read any change in our view on the
20% ROE target at all.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Sorry. I'm bumped in again. I just have a, really a more holistic question. Can I start to
investigate what is your view for Tryg after the savings program is ﬁnished? I know there's
still a good 40% of it to go and we probably in the markets, where we discounted it
already and I understand it's more diﬃcult than just how we see it. But in general, starting
towards the end of 2015 and going forward, what is your view for Tryg? Where do you
want to take this company? Can you spend some words on that?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well I think ﬁrst of all I'm trying to ﬁgure out if this is a friendly overall question or if you're
trying to trick us into giving new data on savings after 2015. But I guess it's fair to say that
until 2015 we have our program to take the cost below 15%. We have our program to
target the DKK1 billion eﬃciency measures which we are conﬁdent that we will reach. And
clearly as we're getting closer to 2015 we are spending more time internally debating
what is the target to follow those targets.
And I guess longer term we don't see that the development on reducing costs and
professionalizing claims will stop with the current measures. We expect to set new targets
for that. And also we expect to make sure that we get the beneﬁt from the current work on
price diﬀerentiation to make sure that we both continue to improve the quality of our new
customers and therefore the claims ratio, but also reach a more stable development on
the top line. But I think you can expect that when we have new targets to talk about,
capital markets day is a likely set-up to do such a discussion so at some point you should
expect that to be called.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Thank you. I didn't want to trick you in any way, Morten. Thanks.

Hi. Daniel Do-Thoi here again. Just one quick follow-up question on the large losses. Just
going through your report I can see that you mentioned that of your roughly DKK200
million in large losses that you reported, just over DKK100 million came from the Danish
part of the portfolio. I'm just trying to see, well, ﬁrst of all, if that's correct.

And second of all, where the remainder came from. Was it largely in Norway or in
Sweden? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Yes, I tried to give a brief overview of that earlier as well, Daniel. But it's, yes, it is in
particular one signiﬁcant claim in the Danish portfolio. It's one signiﬁcant claim in the
Norwegian portfolio. Then there's a number of smaller claims and they are deriving from,
some from the guarantee businesses, some from Sweden, some from Norway and some
from Denmark. So it's scattered round really.

Q - Daniel Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Alright. Thanks very much.
