Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Direct Line Group Q1 Trading Update and now I will
hand you over to your host, Penny James to begin.
Penny, please go ahead.

Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Thanks Kathy. Good morning everyone and welcome to our first quarter update. Now it's
only been I think eight weeks since we presented the full-year results. But Neil and I
wanted to take the opportunity to kind of give you an update on how Q1 trading has gone
and just as importantly, our operational progress through the first quarter as well. I'm
going to leave plenty of time for questions. But first, I just want to run through what I see
is the three key messages from Q1.
So firstly, though most markets continue to be impacted by lockdown restrictions in Q1,
but there are signs that pricing has stabilized during April, and we are well placed as
consumer behavior normalizes. So, with the first quarter in kind of full lockdown claims
trends in Q1 were in line with those that we talked about at the full year results with claims

FINAL

frequency reduced as we've seen in previous lockdowns and severity remaining higher
than normal.
So, we have seen frequency pick up a little bit in April as lockdown restrictions started to
ease, but it still remains well below pre-pandemic levels. Now, while those trends have
provided a tailwind earnings, they've also driven more testing market conditions and
that's led to an acceleration in market premium deflation in the quarter, as the market
took a range of views I think on the trajectory of claims frequency going forward for the
rest of the year.
And that's been exacerbated by continued lower risk mix due to fewer new car sales and
fewer new drivers entering the market. So, against that backdrop, we've maintained our
disciplined underwriting. Against a non-COVID comparative from 2020, we saw a 10%
drop in motor gross written premium, which is broadly in line with the markets.

Bloomberg Transcript

But what we have focused on protecting the quality of the book with average premiums
reduced by 5% against Q1 2020, compared with the market reduction of around 8%. So,
as we progress through the year and claims frequency increases towards normal levels,
we expect the heightened claims severity to put upwards pressure on premiums. It's not
surprising, therefore to see in our latest market data that April prices were flat on March,
so having protected the quality of our book we remain well placed as the market
recovers.
My second message is that we continue to build momentum in areas that are less
impacted by the pandemic, with strong growth in both Home and Commercial. In Home,
the new business markets remain buoyant and we've delivered growth in own brand
policy counts and premiums, driven by strong trading in both direct and PCW channels
and the commercial business has had an incredibly strong quarter, delivering over 15%
premium growth in both direct and broker channels despite the strong comparative.
In NIG, the 16% GWP growth was across all categories, it's the best first quarter growth in
over 10 years, reflecting improved pricing sophistication and it follows on from the
excellent customer service maintained throughout the pandemic disruption and within the
16% rate carry was around 6%. Commerical Direct grew premiums by 15%, as tradesman
landlord and van under the DL brand all delivered premium growth through a combination
of policy count and strong rate carry. While Churchill Business has had a record-breaking
quarter across all its products delivering 75% GWP growth year-on-year.
At the full year, we said commercial was the furthest along its transformation journey and
as you can see from the numbers, it's yielding great results, which is both exciting when
you look across the personal lines, but also reflects the continued focus and investment in
the SME segments. Our third message is this. We've continued to make great progress
on our transformation to be a data and technology enabled insurer, while building on our
existing strengths. The roll out of our new Motor platform is almost complete, we're now
live on all brands and all channels with Churchill fully live and Direct Line following fast
behind.

FINAL

I'm really pleased with the latest roll out the Churchill new business, we've completed in
just 4 weeks, a clear sign that we're delivering at pace, and this is a crucial step towards
delivering the improvements in our trading as well as unlocking of operating efficiencies.
It's still early days in terms of the rollout but we're already seeing some of the benefits of
the new system come through for Churchill which is incredibly encouraging and testament
to the broad transformation agenda.
We've also expanded our own garage repair network with the acquisition of our 22nd
auto services repair center, helping us expand our market leading claims capabilities
further, and this will become increasingly important as customers start driving again.
(inaudible) full-year results for 2021 was a pivotal year in our transformation journey and
I'm really delighted with the progress we've already made this year and we're only a third
of the way through.
So overall then, how do I feel about Q1 and the business going forward? Well, we've
made great progress, our move to system is almost complete and the benefits are
starting to come through. Most market prices have recently stabilized and we continue to
take share in both Home and Commercial. Today, we've demonstrated that we're
building an increasingly competitively advantaged business for future sustainable growth
and we reiterate our existing targets.

Bloomberg Transcript

As lockdown restrictions ease and with our transformation program on track, I feel the
business is well positioned heading into the next trading period. Now, I am going to leave
it there in terms of comments, but I'll hand back to Kathy to open the line for questions.
Thanks Kathy.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you Penny. (Operator Instructions) So first, we have a question from Jonathan
Denham from Morgan Stanley. Jonathan, please go ahead.

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

Thanks very much. Hi Penny, Hi Neil, thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, what's made
you confident enough to remove the caveats around the 93 to 95 normalized combined
ratio range for this year on the medium term. And secondly, just how do you feel about
your expense ratio target given the pressure you're seeing on top line and what are the
additional actions you could take on cost if required? Thank you.

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Thanks Jon. Why don't I take the first one and Neil can take the second one. Look, we've
had a strong quarter earnings wise, we are kind feeling more positive about the overall
economic environment and the position the UK is in generally in terms of vaccine rollouts
and so on so forth. We're through Brexit as well and that seems to have gone from the
most market perspective relatively cleanly. So, a number of factors kind of been around
Page 3 of 19



Company N ame: Direct L ine I nsurance Group PL C
Company Ticker: DL G L N Equity
Date: 2021-05-05

for some time -- are kind of moving backwards if you like. So, as we look at how we
started the year, we felt positive about reiterating the 93 to 95 and some of those
cautions and uncertainties felt lower down the radars than they were before, hence the
fact that we've adjusted the wording very slightly.

FINAL

So yeah, I think you would add on that on pickup expenses?

A - Neil Manser

{BIO 5571223 <GO>}

Yeah great Penny, let me take the question and thanks Jon. So I think as I said at the full
year I'm increasingly confident hitting our 20% expense ratio and I don't think anything in
Q1 has changed that. In fact, actually we've had some good progress during the first
quarter and Penny has mentioned the motor system launch which is faster than expected
through this quarter. So that gives us confidence on the --- and that gives us to generate
sustainable cost reduction through that process as good.

Bloomberg Transcript

We've also making progress on the property reorganization. We talked about at the full
year and then a huge number of other initiatives going on across the group and as we've
said before, we won't stop looking and people going keep on challenging ourselves on
the right things to do -- even if it doesn't -- that doesn't kind of market will keep on
challenging ourselves. And I think the other thing we're saying is that the -- and obviously,
the ratio is a function of both cost and revenue and as you've seen in this set of numbers,
where we have made transformational change, you're seeing growth come through as
you've seen that in commercial and that gives us confidence for where we're making
change in other parts of the group will see the growth, which also support those expense
ratio ambitions.

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

Okay. That's very clear. Thank you very much mate.

A - Penny James

Q - Freya Kong

{BIO 20097488 <GO>}

Hi, can you hear me. Sorry?

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Hi, yes we can.

Q - Freya Kong

{BIO 20097488 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. Two questions please. Could you guys give us some quantitative steer
on what sort of frequency benefits that you saw in Q1, would you be tracking ahead of the
car 93% to 95% combined ratio target. And secondly just on expenses again, so you guys
previously guided to less than GBP700 million in 2021. But last year you said that was at
risk, how are you tracking now versus that target? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

What if I put frequency and then I'll hand off to Neil for expenses. So frequency would be - as in the previous lockdowns clearly there has been a lot more driving on the roads and
that has driven kind of reduced frequency, what we saw is with close last year is in Q2
frequency was down to maybe one-third of what it normally is, maybe broadly and it crept
up as we move through the year and then reduced a little as we came into the lockdown,
Q4. Down again (Technical difficulty)

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen. So, we currently lost connection with the speaker's line and please
wait for a moment and the call will resume shortly. Hi Penny, so you can start to answer the
questions.

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Thanks Kathy. Apologies, we're having technical issues, but I'm not quite sure at which
end. But I think I was halfway through frequency and so broadly what we think, so across
last year a big dip in frequency in Q2 and then carried on creeping up all the way through
the year is of a little bit in Q4, it never go anywhere near pre-pandemic levels and in Q1 it
dropped down again but not as far as it did in Q2 last year but very materially down, so
what does that mean -- it means we saw Q1 with kind of positive earnings compared with
what we would have expected.

FINAL

Otherwise, if you like, that we start the year well, I think in terms of whether we beat 93 to
95, there's a lot of the year still to go, clearly the premiums reduction earnings will start
flowing through at the back end of the year, but we're feeling very confident the range
and we'll see how it traverse through the second half as to whether we beat that within
the track. Neil?

A - Neil Manser

{BIO 5571223 <GO>}

Yes on cost question, so the GBP700 million target we set back at the Capital Markets
Day or 18 months ago. What we've said since then is the COVID did delay or pushed it to
the right, some of the initiatives that we have in place at the time made the targets and
for the full year. I said that we would expect to be on kind of run rate of GBP700 million by
the end of this year. So, if you take that I'd say last year we were 72 it will be at the run
rate at the end of this year expecting cost to be somewhere between the GBP700 million
to GBP772 million we had last year. That makes sense.

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Brilliant. Kathy, we got another question?

Operator
Sure. Now we have a questions from Greig Paterson from KBW. Greig, please go ahead.

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning Greig.

Q - Greig Paterson
Good morning everybody how are you dong. Two questions, one is the FCA pricing of
view has put headwind on motor right for couple of years now. I was wondering how far
we've gone to complete the journey,otherwise will we see right headwind continue for
the remaining three quarters this year and interesting will happen, will we see further rate
headwind next year. And the second one is you carrying very strong positive rate in
commercial. I was wondering if we should expect that to continue for the remaining three
quarters of this year. Thank you.

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Okay. So PPL, I'm not sure they articulated quite the same as you do. So why don't I do
where we are on pricing practices for a second and then reflect what I think is really
happening in the motor market because I'm not sure those 2 things are quite linked to a
view -- you articulate them at the moment. So supporting proud to say, where are we. I
mean, as we said, at year-end. I think we're kind of feeling confident of a preparations
what's happened -- well, how do we feel about ourselves. Well, we think, because the
combination of our diversified business, model, the actions that we've already taken
across the last 3 years also, I mean we were ready, I'm pretty well placed to win in a post
pricing practices market.

FINAL

And we think transformation is all about tailor propositions and market-leading efficiency
and pricing is still the last that the right one and having brands with strong service and so I
want to roll pretty critical in a sort of a market, the potentially has leveled up shopping and
what's happened in PPR, since we lost spoke and a lot of that will not be a huge amount.
The FDA put the timing back, which is still, I mean it's tight but it's much more deliverable
is a cut of possible to achieve it.
Now, I think whereas before it wasn't -- the issuance, so I still expect the rigs to come out
at the end of this month. Am I know from talking to be FCA that really came to hit that
deadline. So I think we'll be doing everything within their power to achieve that. But the
other thing that's happening is we continue to prepare. So whether it's defining internally
how we look at the various value tests, whether it's building the algorithms that I mean we
don't like price out of the 2 -- that isn't compliance or whether it's building the various
optimization models and some of the at the make the choices as we move through that
environment. All of that work, It's going well. Making good progress. So we need to final
guidance to know exactly how we will navigate and how we'll choose another dates
because there still some pretty material questions out that for instance whether we're not
non-cash incentives are allowed, we as well some others are anyway trailing Amazon to
Brazil and so forth in the market to see what the responses.
So we prepare the ground. So those option and should they still be in the, at the end
legislation, but actually I think if we sit here today, we're confident in our preparations and
we await the final rule. Now in terms of whether you can see that in the market all notes in
price possibly in Home, you can see a bit of it because I think not a lot of inflation going
through in the home markets and certainly for us. Some of that is because we've been
making adjustments on the way on conduct pricing which we flagged before.
And we don't know but we suspect there may be others in the market. So I think in that
market, you can see it. I think the dynamics are different. And what I sort of step back a
little bit Greig, and talk about why, I think we're seeing in the motor market, because I
think the pricing practices is actually only a small, a relatively small component to that at
the moment.
So you know, what I see going on in Q1 and actually through lots late last year. When
you've got reduced claims and clearly an earnings tailwind but it does not reduces the
input costs in the market, quite materially, it's putting pressure on top line rates and our
approach is ever in that period to look out over the duration of the policy frequency and
severity expectations and the price accordingly.
And when we do that, we've ended up with GWP down around 10% pretty much in line
with the market that half volume about half average premium due to pricing reductions
and mix less new cars on the right, that sort of thing. But compared to a market of around
8% were all 5, so we've given up a bit competitiveness, which you can see in the ISP
dropping by 1% to maintain the quality of the book.
Now what's happening -- now well, I think as we said, our consumer intelligence data
shows the pricing flattened in April in the market. We're putting some price through clearly

Page 7 of 19



Company N ame: Direct L ine I nsurance Group PL C

FINAL

some others in the market putting some price through as well, which is good to see. And
that's not surprising because of the frequency increases through the rest of the year,
which has been the dominant factor I think driving pricing changes over the last sort of 12
months or so as those that frequency picks back up, then the severity inflation that we
know is happening underneath but is currently kind of outweighed by what's happening
on frequency that severity flight inflation will start to show through. I think more clearly.
And I think what you're seeing in the market Greig is that is kind of a large range of pricing
approaches across the market. I think when you read people year end results. You could
sort of see and feel that happening and the reality is data-driven market. We will look back
at historic data and project forward at the moment, it's very difficult to do that with any
certainty. So it's a much more hypothesis let view of what frequency is going to do and I
think that sort of those hypotheses probably creating a greater spread on price signals
normally do, and as we move through the rest of this year. I'd kind of expect to see
people getting more and more data points on what consumer behavior driving behavior is
actually doing.

Bloomberg Transcript

And I think that will narrow the spread about those choices any which way it's frequency
level for the kind of start to normalize whether -- whatever that new normal is.That
severity inflation will start to show through put upward pressure on rates in it.Now as
we've always said, have a claims advantage we've reduced price less than the market. So
we feel pretty good about where we're positioned coming into those changes. I'm pretty
confident. So I think when I sort of reflect back on your question, I apologize. It's a longwinded answer.
I think Greig the fact is around frequency and severity at the moment of stronger than
kind of a positioning in some pricing practices. Just look at the frequency effects site
material, I think, whereas in Home, why you're not seeing those kind of the same scale of
frequency effects, difficult to know who is pricing for what reason by suspect that may be
more -- more sort of pre-PPL planning kind of going on that. Hope that helps and
apologize it's a bit long-winded but.

Q - Greig Paterson
So the second question was on commercial, right, whether we should see the strong -carrying continue for the next three quarters?

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Yeah, I mean, look, you know, we love the SME the market, we think it's got real potential
for growth and strong margins, and that's why we've been investing in it, and so it's really
great to see kind of the results coming through. After all the transformation work on
technology and improved pricing tools and the combination of those coming through.
I think -- what do we, what are we seeing I think certainly at the moment as rates move up
in the commercial market. There are more opportunities coming around and they have
been in recent years. So more business is coming to the brokers, and the brokers are
looking at it and looking out across the market. And I think that's giving us suddenly

Page 8 of 19

Date: 2021-05-05

FINAL

opportunities and I think we are gaining the benefit of having given great service through
the pandemic cannot all of our peers have been able to do that. I think, so we're definitely
winning something that.
I think in terms of what drives that going forward. Well, I think we'll watch with some
interest, how the UK economy emerges from the lockdown from the sort of various
government support measures, but I have to say we found the SMEs and our customers
will be much more resilient than we could have anticipated coming into this. The team
have got lots of ideas. They continue to run at the opportunities. So we still -- we're pretty
optimistic whether it runs at 15% we had don't know, but we're pretty optimistic about the
growth in that space over the coming periods.

Q - Greig Paterson
Thank you.

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Hi.

Q - Thomas Bateman

{BIO 21707516 <GO>}

Hope you guys are doing well. And just on commercial lines and could you just talk about
how you see the addressable market is, how you think -- how big do you think this
business could be on track to meet GBP600 million business possible and just turning to
the additional garages that you acquired in Q1, how many more cars does one new
garage allow you to service and potentially could you remind us of the cost advantage of
service form those vehicles? Thank you.

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

You're going to test the on what the 3 of our new guarantees because they vary quite a
lot is the -- is the honest answer to that, but that varies, with doing something around just
under GBP100,000 back over yet. To give you -- what I can tell you is what new is relative
to the others which good check after this call. But that should give you a feel.

Page 9 of 19

FINAL

And on the cost advantage, is there -- if there is a considerable cost of manage between
our in-house kind of operations and on the rate suppliers, and we know there is a cost
advantage across market because there are various benchmarking tool across the market
available. So we don't give out what that number is because it's commercially sensitive.
But there is definitely a margin that we can see so that's kind of I guess just to give you
some color around that.
Why do you get the balance sheet coming out, there's lots of things that you can do, you
and me and so we can decide at the point of cool whether we write-off. We've got
technology that runs between the repair centers on the claims function of the sort of
point of notification that lets us assess the damage at that point that you can use tools in
AI and order parts from that. So that when it arrives Colorado carriage of the parts already
in ready to go and that reduces the repair time. And so once I told. You can -- we can also
invest in sort of technology understanding cost technology and those repair centers, so
we could meet Technology Center opening in for this year geared at understanding how
to repair and recalibrate technology understand the EV technology, look at how to kind of
advance pain turbines and pain techniques, so that you can contribute towards the Net
Zero targets in terms of repairing cost, all sorts of things.
All of those things other to being really professional operation and being more cost
advantage more effective as there's definitely a benefit and I think is -- you know if that, if
you like or becomes more important volumes in the market start to increase again. So
with that I'll leave it there on car repair centers it's helped the commercial how big -- look,
I mean you know the commercial market is huge. We're significant player at the very small
end of the market already. And that's where we like to play. So we've talked about the
possibility of moving slightly up the scale chain to expand the scale of that market, if you
like opportunity for us. Perhaps sharing that risk with others on routes, if you like. And
we're certainly looking at that, but it still feels to us is there is a significant SME market out
there in our heartlands that we are getting very strong a targeting have a really strong
operation and we think there is plenty to go for. So I'll leave it there, going to put a pound
sign on the market side.

Hi. Good morning. Just two questions from me please. And I could you just maybe some
color in terms of your Motor premium is that from an electric vehicles and how have you

seen that market changing and what have you found through -- preparing for further
growth? And my second question, your buyback so far you've just over GBP30 million and
the looks like it hasn't been both effective to your share price. I mean, would you consider
at the second set, at your half-year results for the second 50 million tranche, would you
probably consider for the year?

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Thanks. Let me do comment on EPS. And then I'll let Neil comment on buybacks and so
forth and so we think we're still a relatively small, small part of the market and the number
only. But it's still a relatively small part. We know we are slightly heavier than other players
in the market. We've had a strong relationship with Tesla, from the get-go and so we
know that well on we kind of run slightly ahead of the market on EVs but I think more
interesting is how you position for us as that market, that market is clearly growing grow
pretty rapidly from here.

Bloomberg Transcript

And why we kind of punch slightly have any -- we do along we've been trying to learn
ahead of any flip -- heavy flip towards EVs. One of the reasons we've opened, you know,
technology center in garages is to enable us to train our engineers and our engineers
suppliers and those human vehicles more broadly on the new technologies, because
actually the repair cost profile is different, you get a lot of additional you're increasing
using that cause.
All of those things affect repair costs and times and we took the view that wasn't the
expertise in the market and not -- so we need to build that in-house, which is what we
have done to prepare the way for that. So that's really how we're viewing kind of that
overall I think and also doing a bit try and work, how we can help that transition work
successfully across the UK, not just as an insurer -- an insurer of those vehicles, but as a
sort of corporate in the space. So we work with a number of other companies to try and
see if we can find a way to make that transition smooth so we stay close to it. It clearly has
a slightly different risk profile that we're getting used to. But, yeah, that's where the future
lies.

A - Neil Manser

{BIO 5571223 <GO>}

On the buyback, yes, you're right, we're about GBP30 million through the first GBP50
million tranche buyback like you still think is the right way to go and in fact, I'd say we're
getting a better return assessment today on the shares. They were installed buyback. So,
I think is the right thing to continue.

Right. So first question is the various pricing, so they show. I mean the ABI I think minus 8%
year-on-year, but the ones that are more orientated towards new business pricing seem
to be off sort of 10% up to 14%, is that something you recognize that the pricing gap
between new and renewal pricing has actually widened over the last 12 months, despite
the FCA new guide?
Well, the new rules that they're are looking to introduce. And then the second question is,
I'm thinking about the transformation program on Churchill and Direct Line, how should we
be thinking about what we should watch how what which sorry, let me start again what
should we be looking for precisely in terms of the benefits of that coming through in the
motor accounted Churchill and Direct Line over the remainder of the year?

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Okay. So market statistics. So, yes, I think some of the PCW market statistics suggesting
kind of 14% or something like that. And I think there's probably two things going on in
there Oliver. One is, yeah, the new business markets being testing, if you like. So I will
take the heat then the renewals market, I think you can, you can certainly see some of
that happening, I think all of feel some of that happening, and that's why we lost a bit
competitiveness and that's why I kind have come off a little bit because we've drawn draw
a line in a slightly different place to some others it looks as though.
I think the other thing you have to watch though about those statistics is there is a mix
factor in them isn't stripped out. So when you losing kind of new costs from the market in
particular young drivers from the market because they can't come into the market. Whilst
that has a pretty muted effect on the overall book when you include renewals and so on
the ABI, that has a more marked effect on new business on the new business market in
relative terms. So I expect those some recognize the 14th and 15th and so on so forth,
absolutely. But I think you should be a bit wary of believing that the automatic price
coming out on a risk-adjusted basis, if you like. I think that number is new, the ABI sort of
space. So that's about 1 and then in terms of transformation.

Yeah, the benefits come through in layers at different times what I mean by that. So those
of you who made the trip to Doncaster you may remember, just talking about the
transformation and what it delivers in terms of pricing benefits and how it works and one
of the things we talked about there is the fact that on our own models you had kind of
your pricing model and then you had to translate it almost twice to get it actually into the
market and deployed, and then those translations lost a little granularity that was
intended from the original model. So just by switching on new business that benefit starts
to come through and so, if you like, the intention of your original pricing tool is deployed
much more accurately into the market. So, let's benefit one I think then there are other
benefits that come through in pricing which can come through our available to you
relatively immediately. So what do I mean by that?

Bloomberg Transcript

You're able to bring in new sets of pricing data that we were more restricted on the full
you can effect pricing changes faster in the market, then we could have done before, you
can bring product, new product tweaks and changes and enhancements on more
straightforwardly faster and more cost effectively than before. So there are a number of
things that as things evolve that enables us to maneuver faster if you like, and that may
well be important as we come into pricing practices where nobody will know on day one,
exactly where the market is going to land. So actually big flexible the maneuverable. It's
going to be a pretty key thing and then you will see, then on top of that, you've got what
it could be operating efficiencies and in that space, you get some benefit straight away as
the book builds up the calls, even run cost the garages and those sorts of things.
But actually the big benefit through around headcount reduction, the call if you don't have
to do as much activity and selling it sort of operational stuff behind the scenes and those
costs effectively reflected in the 2 sites, adjustments we closures or reductions that we
talked about at the year-end result, year ago. So reducing in Manchester and closing the
IP switch and effectively 700 roles, we talked about that the effective of the new platform
rolling through largely and that kind of builds up as the volume of policies build up every
year.
So you should start to watch for those kinds of expense benefits and you should watch for
either strengthening loss ratio in current year loss ratio improvements all depending on
where the market cycle is you might -- we might deploy that integrated in terms of the -basically should see that.

Good morning. I had a question on time. It looks that last year, you lost a little bit of policy
count and the premium growth, a bit the high market, it doesn't seem to the case
anymore, are you done with the sort of fine-tuning prior to the FCA pricing review in
Home and then my second question just goes back to the merchant pricing environment,
last year, pretty stellar result throughout the industry this year will probably still be a pretty
good results. It appears that some companies are the prudent reserves, why is there a
case that maybe the market will be softer, given the fact that, and then maybe with a bit
of over-earning of the past 18 months, getting them? Thank you.

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Okay. And so I think the -- well, over the year end we were sort of saying, we keep
increasing sort of guarantee less, so broadly because the average premiums stopping is
a lot of the growth is coming from a price comparison site and from memory from
redirect was pretty flat.
At that point. So what's been happening over the last quarter, while new business sales
on own brand dropped about 14% retentions up as well. The market is pretty points and
you can see that in the news that how sales and so on and so forth. So the home market
remains pretty buoyant April. So April kind of premiums up 3.6%, I think cost piece, around
5 year on year. So you're seeing growth, if you're seeing quite strong growth in direct but
stronger still growth in price comparison site business.
So what's going in well, sure, we're being kind of competitive on price, we're marketing
pretty hard as well, we, we've had some good deals running I think that with some of the
price comparison. So it's kind of running on all cylinders, if you like. You've seen average
premium coming off by around 3.5% I think and some of that is kind of pricing actions.
So there's still, we still continue to have some pricing actions in the market to be
competitive, but also a little bit of stuff going on around what we call our contract pricing
which is as we've always said we keep tightening the tails and tightening the process
continues, and will continue, all the way through the year. But probably the biggest effect

and the average premium is the channel mix effect, which has been kind of happening for
a couple of years now.
So I think when you look across the market. I think the market's probably not putting a lot
of pricing inflation through at the moment. And my guess is, there's a bit of a mixture
there is some lower input costs. So claims have been down through the various lockdowns
and so people maybe anticipating that continuing for a while with home working
continuing to many and so on so forth. So you may be seeing some of that you may be
seeing a little bit of positioning difficult to tell what you know what choices, people are
making and for us, you're seeing a bit of channel mix as well going on. So, that's a little bit
of I think in the home market.

Q - Sachin Lakhani

{BIO 17270003 <GO>}

Sorry, I just on your own brand growth you say a bit more competitive now at the end of
the year. What does that do to your back, but then if you're being a bit more capacity on
the new business?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

But I think it's too, bit in the sort of back book story. Well 3 if you include partner brands in
there, but two main business, one is what's happening in the tails and we said for some
time now. But we've been at the 5-year 10-year checking every policy that we're
comfortable that the margins that we're writing where appropriate, we're happy with
those and so we've been kind of happy with our position for some time and that will be
overall value offering in the product and that tailed kind of still we tightened, but for us we
feel is pretty much there.
Obviously it will be FCA pricing review does, it's more than that, though, it says any pricing
step ups basically through that period that our risk-based needs to come out. So we still
got a leveling up process to do over the first handful of years, I think it's very little, have
advantage and people running into that flat if you like. So I'd be surprised if you see a
huge amount of that happening in the market. I think you can see the old product out
there, where people are starting to put product out that does that. And so I think you'll
see on day one of pricing practices. I would be surprised if there wasn't, still a leveling
process that has to happen across the market on those early years people may be in
different places on the journey that on what I would call the tails in the out years. Okay.
And the second question has completely escaped me now I'm sorry about that. Can you
remind me?

Q - Sachin Lakhani

{BIO 17270003 <GO>}

Okay. And yes, is on the most pricing environment, they're sort of people has ground in
the last 18 months and reserves sort of quite region as well. It does not just soft in the
size, the longer this summer?

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

I think this is all about. I really think this is all about and who costs really driven by input
costs. So, the materiality of the shift of frequency is outweigh kind of pretty much anything

else if you like in terms of scale and I think the -- I personally think the key indicator is
where people will be assuming that freight, -- that motor frequency ends up and so we
are certainly looking closely at outwards but the behavior of our driver, our customers are
doing, but also some of the indicators around what the economy will doing. How much
work from home people will be doing, what whether it's likely to be a staycation or
European holiday year all of those things I think as a dominant -- it's certainly, I was thinking
we don't -- when we look at pricing look back at how much money we made in Motor in
months that's what we can reinvest in price. It's just not how we think about it. We look
forward of what we think the input cost on the policy we'll pay what margins we need to
make. And how competitive the market is in that context, and that's how we make our
price includes can't speak for the decisions other make, but I still believe that the biggest
single implements here.I t's what's going on in claims costs today and over the
forthcoming year.

Sure. So now we have a question from Alexander Evans from Credit Suisse. Alexander.
Please go ahead.

Q - Alexander Evans

{BIO 19956412 <GO>}

Hi good morning. Hi Neil. Good morning. Just first one maybe just on the sort of risk mix
angle that you talked about for -- is it possible to give a stare on how much is related to
sort of the closing of the economy. None of these new drivers relative to how much of
that changes, is it related to what's being pass through on frequency. And then secondly,
if I just look on quarter-on-quarter, it looks like your Motor Gross written premium is
actually up 1% versus what we're seeing in the market with various indices saying sort of
down 6% or even 15%. So is it possible just to give a little bit of an explanation of this, and
if you're seeing sort of improvement there quarter-on-quarter?

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

I'm just puzzling on the last question. Let's do the first one, because I think could follow
that one. And it comes all kind of what's going on GWP and so we got a 1% fall about half
of that is volume, about half of that is average premium and very broadly it's split slightly
to put -- but very broadly, I'd go about half of that probably risk mix and that's kind of pure
pricing effects, you'll be within 0.5%, either way, I suspect if you do that, but that's the kind
of shape. Neil, because you followed the numbers better than I did on the second part of
the question?

Yes, I think if you're comparing Q1 most the Q4 Motor premium and you're right, is up
slightly on Q4. I wouldn't overread too much because Q4, it tends to be a slightly lower
quarter at market premium at the market level then the other quarters.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, Penny, Good morning, Neil. Just one question I have
actually. I mean, you mentioned on the FCA review that there is not much happening on
the motor side at the moment. Whereas it feels like people have started adjusting on the
home side, I mean what are you doing at the moment. I mean, how much have you
adjusted either your pricing or your expectations around FCA what would be your base
case expectation where we are going towards would be some good, a good reminder
for us. Thank you.

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Look, I mean, I think in motor I've been clear also could is on a frequency severity and so
once they just to remind that we don't yet know what the PPR will roll off. So we don't
actually know how to trade that through the market because we didn't know what the
lines. You know that the FDA wants us to check, so we can do some directional stuff which
and remember the kind of biggest issue area from the FCA review is home. So it's home
and motor included in. But in terms of the historic back books and some of them because
of the stickiness of accounts, home is the area that kind of with the Motor issues.
And so, when I say we've been public, all the way all about what we are doing in the
home, but to make sure that we are dealing with the tails of that we continue to do so. I
can't tell you I don't have much insight as to what other people are doing in the market
and how they construct their prices. But all I would say is that doesn't look to be a lots of
inflation going through the Home book at the moment on that maybe people adjusting
pricing, it may be, it may be simply that there were less a few less claims coming through.
So I don't know if the company or others are doing. I can't speak for others are doing
directly and why they're making the pricing choices, they are.
So yes, clear what we've done on Home and we continue to take that path. We think in
the long run, the book will be stickier post PPR. So we see little downside in the market at
the moment about being competitive ahead of that as long as our long-term tails moving

Good morning. Just a quick question around the rebates, you've been providing in the
motor market since the second quarter of last year. Could you maybe highlight your plans
of unwinding these rebates is this one on one with mileage driven or is there something
else, I need to think about and how sticky do you think these rebates will be in the
remaining in the remainder of the year. Thank you.

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Yeah. We've offered what have we done it. So over the course of the middle of last year,
coming to the exact date actually we offered. Pretty much all our customers a rebate we
gave all those numbers are a kind of a year-end, but what have we done as we've come
into this year. We have done 2 things, one is we've made it permanently possible for DL
customers to flex that mileage through sort of mileage proposition.
And so we see that as part of the DIRECT strategy, if you like I talked before about
tailoring product individuals. Some of that is having components, a product like we do in
garages where you can tailor around someone's business, some of that is increasing
creating what sort of more modular product to the personal line space. But actually
people being able to tailor their own motor policy around the rebates. We consider that
something that is entirely appropriate and consistent with the brands, so that a kind of
permanent offering maybe 10% 15% of the book is taken that up, something like that.
We've also offered because of the lockdown and because of the fact that the then they
don't have that kind of proposition. We've also offered some of our Churchill customers
and PCW customers refund opportunities if you like of the opportunity. So take refund I
think it's appropriate through the lockdown and this was something like GBP1.6 million has
been refunded on that.

As a result, and around I think 300,000 is going to charity, we give the charity option as
well when we do that. So that's sort of the scale of the refunds overall, I think.
