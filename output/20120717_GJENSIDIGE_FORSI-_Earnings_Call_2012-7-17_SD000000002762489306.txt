Welcome to this presentation of the ﬁrst half year and the Second Quarter results for
Gjensidige. My name is Janne Flessum and I'm Head of IR. This time our CEO, Helge Leiro
Baastad, will start with presenting headlines for the Second Quarter, before our CFO,
Catharina Hellerud gives you some more details on the ﬁnancials for the ﬁrst half year and
the Second Quarter. Then we'll follow up by a Q&A session.
Before we start I would like to remind you that the presentation can be downloaded from
our website, gjensidige.com and then I'll leave the word to CEO, Helge Leiro Baastad.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Janne. Before I will comment on the Second Quarter ﬁgures I would start to
tell you that in the webcast presentation today we showed some (diﬀerence) in the
Norwegian market now and it was advertising related to the company-speciﬁc and unique
customer dividend concept. So we are really glad that our main shareholder, Gjensidige
Foundation is investing a substantial amount in this year's dividend campaign. The
investment will continue after the summer and hopefully it will continue in the next years
to come as well. And of course, from our perspective this is extremely important for our
future competitiveness in the Norwegian market.
Then I will take you through some comments on page three in the presentation. The proﬁt
before tax in the Second Quarter was NOK1,218m, and this is ﬁrst and foremost driven by
another historically strong underwriting result of NOK719m. The combined ratio was
83.9% and compared to last year it was 86.1%. This is especially strong taking the higher

proportion of large losses into consideration; that aﬀected our combined ratio
3.4percentage points more than the Second Quarter last year.

FINAL

It's also satisfying underlying premium growth. We reported a premium growth of 0.9%
but if we adjust for the Norwegian motor association agreement we had several years with
NAF and currency in the Danish kroner towards Norwegian kroner, the underlying
premium growth was 3%.
And it's also interesting to see that we had strong development once again in the Baltics.
As you'll remember, before the ﬁnancial turmoil it was more than 50% total market growth
and this Second Quarter we had almost 50% premium growth in the Baltics.
We had a strong loss ratio of 68.5% despite then more large losses compared to last year
as commented, and also despite more large losses than expected this year.
We continue with strong cost discipline, 15.4% cost ratio and if we compare those cost
ratios, last year was 15.9% -- 15.8%, yes, but we had a number of cost reduction and we
continue as I said with strong cost discipline.

Bloomberg Transcript

The Retail Bank and Pension and Saving businesses showed a solid improvement with a
total increase in proﬁts of more than 8% Second Quarter compared to last year.
And ﬁnally also comment, the investment income, the return on the investment portfolio
was NOK494m, obviously aﬀected to a certain extent by the unrest in the ﬁnancial
markets we have seen during the quarter with the return of 0.9%.
So this gives annual return on equity so far this year of 22.8% before tax expense which
we comment as a very satisfactory return on equity.
On page four I'll give you some comments related to the segments. Adjusted for the NAF
agreement, the Private segment reported good growth in earned premiums, up to 2.5% in
the Second Quarter, and it's not so many years since we had loss ratios (on a par with) the
combined ratio of 76.1% that the Private segment delivers this quarter.
We have been working systematically, as you know, on customer and risk selection for a
long time which has resulted in good quality in the customer portfolio and excellent
proﬁtability.
Customer retention is priority number one for us and we had a trend shift in the Second
Quarter, net customer growth for the ﬁrst time in several years, I think we have to go back
to 2006 to see a positive development in net customers as we have seen in the Second
Quarter. This is actually a main takeaway from this presentation, the trend shift in the
Private line in Norway.

FINAL

The combined ratio of 76.1% in the Second Quarter is also very strong, so the combination
of underlying premium growth of 2.5% with a combined ratio of 76.1% and we shouldn't
go many years back to ﬁnd loss ratios at this level. And if you combine this with this trend
shift we have a very solid position within the Private segment.
On the Commercial side, the Commercial segment is working on professionalism in the
multi-channel model. A good year after implementation we have succeeded in turning
the decline in portfolio premiums into growth. We have a Corporate Center that serves
more customers than before with 18% fewer employees within the same service
parameters. The cost ratio was a sound 11.8% in the quarter.
The goal of proﬁtability over growth remains unchanged and in the Second Quarter this
has resulted in us letting two big agreements go, one with accounting eﬀect from the
Second Quarter and one with accounting eﬀect from the Third Quarter. Despite the loss
of some large customers, the company's competitiveness is regarded as good in the large
customer segment and there is high activity in terms of new subscriptions.

Bloomberg Transcript

Another main takeaway is actually the proﬁtability development in the Nordics. We have
long been working on portfolio adjustments and price measures in the Nordic segments,
work that is still ongoing, and this work precedes good results in the First Quarter and the
ﬁgures for the Second Quarter conﬁrm that we now have a good grip on the Nordic
operations which delivered a combined ratio of 85.2%. What we have done actually is to
implement more or less the Gjensidige way also in the Nordic segment.
Going forward, it's absolutely more to do, to implement new tariﬀs both in the
Commercial segment and in the Nordic segment, we have commented that before, that
the combined ratio in the Private line in Norway, with the strong combined ratio of 76.1%
is, one signiﬁcant explanation for that is the new tariﬀ implementation in Norway.
And ﬁnally Pension and Savings. As you know there were many players who wanted to
earn money on deﬁned contribution unit-linked pensions when the new law on
mandatory occupational pensions entered into force in 2006. And as you also know,
players have slowly but surely dropped out while Gjensidige has achieved an increasingly
strong position in this market. And as you can see on page four, we have a market share
of 8.3% measured by Assets under Management. In other words, we have a strong
position in an exciting, growing market.
I'll comment the bank loan commissions ﬁnally today but going forward we are positive to
the second proposition from the bank loan provision. We do not have any challenging
history within our Pension and Savings business, we have a cost eﬀective model and it's a
scalable model, so going forward we can see Gjensidige taking a broader position within
future pensions by our own Pensions and Savings business.
The next page, page ﬁve, is also an important and main takeaway from our presentation
today, it's just to remind you of our overall combined ratio target, and over time our goal
is to have an annual combined ratio in the corridor between 90 and 93. That said, you are
well aware that the Nordic General Insurance is very much about weather and the weather
Page 3 of 15

FINAL

is the most important single factor that can move the combined ratio outside this target
level, both on the down side and upside. But we believe that an annual combined ratio
target of 90 to 93 over time is ambitious. So this year, of course, we report 83.9%
combined ratio Second Quarter and our combined ratio year to date is 86.1%. So surely
we are signiﬁcantly under the corridor of 90 to 93, but it is important for me to, once
again, say that over time our goal is to have this annual combined ratio in the corridor of
90 to 93.
Within General Insurance it takes time before implemented measures are reﬂected in the
ﬁgures. The combined ratio level, as you can see in the ﬁgure on a rolling annual basis
has shown a downward trend in recent years and this is the result of many diﬀerent
measures, such as the risk pricing and selection, cost control programs, increased
automation and centralization. In combination with the combined ratio in the corridor
between 90 and 93 and our expectation that more of our competitors will have to
increase their prices more than us, this means that we expect to increase our
competitiveness in the time ahead. And you saw the trend shift in the Private segment in
Norway in the Second Quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

And ﬁnally, on this page, it's important to point out that we still have to be disciplined and
take on risk at the right price. Our premium increases are currently in line with expected
claims inﬂation which is in Norway for motor and house and contents between 4% and
5%.
At the same time as we are adapting our prices to the market to some extent in attractive
segments our best customers will pay lower increases in premiums. We believe that we
have been ahead of, as I said, our competitors in implementing necessary price increases
and making adaptions and that we now are in a strong position to oﬀer the right
customers a competitive price in addition to the competitive terms they have always had.
So what I'm actually saying here, to sum up, over time the annual combined ratio should
be in the corridor between 90 and 93. Weather can be the most important single factor
that can moved combined ratio outside this target level which we have seen so far this
year. We have started with price increases early and we have implemented more or less in
all the Private segments in Norway new tariﬀs, we are going to implement more in the
Private segments, we are going to implement more in the Commercial segment and even
also into the Nordic segment. So in sum this also means that we can increase our
competitiveness in the quarters going forward.
And that was my actually introduction and I pointed out some main takeaways which I
hope you take with you. So Catharina, please.

Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Thank you. We are, in this quarter, as well, very pleased with the results of our operations,
both Insurance operations as well as Banking and Pensions and Savings, and also what we
regard as an acceptable return on our investments portfolio.

FINAL

As you can see on slide seven, all segments show an improvement in ﬁnancial
performance in relation to the corresponding period last year, both for the ﬁrst half year
and for the Second Quarter seen in isolation.
The insurance results for the quarter ended at a solid NOK719m, up by NOK104 million
compared with the corresponding quarter last year. While the business areas, Pensions
and Savings and Banking, in total increased their proﬁt before tax expenses by 86% in the
quarter. This in addition to an acceptable return of the investment portfolio gave our
proﬁt before tax expense of NOK1.2 billion for the quarter and NOK2.6 billion for the ﬁrst
half year.
Turning to page eight you can see that earned premiums increased by 0.9%i in the
quarter with good underlying growth in all segments.
Private shows a decrease in earned premiums of 1.2% in the quarter; however, adjusted
for the agreement with NAF concerning breakdown insurance which amounted to NOK75
million in the Second Quarter last year, earned premiums increased by 2.5% in the
quarter. The negative trend in relation to the number of customers have been reversed
and we have net growth in customers in the Private segment in the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

And also the positive development in earned premiums continued in Commercial in the
quarter with an increase of 0.5%.
The Nordic segment had a growth of 1% in earned premiums in the quarter and this is a
good result given that restructuring and re-pricing of the portfolio is still ongoing,
particularly in the Swedish Commercial market and these this has resulted in the loss of
customers. In addition, there is a negative exchange rate eﬀect of NOK16 million for the
quarter. Adjusted for the exchange rate eﬀect, the growth in earned premiums in Nordic
was 2.8% in the quarter.
And also the positive development of the Baltic insurance market contributed to a
substantial growth in earned premiums in the quarter with a growth of 14.7%.
Turning to page nine, the combined ratio for the quarter ended at a strong 83.9%. Of this
ﬁgure, the cost ratio was 15.4% and the loss ratio was 68.5%. Better customer selection
and more precise re-pricing is contributing to a good underlying development. In
addition, we still have a favorable frequency development for the most important claim
types within motor insurance and the same applies also to the property products.
On the other hand, the loss ratio was negatively aﬀected by a large proposition of large
losses this quarter than in the corresponding quarter last year.
If you turn to page 10 you can see that the large losses in the quarter have an eﬀect on the
combined ratio of 6.4percentage points compared with the expected 4.6percentage
points. The large losses mainly occurred in the Commercial Norway segment. When
claims are higher than NOK30 million the exact amount is charged to the Corporate

Center which therefore also had higher large losses this quarter than the corresponding
period last year.

FINAL

For the ﬁrst half, on the other hand, large losses had an eﬀect on the combined ratio of
4.2percentage points, somewhat lower than the expected value of 4.7.
If you turn to page 11 you can see that we had run-oﬀ gains for the quarter that are more
or less in line with the run-oﬀ gains in the corresponding period last year, with a positive
eﬀect on the combined ratio of 2.3percentage points compared with the 2.4percentage
points in 2011. Developments in the Norwegian Accident and Health products are still
positive and the Occupational Injury portfolio in the Nordic segment is also showing a
positive development, in addition to a few large losses being adjusted down.

Bloomberg Transcript

On page 12 you can see that the cost ratio was 15.4% in the quarter. The positive
development in nominal operating expenses continued in the quarter with a reduction of
NOK55m; however, a substantial part of the positive development is due to adjusted
calculation of indirect claims customer costs as from the Fourth Quarter 2011. This eﬀect
amounts to NOK41 million on the Group's -- or equates to 0.9% on the Group's cost ratio
in this quarter. Adjusted for this, there is still an underlying reduction in the nominal
expenses, also the slight increase accruals for bonuses in the period, which you know
accrue more evenly through the year.
On page 13 you see the illustration showing how much capital is allocated to the
operational segments. The allocation to the General Insurance segment is based on
calculations carried out in Gjensidige's internal model. The total capital allocated to the
operational activities is unchanged in the quarter; it amounts to NOK7.4 billion at the end
of the quarter.
Turning to page 14, the asset risk has been reduced from NOK4.3 billion at the end of the
First Quarter to NOK3.8 billion at the end of the Second Quarter and this reduction is
largely due to the reduction in the market value of (inaudible) and (FM) Bank. In addition,
also to some smaller investment portfolio now that the dividend for 2011 has been paid.
In this quarter, it is still the rating requirement from the S&P the A rating, that it's the most
binding of the three capital requirements. Taking account of these capital requirements,
this (technical diﬃculty) capital amounts to NOK3.3b, a reduction of NOK1.4 billion from
the previous quarter.
Following discussions with S&P, we have made two changes in relation to previous
practices when we're calculating the capital requirements in the S&P model. The most
important change concerns the treatment of associated companies. Previously, they were
adjusted from book value to market value when calculating available capital and the
capital requirement of 75% so any excess value over and above book value was
calculated. This has now been changed; when calculating available capital, an adjustment
is still made of any excess or shortfall value in addition to the (inaudible). But in addition,
available capital is reduced by a capital requirement corresponding to 27% of the total
market value and this to have a negative eﬀect on excess capita) in the quarter.

The other change concerns the treatment of Norwegian unrated ﬁxed income securities.
They often have an oﬃcial rating from Norwegian brokerage ﬁrms or similar and we have
now gained acceptance for using this rating for Norwegian ﬁxed income securities
instead of having to classify them as unrated investments in the model. This has had a
positive eﬀect on excess capital, as it to some degree compensated part of the ﬁrst eﬀect
that I commented on. Independent of these changes, the negative development in the
market value of the associated companies have, of course, considerably reduced the
excess capital in relation to the situation at the end of the First Quarter.
You should also bear in mind that the interim proﬁts are not included in the S&P model
when calculating available capital. This means that the comprehensive income of NOK1.8
billion after tax expenses for the ﬁrst half of 2012 has not been taken into account in the
excess capital.
Turning to page 15, the investment portfolio totaled NOK54.5 billion at the end of the
quarter and it's divided into three separate portfolios. The match portfolio totaled
NOK31.8 billion at the end of the quarter and it largely corresponds to the Group's
(external) provisions.

Bloomberg Transcript

In geographical terms, most of the exposure, around 80%, is in Norway, Sweden,
Denmark and the Baltic countries. There is still a small exposure in relation to the PIIGS
countries. At the end of the quarter, the amount is NOK191 million and the amount has
been reduced during the quarter as a result of ordinary payments received on maturity.
The free portfolio totaled NOK18 billion and the portfolio mainly consists of interestbearing instruments, equities and properties. The money market portfolio included in the
interest-bearing instrument portfolio has been considerably reduced during the quarter
largely as a result of the payment of dividends for 2011.
There is a somewhat increase in the property exposure due to a couple of new properties
that have been purchased during the quarter. The associated companies have a book
value of NOK4.8 billion at the end of the quarter.
If you turn to page 16, you can see that the total return for the total portfolio was NOK494
million in the quarter, corresponding to a return of 0.9%. For the year to date, the return
on ﬁnancial assets was NOK1.4b, a return of 2.5%.
The match portfolio made a stable contribution with a return of 1% for the quarter.
Included in this item is the eﬀect of the Danish authorities' change of discounting rate in
Denmark relating to workers' comp on June 12. We estimated approximately one-time
eﬀect that day of approximately 7 million (sic; see press release "NOK70").
The proﬁt from associated companies was NOK86m, corresponding to a return of 1.9% in
the quarter and partially this is due to property estimate deviation for (inaudible) from the
First Quarter.

The free portfolio yielded a return of 0.4% during the quarter. Here, in particular, the
short-term shareholding that contributed to reduce the return for the quarter with a
negative return of NOK129m. That's, all in all, an acceptable return on the investment
portfolio, 0.1% for the quarter and 2.1% for the year to date.

Then the last page is some comments regarding the outlook and priorities. First, some
comments regarding international economic situation. Of course, there is still great
uncertainty and several key economies are expecting, or experiencing, ﬁnancial
challenges. And this, of course, creates uncertainty for Gjensidige as well. But it's
important to, once again, say that we have a robust investment strategy, at the same time
as the Group has considerable ﬁnancial strength. And you also have to take into
consideration that we have a high proportion of our business in the Norwegian and
German insurance market.
The macro situation for the Norwegian and German insurance operations is still deemed
to be good, while the economic situation in Denmark is weak. An improvement in the
Danish housing market, in particular, should have a positive impact on the development
of the Company's earned premiums. As you know, we have a signiﬁcant part of the
distribution model related to (inaudible) and real estate chains in the Danish market.

Bloomberg Transcript

The Baltic economies are developing positively and there is reason to expect a continued
positive development in the premiums in this market, going forward.
A second point is that there's still uncertainty attached to the changed regulatory
conditions for the ﬁnancial sector in Norway and internationally. The EU is continuing its
work on the Solvency II regulations and we still continue planning and working for
implementation from January 1, 2014, despite speculation about further delays.
Moving to Norway, the Banking Law Commissions Report and proposal for a new law on
group occupational pension insurance in Norway, was submitted at the end of June and it
is expected to enter into force in 2014. The scheme is primarily intended to replace the
current deﬁned beneﬁt schemes.
In Phase III, as you know, the Commission will consider transitional arrangements from
today's deﬁned beneﬁt schemes as well as changes to the act relating to deﬁned
contribution pensions and other acts. It's expected to report in the winter of 2013. And of
course, from other perspective, we are really looking forward to this clariﬁcation from the
Norwegian government.
For Gjensidige, the new pension products can open up new opportunities, as I
commented, to compete in the former BB market. With good transitional arrangements,
this could prove to be an attractive market for us to focus on. And once again, we have no
challenging history. We have a cost eﬀective model and the model we have is scalable.

FINAL

In connection with a revised national budget, the government proposed a new state
agency for the handling of occupational injury claims. Gjensidige has yet to adopt a
position on the proposal but we believe there is a risk that a state agency could lead to
more bureaucracy and longer processing time for our customers without there being
corresponding beneﬁts.
And ﬁnally, in relation to the uncertainty we see around us, Gjensidige has a strong
position, both ﬁnancially and operationally. Our day-to-day focus is on becoming the
most customer-oriented general insurance company in the Nordic countries. We believe
we are well equipped for this competition and we expect to increase our competitiveness,
as I commented during my ﬁrst part of the presentation, in the time ahead. That said, it's
still the principle of proﬁtability overall that governs how we act in the market.

Sorry, hi. Sorry, I had my phone on mute. Thanks a lot. If I'm restricted to one perhaps I
could just come back on Helge's comment at the very start of the presentation where you
were talking about the investment by the Foundation, and I just wanted to clarify when
you said ongoing for many years. Were you referring to just the dividend model being
sustainable for many years in terms of the Foundation returning back its dividend to
policyholders or were you perhaps envisaging whether it would be investing further in
spreading the message? And perhaps you'd just touch on how that message has been
spread at the moment or advertized in terms of what policyholders can expect.

Yes. Peter, as I understood the Foundation, it's to spread their message further. Of course,
in their (inaudible) policy they have been clear that they want to further distribute their
dividend to their members, which is our Norwegian non-life customers, so that's given,
actually. And what they have decided now is to invest in communication to spread this
message in the Norwegian market for this year. And they have also, when they decided
that, said that they hopefully will continue with that in the next years to come, as well.

Hi there, guys. Could you please describe that S&P classiﬁcation calculation? I missed
some of those numbers, if that's possible.

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yes. I'm not quite sure what you meant by the number but I can explain once more about
the change in the model. That's what I talked about on the slide on page 14. So it's two
changes that have been done. One is concerning the treatment of associated companies
and it's about how we calculate the available capital. Previously, what we did was that we
adjusted the available capital based on the market value. Either it was an addition based
on excess value or a reduction based on shortfall value. Then if it was excess value we had
-- there was a capital requirement of 75% of that excess value when you calculate available
capital under the S&P model.
This has now been changed, as I commented. What we do now when we calculate
available capital in the S&P model, is still to adjust for any excess or shortfall value in
relation to book value, but then we also have to reduce the available capital by an amount
corresponding to 27% of the total market value of the holdings S&P -- sorry, the
(inaudible) bank holdings. I hope that was clearer.

the weather has a very signiﬁcant impact on the combined ratio and, of course, in the ﬁrst
two quarters it's been actually quite positive, but now it seems like this has changed and
I'd like to hear some comments about how the weather in the Third Quarter, so far, has
been quite changed. Has that had any impact and should we read this more caution
regarding the weather to the events we've seen especially in Sweden and partly in
Norway in the Third Quarter, as well?

Yes, Matti. It's sun today, actually, in Norway and it's really nice here. Third quarter so far,
start with Sweden, as you know, we have a very small position in the Swedish market. It's
ﬁrst and foremost related to the Stockholm area and it's much (smaller) in that ﬁgures.
We have had some heavy rains in Norway -- the northern part of Norway. It was actually
early this week or -- yes, early this week. What we said during the presentation today is
that it's limited, actually, insurance damages in that area. It's more, for the government,
related to roads and infrastructure, actually, so I do not think we will see that in our ﬁgures
in a signiﬁcant way, at all.

Yes. Good afternoon. Per Gronborg from Danske. A single question; in the (inaudible)
what you addressed life and the new potential revaluation on the Norwegian life quite a
number of times, it seems like your appetite on life -- that you indicate that your appetite
on life is going up. How should we read that? And in this context, of course, it's diﬃcult
not to put focus on your stake in Storebrand if you are able to give me any comments
related to that one.

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Both.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Both. The last question I do not have any question -- answer actually to that.
To the ﬁrst question, as I said, we haven't seen yet the margin picture for the new
products. We have to look more closely into this. But of course, as I said ﬁnally in my
presentation, that can open up new opportunities and, as you saw, we have an 8.3%
market share of the deﬁned contribution market now in Norway. We have a very strong
brand name originally in that the life brand name. We have a scalable model and a good
ICT system and we know that some of our major competitors, they have some ICT
problems due to actually they are struggling with lots of systems. We have one system
and it's scalable, so it can open up.
And of course, if we can see proﬁtability opportunities and good margins and okay
margins, going forward, within this new area, it will also, of course, aﬀect our appetite to
take a bigger stake in the pension market, going forward. We'll come back to the market
with more detailed information regarding eventually if we are going to increase our
appetite within this area.

It seems like you're talking very (inaudible) or your talk is so (inaudible) contribution and
not deﬁned beneﬁt at all.

FINAL

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

No. I'm not talking about deﬁned beneﬁt at all because that's history now. In 2013/14, it
will be history. So what we then will take part in as actually the new pension products
deﬁned by the Bank Law Commission now in June and that's a hybrid. We do not have
the same interest guarantee product. It's -- and the future pension market in Norway, it
will be a combination of asset management, I think, and risk products. It will be diﬀerent
compared to previously.
And I also think that you will see diﬀerent life companies in the future with a completely
diﬀerent cost base to actually -- and some of the two will also drive the cost base in the
life companies down. But we can see that we have a brand name, we have a distribution;
we have competent organization and a scalable model and system. And we can take part
within this area. And I'm not talking about deﬁned beneﬁt because that's history; interest
guarantees is history. We will take part, eventually, in the new products, going forward.

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Sorry, guys, second one. On the Corporate Center large losses, are these largely
commercial relating to this quarter, and did they in the same quarter in the prior year, just
so I can try and get a match up in my underline?

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

It's correct that it's related to the commercial segment in this quarter, that's correct.
(multiple speakers) in excess of NOK30m, the amount excess over NOK30 million is then
moved into the Corporate Center segment.

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

So say a loss was NOK40m, just so I'm clear, it would just be NOK10 million that's moved
into the Corporate Center or would it be the NOK40m?

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

FINAL

No. If the loss is NOK40 million it's NOK10 million that is going into the Corporate Center.
