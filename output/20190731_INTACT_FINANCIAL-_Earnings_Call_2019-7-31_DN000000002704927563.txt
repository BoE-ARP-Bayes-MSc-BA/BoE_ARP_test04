Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining today. Last night, we announced a 4%
increase in the second quarter net operating income per share to a CAD1.44 with strong
investment in distribution results. The combined ratio in Canada was 97.4% and included
4.3 points from an increase in personal auto reserves for prior years. While this was
disappointing, the fundamentals in all lines of business remained strong and hard market
conditions are driving signiﬁcant rate momentum across the country.

Bloomberg Transcript

US commercial performance was solid at 94.8%. In the second quarter, as anticipated, top
line growth accelerated to 8% with strength on both sides of the border. Our Canadian
business grew 8%, led by double-digit growth in commercial lines and accelerating
growth in personal lines at 6%. In the US, premiums grew 10% on a constant currency
basis, driven by new business, strong retention and rate increases.
In Canada, the hard market is not a surprise on the back of 3% industry ROE in 2018.
When we compare ourselves to the industry at the end of the ﬁrst quarter of 2019, we're
outperforming by close to 10 percentage points, almost double our target of 500 basis
points. While we are far exceeding our outperformance target, we remain focused on
returning ROE to the mid-teens.
So let's take a look in more detail at our results by line of business, starting here in
Canada. Personal auto premiums grew 6%, a signiﬁcant increase from the 1% growth last
quarter. Growth was driven by rate increases and a slowdown in unit declines, as our
competitive position continues to improve. Premium growth is now accelerating monthto-month and portfolio quality remained strong. The combined ratio of 99.5% included 10
points of unfavorable prior-year development. In recent months, we observed more
activity than anticipated on older ﬁles and considered it prudent to bolster reserves for
those years, and we will provide a bit more color in a moment. At the same time, our
actions in auto are working well. The underlying performance was very strong, the best in
5 years, on the back of lower frequency and substantial rate increases.
The environment in which we compete, continues to harden with capacity constraints and
rates increasing. The industry in auto, grew at an upper single-digit level in the ﬁrst
quarter and we saw further rate increases across the country in the second quarter. So I
think we're well positioned to grow that line of business at a mid-90s combined ratio

Page 2 of 25

FINAL

going forward. In personal property, we saw strong growth at 6% with rate increases and a
favorable environment and a return to unit growth, the combined ratio of 99.6%, included
over 9 points from catastrophes and elevated weather and ﬁre losses. The actions we've
taken over time in property have been very successful. So while we anticipate some
quarterly ﬂuctuations, we expect this line of business to run at low 90s or better
performance over time, consistent with our 5-year track record.
The industry grew 8% in the ﬁrst quarter in that segment, and we expect mid-to-upper
single-digit growth in property this coming year. Looking to commercial lines in Canada,
all segments contributed to the top line growth of 11% in the quarter. We saw mid-toupper single-digit rate increases, as well as strong new business and renewal. The
combined ratio of 92.8% was solid, despite elevated large losses. The fundamentals
remain strong and rate increases are continuing to ﬂow through the system. The industry
outlook for Canadian commercial continues to improve and we expect the current hard
market conditions to drive upper single-digit -- low double-digit industry growth over the
next year.

Bloomberg Transcript

This environment is very supportive of our rate and segmentation actions. We're
positioned for strong growth and expect to run this business at our historical low 90s
combined ratio moving forward. Turning to our US commercial segment. So premium
growth was a strong 10% with mid-teens growth in proﬁtable segments. Overall, I'm
pleased with the progress on US commercial. The combined ratio of 94.8% reﬂects strong
performance in the core segments of the business, tempered by weak results in lines
undergoing proﬁt improvement. We continue to work on improving under-performing
segments with pricing and claims action, and we're well on our way to achieve our goal of
a sustainable low 90s combined ratio by the end of 2020.
Market conditions are evolving favorably in the US, with improving upward trends in a
competitive environment. We expect the US commercial industry to grow at a mid-single
digit rate in the coming year. We expect strong growth to continue in the proﬁtable
segments of the portfolio. Turning to strategy. So over the past decade, IFC has delivered
on its ﬁnancial objectives. On average annually, we've grown our net operating income
per share by over 10%, and beat the industry ROE by 650 basis points. This has translated
into an average annual total shareholder return of over 15% in the past decade, almost
twice that of the S&P/TSX 60 Index.
So as we look forward to the next decade, my team and I, are working to beat this
performance. The ﬁrst priority is returning the operating ROE to our historical mid-teens
level. A sustainable mid-90s auto performance is key to getting us there. Then bringing
our US operation to low 90s combined ratio on a sustainable basis will solidify that
performance. To expand our ROE outperformance, we will continue to invest in our risk
selection and claims advantage. So to stay ahead in risk selection, we want to become the
best insurance AI shop in the world. So we currently have over 60 machine-learning
applications in the ﬁeld.
In claims, we'll go deeper in the supply chain to improve customer experience and
capture the margins embedded and getting our customers back on track. To grow our net
operating income per share in excess of 10% yearly over time over the next decade, will

create a fortress position in Canada and build the leading specialty insurer in North
America. In Canada, we'll continue to transform our customer experience, add scale to
our distribution and continue to consolidate the Canadian market both in manufacturing
and distribution. Specialty lines will expand our product range and our distribution
footprint across North America.
And at the same time, we'll continue to invest heavily in our people, the most important
element in our success over the past decade. In conclusion, while results in the quarter
were tempered by auto PYD, the fundamentals are strong and continue to improve in all
lines of business. We expect to take advantage of the substantial rate momentum we see
in the current market, and we'll continue with our segmentation and claims initiatives. We
are committed to returning to our historical mid-teens ROE level and we'll get there.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Louis Marcotte.

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles. Good morning, everyone. Net operating income was up 5% to CAD212
million or CAD1.44 per share in the second quarter, driven by lower cat losses, strong
underlying performance in personal auto and solid proﬁtability in commercial lines on
both sides of the border. Results were, however, impacted by the CAD0.49 per share
prior-year reserve increase in personal auto. I will elaborate on that shortly. Cat losses of
CAD70 million, which included the severe ﬂoods that took place in Eastern Canada in
April, were below last year's elevated levels, but largely in line with our expectations. We
are not changing our cat guidance at this time. Operating income was bolstered by
strong performances in our investment and distribution activities.
Net investment income of CAD148 million, was particularly strong and grew 8% over last
year, reﬂecting our portfolio optimization initiatives in the ﬁrst half of 2018, as well as in
higher invested assets. We still expect full-year net investment income to grow at a midsingle digit level over 2018. Distribution EBITDA grew 16% to CAD72 million, but included
some non-recurring favorable items. Excluding these items, growth was solid at 11%,
driven by commission growth and margin improvements. 2019 has also been an active
year on the acquisition front so far, which will lead to additional earnings in the future. We
are now expecting to deliver high single-digit growth for the full year.
Let me provide some additional color on our underwriting results, beginning with
Canada. In personal auto, hard market conditions are continuing to support strong rate
increases across the land. In Q2, both written and earned rates were up 8%. Earned rates
will grow at about 8% for the remainder of 2019, driving strong momentum for our auto
business. The underlying current year loss ratio improved close to 3 points over last year
to 66.8%, the best current accident year performance since Q2 2014.
This is clear evidence that our actions are eﬀective. With respect to the 10 points of prioryear development, the level of claims activity on older years, primarily 2015 and '16,
observed in recent months, has led us to increase our reserves in personal auto. Twothirds of the reserve increase is for Ontario AB and the rest is for Alberta BI.

FINAL

In Ontario, the push for cat determination has not diminished as we expected. As a result,
we changed our view of ultimate payouts. However, it is important to note that actual
payouts on these ﬁles continue to show no inﬂation and cat concession rates are in line
with expectations.
In Alberta, our action plans are showing signs of tempering inﬂation, but the level of
claims activity on older years was higher than expected in the past few months, leading us
to update our view of ultimate payouts. All-in, we concluded that bolstering reserves by
CAD93 million was the prudent thing to do. Although, I cannot oﬀer certainty, I am
conﬁdent these additional reserves are suﬃcient to oﬀset future prior-year activity based
on the activity observed. Although, it is a signiﬁcant hit to this quarter's result, I believe it
is more appropriate to look at it on an annual basis, where it represents approximately 2%
of the auto premiums.
When combined with hard market conditions, 8% rate increases and solid underlying
results, we remain well positioned to grow and sustain a mid-90s performance moving
forward. That's it for auto.

Bloomberg Transcript

On expenses, the 28.5% expense ratio remains low and we saw improvement across all
lines of business. We remain diligent and continue to lead the industry and expense
management. At the same time, we are continuing to invest in digital and artiﬁcial
intelligence to enhance the customer experience. We still expect the annual expense ratio
in 2019 to be consistent with 2018.
Now turning to US commercial, strong top line growth of 10% in constant currency,
reﬂects a mix of rates strong retention levels and new business. Pricing trends are
improving across most lines at OneBeacon. Similar to last quarter, growth continues to be
driven by our proﬁtable lines of business. We reported a solid 94.8% combined ratio,
driven by a healthy underlying current year loss ratio of 57.8% and favorable prior-year
development. The expense ratio of 38.6% for the quarter was slightly higher versus last
year's, but it's largely due to quarterly ﬂuctuations. We still expect the expense ratio to
remain steady at around 37% for the full year.
Now looking at our balance sheet, we ended the quarter in a strong ﬁnancial position with
total capital margin of CAD1.3 billion and an MCT at 191%. Our debt-to-total capital ratio
was 21.6% and we're on track to reach our 20% by the end of the year. Our Canadian
results, if we exclude the reserve increase for a moment, were solid. The underlying loss
ratio in personal auto continues to improve and reached an attractive level. Commercial
lines are doing well, despite some large loss activity, and we're currently growing written
premiums at a pace of 8%, mostly from rates and only half has been earned.
And this is happening while market conditions remain favorable across businesses.
Overall, we feel good about Canada. In the US, we're making steady progress at
OneBeacon and executing well with strong top line growth and improving underwriting
performance. Our capital position remains strong and we are ready to capitalize on
growth opportunities that may arise in manufacturing or distribution across North
America. With a talented team, robust operating platforms and solid fundamentals, I'm

conﬁdent we can continue to meet our ﬁnancial objectives and deliver increased value to
our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it back to Ken.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) The ﬁrst question comes from Geoﬀ Kwan of RBC Capital Markets.
Please go ahead, your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Geoﬀ Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. On the M&A front, so you guys talked a little bit earlier this year,
potentially looking at something in the US, but I was just wondering, given the rally and
the valuations in the US P&C insurance, as well as the brokerage space year to-date, has
that changed at all, kind of the appetite that you have, or has the -- also the improvement
in your valuation maybe help to temper any concerns that you might have had?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Jeﬀ, we've laid out a 10-year roadmap. I think the ﬁrst thing we want to see in the US is
sustainability towards low 90s combined ratio. We're making really good progress. We're
not there yet, and therefore, we're open to mid-sized transaction, but there'll be no large
capital deployment in the US until we feel comfortable we found the sustainable low 90s.
I think our priority is to build the fortress in Canada by consolidating both manufacturing,
as well as distribution. We feel that the environment in which we operate, the industry
with a 3% ROE in 2018, are excellent conditions to deploy capital in the current Canadian
market and to use our ROE outperformance to create value, and I would say we'll be
focused on that at this stage.

Q - Geoﬀ Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay. And just the other question I had, was on the personal auto PYD. My recollection
was in the past, you've talked about just kind of bigger picture, ideally kind of having
about 3 points favorable on an annual basis. Is that still the way to think about that and do
you have a sense as to what type of timeframe you'd like to get that back to?

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. If you look, in aggregate, the -- our historical track record has been slightly above 4%.
Our guidance last quarter or a couple of quarters ago, has been moved to 1% to 3% to
take into account, in particular, the fact that the higher interest rate environment will lead
to slightly less PYD going forward. And I think we've said in the near term, in automobile
per se, I think we're likely to be seeing 0% PYD until the sustainable mid-90s and the
older years on with -- there has been activity become more mature.

Q - Geoﬀ Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thank you. Sorry, go ahead.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No, no, that's good.

Q - Meny Grauman

{BIO 15238080 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Good morning.

Q - Meny Grauman

{BIO 15238080 <GO>}

Charles, you talked a lot about hard markets all across Canada, both on the personal and
the commercial side. And it doesn't sound like you think that's going to change anytime
soon? But I'm wondering, to kind of reach into your experience in history, how do you
expect this all to evolve? Do you expect a backlash to come, and just -- at what point does
it become too much?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So if I go back to my own experience, I would take us back to about 16 years, 17 years ago
in 2002, 2003 and 2004 where there was pressure at that point in time, primarily in
automobile insurance, and to a lesser extent, to commercial lines. The industry's ROE was
back at those sorts of level. And at that time, we've seen a meaningful increase in rates,
we've seen reforms taking place to slow down inﬂation, and we've also seen a fair bit of
consolidation in the Canadian marketplace.

Page 7 of 25



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

FINAL

If I look at where we are today, 1 diﬀerence is that automobile is hard pricing conditions;
home insurance on the back of changes in weather patterns, is hard market conditions;
and commercial lines, even though we, in fact, have increased our rates for close to 6
years, we're now seeing a meaningful pickup and tightening of that environment, and by
tightening, I mean rates are up meaningfully; in our case, we are in the upper single-digit
range.
We're also seeing less capacity in the marketplace. In other words, our competitor is
showing less desire to grow in a far more defensive stance. Given where the industry ROE
is at the end of '18, our view is, you've got a good 18 months to 24 months of strong
market conditions in most lines of the business. So very favorable, I think to grow, to
expand the margin and to consolidate the industry. And that's certainly even more true
given the size of the outperformance at the end of the ﬁrst quarter. To your question, how
much is too much? Well, the industry's ROE is 3%, so there is a fair bit of work left.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the lines that are regulated, there is only 1 and it's automobile insurance. And the
degree of regulation varies by province. What I would say clearly, as rates go up and
capacity tightens, this can become more political. We've seen that in the early 2000, and
this is where to restore insurance companies' appetite to grow reforms are needed, to
restore capacity and restore aﬀordability. I think that if you take Ontario being the biggest
province in the budget of the new government, they've laid out a roadmap of reforms,
which we think were -- are quite good and we're encouraged by that. But clearly, the state
of the market should give momentum an impetus to government to modify the product to
tame inﬂation.

Q - Meny Grauman

{BIO 15238080 <GO>}

Thanks for that. And just as a follow-up in terms of the hard market creating opportunity
for you on the M&A side, I'm wondering if you could just expand on that? Are you
suggesting that maybe foreign players will start to leave or how do you expect those
dynamics to work in your favor?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So we've laid out, 7 years, 8 years ago, the perspective that 20 points to 30 points of
market share would change hands, and half of -- more than half of that has taken place
already. Our perspective now is, probably a good 15 points to 20 points of market share
that will change hands. And clearly in an environment where the average return of the
industry is just not cutting it in terms of return, many people are thinking about the way
forward. The diﬀerence between now and 20 years ago is, scale is making an even more
important diﬀerence.
I think you're seeing the cost of investing in technology for smaller players being a drag,
the cost of generating response and promoting one's brand name is more expensive than
it was historically. So I'd say the diﬀerence between this cycle and 20 years ago, is that it's
not just about performance issues, it's about strategic positioning and your ability to
ﬁnance your growth as a smaller player.

And so, if I look out -- you can look at every segment of the Canadian marketplace,
ranging from private Canadian companies to foreigners to banks to mutuals, and one can
easily see potential action in each of these segments. So, I do think that if you look out in
the next 1 year to 2 years, it would be very surprising if we didn't see consolidation activity
taking place from a number of the segments I've just highlighted.

Your next question comes from Paul Holden of CIBC. Please go ahead, your line is open.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. I want to ask a couple of questions on auto QID, and I guess,
starting with Ontario and they get a better sense of, from our perspective, future potential
risk around PYD. So you know all the open ﬁles. So there is no risk of higher volume per
se, but really the risk is in claims per ﬁle. So are you -- or help us then compare what the
risk is, and what you've reserved for every open ﬁle that still remains? Have you reserved
to the point where it matches prior claim payouts?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. I think we're probably reserved above what the past payouts have been. I'll let Patrick
share his perspective on the Ontario marketplace, and accordingly lead the reserving
position.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Right. So your point on the new claims coming in is right, that we don't have new claims
coming in. So these developments in Q2 on pre-reform is really the ones that were
already open there to develop. And as we mentioned, payments are continuing to push
to try to get access to cap limits. We were expecting that to slow down faster and it hasn't
slowed down as fast as we thought in Q2, and we have reserved for that new observation.
I think a few important points that Louis pointed out that I want to come back, like the
payback. The amount in average that we pay on the ﬁle that we close, continue to show
no inﬂation. And that has been the case for now at least 18 months. The number of cats
that actually are considered or that get access to the limit, is also in line with our
projections that we talked about in prior quarters. So it continues to develop in the
settlement as planned. We also --

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

That's an important point, Paul, because the activity comes from demand forecasts, which
drive an increase in case reserves in the ﬁeld by our adjusters. The amount of actual
payments or the amount of cats considered, agreed upon, is in line with expectation. It
hasn't shown much inﬂation.

FINAL

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

That's right. And the last point that I would add is, the rate at which we close those ﬁles
that remain open on pre-reform is also in line with our expectations. So there is no
slowdown in our ability to close those ﬁles. Now if we look at the future, there are a few
reasons, 3 main reasons why we can feel conﬁdent with the current level of reserves. First
in both Ontario and Alberta, actually the activity that we have seen is on older years and
the risk on these years really diminish at current prices and as ﬁles are closed. And for
example, in Ontario, Alberta, if I take the 4 pre-reform accident years that -- where there is
still some signiﬁcantly open ﬁles or a number of open ﬁles, so 2012 to 2016, 95% of those
ﬁles are not closed. Secondly, why we increased the reserves? As I said, the paid activity
shows almost no inﬂation and that's true not only for IB, but across the board now. So the
average pay-per-ﬁle that closed are ﬂat compared to a year ago.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And lastly, maybe on the Q2 in particular, for every dollar of actual incurred loss activity
that -- which we've seen, we've added on top of it an additional CAD2 to reﬂect and to be
prudent in our reserving approach.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

So to your point 95% of the claims for those accident years have been closed at this stage.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

That is a very helpful color. And then, I just want to understand the speciﬁc situation in
Alberta a little bit better as well. So -- because when you refer to Ontario, you say, prereform. So if something changed in the regulations in Alberta as well, that means that, that
eventually will bleed down or is there potential for ongoing reserve development in
Alberta based on current trends?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Sure. I think in Alberta, the inﬂation stems from the number of court decisions that took
place in 2012, '13. We've talked about that in the past, we've done lots since. But I'll let
Patrick comment on what we're seeing in Alberta, what we've done, and how we feel
about the marketplace in general.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yes. So there was -- there were no new court decisions. It's linked to those same older
court decisions that back in 2012 and '13, have opened the door for injuries of chronic
pain to get access to outside of the minor injury guideline. So this is linked to that same
trend that we've been discussing. When we look at the PYD for the past few years, it has
been fairly benign in Alberta, but we have seen a bit more activity on those older years in
the claims, so there's development than we anticipated during the last few months.
But part of that activity could actually been -- could actually be caused by the fact that the
new accidents in the past 2 years is going down signiﬁcantly. So that might trigger more
actions on the other open ﬁle by the diﬀerent stakeholders in the market. We have also
Page 10 of 25

FINAL

implemented that quite a few actions since back in 2014 on the claims side, trying to focus
our actions on keeping those claims within the minor injury and trying to close them fast
and we're seeing some signs in the more recent accident years of beneﬁts from it, but
there's kind of the mix forces or signals in the reserve during the quarter that made us be
prudent on the total reserve. And, Darren, do you want to add to the perspective in
Alberta?

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

The only other thing I would add is that really, we identiﬁed this trend back in 2016 in
Alberta. And if I look at our activity since that time, we have taken 30 points of rate, and as
Patrick said in our more recent accident years, we continue to see that impact, we
continue to see the climb in frequency in the last couple of years. So that's also very, very
encouraging. So I would say that our actions really are paying oﬀ in the last 3 years to 4
years and we're quite comfortable with our position in Alberta. Just for some context,
Alberta represents 7%, personal order represent 7% of IFC in Alberta and the particular
longer-tail coverage of BI is only 3% of IFC. So it is a small piece of the total IFC portfolio.
But as I said, we're quite comfortable from our position in Alberta and we're in very much
in a prudent quality growth mode right now in Alberta.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes and I think just -- how do you feel about the current accident year in Alberta. Darren
talked about 3 points of rates, frequency year-to-date in Alberta is down 17%, just to put
things in perspective. So that's in part why our sense is one of growth, but quality growth,
we want to make sure that because capacity is tight in the marketplace and the market
has been slow to react, we want to make sure that we're growing in the right segment of
the marketplace, but we have the tools to do that.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks. Charles, could you comment what current loss trend kind of looks like in
personal auto, the severity frequency?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. So the sort of -- if you break down current accident year, what you're seeing is
frequency is down about 7% year-to-date in auto. So it's really starting to gain some
traction. That's why if you look at the underlying combined ratio in Q2, it's actually sub
90%. If you adjust for seasonality, you're probably in the 94%-ish range and it's on the
back of meaningful drop in frequency and meaningful increase in rates. You're picking up
-- in terms of drift in auto right now, you're picking up a point of drift.

FINAL

And the severity, including some of the changes we've made to the reserves, which also
touch the current accident year, is mid-single digit to which you should subtract the point
of additional sum insured that we're picking up. So let alone rate increases, you're getting
at current accident year, improvement in loss cost and you're getting rates at the
meaningful clip here. So we like what we're seeing in the current accident year in
automobile insurance and that's why our growth, despite the adjustment we've made to
the prior year, is certainly one of growth, but quality growth.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

And then on commercial lines in Canada, you talked about a good pricing environment
there. Is rate an excessive trend? And then, can we expect improvement in combined
ratios in date of commercial?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I'll ask Alain to share his perspective.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

So just to give you a bit of perspective, rates right now are in the tone of about 8% to 9%.
In fact, in the quarter, average rate increase were about 8.5% and at the end of June, we
were closer to 9.5%. And with what we have currently in the pipeline, we expect the rate
to be closer to 11%, 12% by the end of Q3. So that gives you a bit of perspective on the
rate. The net loss trend we're seeing are in the range of about 3% in auto and about 2% in
P&C. So you can see that there is a solid gap between the trend and in the -- in rates and
loss trends. Currently on the earned basis, we're earning rates at about 5%. So, we've got
a lot in the pipeline coming up through the next month.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Right now I would say, I listened to Alain's comments and I'm -- that's very much what we
observed. The thing we've seen in commercial lines in the last 9 months is a number of
large losses that have taken us away from what I think the underlying performance should
be. We're keeping an eye on those to make sure that this is random stuﬀ as opposed to
tweak in the portfolio. I don't think it's the case. But there is lot of momentum in the
marketplace to grow opportunistically our quality portfolio.

Good morning. Just -- I think the comment was made about -- you've added CAD2

little bit more behind that? I'm not so sure I entirely understand what you mean.

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. So we've basically not only reﬂected in the PYD the actual activity in the ﬁeld, we've

And that was done by a factor of 2:1.

Q - Mario Mendonca

So let me ask in a slightly diﬀerent way then. If the level of activity in those troublesome

back and strengthen reserves again?

Well, the changes we've made in this quarter is in anticipation of increased activity in the

Q - Brenna Phelan

{BIO 20108118 <GO>}

So one more question on the prior-year development within auto. As you look at the
government initiatives and speciﬁcally in Ontario, but also in Alberta, is there any sort of
Page 13 of 25



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2019-07-31

legislative understanding that there should ultimately be an end to this? Is -- do you
foresee a stage where enough is enough, and the door is shut either in the courts or
through some sort of regulation?

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. So Brenna, I think the answer, of course, varies by province, but overall you take the
biggest province, Ontario, actually reforms took place in 2016 to deal with that and the
activity we're seeing is people are going back on the older years, because the gravy train
is over. And so the activity we're seeing in a province like Ontario is increased
representation on open claims, trying to take what was seen as a basic claim, claiming
psychological injury, which was really the center of the reforms in 2016 and trying to get a
cat designation.
This has led to more activity than we anticipated. That's what our adjusters are seeing in
the ﬁeld. The payments were making, as a result, or the actual amount of conceded tests
were making, once the assessment and the negotiation, is done is not out of line with
what we expected, but because there is more activity, we've strengthened reserves. The
reforms that took place in 2016 appeared to be eﬀective so far. So I think the government
gets that and they have a number of ideas to further strengthen the inﬂation in the
Ontario automobile environment.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the other jurisdictions it depends, it varies based on the nature of the problem and we
certainly have been working with the government in Alberta and are renewing eﬀort with
the current government in Alberta to bring the slight modiﬁcation that are needed to the
minor injury guideline to tame inﬂation further.

Q - Brenna Phelan

{BIO 20108118 <GO>}

Right, understood. I guess more speciﬁcally, what I was asking, if there is an open claim
that is for something smaller, and then suddenly that's adjusted to claims psychological
injury and wanting to get a higher payout, is in your view, the court system aware of this?
Is there any impetus to say it's fairly clear what the incentive is here and we're not going to
allow this?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

It's for the government to do that. I think the government in Ontario clearly gets it. Has
done a number of reform in '16 and the current government also is keenly interested and
focused on reducing cost and that goes through the incentives you're referring to. So I'm
pretty comfortable that the government is thinking about this the right way and I think
we've got a new government in Alberta, and it is on their list, though Alberta has a whole
range of things to tackle.
Automobile insurance is something we're talking about with them and they understand
where the problem is coming from. It's not so much for the courts to solve that problem. I
think it's for the government who mandates a product, who actually gives clear direction
to the court as to what is a minor injury and what is not a minor injury, and that's where
there has been erosion. That's why we think it's for the government to go back and clarify
Page 14 of 25

FINAL

the language. They've done that over the years in a number of jurisdictions through
regulation. We think that more is needed and legislative changes is needed, and we're
interacting with various governments across the board to do that. In the meantime
though, we're not sitting on our hands. We're moving rates and we have meaningful
claims actions across the board and we're seeing that we're able to tame inﬂation in that
context.

Q - Brenna Phelan

{BIO 20108118 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. Then switching gears to unit growth within auto, can you speak to
how written insured risks trended throughout the quarter and post quarter, if you can,
across your various geographies and how you expect those unit growth trends to play out
over the next 18 months to 24 months?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Yes. So ﬁrst of all, we're not going to get into post quarter stuﬀ, other than to say that
we're seeing changes month-to-month as we have throughout the year and we were
pretty clear in previous earnings call that we expect that the second half of '19 to look
diﬀerent from the ﬁrst half of '19. I must admit that the second quarter of '19 was better
than what we thought it would be and we're seeing a momentum building up. I'll ask
Darren to give you a perspective on units in auto, and hopefully this will answer your
question.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

So Brenna, obviously when you look at the MD&A, you can see that we still experienced
slight unit decline in the quarter. When I break it down to the month, in fact, in the month
of June itself, we saw a slight increase in unit growth. So when we look at June compared
to January, we see approximately a 5 point swing in our unit growth proﬁle over that
period. Now again, June is 1 month, so we are cautious in terms of extrapolating on that.
But clearly we see a pivot in our growth proﬁle. We continue to see hardening market
conditions that is supporting that growth.
Now that growth has come from both an increase in new business levels, but also with
retention ratios as well, and obviously, you put on top of that the right momentum that
we've talked about before. Clearly, as we have a shifting growth proﬁle, quality continues
to be critical. So that's one thing that we continue to monitor extremely carefully on a
regular basis and we have no concerns currently with our growth that we're seeing on the
order side. So a lot of that hard work in the past 3 years is paying oﬀ and has positioned
us quite well from -- with the current hardening market.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And Brenna, just to give you a sense of momentum in units, the ﬁrst quarter of 2019, we
shrunk the units by 4.7%. In the second quarter of 2019, we shrunk the units by 0.6%, and
in June, units were growing by 0.7%. So you can see where a big company like Intact to
have such change on a sequential basis by month, gives us a sense that we are about to
start to see momentum picking up in units. Our job here -- we've been sort of predicting
that this would be the case and that the market would move in that direction. Our job is to
Page 15 of 25



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

make sure that the quality of what we're growing with in terms of units, is top notch. And I
think in a tight market, this is something that is really, really important and we're focused
on that.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, good morning. Just wanted to make sure I understood just what you're saying about
the Ontario -- auto prior-year reserve development. And I think you mentioned
concession rates haven't changed, meaning the amount of people that are asking for 2%
of those asking for the cap beneﬁt hasn't changed, but because the amount of people
asking for the cap beneﬁt has increased, and the total amount, it increases. Is that really
the pivot point? Am I thinking about that right?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

We're not conceding more cats than what we expect.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

The process is, now that we are past the 2 years, people will want to have access to the
cap limits needed to ﬁle a cat application, that we call it. And from there, we can ask our
own evidence and examination of the injuries or situation of the client. And after that
process, that's where it's either conceded or not. That ratio of the ones and of all the
requests we receive that are conceded, continues to behave the way we were expecting
and from what we were seeing in prior quarters. But the number of people on the
remaining open ﬁles that continue to try to ﬁle for it, that piece has increased in the
quarter compared -- well not increased from prior, but is higher than what we're
anticipating because we were projecting that this would start to now slow down faster
than what we've seen. I don't know if that's clear.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

So it's not like you're paying out more, right?

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

No.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

FINAL

It's just the fact that more people are asking, so the -- that's probability of you having to
pay out. So it's not -- so you're not actually having to payout, it's just the probability that
you would, because more open ﬁles are coming and asking you if that's increasing, is that
correct?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

That's exactly right. Again, I think that the way we set up case reserves in the ﬁeld, the
probability you're just highlighting is actually a variable that is used to case reserve in the
ﬁeld and has been driving a bit of let's call this ﬁeld reserving activity, paid as well as
conceded taxes sort of in line with what we anticipated. But we feel like we need to react
to the activity we're seeing in the ﬁeld.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

But I thought that this was a message to you last year as well, that you didn't think there is
going to be any further change or that you thought prior-year reserve developments
would be nil going forward. So what's the quantum? Like has it changed that much in the
last 3 quarters?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes, we thought that the level of activity that is, people trying to push themselves from
basic to cat, would drop faster than it actually did, because we thought the passage of
time should lead to within -- I think we said 24 months last time or 12 months at this level
should drop meaningfully and the slope of decrease hasn't materialized as we
anticipated.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Okay. And then just Alberta, I mean what I've learned over the years is that once you start
to have adverse developments, they tend to creep back in for a while before they start to
move the other way. And so Alberta is relatively new in my view as to the prior-year
reserve development. And I know you talked a bit about the rate that you're getting. How
much slippage could there be here going forward? Like do you feel conﬁdent, you've got
your handle on this, or is there the risk here that there is going to be further slippage as
we've seen with the Ontario ﬁle?

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yes. So I think from a scale point of view, Alberta is much smaller. We've been on this for a
number of years. I think the level of representation has gone up over time and as a result,
the activity has gone up. We've responded by reorganizing our claims operation to be
better equipped to deal with the higher level of representation. This has led to activity in
the ﬁeld as well, driven by us as opposed to the external environment. But I'll let Darren to
share his perspective.

I think that if you look at the activity that we see in the quarter, it is the older accident
years where we see a little bit of this pressure. What gives me some comfort when I look
at the more recent accident years, we see strong improvements through lower frequency.
We see the evidence of the work that Patrick and team are doing to manage our
payments early on within development. So early signs from the more recent accident
years are quite encouraging. So as I said, the Q2 activity or the ﬁrst half of this year
activity, is obviously, further out into the tail. Obviously, that does have a ﬁnite timeline
and that risk will diminish over time.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Hi, Tom.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Good morning. I'm going to go ask something about personal property for change here.
In the MD&A you noted higher non-cat weather and ﬁre losses in the quarter. Would you
be able to quantify what those were, where those a couple of points or 2 points, 3 points,
4 points? What -- were those losses, higher than anticipated?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. Will ask Darren to give you a perspective on that.

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Yes. Both of them were a couple of points, Tom. We've taken a good close look at the ﬁre
losses, but we are seeing no evidence of concerns from an underwriting perspective,
underlying trends, just a little bit of noise volatility in portfolio. As I mentioned, 2 points
from the non-cat, that's really just a bit of a shift from cat to non-cat. We get a little bit of
that from quarter-to-quarter. No overwhelming concerns there. I think what I would say
from a property standpoint and which gives us further comfort is, on the right side, we
continue to see strong momentum there.

Page 18 of 25



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2019-07-31

FINAL

So to the extent that we see a little bit of noise, a little bit of activity, we've got 4.5 points
of written right ﬂowing through personal prop less on the earned. So we've got some
strong momentum there as well too. So again, no concerns from where we sit. Clearly,
combined ratios today, they are higher than where we've been historically. But again, past
5 years, 90s or better, really -- and it's continued to be in a strong position from a
personal property standpoint.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. So that's 2 for the -- points to the non-cat and 2 for the ﬁre. So, 4 points in total?

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Yes. That's it.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. And to what extent do you think on the PYD issue that we've talked here, that it's
kind of an industry problem, not just strictly an Intact problem? Do you think this is just
leading to -- to what extent do you think that will just lead to higher rates in Ontario and
Alberta?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well, I think that it will see the hard market for sure. I think we're a harder market for sure,
because those years go into rate indication. I think we've baked in the pressure on those
years now for a few years ourselves in terms of pricing. As you've seen, we were way out
there from the pricing point of view, shrinking our market share. And I think as this
becomes more real for the industry, you will see further tightening in the marketplace. So
no doubt that this will impact the state of the market.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

And in your slide show, you mentioned you expect minimal impact from PYD going
forward in personal auto. And I get Ontario, because anything that happened post the
pre-reform is not going to be able to qualify in. As you mentioned, to quote you, "this
gravy train is going to be over here." But in Alberta, what gives you conﬁdence to say you
would expect minimal impact from PYD going forward?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I'll ask Patrick to share his perspective on that.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yes. I think it's the fact that the activity we've seen recently is linked to older years. We've
seen the history in the past few years and if it's linked to older court cases that triggered
this opening, our erosion in the minor injury, the activity we've seen is concentrated on
older years. And we see signs that our actions since then and in more recent years are
paying up. Some of the increased activities that we've seen in just the recent months
might be caused by the fact that we have less new claims. So more time to work by the
Page 19 of 25



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

diﬀerent stakeholders and the legal community on the older ﬁle. So not all of it might
actually be fully trend, but we're cautious in our reserves at the moment and not assuming
that this is just in what diﬀerent development -- developing pattern.

FINAL

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

assumed frequency in auto that was compared to the 7% decline that you've seen year-todate?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think Meyer is asking what did you expect the frequency to be versus what we're actually
getting. I think if you look -- I mean there's a lot of moving parts here. Clearly, the
underlying minor issue was slightly better than what we would have expected in Q2, and
a big chunk of it would be frequency-driven, because we largely know what the rates
earned would be. I don't know if you want to add to this, Darren?

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Yes, I think it's diﬃcult to quantify, Meyer, but what I would say is, a lot of the rate activity
or all of the rate activity is heavily segmented. So that by its very nature should drive the
risk selection process, which drives also the frequency that we're experiencing as well.

higher priced customers?

FINAL

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Yes, and I think we're also doing a lot of work in the ﬁeld in terms of quality of portfolio
both in terms of, as I said, the new business that we're writing, but also in terms of the
book of -- the renewal book as well too. So a lot of -- the ﬁeld has a lot of quality indicators
at their disposal to help ensure quality moving forward, and I think that's what you're

And can you give us a sense of maybe what a normalized annual loss trend is for personal
property?

A - Charles Brindamour

Well, if you look at the expected increase in the value of the carpool, so to speak, you're
in the single digit, value is not single-digit. You're close to 1% to 2% increase in the insured
value of the carpool, which we're picking up in premium. Is your question personal auto
or personal prop?

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Personal property, actually.

A - Charles Brindamour

Sorry about that. I was going down a tougher answer here. So what's your perspective
Darren, on personal prop?

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

I think obviously, similar to the auto, we do have a inﬂationary element in terms of
exposure. So in terms of increasing amounts of insurance we see -- we pick up a couple of
points there in personal property. From a loss trend, which would include that, we're in
the sort of 4 point to 5 point range. So net-net, 2% to 3% is where we're looking at right
now, Meyer.

Yeah, hi. I think that's me. I didn't get the name. It's Mike, Michael. I wonder if you can
quantify -- trying to get the quantiﬁcation of -- on the US commercial, kind of the impact of
the accounts and the business that is ongoing on a proﬁtable improvement program so if
you look at the core loss ratio, that kind of went up a little bit this quarter. Can you back
those guys out and see what that would have been without them?

Yes. Alain, why don't you share your perspective on that? The impact is really quite
meaningful --

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Yes, the impact is meaningful, because if we would look at our commercial just in the US
and we want to split between lines undergoing proﬁtability improvements and other lines,
it's about 80%, 20%, 80% very solid and that 80% has been performing some 90s
combined ratio regularly over the last quarters and years. So very solid improvement. The
20% is really where the drag is coming from and this has been performing above the
100% zone, okay. And this is where we're concentrating our eﬀorts, okay. A lot of that
relates to PYD's past where we are in, adjustment there, but we're taking a lot of increase
on those lines of business. We're doing a lot of selection exiting sub-segment, reviewing
the portfolio. In fact, the retention on that portfolio is down meaningfully compared to the
rest of the business. New business is down, and in fact, that portfolio is shrinking.

Your next question comes from Jaeme Gloyn of National Bank. Please go ahead, your line
is open.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks. In the US commercial business, looking at premiums written and net earned
premiums, just a little bit divergence there. I wonder if you can speak to some of the
dynamics at play between what you're writing in and what you're earning on a quarter-toquarter basis?

Yes, well, the environment in which we operate has been improving, in particular, in the
last few months and you're starting to see an increasing divergence. I'll let Alain share his
perspective on the state of the market.

FINAL

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

There is one business unit called Dewar in our organization, that is really looking at
covering tuition fee in school, and that business unit earning pattern is way diﬀerent.
There is a bit of seasonality on that, and that is really what's causing the discrepancy
between the growth in written and the growth in earnings.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Was that your question?

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Yes, yes. Just the divergence between those growth rates and the gap between written
and earned, if there was any reinsurance or anything like that at play, but it sounds like it's
related to speciﬁc segment mix in the quarter-to-quarter basis.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Exactly, and seasonality in that segment.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Okay. In terms of the broker distribution and distribution EBITDA, acquisitions in that
broker market are continuing to occur at a more rapid pace this year. Can you talk about
multiples and the outlook for continuing to consolidate that part of the market?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Sure. So in the state of the market as it is now, we're clearly seeing some rising activity.
Hasn't triggered necessarily any meaningful bump in multiples, just more opportunities as
brokers want to move on either exit the business merger somewhat to acquire other
brokers. So we're clearly seeing some more activity than we did last year, and this will
accrue to us over time as we integrate those businesses into our own businesses. So we
did the -- you saw the jump in distribution income in this quarter. Most of it has come -really comes from organic growth. In fact, the top line impact you're seeing at Intact is also
trickling into our broker network. So that's the main growth engine there.
The M&A will pan out I think in future quarters mostly, and this enabled us to rise our
guidance from 5% to 10% in terms of EBITDA earnings for the rest -- or for the full year,
this year, we will show 10% growth rather than what we had estimated at ﬁrst.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And the environment in which we operate, is certainly conducive to consolidation and
distribution as well, and to work quite keen to continue to deploy capital in that segment
and build scale and distribution.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

And how would you rank distribution in terms of capital deployment priority relative to
either manufacturing or as a traditional manufacturing distribution combination like a CDI,
for example or US M&A?

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes, I would say that manufacturing in Canada right now would be at the top end of our
appetite level just given the fact that performance in the market is not so good and our
outperformance is big. So I think that the opportunity to go beyond our target rate of
return on manufacturing acquisitions at the moment is pretty good, I think.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then I would say distribution, consolidation opportunity, there's big synergy potential
there, given what we've done in distribution in the last decade. And I would say that's the
second area of focus in terms of capital deployment, followed by the US. The diﬀerence
between manufacturing capital deployment and distribution capital deployment is on one
hand, distribution is less risky.
On the other hand, in manufacturing, you can move the needle much faster given the
outperformance and the size of most opportunities. And that's why it's at the top of the
list at this stage. But we like distribution because to keep things in perspective, I mean
between investment income and distribution income now, and that's very diﬀerent from
where we were 10 years ago, we're coming to work on Monday morning with an 8% ROE
before we start doing the insurance manufacturing business, which is what we're really
good at. So, we intend to add to our distribution and fee earning capability to solidify our
ability to generate mid-teens ROE over time. Thanks a lot.

Operator
