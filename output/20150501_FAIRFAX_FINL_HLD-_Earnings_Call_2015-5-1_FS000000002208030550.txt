MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Vivian Prem Watsa
Q1 Highlights
Performance
• I plan to give you some of the highlights and then pass it on to Dave Bonham, our CFO, for additional financial
details
• In Q1 2015, book value per share increased by 2.3% adjusted for the $10 per share common dividend paid in Q1
2015
• Our insurance companies had an excellent first quarter with a combined ratio of 91.3%, with excellent reserving
and significant underwriting profits of $127mm
• OdysseyRe again had an excellent combined ratio of 89.2%, while Zenith had a combined ratio of 77.7%

Investment Portfolio
• As shown on page 30 of our quarterly report, we realized gains on our investment portfolio of $482mm before
equity hedges

• OdysseyRe, premiums were down 1.6% with a combined ratio of 89.2%
• Crum & Forster, premiums were up 11.9% with a combined ratio of 98.6%
• Northbridge, in Canadian dollars, premiums were up 5.8% with a combined ratio of 97%
• Zenith, premiums were up 7% with a combined ratio of 77.7%
• And Fairfax Asia had reported at their level a drop in premium of 26.5% with a combined ratio of 90.8%
• The drop in that premium was because of a new internal quota share reinsurance treaty beginning in 2015
• On a consolidated basis, there was basically no change

Net Investment Gains
• As we’ve said before, very low interest rates and reduced reserve redundancies means there’s no place to hide for
the industry
• Combined ratios have to drop well below 100% for the industry to make a single-digit return on equity with these
low interest rates
• While the short term is always tough to predict, fundamentals will eventually play out
• So net investment gains of $176.5mm in Q1 consisted of the following; please refer to page two of our press
release

Treasury and Municipal Bond Portfolio
• Net losses on equity and equity-related investments of $70mm, resulting from the net gains of $100mm and
$170mm net loss on our equity hedge reflects the outperformance of the Russell index vs. our stock portfolio
• We realized gains of $237mm on our equity and equity-related holdings in Q1 2015
• Also, we had gains of $141mm, primarily on our treasury and municipal bond portfolio, because of the impact of
dropping interest rates
• As we have mentioned in our annual meetings, annual reports and quarterly calls, with IFRS accounting, where
stocks and bonds are recorded at market and subject to mark-to-market gains and losses, quarterly and annual
income will fluctuate wildly and investment results will only make sense over the long term

CPI Index
• Our CPI-linked derivatives with a notional value of approximately $106B produced unrealized gains of $75mm
in Q1
• With deflation in the air, these contracts have come to life, appreciating 24% in Q1 after a 100% increase in Q4
last year but they continue to be very volatile
• But the majority of these contracts are based on the underlying U.S.
• CPI index or the European Union CPI index

• Further information is available on page three of our press release, where we’ve included a table on our deflation
swaps
• On average, they have 7.2 years to run
• As I’ve said to you before many times, our CDS experience comes to mind
• When you review our statements, please remember that when we own more than 20% of a company, we equity
account, and when we own more than 50%, we consolidate, so that mark-to- market gains in these companies are
not reflected in our results

Balance Sheet
• As you can see on page 11 of our quarterly report, the fair values of our investment in associates is $1.95B vs. a
carrying value of $1.5B, producing an unrealized gain of over $0.4B or $400mm, that’s not on our balance sheet
• On February 16, 2015, we announced the purchase of Brit PLC for approximately $1.7B.
• Proceeds from our public offerings of common shares, preferreds and senior notes and from the sale of 29.9% of
Brit to OMERS will be used to finance the Brit acquisition
• We expect it to close before the end of Q3

Investment
• During Q1, we completed the following
• In January, in conjunction with the initial public offering of Fairfax India Holdings Corporation, Fairfax
purchased for $300mm all of the multiple voting shares of Fairfax India, constituting a controlling interest
• Including Fairfax’s $300mm investment, Fairfax India raised net proceeds of a little more than $1B after issuance
costs and expenses from its offering
• The consolidation of Fairfax India increased Fairfax’s non-controlling interest by $735mm at March 31, 2015

IPO
• In anticipation of the IPO of Cara, the March 31, 2015, mark-to-market of the company’s interest in Cara was
based on the C$23 per share price, at which the Cara IPO was completed on April 10, 2015, resulting in a first
quarter pre-tax unrealized gain of approximately $204mm
• Upon closing of the IPO, the company held a 52.6% and 40.7% voting and economic interest respectively in
Cara, and will commence consolidating Cara in Q2 2015

Pre-Tax Gain
• In April, Kennedy-Wilson in which we have a 59% limited partnership interest, entered into an agreement to sell
all of their equity interests in 50 multi-family buildings located throughout Japan
• The transaction is expected to close in Q2 2015, subject, of course, to customary closing conditions
• We believe that upon successful completion of that sale, we will receive approximately $141mm or 59% limited
interest, and as a result, we will recognize a pre-tax gain of approximately $80mm

Outstanding Shares
• In April, Ridley announced that they had entered into an agreement with the subsidiary of Alltech, which will
acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Ridley for C$40.75 in cash per common share
• We have agreed to tender our shares in favor of the transaction, which is expected to close in Q2 2015
• The company estimates that upon successful completion of the transaction, it will receive approximately $317mm
or C$384mm for our 74% interest in Ridley, and as a result, we will recognize a pre-tax gain of approximately
$232mm or in C$282mm
• Fairfax’s interest in Ridley was initially acquired at an average cost of C$8.44 per share and it was on our books,
just prior to the sale at approximately $8 per share

Investment Gains
• We continue as you can see to realize significant investment gains, which add up over time, since we began,
we’ve had over $11B in realized and unrealized gains
• In April, again, Crum & Forster acquired a 100% interest in the Redwoods Group for approximately $20mm
• Redwoods is a full-service, national managing general underwriter and produces approximately $50mm of gross
premiums written annually from property and casualty packaged insurance business focused on YMCAs,
community centers and day camps
• As we’ve said at our AGM and for a few years now, we continue to be very concerned about the prospects for the
financial markets and the economies of North America and Western Europe, accentuated as we’ve said many
times before by potential weakness in China and emerging markets

Financial Markets
• We believe there continues to be a big disconnect between the financial markets and the underlying economic
fundamentals
• As of March 31, 2015, we have $5.7B in cash and short-term investments in our portfolio, which is 22.7% of our
total investment portfolios, to take advantage of opportunities that come our way
• As a result, in the short-term, our investment income will be reduced

Shareholders
• Finally, on page 17 of first quarter report, we have requested the maximum disclosure possible for our
shareholders
• To this end, we have worked closely with the council and Quebec regulators to get you the updated disclosure
with respect to the Quebec investigations all in this quarterly report
• We believe this updated information serves to put the subject matter of the investigation into context

Current Quarter: 11.400

Current Quarter: 2293.500
Current Year: 9528.000

Net Earnings
• For Q1 2015, Fairfax reported net earnings of $225mm or about $10 per share on a fully-diluted basis, and that
compared to Q1 2014, when we reported net earnings of $785mm or about $36 per share on a fully-diluted basis

Underwriting Profit
• Underwriting profit at our insurance and reinsurance operations increased to $127mm at 91% combined ratio,
compared to underwriting profit of $99mm last year at a 93% combined ratio
• So that’s the y-over-y increase in our underwriting profit of about $28mm
• Our combined ratio was benefited from net favorable prior-year reserve development in Q1 2015 of $68mm, that
translates into about 5 combined ratio points and that was slightly higher than the net favorable development of
$56mm in Q1 2014, which represented about 4 combined ratio points
• Current period catastrophe losses in Q1, although which were attritional, totaled $28mm or 1.9 combined ratio
points and that was slightly lower than cat losses in Q1 2014, which totaled $31mm or 2.2 combined ratio points

OdysseyRe
• Now turning to our operating company results; we’ll start with OdysseyRe
• In Q1 2015, OdysseyRe reported an underwriting profit of $58mm and a combined ratio of 89% compared to an
underwriting profit of $75mm and a combined ratio of 86% last year

Catastrophe Losses
• Catastrophe losses in Q1, again all of which were attritional, totaled $23mm that translated into four combined
ratio points and those results were fairly comparable to Q1 2014
• Net favorable prior-year reserve development of $11mm or 2 combined ratio points in Q1, principally related
to casualty and non-catastrophe property loss reserves and that was slightly lower than Q1 2014, when it was
$22mm or 4 combined ratio points

U.S. Crop Insurance Business
• OdysseyRe recognized the majority of the premiums written in respect of the winter planting season of its
U.S. crop insurance business in Q4 2014, whereas in prior years, those premiums would have been recognized
in Q1 2015
• So excluding the impact of the U.S. crop insurance business from Q1 2014, that being last year, OdysseyRe’s
net premiums written increased 4.7% to $563mm in Q1 2015
• That reflects modest increases in writings of property reinsurance and commercial automobile, insurance
and reinsurance, partially offset by lower writings of casualty insurance

Crum & Forster
• Moving on to Crum & Forster
• Crum & Forster reported an underwriting profit of $5mm and a combined ratio of 98.6% in Q1 2015, and that
compared to an underwriting profit of $1mm last year at a combined ratio of 99.8%

• There was no net prior-year reserve development in Q1s of either 2015 or 2014
• Current period catastrophe losses were modest at $5mm in Q1 that added 1.5 combined ratio points
• In the same period last year, catastrophe losses were $7.5mm and added 2.4 points to the combined ratio

Net Premiums Written
• Crum & Forster’s net premiums written increased by 12% in Q1, reflecting growth across several lines of
business and improved pricing of casualty reinsurance purchased, reductions in purchases of other forms of
reinsurance, partially offset by planned reductions in the writings of business in the CoverX line

Zenith
• Zenith; Zenith reported underwriting profit in Q1 $40mm at a combined ratio of 78% and that compared to an
underwriting profit of $16mm at a combined ratio of 91% in Q1 2014
• The improvement in 2015 reflected two items
• First, higher net favorable development y-over-y, so there was 20 combined ratio points or $36mm in Q1
2015, and that compared to 10 combined ratio points or $17mm last year, and that reflected net favorable
emergence on accident years 2007 through 2014
• The second point, a y-over-y decrease of 4 percentage points in the estimated current accident year loss ratio
and that’s due to favorable loss development trends for accident year 2014 and price increases that are equal to
estimated loss trends for this accident year 2015
• Net premiums written by Zenith of $310mm in Q1 2015 increased by 7% y-over-y; that reflected premium rate
increases, modest increases in exposure and higher audit premiums

Northbridge
• Northbridge; Northbridge reported an underwriting profit of $6mm and a combined ratio of 97% in first quarter
that compared to underwriting profit of $1mm last year at a combined ratio of 99.8%
• The increase in Northbridge’s underwriting profitability, principally reflected improvements in its
non-catastrophe underwriting margins relating to the current accident year, that reflects the absence of the severe
winter weather conditions in Q1 2015, that we experienced in Q1 2014, and that was partially offset by lower net
favorable reserve development y-over-y

Canadian Dollar Terms
• Net adverse prior-year reserve development was $1mm, representing 1 combined ratio point in Q1 2015, and that
reflected Northbridge’s share of the facility association’s underwriting results
• That compared to net favorable prior-period development in Q1 2014 of $15mm, which represented 7
combined ratio points
• In Canadian dollar terms, net premiums written by Northbridge in Q1 increased by 5.8%, that reflected increased
new business in Northbridge Insurance, modest price increases across the group and a decrease in the amount of
casualty reinsurance purchased

• Fairfax Asia reported an improved underwriting profit of $6mm and a combined ratio of 91% in Q1 that
compared to underwriting profit of $5mm and a combined ratio of 94% in the comparable period last year
• Net premiums written by Fairfax Asia decreased by 26% in Q1 that reflected an increase in written premiums
ceded to reinsurers, related to a new intercompany quota share agreement in Group Re and First Capital
• It also reflected planned reductions in commercial automobile writings at Falcon, the unfavorable effect of
foreign exchange on Pacific and First Capital that was partially offset by $10mm of premium that we
consolidated as a result of our acquisitions of Union Insurance and Fairfax Indonesia

Insurance and Reinsurance Other Segment
• The insurance and reinsurance other segment produced an underwriting profit of $11mm at a combined ratio of
91%, that’s in Q1 this year, that compared to underwriting profit of $2mm and a combined ratio of 98% last year
• The improvement in underwriting profit principally reflected increased net favorable prior-year reserve
development, partially offset by lower non-catastrophe underwriting margins in the current accident year

Net Premiums Written
• Net premiums written by the insurance and reinsurance other segment increased by 51% in Q1 2015, reflecting
the impact of $51mm of net premiums assumed from QBE as an interim step prior to the acquisition of QBE’s
insurance operations in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia that we announced late last year and that we
expect will formally close later this year

QBE Reinsurance Transaction
• The QBE reinsurance transaction is described in more detail on page 39 of our first quarter interim report
• The 51% increase also reflected the other side of that new intercompany quota share reinsurance agreement
between Group Re and First Capital that I just mentioned when we discussed Fairfax Asia

Operating Losses
• Runoff reported operating losses of $13mm in Q1 2015 that compared to operating losses of $21mm in the same
period last year, the y-over-y improvement reflecting lower net adverse development in Q1 2015
• And moving on to some of our consolidated results; consolidated interest and dividend income increased from
$91mm in Q1 last year to $114mm in Q1 2015, that reflected an increase in interest and dividend income earned,
partially offset by slightly higher total return swap expense

Tax Rate
• Fairfax recorded an income tax provision of $95mm at an effective tax rate of 28.6% in Q1, that was higher than
our Canadian statutory income tax rate, principally due to the income that we earned in the United States, where
the statutory tax rate is 35% compared to the and dividendcanadian statutory tax rate of 26.5%

Debt and Dividend
• Moving to our financial position, our total debt to total capital ratio decreased to 23.2% at March 31, 2015 from
24.6% at the end of last year

• That was primarily as a result of the increase in our common shareholders’ equity, reflecting the increase of
subordinate voting and preferred shears to finance the Brit acquisition, our net earnings for the year and increased
non-controlling interest principally related to the offerings by Fairfax India, that was partially offset by dividends
paid on our common and preferred shares
• Note that we also issued C$350mm principle amount of 4.95% unsecured senior notes due in 10 years and that
was part of the financing for the Brit acquisition also

Investment Portfolio
• We ended the year with an investment portfolio, which included holding company cash and investments of $27B
compared to $26.2B at the end of last year
• The increased investment portfolio reflected in part the funding of $1B that we reserved to complete the Brit
acquisition and it also reflected, sorry, that was reflected in our holding company cash and the net – and the other
factor was the net proceeds that we received from the non-controlling shareholders of Fairfax India on the closing
of the Fairfax India offerings

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
<Q - Sachin Shah>: I just want to find out an update on the Brit acquisition, I think the EC approval is – provisional
deadline is set to expire May 18. Just wanted to see if there was any other regulatory approvals that were still pending,
if we can just get an update on that and possible estimated closing date? Thank you.
<A - Vivian Prem Watsa>: Yeah, no. Thank you for asking the question. The big one is of course the insurance
regulatory body, which is called PRA in the UK. And that approval we expect, with some good fortune, by the end of
June, but officially we’d say by the end of Q3 is when we would be – before the end of Q3 is when we’d be closing our
deal.
<Q - Sachin Shah>: Okay. So if you do get that [indiscernible] (25:08) by the end of June, you could probably close it
maybe early July or early third quarter timeframe?
<A - Vivian Prem Watsa>: Yeah, as soon as we – as soon as is possible, subject to those regulatory approvals, Sachin,
as soon as we get them, we’ll close.
<Q>: I was wondering if you could give me a sense of your fixed income portfolio’s duration and how it might have
changed over the past couple of years. I don’t know if you track the average duration or something like that?
<A - Vivian Prem Watsa>: So, basically [ph] John (25:48), what we have is, we have the municipal bonds, which is a
big component of our investment and bond portfolio and we have – now municipal bonds are callable and as the
treasury rates go down, they get refunded, [indiscernible] (26:07). And so, we’ve had a few of those take place already.
Municipal bonds are predominantly reinsured by Berkshire Hathaway, and on the – we’ve got some California bonds
and we’ve got some other muni bonds, and then we have some treasury bonds, and our treasury bonds are long-term
bonds, long treasury bonds. And we still will continue to hold those positions. We don’t monitor it on an
average-duration basis, but we do give you a, what happens if interest rates go up a 100%, 100BPS or 200BPS. That’s
in our interim statements.
<Q - Paul Holden>: So, wanted to ask you, I guess, two questions related to the, I’ll call it, the new CPI swaps that
you’ve taken on, specifically the ones with the floor rate of half a point. So first question is more technical and second
one is more philosophical. So the technical question is, how exactly that 0.5% works? Is it a matter of the strike price
increasing by half a point every year? Is that how we should be thinking about that?
<A - Vivian Prem Watsa>: Yeah. That’s you should be thinking about it. Half a point each year for 10 years, so 5%.
So we have inflation less than 0.5% a year, cumulative less than 5%, then of course we benefit.

<Q - Paul Holden>: Okay, got it. And then the more philosophical question, I guess is, it’s kind of – to me, it’s a little
bit of a switch going from necessarily a call on outright deflation to a call on low inflation. So looking at it in two ways
I guess. That would be one is, just perceptually it’s kind of different, and then two is, you say that you have the CPI
hedges to serve as an economic hedge against the potential adverse financial impact on the company of decreasing
price level. So, with low inflation, that’s not quite the same. So, just wondering if you can explain your thinking behind
this new structure?
<A - Vivian Prem Watsa>: Yeah, no. On the 0.5%, Paul, we did that because it was extremely inexpensive and that’s
why we did it, and you might have noticed it’s gone up quite significantly, more than doubled on our cost, whereas
everything else is still below our cost. What, Paul, you have to understand is that, we haven’t gone in North America,
we haven’t experienced deflation since the 1930s. The last time we, all of us here, on this call and others have
experienced deflation is by watching what happened in Japan, but none of us have experienced the 1930s. And when
you have – and deflation is in the air right now in the United States, you’ve had January and February, basically CPI
numbers have been flat to a little negative. And the economy in Q1 came out at 0.2%. Now, people say there was a
severe winter. There was a strike, a port strike and other things like that. And I’m suggesting to you that after QE1,
QE2, QE3 if the second and third quarter come out like that, I don’t know, I’m just suggesting, but if that does come
out, then this idea of deflation might get engrained in peoples’ mind and it’s a very difficult environment to face. It’s
one that we’ve studied and it’s one that we want to protect our company from.
If we can get the advantages of deflation, protection by building in 0.5% inflation because no one else believes
deflation, that’s the reason we were able to buy those contracts, then of course we’re going to do that.
We buy 2% inflation each year, if we could buy it cheap, and that’s basically what we’ve done. We have shown for
some time that [indiscernible] (31:00) that as I said in my prepared remarks, that realized gains have been very
significant, over $11B. That’s when we were a very small company and now we are significant. And the problem with
realized gains is that’s not forecastable, when you can’t forecast it, none of the other analysts can forecast it, but that
does not make it not real. It is significant, our book values have compounded because of that and we think over the next
few years, I have listed some of the realized gain that we’ve made recently, the Ridley and others, I think we will – our
company will experience very significant realized gains and we expect to benefit from that for all our shareholders.
<Q - Jeffrey M. Fenwick>: So, Prem, I wanted to start with U.S. P&C, the results at Crum have pretty encouraging
recently and I just wondered, can you give us some commentary about how much of that is associated with industry
conditions, which still sound to be pretty challenging versus, the shift that Crum has made more recently into specialty
lines, and what’s the balance between those two that’s been helping Crum?
<A - Vivian Prem Watsa>: Yeah, it’s – the industry conditions, Jeff, have been difficult. They’ve been up about –
depending on the United States, depending on the line, maybe 2% or 3%. But in terms of cat exposures, they are down
7%, maybe 10%, depending on where you are in the layers that you provide reinsurance for. So the industry is still
difficult. But Crum has moved, as you know, basically to 100% specialty as we said in the – in our annual meeting and
it’s really from that focus, that you are going to see, we think, Crum develop underwriting profits on a sustainable
basis, because it’s gone from about 20% specialty, maybe seven, eight, nine years ago to about a 100% specialty and
we think that’s a dramatic change and we think the possibilities for Crum now in the future are very significant. You
heard Marc Adee make that comment at our AGM and we think you’ll see that in the future.
Just in terms of our business by the way and the cycle, property casualty prices are flat, maybe down as I said in the cat
area, there is capital coming into our business, perhaps capital that might not enjoy good returns. But we write about
0.7, 0.8, less than one-times, Jeff, in terms of premiums to our capital and we can write – we’ve written 1.5 times our
capital and sometimes up to two times our capital. So we’ve got a tremendous ability to write more business.
I’ve mentioned this many times in our call, but we’re not going to write it unless the pricing is good. There is a lot of
reaching for yield that’s taken place. We’ve noticed it more recently a gain and reaching for yield in terms of trying to
get some interest income, trying to get some income from common stocks and we think all of that will result in – will
not have a happy ending and it might be another reason – might be a reason because it’s always difficult to tell, but it
might be a reason for why the insurance cycle will turn and if and when that happens, we would be able to take

advantage of it.
I made that point sometime before and for you to be able to take advantage of it, you have to have the management
teams and you have to have the capital and we have both.
<Q - Jeffrey M. Fenwick>: And I guess the follow on to that. You did a – Crum did a small acquisition of an MGU
during the quarter, which I haven’t seen you – haven’t seen really do before. I mean is that part of that effort to utilize
some of that capital bringing on an MGU that can drive some volume for you in the line that you link?
<A - Vivian Prem Watsa>: Yeah, no question. This company – these are companies that we’ve known for a long time.
So in this particular case, Redwoods, we’ve known them for 17 – Marc Adee has known them for 17 years or 18 years.
They’ve got a specialty operation, underwriting profits year-after-year in terms of the insurance company that wrote the
business and of course by buying the MGU, we write 100% of the business over time. And those underwriting profits
will accrue to us. So, we’ve done that – done some of it already, Jeff, and we plan to do more of it in the future.
<Q - Jeffrey M. Fenwick>: Okay. And I guess maybe just one last thing with respect to U.S. P&C and with the Brit
acquisition; I know Brit has a pretty substantial U.S. presence in surplus lines. Is there going to be some overlap
between the two businesses and opportunities there maybe to sort of rationalize or get some synergies between the two
of them or how do you envision that working?
<A - Vivian Prem Watsa>: So the way we envision that working is we do not put them together. We make sure that
we introduce our U.S companies and that might be Brian Young and Odyssey, Hudson and Marc Adee and Crum &
Forster and the other subsidiaries under Crum. Two, the Brit management and expect them to work that out themselves
with of course Andy Bernard working very closely with all of them.
So we don’t believe in sort of choosing the best people and putting them together and having synergies of $20mm, or
$50mm, or $200, we don’t think that’s the right way to go about it for us, for our company and a decentralized
approach. But it works by sharing information and working together.
