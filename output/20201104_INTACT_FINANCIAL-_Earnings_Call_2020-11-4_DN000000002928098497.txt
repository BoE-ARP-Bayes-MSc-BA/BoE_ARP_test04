Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you very much for joining us today. The pace of the
COVID-19 pandemic, as accelerated in the last few months across North America, and it continues
to cause significant pain and hardship on society. We are thankful for the dedication of health care
professionals and frontline workers, throughout this year. Businesses have an increasingly
important role to play in protecting and supporting their communities through this crisis, especially
if the second wave is more dramatic.
We entered the crisis in a position of strength which has enabled us to support our customers
while protecting employees. To-date, we have provided CAD510 million of relief to over 1.2 million
policyholders. In response to the changing environment our relief measures are evolving towards
rate strategies based on our customers' changing risk profile and needs, accelerated deployment
of our UBI offering to deliver savings to customers for safe driving habits and lower kilometers
driven. Innovative product enhancements in personal property to support work from home, and
continued support for the most vulnerable small businesses to our ongoing policy and rate
adjustments as well as the recently announced a CAD50 million relief program to support
approximately 100,000 customers in the small business area.

Bloomberg Transcript

It is our strong performance over the years that has enabled us to provide substantial relief to our
customers. Now let's turn to results. Yesterday evening we announced third quarter net operating
income of CAD2.78 per share, an increase of 46% over Q3, 2019. This led to an operating ROE of
17%. Our resilient operations along with the tailwinds from our action plans over the years and
benign weather delivered a strong results.
Topline growth was a healthy 8% in the quarter with Canada growing at 9% and the US at 3%. The
overall combined ratio was strong at 87.1% with solid underwriting performance across personal
lines and commercial lines. There were no direct COVID-19 provisions recorded in the quarter as
we again have seen no evidence to warrant the change to our initial Q1 provision. In Canada, the
combined ratio of 86% was strong, driven by underlying performance and the low level of CATs,
while US commercial lines delivered a solid seasonal 94.5%.
Let's now look at our results by line of business, starting with Canada. In personal auto growth was
strong at 8% as our relief measures have improved our competitive positioning leading to high
retention and robust new business. The combined ratio was solid at 84.9% with the underlying loss
ratio improving 9 points. The underlying improvement is driven by our profitability actions, changing
mix, benign weather and reduced driving activity.
Driving activity itself has increased since last quarter, and stabilized slightly below pre-crisis levels.
Overall, the fundamentals in personal auto are solid, and I expect this business to operate in the
low end of the mid 90s range next year.
Looking at the industry rate momentum has been impacted by the crisis. However, with an industry
combined ratio over 100% at Q2, we expect corrective measures to resume as claims frequency
returns to historical level later.
In personal property, premiums grew a strong 10% driven by market conditions, unit growth and
the GCNA acquisition. The combined ratio of 83.7% was driven by our profitability actions over time
and benign weather conditions. Over the last decade we've more than doubled the size of this
business, while better protecting Canadians from the risk of climate change. At the same time,
we've transformed our offerings, advanced our pricing and risk selection and move deeper into
the supply chain.
Personal property performance is in the right zone, and I'm confident this will continue. In
commercial lines, premium grew 11% reflecting the GCNA acquisition. Growth has decelerated, as



FINAL

this segment is exposed to the economic slowdown. I know that SMEs in certain sectors are
severely impacted by the crisis and the economic slowdown.
We are here to support our small business customers through this difficult time, and our relief
measures are ongoing and evolving. The 89.4% combined ratio in commercial lines reflected
strong underlying performance, in a low level of catastrophes. I expect this business to operate in
the low 90s next year. While the hard market industry conditions in commercial P&C have returned
we continue to temper our rate increases for the most vulnerable small business customers. In
commercial auto, the hard market conditions remain tempered by the crisis.
Moving to our US commercial segment, premiums grew 3% with the GCNA acquisition adding 5
points. Lower volumes in lines impacted by the crisis such as ridesharing and entertainment have
setting the strong organic growth in other lines. The underlying loss ratio improved 0.8 points[ph]
[0:02:49.2], driven by our ongoing profitability actions.
The combined ratio at 94.5% including 3 points of seasonality was solid. This segment is
positioned to hit our sustainable low 90s objective. The US commercial market is hardening and
we expect it to continue.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the strategic front, our teams haven't missed a beat, advancing our long-term roadmap.
Expanding our leadership position in Canada is front and center, and we've made significant
progress. First, our customer experience is second to none. We reached a significant milestone in
belairdirect with three out of four customers digitally engage with us.
Our mobile apps continue to lead across Canada with the belairdirect and Intact Insurance taking
the two top spots in the app store, in the insurance category. And as the economies of reopen our
digital engagements across our claims, apps and UBI have all remain at record levels.
Second BrokerLink recently surpassed 2 billion of premiums as it continues to grow organically, and
through acquisitions. The growth story isn't done, as we've set a new premium target of CAD3
billion for BrokerLink. And finally, the integration of GCNA is progressing really well. And we're on
pace to meet our financial objective on this transaction. Building a leading specialty lines players
another one of our main strategic pillars, and our execution is continuing.
In September we acquired International Bond & Marine leader in the US Customs bond market.
This stuck-in was in line with our strategy of finding opportunities where we can leverage our
manufacturing capacity, gain deep expertise in specialty markets and capture an ongoing growing
stream of distribution earnings.
In October we brought together our Canadian and US specialty platforms under a single brand,
Intact Insurance Specialty Solutions. This is an important step as we build a world-class specialty
platform. There is significant growth potential in this business, through organic and inorganic
opportunities as we drive towards our objective of CAD6 billion of premiums running in the low
90s.
Finally, we have reinforced our commitment to be a best employer and support our employees
through this difficult time. We've ramped up training and awareness around mental health issues,
enhanced our diversity and inclusion strategy and invested more in learning and development.
These initiatives have helped drive an all time high employee engagement across our organization
as measured in September. As well for 2020 we're recognized again as a Best Employer in both
Canada and the US.
Our outperformance mindset is what sets us apart from our competitors, and drives us to deliver
on our promise to customers to support our communities, to transform our competitive
advantages, and to build a world-class insurer.



FINAL

In conclusion, we've made significant progress on our strategy, while delivering strong results. We
ended the quarter with the robust capital margin, ready to manage potential shocks and invest in
strategic opportunities that will come. Our book value is up 10% year-over-year and we're
delivering a mid-teens operating ROE. Our employees have made this outperformance possible,
and I want to thank them for their continued focus and hard work.
We've the best team, our business is very resilient and we're very well positioned to surpass, our
financial objectives in the years ahead.
With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Louis Marcotte.

Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles, and good morning, everyone. The crisis continues to have an impact on society
and we remain committed to supporting our customers, brokers, and employees throughout
these uncertain times. With this in mind, we recently launched a CAD50 million targeted relief
program for our small business customers, bringing our total relief to CAD510 million and covering
over 1.2 million customers.

Bloomberg Transcript

These new targeted measures will be entirely written and earned in Q4 2020 in Canada
commercial lines. During the third quarter. The relief measures impacted our written premiums by
5 points, and our net earned premiums by 1 point. The unearned portion of the relief measures will
impact net earned premiums in future quarters, offsetting the impact of reduced frequency.
At the end of Q3, the incurred losses related to COVID were less than CAD40 million, with more
than 85% of reported claims already paid and closed. We are therefore, confident that our
provision for both COVID related direct losses and bad debt remain adequate.
Moving to results. We delivered strong net operating results of CAD411 million up close to 50%
versus last year driven by strong underwriting and distribution performances. Underwriting income
grew 86% over last year driven by our profitability actions and benign weather combined with
higher earned premiums. This was partially offset by our continued relief measures.
Net investment income of CAD143 million was down 2% compared to last year. This was mainly
due to lower reinvestment yields, partially offset by higher invested assets from the GCNA
acquisition. All else being equal, we expect net investment income for Q4 to be similar to Q3,
reflecting lower yields. Distribution EBITDA and other income grew 45% in the quarter driven by
underwriting profitability, organic and inorganic growth including divisions of FCC and on-side, as
well as disciplined expense management. On a year-to-date basis, distribution income grew 24%,
above our earlier expectations. When including Q4 earnings we expect full-year growth to be
around 20%.
Now let me provide some additional detail on the underwriting results, beginning with Canada. Our
action plans and our improved competitive positioning in auto led to solid results as units grew 6
points in the quarter and profitability was at 84.9%. The improvement was driven by a combination
of better weather conditions, our profitability actions, lower driving activity offset by release
measures.
With regards to our decision to exit the BC auto market, this will have a negligible impact on our
underwriting performance. In personal property, organic growth was largely fueled by unit growth
and a high retention ratio. The combined ratio improved 5 points mainly driven by our profitability
action and mild weather. Conversely, the expense ratio increased 2.1 points, driven by higher
variable commissions due to strong underwriting performance.



FINAL

In our Canadian commercial lines, we saw premium growth of 11% in Q3, mostly driven by GCNA.
The combined ratio of 89.4% reflected a solid improvement of 2.4 points in the underlying
performance mainly driven by lower claims frequency in our profitability actions. The Canadian
expense ratio of 29.8% for the quarter increased 2 points from last year. This was mainly driven by
higher variable commissions due to continued improvements in our underwriting performance. We
expect the full year expense ratio to be in line with our year-to-date figures.
Turning to US commercial. Keep in mind when looking at our Q3 results in US that there are 3
points or 4 points of unfavorable seasonality. Having said that, the underlying loss ratio of 57.3% in
the quarter improved 0.8 points, which was largely driven by our profitability actions including
migrating to a more profitable business mix. Despite the high level of CAT activity we've seen
across the US landscape, none of these events generated losses that met our own CAT threshold.
It has however impacted non-CAT losses in the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

The US expense ratio of 39.2% was 0.8 points higher than last year, mainly due to the addition of
GCNA's surety business. We expect the full year expense ratio in the US to be slightly lower than
our year-to-date figures. Our operating performance led to an operating ROE, are close to 17%. In
terms of our performance, we've generated 690 bps during the first half of 2020, well above our
objective of 500 bps.
Now looking at our balance sheet. We ended the quarter in a strong financial position with a total
capital margin of CAD1.9 billion and debt-to-total capital ratio of 21.2%. We remain on track to reach
our 20% target over the next six to 12 months. We also have CAD500 million of cash at the holding
company and our CAD750 million credit facility is entirely undrawn. Our book value per share
increased 4% since June 30 to CAD56.22 million, thanks to solid earnings and favorable capital
markets.
Before concluding, I'd like to draw your attention to the risk of an impairment loss of CAD96 million
pre-tax in Q4, related to the equities that have not yet rebounded from the pre-crisis levels. This
may change due to market fluctuations. But as a reminder, the impairment will not impact our
capital position nor our book value per share.
Overall, we have maintained a position of strength throughout this crisis, and that has allowed us
to continue to support over one million customers coast-to-coast. We are well positioned right
now, both from a profitability and a balance sheet perspective, while the fundamentals of our
business remains solid on both sides of the border. We stand ready to deploy capital as our
opportunities arise during these uncertain times to add further value for our shareholders.
With that I will turn the call back to Ken.

Ken Anderson

{BIO 16846692 <GO>}

Thank you, Louis. In order to give everyone a chance to participate in the Q&A, we would kindly ask
you to limit yourselves to two questions per person. At this time at the end you can certainly
requeue for follow-ups.
So, Carl, we're now ready to take questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jaeme Gloyn from National Bank Financial.
Please go ahead.



Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, and good morning.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

FINAL

Good morning, Jaeme.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

I just wanted to dig into the M&A picture first off. And can you just really reiterate what you're
seeing in terms of opportunities nice tuck-in with IB&M, but looking at the excess capital of
CAD300 million to CAD500 million and then the credit line facility as well at your disposal. How is
this part of the picture evolving?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, thanks for your question. Jaeme, yeah, the acquisition in the US which you just pointed to
IB&M is very consistent with the strategy we've laid out to build a distribution footprint in the US to
really helped scale up some of our operations in this case, our surety operation expand our reach
and at the same time build our distribution earnings stream which as you've seen is very healthy
and growing.
Now, your question is bigger than that, Jaeme I recognize and our thesis is very much intact 15
points to 20 points of market share here in Canada will change hands. In the coming years we think
that with an industry running in the single-digit ROE range with the dislocation that is taking place,
globally, and the pressure that COVID it's putting on institutions here and abroad we think that -this is a good environment in the coming months, coming years for consolidation to take place.
That's the first point. And as you know, expanding our position in Canada is our number one
priority when it comes to capital deployment.
Second point, I would make Jaeme is that, there is a fair bit of activity at the distribution level in
Canada as well. The joint venture we have with the number of brokers and then BrokerLink also
very healthy deal pipeline, and we're really bulking up and helping a number of players, including
BrokerLink to consolidate the space.
And again you can see the distribution income, earning stream here being a reflection of that
activity. Clearly if you move south of the border, when you look at the performance of our US
platform now known as Intact Insurance Specialty Solutions, you see that this is really operating in
the zone that we were looking for before deploying capital that is low 90s, and if you take season
into account that's very much where the business operates now.
We would look to deploy capital in that space, but we need to find a target that bulks up the
strategy that we're focused on in the US, but I see an opportunity to consolidate a portion of that
market as well. So I would say in aggregate, I think we are in a very healthy environment to advance
our consolidation and acquisition strategy. And we think that there are opportunities to leverage
our skills at integrating and creating outperformance on a bigger base.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Thank you for that. And second question, just digging into the US operations. Organic growth was
down 3%, sorry 2% I guess, year-over-year in this quarter primarily on the rideshare and
entertainment businesses. Can you talk about the organic growth outlook for the other lines were
even those lines as well as we head in the Q4? And then in the 2021, what you're seeing in terms
of unit growth and rate growth in the US?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}



FINAL

Yeah. So I think, high level the market in the US is hard, broadly speaking and when I look at our
own business, and I leave aside the noise that COVID as related to them in terms of business
activity, I see it as an upper single digit growth story, quite frankly. We've seen throughout the year,
Jaeme that most of the lines of business that are not under profitability improvement plan are
growing in the teens.
The lines of business that are under profitability improvement plan have been shrinking. I see that
work diminishing next year because there's been so much heavy lifting that's been done by our
teams that are trying to improve performance that all in we view 2021 for the US base as upper
single digit sort of performance, a combination of rates tapping into the hard market, and then
some unit growth as well.
But very healthy organic growth profile there. I don't know, I see Darren is nodding in Calgary.
Darren do you want to add a bit of color?

A - Darren Godf rey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

No, I think the only thing I would add to this show is you're right in terms of Q3, obviously some of
the COVID sort of economic sectors you can think of sharing economy, and you can think about
entertainment for example, where we saw some top-line pressure as expected. If we somewhat
look at the other lines of business we are in the upper single close to double-digit range growth in
the US on those other lines of business.

Bloomberg Transcript

So again and a very consistent with what we would expect moving forward into '21 as well.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Thank you.

Operator
Our next question comes from Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Hey, thanks, good morning everybody. I guess first question is on a lot of talk on digital and in
personal auto on UBI. I guess, how much of that do you think does the UBI uptick is more
temporary because the times ran versus a longer-term trend that you think should sustain once we
get out of the COVID crisis?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well, I don't think it's temporary. I think that it is a trend. Clearly, there has been a jump during
COVID. But, Michael, we've been very proactive for the past four years to build a massive
telematics or UBI program and we're clearly you know, in the current context where it makes
eminent sense for people to embrace that technology have been pushing this as a product that is
really good for customers.
The reason why I don't see this coming down is because of the fact that the telematics offer is
actually evolving a fair bit, and what you'll see at Intact and belairdirect in early 2021, is a broad
range of value-added services that will be provided as part of our telematics offerings, will not just
be about how well and how much to drive and what it means for your price. It will be about your
driving experience and what Intact or belairdirect can do for you. And we will clearly tap on these
new features as we enter into 2021 to make sure that the trend goes up.
You'll also see that the marketing game plan will very much back up this notion. We have a big lead
in telematics and we want to make sure that we accelerate that lead going into 2021, and as I said



it is in touch with times and what people are going through in terms of changing habits. And so,
we're quite bullish about what telematics can do for our business. And we'll press the accelerator
in the coming months.

FINAL

Q - Michael Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Charles. I guess, second question shifting gears on your decision to combine the
Canadian operations and US under kind of one roof, on the specialty operations there under one
roof. Was that more of a marketing play to do so? Or are there maybe expected synergies that
can come from doing it?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

You know, the synergies in my mind are independent of the brand. I think we have acquired the
business in the US, and Mike Miller and team have done a phenomenal job in my mind to really
connect our value offering, and specialty lines in Canada with our value offering in the US. And I
think we've also established very strong cross-border capabilities and in a number of segments
like entertainment, marine, surety, et cetera, we truly have a North American offerings. So, it just
makes sense at this stage to operate under one brand and a brand that is distinct for specialty
lines as we embark on the second leg of our growth in specialty lines, where we see a ton of
opportunities, you know in that segment broadly speaking.
So it was more, you know people ask me when we did the acquisition, how about the brand? And I
said brand as they two. Well, this is they two. It's just the normal continuation. But from an expense
and synergy point of view we really have achieved what we wanted to achieve with the US
platform. And I don't know Louis, if you want to add some color on that point? The branding
exercise was not done with a major expense blend line.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

No, I would agree with you, Charles. Here, the most of the synergies were extracted early on. I
would say, maybe there is still a bit more to be done on the claims side internalization and process,
but and that you're seeing flow through quarterly as we improve the results, but the pure
synergies were achieved, I will say probably in the first 18 months, 24 months of the transaction.

Q - Michael Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, guys. Congrats on the quarter, and all the best. I appreciate it.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Thank you.

Our next question comes from Geoff Kwan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Q - Geoff Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Hi, good morning.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Good morning, Geoff.

Q - Geoff Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Yeah. I have a question on personal auto pricing. Just wondering where you see yourselves versus
peers.? Do you think there is still more room that they need to catch up to you on pricing? Just



trying to understand is like, if we see further rate increases from them that could help here policies
enforce growth in DPW growth?

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, Geoff. This is sort of the question at the moment quite frankly because the team, and I were
surprised by the strength of our growth in Q3. And in fact, I think there was everybody is surprised
by the speed of our growth in personal automobile in Q3. Relief was largely in line with what we
had guided before, but clearly the new business flow is very strong and then the retention is at an
all-time high. And that's clearly a sign that the industry is catching up to some of the heavy lifting,
we've been doing over the past three years. And we're entering, and I think this period where
growth comes at the healthier clip, now that we're in the zone, we were aiming for.
And we're very happy to grow in this sort of environment. I'll ask Isabelle maybe she wants to
provide a bit of color in terms of competitive positioning without sharing all the tricks with our
competitors who always listen to those earnings call.

A - Isabelle Girard

{BIO 21256467 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Charles. No, I think, to add to what you just said, I think the fact that we were fighting cost
inflation in automobile for already a long period of time. We're already entering 2020 in a position
of strength and the relief measures we have put in place have brought our competitive positioning
in a very good spot. And now as Charles mention, that's part of why we saw a good growth in Q3.
So new business levels are robust and that is to be expect to continue a bit in Q4. Further, of
course, there is still moving pieces. But we think our competitive positioning is very good as we
speak.

Q - Geoff Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. I think one of the nuance that Isabelle has just made, Geoff is that we launched a big relief
effort in late March. Now we stepped up the relief effort in automobile and it was needs based and
risk base and I think what we've done in the second part of the summer is basically reflected a
portion of the relief that we want to provide customers in our rate position, and it's clearly the
response is very strong. So we're quite pleased with that.

Q - Geoff Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay, perfect. And just my second question was I know it's a really small part of the business, but
staying on personal auto the decision to pull out of the BC market. I'm just curious whether or not it
was something to happen, maybe it did before we made the decision or after if there's been any
discussions, with the government because obviously this is effectively reducing competition?
And then what would you need to see for you to contemplate reentering the BC market, if you
were to do it at some point in the future?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. And you're right that it's not a big part of the portfolio, and Louis will give you a bit of
perspective on what it means from a topline point of view. But look, Geoff, I mean we've been at it
for 20 plus years. And as you know you're trying to compete on a small part of the marketplace
against the monopoly we subsidizes one part with the other has made it very difficult, and it's one
of the areas of the organization, probably the only area of the organization we're hope was part of
the strategy. And I'd say in the last year we lost hope there, yet I think what would be needed, and
we've gotten the capabilities to serve the marketplace extremely well in BC. We are fully equipped



FINAL

to run. I think the way to go, in BC is to open up competition across the board basically and
compete against the platform in place now, but to compete in a small part of the market, which
the monopoly is subsidizing is just unpinable[ph][0:00:25.7] from a strategic point of view. We
thought people were sort of eventually, realize that the best thing for drivers in British Columbia,
would be to open up competition. We just don't see that happening at this stage.
And we've got so many growth opportunities now on the platform that we've decided to redirect
our efforts we're private markets operate effectively and where we can give customers the best
deal we can.

Q - Geoff Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Our next question comes from John Aiken from Barclays. Please go ahead.

Q - John Aiken

{BIO 21267604 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning. Clearly, I appreciate all the guidance that you gave us for the fourth quarter. Just
wanted to talk about the distribution EBITDA for a moment. Can you remind me about the
seasonality expected in Q4 given the expected drop-off in the fourth quarter from the third
quarter based on your 20% growth target?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, so I guess historically it's probably in the 24%, 25% or quarter of the earnings in the fourth
quarter. So, that would be historical. Having said that, it fluctuates a bit based on when the brokers
will record some CPC, and so we have to be careful with the variations. And the guidance, I
provided earlier was really meant to say there is 46% growth in Q3, don't -- well let's not carry this
over into Q4, because that's not what it -- how it's going to work.
So this is what we're trying to sort of clarify, in giving the overall year guidance, if you want. So I'd
be careful. Normally, I would say you would expect to have a light Q1, a heavy Q2 and then the
other half of earning spread between Q3 and Q4, but it does vary a bit and I want it to be specific
enough so that you have the right idea of what Q4 will look like in terms of what we expect.

Q - John Aiken

{BIO 21267604 <GO>}

Fantastic. Thank you. And then in terms of the personal auto claims ratio, obviously we saw a step
back in the quarter because of the number of kilometers driven, but are we seeing the increase in
the claims ratio? Is that actually commensurate within the amount of kilometers driven of course,
ex the impact accounts?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Isabelle may be, you want to? I think in the context of Canada, it's always better to compare
quarter, one year from the next because there are seasonal patterns here. Isabelle why don't you
explain high level the underlying improvement in personal auto? And how it's largely breaks down?
And then we'll give you a perspective on what driving as shown throughout the summer right until
today. Isabelle?

A - Isabelle Girard

{BIO 21256467 <GO>}

Yeah, sure. So in terms of looking at the improvement in the underlying loss ratio in Q3 versus the
same period last year, where we think about 9 points of improvement and we estimate that three
quarters of this improvement is coming from our actions. So mainly rate action, risk selection
actions and claims actions we have taken in the past. So, and that the remaining quarter would be



FINAL

explained by the benign cost environment that were hidden[ph][0:01:03.5] due to the pandemic,
net of the relief we gave and different mix of claims.
So that's what we see in our improvement versus last year. In terms of driving what I can say is that
since April as we said last quarter, driving is returning progressively since then and at an increasing
pace, that's why (inaudible) [0:01:30.7] I would say a bit by province as governments were either
re-opening the economies or I think new restriction at different points in time, but since the
summer we're still seeing the driving level increasing.
I would say that as we speak today we're still below normal levels in terms of driving. And in terms
of frequency at the driving as increasing we saw that frequency[ph][0:02:00.0] also increasing at
the same time. And since the end of the summer frequency has stabilized as well below normal
levels. So that's what we see today.

Our next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks. Charles, I'm just curious, you know, you've talked about it is a little bit, but I was a little
surprised as the outlook with respect to personal auto direct premium written growth for the
fourth quarter, just kind of mid to high single digits. I would have thought without any premium
relief coming through, it could be double-digits. Maybe a little color around that?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. Isabelle, do you want to provide a bit of perspective there?

A - Isabelle Girard

{BIO 21256467 <GO>}

Yeah, sure. So as we explained a bit earlier our Q2 growth at 8% including the impact of relief was
really driven by our improved competitive positioning and driven in part by high retention and
robust new business.
So that's why, as we are sitting here today, our best guidance for our Q4 growth would be mid-tosingle, mid to high single-digit for Q4, knowing that we have -- moving, we've moved from our
relief program to rate strategies. And as I said, I expect that, us and other peers may continue to
move as well. So, that's why our guidance is aligned with the growth we saw in Q3.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. So competition has picked up, I guess what you're saying?

A - Isabelle Girard

{BIO 21256467 <GO>}



I guess is reacting to inflation as we do.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

FINAL

Got you, got you. And then, Charles, I'm just curious, your guidance with respect to the personal
auto combined ratio next year kind of the low end of the mid to low '90s as you're talking about. Is
that contemplating some normalcy in the claims frequency environment?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No, I think that we are expecting that we'll be a bit in the low in 2021 from the driving and
frequency point of view. And we do expect it return to normal driving level that is bridging the small
gap, we're seeing now by year-end. And to a certain extent that is reflected in our temporary price
position which were equipped to reverse should driving returned back to normal, but when I look
at the overall cost environment at the moment and some of the work that we've been doing,
which is flowing through our performance in mix and quality of portfolio, we think we'll be at the
low end of the mid 90s sort of range for the foreseeable future.

Our next question comes from Tom MacKinnon from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks very much. Good morning.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Good morning, Tom.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

I've heard retention mentioned more on this call than normal and I get the impression that some of
the premium relief measures are helping with retention, if you can clarify that. Is that strictly in
personal auto? And what's going to happen, maybe you can put some metrics around retention as
well, just to show how much it has improved? And what's going to happen when some of these
relief measures kind of wear off ? Do you think the retention has been change at all? And have you
experienced, what's retention like outside of personal auto and personal property? Or maybe in
commercial where you given some hard pressed industries and some relief as well. And I have a
follow up. Thanks.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, Tom will ask Isabelle and Darren to share a perspective on what they see in their respective
lines of business, but I would say from my own point of view historical high across the board in
terms of retention. And I think it is a function of tight market capacity in both auto as well as
commercial lines. And the heavy lifting we've been doing for three years which is also slowly
eroding from a competitive disadvantage point of view, and all of this is paying up. But why don't
we kick it off with Darren in commercial lines, and then we'll go to Isabelle.

A - Darren Godf rey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}



FINAL

Tom, so as you would expect, I mean obviously there are different sectors within the portfolio
experiencing different profiles given the economic realities of the crisis today. So when you think
about more on the more vulnerable customer side. So you can think about hospitality and retail.
We do see a little bit of pressure there from a cancellation standpoint. Not material, but definitely
there is a little bit of pressure there.
On other segments of the portfolio, which are not as impacted by the economics we see either
flat or slightly improved retention. So again it's very much depend upon sort of where we're at sort
of an economic cycle standpoint. New business levels are starting to pick up as well too. It's a
reflection of I think capacity challenges within the marketplace. Obviously we've been very cautious
and prudent relative to quality, but definitely, I think the growth profile is changing a little bit, but
again, it's difficult to make broad brush comments because it is very much sector by sector that
we're watching very, very carefully.
Obviously, I mean obviously you saw the announcement around our relief program there to further
support our most vulnerable P&C customers there 100,000 customers coast-to-coast. So we
believe that will help as well, but again were monitoring wise too in particular and modulating rates
as we need to, based on the crisis as it unfolds.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

But Tom maybe if I put some numbers on that. Darren, correct me if I'm wrong, but historically in
commercial lines, you would be in the upper 80s in terms of retention in units. That is in units I'm
talking about. And if you look at September for instance, here in the 91% range. So a couple of
points of retention change like this is very good, because we know that the more loyal/mature
business as always better business in terms of loss ratio performance. So a nice pick up in
commercial lines. Let's look at personal lines. Isabelle?

A - Isabelle Girard

{BIO 21256467 <GO>}

Yes. So as you mentioned, part of the various form of relief we have provided was in the rate
tempering or rate increases at renewal and that's because in retention to increase accordingly. So
in both lines, I would say. So in personal auto as of example a bit like Charles when he was
mentioning in commercial, we were running in the upper 80s and low 90s retention ratios in units.
And in Q3, we saw as an example, the retention ratio increasing close to 94%. So meaning that
we're keeping 94% of our clients at renewals. So that's one of the highest point we saw in
retention in the last 24 months to 36 months. So that contributed to the growth we saw in Q2 in
personal lines in general.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, and I would Isabelle what you say 24 months to 36 months, I would go so far as to say
probably 20 years. 93%, 94% combined retention in personal automobile is extremely high, and
we are seeing very strong retention in both channels. So we're quite pleased with that. And in fact
if you look at what most people expected from a topline point of view in auto and what we
expected versus what actually happened, I'd say 40% of the spread in expectations was driven by
retention. 40% of the spread then was driven by new business generation. So very pleased with
that.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay, thanks. And then the second question has to do with disruptors. We just saw another one
kind of come out here IPO recently Root, Lemonade, and companies aren't necessarily in Canada,
but they are potential disruptors to what extent maybe Amazon or Facebook might come into that
play as well. I mean they have -- they social media to market that, I guess I just assume that some
sort that the distribution edge. And can they replicate your pricing and segmentation edge as well?
What are you doing to the 10 year you've space against these potential disruptors? Is it simply just
by trying to change mix, or maybe you can discuss some of the points around that?



A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

Sure. I think Tom, we've been focused on disruption for 10 years, I would say. We've been far more
focused on preparing for disruption than competing with our existing competitors quite frankly.
And you know for disruption to actually take effect you need in our book two things, you need
better design, and you need better value for money.
And so if you've got both then you can promoted at scale, you've got a good shot at potentially
disrupting. So, if you look at the agenda that we've presented to investors over the past decade,
you'll see that there has been a lot of focus on the digital tools, the role of our design lab and the
customer experience broadly speaking.
You'll have seen that we are dramatically changing the experience in the direct channel, through
our insurance simplified project and you've seen in the direct channel big drop in the expense ratio
to make sure that we can compete on affordability or just value for money, if somebody came in to
do things dramatically differently. You've seen us invest aggressively in our brands, both Intact
Insurance and belairdirect who are two leading insurance brands in the country.

Bloomberg Transcript

And the other thing you've seen, Tom is a big focus on creating optionality in distribution. You've
seen us build Intact Insurance then bring Intact Insurance online even though we distribute to
brokers, you've seen the build up of belairdirect then you've seen us build a massive personal lines
distribution platform with multi-options which also provides a ton of optionality.
So that is on the sale, distribution and customer relationship side of things. The other edge, that is
very significant is the product we actually delivering, by that I mean claims. Our perspective when it
comes to disruption that the work we're doing to get our customers back on track in the physical
world is quite differentiating. And so it is depreciating from a cost point of view, and it is
differentiating from an experience point of view.
So, the whole in-sourcing of the supply chain process and taking in charge, the experiences, we
see a differentiator with often how people see the claims process as a financial transaction. We
don't see the claims process as a financial transaction. We see the claims process as getting our
customers back on track and we've built quite a force there.
The last point I would make Tom is the importance of data in the disruptive process and as you
know you could say we're a data shop. We've been harvesting our own structured data sets for
decades. We're tapping into unstructured data sets. We're tapping into external datasets.
Telematics is a great example of a massive program that we have built and it's all backed up by a
huge team of machine learning experts in our data lab, few 100 people in addition to the data
experts that we have in the rest of the organization.
And so when you stack all that together, I would say, we're paranoid of course that's our makeup,
but we're quite equipped to face distribution. And the last point I would make, in terms of
optionality as you've seen in the past three, four years a lot of emphasis on commercial lines,
specialty lines and opening up a big pipeline of growth in that segment to make sure that should
there be growth pressure in personal lines in part because of disruption or change in how people
move we've got big pipelines of growth outside as well.
I don't think we -- there is a dependency on that, but our strategy is one of plenty of optionality.

FINAL

Our next question comes from Mario Mendonca from TD Securities. Please go ahead.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. First on, I want to clarify some guidance you've already offered. I think
you said that, you'd expect mid to high single-digit growth in direct written premium personal auto
in Q4. Did I hear that correctly?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. You did.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. And can you offer anything about 2021? Because presumably the premium relief
will continue throughout. Would I be correct in saying the entire year, at least the first half of the
year?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, I think that's fair, Mario. I would -- I'd be inclined to think about 2021 in the mid-single digit
range. The thing you need to keep in mind is that the exit of BC will be, I think a pointing that.
Louis, can you confirm? (Multiple Speakers) Yeah. So look, Mario we've been surprised by the pick
up, so to speak, in the last 2, 3 months. So we're thinking about auto with BC in the mid single digit
range in 2021, but subject to adapting to the environment that's our best guess at this stage.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

And that's despite the premium relief ?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Yeah, that's all in.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

So let me, how do we think this through? I've been in the notion that at some point the frequency
would increase or return to normal. The premium relief will still be in place and it could result in
some lumpy quarters. I think that was the word you used to describe this earlier on in the process.
Is that no longer your view? Is it fair to say now the premium relief is being matched up with a
gradual increase in frequency there is nothing really abrupt happening here that could cause lumpy
quarters?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

We don't see abruptness. I think what we see Mario is running the business, of course taking
seasonality into account at this stage at the low end of the mid 90s. But we don't expect too much
lumpiness as a result of relief at this stage. Isabelle you want to add any color to Mario's question?

A - Isabelle Girard

{BIO 21256467 <GO>}

No, I think you're right, Charles. The only color I would love is that we also have an increased
momentum going on. So, even if we have relief that will behind throughout Q4 and 2021 will serve
as a earned increased momentum on top of the benign cost environment we are operating in.



So I think that's why we are believing that we'll be able to operate at the lower end of the mid-90
range in personal auto.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. Keep in mind, Mario, there was a lot of heavy lifting done pre-COVID here that is still earning
through the system.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Paul Holden from CIBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Thank you. So, first question I want to ask is regarding the distribution EBITDA. So the guidance for
the year is helpful. I'm wondering if you can help us with those contingent commissions. How much
of that added to growth in 2020? And what I'm really trying to get to hear is for 2021, the growth is
likely going to be a little bit below normal because of that. And that's what I'm really trying to solve
for? So anything you can help us on contingent commissions or otherwise would be appreciated.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, that's I think profit sharing indeed, but Louis why don't you take that for Paul?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Sure, Paul. So let's unpack year-to-date, as one example. Here we're around 23%, 24% growth.
About 10% is our existing broker plant. What we would consider organic growth and that would
include the impact of CPC. Then you have about 5 points, which is the result of M&A. So the
inorganic impact on BrokerLink and our other brokers. And then the remainder would be the
impact of adding On Side and FCC.
So that's roughly the three main components that we expect. Going into next year the pace will
slow, but it's still expected to be a fairly healthy growth pace, and this would be -- the sharing here
of course On Side and FCC will become organic, I would say. Here the M&A impact is probably
similar to what we've had year-to-date. So mid-single digit area. And then we do expect a higher
contribution from On Side and FCC next year, that will juice up with the growth. And that's simply
accelerating the earnings mostly at the On Side side into 2021.
So I would say next year an expectation probably year slightly above 10%, and split between
organic, a bit of a M&A, and then top up with the On Side and FCC.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Perfect. That's very helpful. Second question, is related to net investment income, obviously seeing
some pressure on refinancing rates. I guess the question is, are there any shifts you're that are
taking place in the investment portfolio to offset reinvestment pressure either actions taken todate or things you're contemplating over the next 12 months?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I don't expect a major shift in the portfolio. These are, I'd say tweaks here and there. In the
portfolio we're very cautious, as you know. And there is some pressure clearly. Going one way
we're seeing a bit of erosion on the other side the growth in assets. So to some extent they offset
each other and help us sort of (inaudible) [0:02:48.7] the pressure here, but you would not expect



us to take -- you should not expect us to take massive moves here in terms of our asset mix or
investment style to chase higher yields. We do on the margin, but it's not a huge changes, and it
doesn't move the risk envelope very much.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

FINAL

Got it.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

You know on the contrary I would say that we've taken a cautious position on the asset side of the
house, early in the crisis to be able to defend against volatility but also to make sure that you know
at all points in this crisis, we would be in a position to take advantage of opportunities. So reaching
for yield and expanding the risk envelope has not been one bit our approach to-date.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Thank you for that.

Our next question comes from Doug Young from Desjardins Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I get to say good afternoon. Two questions, here. And Charles I know I've asked
You this in the past, and it comes and goes. But given what I've read in The Globe and Mail, and I
know that's maybe placed always go to, but are you at all worried in Canada about the commercial
market becoming regulated? And has there been any discussion around that with the government
or with the regulator?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Thanks, Doug. Look, I think the commercial lines market. No, I'm not worried that it becomes
regulated from a pricing and product point of view, I think that, and the reason why I'm not overly
worried about that is the fact that coming into this crisis the market was tight, meaning that the
industry ROE was single-digit and commercial property was under, and commercial P&C was under
pressure, right. It was liability inflation in the system.
And then the impact of natural disasters put a fair bit of pressure on property and there has been
10 years of sub-market in commercial property. Now people forget about that now, but there has
been 10 years of soft market in commercial P&C.
Then COVID happens, and the investment income potential comes down. You get a fair bit of
pressure on the claims side of things. Now we've reserved for all of this in Q1, and we're in good
shape, but the industry is under -- has been under pressure as a result of claims. So clearly the
capacity issues that existed in the first place have been exacerbated by COVID, and then you layer
on top of that the demand that reinsurers have made. In terms of awarding and so on, you have to
acknowledge that there are areas of the market where capacity is tight. With COVID there has
been a number of class actions on long-term care facilities for instance. And then there is moral
hazard of vacant buildings that is also an issue.
So long story Doug, but I think the nuance is important here. In the high-risk areas of the market.
Take bars, restaurant, with heavy liquor liability this part of the market was largely served by
foreign operators, and a number of them left and this has led to a capacity crunch only small -- very
small portion of the market, because it's still very competitive in commercial lines. But a number of
foreign operators left, and this has created a bit of tension.



FINAL

Now, I don't think you bring capital back in the industry by regulating. The problem is capital is left,
not people are doing extremely well in commercial lines. And I think that people understand this
dynamic. That being said solutions need to be found. So we're leading a solution with the industry
to ensure uninsurable risks and there is a number of mechanisms that are being put in place to
address the issue here, but I don't think regulation will solve the problem.
It's not that people are overcharging. It's because capital has left the system. And I don't think
scaring insurers is the way to bring back capital in the system. And that's my sort of analysis of the
situation. We've been providing a ton of relief in commercial lines.
We're growing our commercial lines platform. We've frozen rates for vulnerable customers. We've
just announced a CAD50 million relief program in that space and quite frankly the large leaders in
the marketplace are stepping up at the moment. The issue is number of foreign operator in the
high-risk base has left -- have left.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Okay. And so it doesn't sound like the regulators really breathing down your neck or there is that
discussion going on. Like I get all your explanations, and it's absolutely logical. I think regulatory
team logical, but it doesn't sound like that a real concern you're having right now.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No, I think that there is a dialog and were capital has left the system we need to find solutions. And
that's where the dialog is taking place. But, so the regulation won't sell the system, it will make it
worse, if not far worse, if you want my opinion.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

And my second question is, my question I actually I just received, and it's the industry, I think you
quoted the industry as having fine ratio is about 100% and ROE, so around 5%. It doesn't seem like
that's really improved materially, despite some of the favorable headwind and that 2020 as
provided and we're seeing some good results out of you and some of the others. Is there a
certain segment of the market that's really performing absolutely horrendously and then certain
segment of the market that's doing really, really well? And I am just surprised by that.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. So I think there is two things, Doug. One of the things we've seen in the first half of 2020,
which were we surprised yes or no. I don't know, but adverse development from the past in
automobile insurance has been a problem and we've been at it since 2016, there's a lot of heavy
lifting, you've seen us take a cautious stance in reserve, a few years back, I think that is taking place
now at the industry level and as such, putting pressure on the overall performance in automobile
insurance, even if you could expect the benign sort of cost environment.
Commercial lines performance overall, first half of 2020 has been very bad, at the industry level.
So you know, depending on the province in which you operate, you see 105, 110-ish type
performance in commercial lines and that's why you know, my view is, you've got a capacity issue,
clearly an opportunity for us. And, but that is the nature of the market, and hence the industry's
result. I expect things will get better this year, but there is a fair bit of digestion to do in this
industry to return to historical levels of performance from an ROE point of view. And that's why our
view, Doug, has been you know when we were asked before the crisis, how long will the hard
market last, Darren had done a very good analysis last year to say, we think it will be 24 months.
And you know, this has been put on pause to a certain extent you know, depending on the line of
business, but there's a lot of work left to do to improve the performance and the attractiveness of
this industry, for say average players, gladly we've done that early on. And now I think the topline is



benefiting and the bottom line is doing well, and that's how we operate as a firm, we've shown
that in the past and trying to -- to win in this environment.
