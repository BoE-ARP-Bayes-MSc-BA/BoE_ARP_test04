{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us to review our
third quarter results. For AXIS, the story of the third quarter is that we're continuing to see
positive momentum in our business, and our efforts to grow our leadership in selected
markets are generating real traction. It's been a very productive year for AXIS and one in
which our improved results are beginning to demonstrate the potential of our business.
Like the rest of the industry, our third quarter was impacted by cat activity in the
Southeastern United States and in Asia, as well as elevated attritional property losses.
Within this context, the strength of our results speak to our teams' work to build resilience
within our portfolio.
We reported operating ROE of 7.2% in the quarter. But as you know, we believe this to
understate the true run rate profitability of our business due to PGAAP rules. Excluding
PGAAP entries, our third quarter results would have been an operating ROE of 8% and
our year-to-date ex-PGAAP operating ROE was a solid 10.2%. In recent years, we've
worked hard to establish AXIS as a profitable relevant player in specialty lines with a
differentiated hybrid platform. Our underwriting expertise, outstanding service and
industry leading claims capabilities have helped us build deep and meaningful
relationships with our clients and partners and distribution.
With close to $7 billion in premium and at top 10 positions in all of our key markets, we
believe we are the perfect size to succeed. We have the scale, talent and breadth of
products to be impactful to our markets and partners in distribution, but with the agility
required to execute and leverage change to our advantage in a rapidly evolving industry.
In recent calls we've spoken to you about our transformation program to enhance
operational effectiveness and efficiencies while leveraging increased capabilities in data,
analytics and digital technology. We continue to make progress against plan and much of

FINAL

the heavy lifting on the organizational side has been completed. In parallel, we're also
continuing to integrate Novae into our business and are pleased with the progress that
we're making there.
Of note, the Novae portfolio we acquired last year delivered a year-to-date underwriting
profit. You also recall that we had previously advised that between our transformation
program and the Novae integration, we were targeting $100 million in savings of our 2017
expense levels. I am pleased to say that as of the third quarter, we've already achieved
$68 million in annualized savings on a run rate basis.
We're now focusing the bulk of our energy on enhancing our key capabilities and investing
in our markets and in our future. We've launched several exciting initiatives including AXIS
Digital Ventures, a new unit that is accelerating our InsurTech partnership efforts and a
number of promising new projects to put better tools and data in the hands of our
underwriters so that it can deliver improved and accelerated service to our clients and
partners in distribution. One of them is our recent launch of a tech-enabled platform for
accelerated underwriting of small commercial risks.
As we approach the end of the year, we're encouraged by the momentum and pricing
improvements that we're seeing across our business. We've never had stronger market
positions. And our team is working very hard to make the most of upcoming renewals and
creating new opportunities for profitable business in our chosen markets.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Pete, who'll go through the figures in more detail.

Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. Building on Albert's earlier comments,
this was a quarter where we saw continued improvement across several key areas in our
business. During the quarter, we generated net income of $43 million. Our operating
income for the quarter was strong at $81 million, generating an annualized ROE of 7.2%.
On an ex-PGAAP basis, our operating income was $90 million generating an ex-PGAAP
annualized operating ROE of 8%.
The quarter benefited from improved underlying, underwriting results in our reinsurance
segment. Both segments reported lower level of cat and weather related losses. And
both segments continued to report favorable, prior year reserve development. In
addition, the quarter benefited from strong investment income. These positive factors will
partially offset by attritional property losses, net realized investment losses, and
amortization of value of business acquired or VOBA.
Before I get into the specifics of the income statement, I would like to provide an update
on several items. First, we reported $92 million in cat and weather losses during the
quarter. This was driven mostly by Hurricane Florence, which we saw primarily as an
insurance event. Separately, our exposure to the cat activity in Asia was minimal.

Page 3 of 24

FINAL

Second, with regard to the acquisition of Novae in the quarter, we recognized
amortization of VOBA of $39 million. The expense affected the company's consolidated
operating income, but it was not included in the segment results. Underwriting income in
the quarter continued to include the earn-out of Novae's unearned premium as of the
closing date without the recognition of the associated acquisition costs since the DAC
asset was written off at closing.
We estimate the consolidated acquisition costs on an ex-PGAAP basis would have been
approximately $29 million higher resulting in an acquisition cost ratio of 22.7% versus the
reported 20.3%. The net drag on operating income from the VOBA/DAC adjustments
was $10 million pre-tax or $9 million after tax, which is approximately $0.11 per share. As
previously disclosed, the VOBA/DAC adjustment is expected to be immaterial beyond
mid-2019. I'll also remind you that we did add disclosure to the supplement that details
this information for you.

Bloomberg Transcript

As an update to our expense initiatives, in the quarter, we generated Novae integration
savings of $11 million and we also delivered $6 million in savings associated with our
transformation initiatives. As Albert noted, on an annualized run rate basis of $68 million,
you can see that we are well on our path to delivering $100 million in run rate savings by
year-end 2020. Lastly, non-operating reorganization expenses associated with Novae
integration and our transformation program totaled $16 million in the quarter.
Now let's move into the details of the consolidated income statement. The current
quarter consolidated combined ratio was 97.9%, an improvement of 55 points from the
third quarter of 2017. As I mentioned earlier it's important to note that the quarter
benefited from the absence of the amortization of some acquisition costs. The ex-PGAAP
combined ratio of 100.3% is almost 53 points better than the comparable period last year.
This improvement is largely driven by an almost 54 point decrease in the cat and weather
related loss ratio; a reduction of over 3.5 points in the current accident year loss ratio, excat weather partially offset by an increase in the ex-PGAAP acquisition cost ratio.
The current accident year loss ratio ex-cat weather improvement was driven by the
addition of the Novae book, favorable rate in excess of trend, especially in the property
and motor lines and improved experience across most classes. This was partially offset by
elevated attritional loss experienced in property, especially in the insurance segment. The
increase in the ex-PGAAP acquisition cost ratio of 3.6 points was primarily driven by the
addition of the Novae book.
We reported net favorable prior year reserve development of $46 million in the quarter,
of which $14 million came from insurance and $32 million came from reinsurance. This
includes a reduction in our estimate of the 2017 hurricanes, Harvey, Irma and Maria of $21
million.
During the quarter the consolidated G&A expense ratio of 12.7% increased by 0.4 points
compared to the third quarter of 2017. The normalized G&A ratio this quarter would have
been 13.1%. The year ago quarter pro forma G&A ratio, which would include Novae
expenses was 15%. So, on a like-for-like basis, the G&A ratio is down almost 2 points. This

Page 4 of 24



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2018-10-25

decrease in the G&A ratio was driven by the expense actions, I mentioned at the
beginning of my comments.

FINAL

Fee income from strategic capital partners was $18 million this quarter compared to $6
million in the prior year. This important part of our business continues to grow well with
year-to-date fees aggregating to almost $43 million, up from $28 million last year. We'll
now discuss in detail the underwriting results of both insurance and reinsurance.
Let's begin with insurance. The insurance segment reported an increase in gross
premiums written of $318 million with all the increase coming due to the addition of
premium from the acquisition of Novae. The legacy AXIS book was flat year-over-year,
where we saw increases in the professional lines and liability classes offset with declines in
the property and A&H lines.

Bloomberg Transcript

Insurance net premiums written increased by $195 million during the quarter. Excluding the
impact of Novae, the net premiums written decreased by $15 million due to the increasing
premiums ceded in liability and property lines. Reported combined ratio was slightly over
102 points. Again, we think the best way to look at this ratio was adjusting for PGAAP. So
adjusting for $29 million in DAC acquisition costs or 4.7 points on the acquisition ratio, the
ex-PGAAP combined ratio would be nearly 107 points, which is an almost 62 point
improvement over the same period last year.
The improved combined ratio is driven by a significant decrease in cat and weather
related losses and improvement of almost 4 points in the current accident year loss ratio
of ex-cat and weather. This was partially offset by an increase in the ex-PGAAP acquisition
cost ratio of slightly over 8 points. This quarter pre-tax cat and weather related losses was
$62 million, primarily attributable to Hurricane Florence and other weather events. This
solid performance is the result of repositioning of our portfolio – our property reinsurance
coverage that we completed in the second quarter.
The insurance segment's current accident year loss ratio, ex-cat and weather, improved
by almost 4 points, driven by a mix of business largely related to the Novae book, the
favorable impact of rate over trend and improved experience in most lines. This was
partially offset by a higher attritional loss experience in property and to a lesser extent
elevated aviation losses. The insurance segment's acquisition cost ratio on an ex-PGAAP
basis was 22.9%. This increase over prior year was predominantly driven by the addition of
the Novae book of business. The quarter's ex-PGAAP combined ratio of 106.9% compares
to a nine-month ex-PGAAP combined ratio of 99.7%. These figures reflect elevated losses
in property and aviation consistent with what we've seen in the industry experience.
In looking at our international division, this is the first January 1 renewal period where we
have the integrated AXIS Novae portfolio. When we acquired Novae, it had always been
our plan to optimize our portfolio, which includes shrinking or exiting underperforming
parts of our business. This process has been underway throughout the year and we
expect to make further refinement as we head into the January 1 renewal season. This
reflects our larger enterprise strategy to concentrate our resources in areas of our
business where we can be a market leader and drive sustained profits.

FINAL

Moving to reinsurance, during the quarter, we saw solid results within our reinsurance
business. The reinsurance segment reported a decrease in gross premiums written of
$80 million in the quarter. The decrease is driven by re-instatement premiums included in
the prior year numbers, premium adjustments in A&H, in timing and motor.
Reinsurance net premiums written decreased by $108 million compared to the same
period 2017. The decrease in net premiums written reflected the decrease in gross
premiums written together with an increase in premiums ceded in A&H and liability. The
current quarter combined ratio is 89.5%, which is an over 47 point improvement from the
same period last year. The improvement is largely driven by a significant decrease in cat
and weather related losses and a reduction in over three points in the current accident
year loss ratio ex-cat weather.
Pre-tax cat and weather related losses were $30 million, primarily attributable to Hurricane
Florence, Typhoon Jebi and U.S. related events in the quarter. The reduction in the
reinsurance segment's current accident year loss ratio ex-cat and weather was driven by
rate increases, especially in property and motor, favorable changes in business mix and
the addition of Novae book. The reinsurance segment's acquisition cost ratio is 22.5% on
an ex-PGAAP basis. This is comparable to the prior year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Onto the investment returns. Net investment income of $114 million for the quarter
increased from $95 million in the third quarter of 2017. This was due to an increase in
income from fixed maturity securities attributable to a larger investment base from the
acquisitions of Novae and Aviabel, and the increase in interest rates.
Our current book yield is 2.9%. And our new money yield is 3.5%. The duration of our
portfolio is approximately three years. The 60 basis point spread between the current
book yield and new money rates provides an ongoing opportunity for increased
investment income in the future as our bond portfolio continues to roll over.
Diluted book value per share increased by 0.4 points in the quarter to $52.70, principally
driven by operating results, partially offset by net realized and unrealized losses on
investments, re-organization expenses and our common dividend. Again, overall it was a
solid quarter for AXIS and one in which we saw promising results in a number of areas of
our business.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Albert.

Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you, Pete. Let's spend a few minutes reviewing market trends and then we'll open
the call for questions. The bottom line is we continue to see improved pricing in the
marketplace. Within our insurance segment, average rate increases were comparable to
the second quarter at close to 4%. However, we saw a positive trend throughout the
quarter with rates increasing each month to an average of 5% in September.

Page 6 of 24

FINAL

In our U.S. division, renewal rates were very modestly lower than in the second quarter by
a few decimal points, but still in the 7% range overall. As lower rate increases in property
at about 8% were offset by higher rate increases in excess casualty at over 12%. We need
to see these double-digit rate increases for excess casualty as we've been very cautious
keeping in mind the potential for inflation and higher loss trends. Separately, U.S.
programs continue to show steady rate increases at about 4 points and our primary
casualty rate for the quarter was up about 1 point.
In our London based International insurance division, the average rate change for the third
quarter was nearly 3% and here again we saw higher rates in each subsequent month of
the quarter. Within that, property rates were positive across all classes with the largest
rate increase observed in Global Property at 9%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Of note, international professional lines pricing has also picked up in the quarter with
average rate increases of 5%. Within our North American professional lines division, price
increases have picked up some pace although they remain relatively low at 2%. We
continue to see more pricing on primary and less on excess. Please note that we are not
much exposed to loss trends and primary D&O for large accounts as we substantially
reduced our exposure to that book several years ago.
Additional highlights included increased rate changes in Healthcare at plus 5% as well as in
cyber and professional firms which both saw increases of 3%. Overall across our entire
insurance segment, 86% of our business renewed at flat or better in the quarter. Turning
to our reinsurance segment, quota share treaty is benefited from improvements in the
underlying primary pricing, while ceding commissions were generally flat or down
modestly.
Excess of loss pricing has generally been rational and follows recent loss activity with the
exception of catastrophe reinsurance where pricing is essentially set at the margin by
growing ILS market. Hopefully, the adverse developments reported by others on the 2017
cats and recent storm losses in the U.S. and Asia provide somewhat of a floor for cat
pricing to head in a favorable direction at the next renewals.
As you know, by now we share about half of our property cat business with capital
partners. In our Europe, Middle East and Africa division, the market remains stable with
pockets of continued improvements in line such as liability and motor. In our North
American division, pricing was also relatively flat in non-cat lines with regional and middle
market accounts typically performing better than large accounts. Property lines remain
competitive, but we'll have to see how the recent storms impact the broader market
place at upcoming renewals.
In Asia, the market remains broadly flat from last quarter. We have seen some
competition pull back from certain lines of business such as portions of the property,
marine and engineering markets and we've also seen a few companies exiting Singapore
and Hong Kong. This disciplined behavior is encouraging.

FINAL

Separately we've had some opportunities to participate in new backup covers in Japan,
where we were happy to support our strong Japanese relationship. It'll be interesting to
see how the next renewals reflect the higher loss activity in that market. Overall in both
insurance and reinsurance while we may debate the adequacy of the quantum of change,
conditions are continuing to move in the right direction. After a decade of price cuts, we
are seeing some encouraging signs of strength and discipline within the industry.
We support and applaud Lloyd's for their recent actions to mandate the use of electronic
placement and reduce unprofitable underwriting. The impact of their pressure is visible in
the many announcements of reduced capacity, market exits and even in the closure of
syndicates. My hope is that the recent actions by Lloyd's will have some positive impact on
pricing.

Bloomberg Transcript

We should also expect that the loss activity that the industry experienced in the last few
years would be driving better pricing. But we recognize that there remains an abundance
of capital in the marketplace. So while we're not predicting a meaningful firming on
pricing, everything that we are seeing and hearing points to strong justification for
continued improvement in the market.
Within this environment at AXIS, we do not intend to be an index. We have our own views
on risk and return, and we'll take independent actions to secure a more stable and
profitable portfolio. Our research tells us that we've been demanding and getting price
increases that are a bit ahead of the market. Looking forward ongoing modest pricing
increases should make several lines more attractive to us. And where our appetite is
warranted, we're confident of winning the business we want. On the other hand, we've
already reduced business that did not offer adequate returns and we are resolute to shed
more business if we do not get the right risks at the right price.
I'm convinced that the future belongs to those companies that invest in winning
capabilities, including underwriting expertise, new product development, claims service
and analytics, and who have the courage to take decisive actions to ensure their ongoing
profitability. With our transformation program and our investments in growing our
relevance in the key markets, AXIS is already part of the lead pack. We have a talented
team that is working hard to position AXIS to capitalize on the opportunities created by
the changing marketplace. And if we stay true to our strategy, we will be well-positioned
to break out ahead of the pack and create an exciting future for our clients, partners in
distribution, employees and shareholders.
And with that, we'll be happy to answer your questions. Brian, please start the question
period.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you, and good morning. My first question...

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

FINAL

Good morning, Kai.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Good morning. You have make a lot of changes repositioned portfolio on the property cat
side and reduced volatility. The results are evidenced in the third quarter results that your
cat exposure is actually less than some of your peers. So, I'm wondering – so what's your
normalized sort of cat loads going forward because you have done a lot of things? Is this
first nine months your cat – cat – yeah, cat loss ratio about 4.5%? Is that sort of like a
normal going forward or is that actually below sort of what do you think your normalized
cat load?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, Kai, as you know, this is a very difficult question to answer. On the one hand, we
don't publish a cat load, but more importantly, cats by definition are very volatile. But I
think that what I would say is that we would expect to see an ongoing continuing trend in
our average exposure to cat as we go forward. And we've shared some of that
information with you.
2017 was a difficult year for us, but still compared to the prior years of 2011 and 2005 are
the impact of the cats on our book of business, on our shareholders' equity had
diminished across that and we would expect that we would continue to see on average
lower. So what I would say to you is every year is different, but if you take the last three to
five years, they're probably better than the three to five year period before that. And our
hope is that we will continue to make progress in that direction.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. And do you have any early indication from potential losses for Michael?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Well, Kai, this is Pete. What I would tell you is with regard to Michael, it's still very early
days. Looking at Michael compared to Florence, one, we definitely believe it's going to be
a bigger event. Florence is pegged in the $4 billion to $5 billion range and Michael is
looking more to, I'll call it $8 billion to $10 billion. We're also looking that is probably being
more of a reinsurance event, with the carriers that cover that area of Florida, most of
those insurers buy an awful lot of reinsurance. So we expect it to be more of a reassurance event and we do expect it to be bigger than Florence. But right now, our claims
teams are working with our clients and our cedants in doing a bottoms-up, but wouldn't
be prudent for me to give you any sort of range at this moment.

Q - Kai Pan

Page 9 of 24



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2018-10-25

That's fair. My second question is on the insurance operation. Could you quantify the, like
the higher attrition losses from property lines in the third quarter?

FINAL

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yeah. So, Kai, again this is Pete. I'll handle that for you. If you look at our property class
from the third quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year, you can actually see
that the loss ratio is up a bit and we believe that the loss ratio is probably got about, it's
about 2 points high on the insurance segment, just associated from what we're seeing
from attritional property year-over-year. In addition to that, we expected to see a 2 point
improvement in the insurance book given all the actions we had taken with regard to
getting rate and with regard to portfolio actions. So I guess what I'd tell you is in the
quarter, the insurance segment's probably got a drag on it of close to 4 points or maybe
even a little north of 4 points due to what we're seeing as basically a frequency of
property loss issue in the quarter.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's great. If I'm following on that one to say, you do talk about the potential the pricing
above your loss trend and improving your underwriting – underlying loss ratio by 2 points.
Albert, you talked about a 4% average rate increases. Could you expand a bit more on
the loss cost trend side to give you a confidence that you can have the 2 points margin
expansion?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yeah, I'm not sure we talked about the 2 point margin expansion, I think we talked
specifically to the property.

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Just to property there.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

If you look at our book of business...

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

If you look at our book of business all in, I would say that we've probably got a little under
1 point of improvement coming in from rates which is better the trend, that's a little bit
better on the reinsurance side, because we've had the impact of the Ogden rate change.
And so that was a significant amount of rate change, but that impacted the reinsurance
book. But on both insurance and reinsurance, when you put them all together, there's a
little under 1 point of improvement there.

Page 10 of 24

FINAL

And I would add that right now, it looks like almost every line of business is offering rate
above trend except for marine by a little bit and some professional lines, so there the
improvement really comes through changing mix, changing books of business, changing
attachment points. The improvement will come, but we're not looking for the market to
bail us out.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's perfect. Thank you so much for the answers.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

Good.

Next question will be from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. Just one follow-up to Kai's question and one other question. When you
talked about Michael versus Florence, you said it's a bigger event. Was that a comment
relative to the industry or AXIS or both?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yeah. It was a comment with regard to the industry, Jay, but because it's bigger with
regard to the industry, we do think that at least early days here, Michael will more than
likely be a bigger event to us in the fourth quarter than Florence was in the third quarter.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

But we do caution you, it's really early.

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

It's really early.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yeah. I wouldn't want to do – I wouldn't want to project anything on this at this point in
time. We need to leave the claims process follow its normal course.

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

And...

FINAL

And to give you a follow up on that, Jay, I guess, let's say in the third quarter and the $92
million of cats we reported, $68 million were due to Florence, $11 million were due to Jebi,
$5 million were from the California wildfires, and then the remaining $8 million was just
from various PCS events.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

That's good disclosure. Thank you. And then the other question, I guess for Albert. You
talked early on about some investments you're making and you mentioned AXIS Digital
Ventures and I'm wondering if you could speak a little bit more about that.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Absolutely. We've said this before, I think this industry is in an arms race when it comes to
data, analytics and technology. And there is a huge amount of start-ups and
developments in terms of using technology to enhance every part of our business from
the underwriting, our ability to respond quickly to our customers, the ability to add thirdparty data to the submission data so that we can make better decisions, the ability to
enhance the claims process by using things that you've heard about like drone
technology, geospatial mapping, you name it.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, there's tons of stuff that we could be using to what I call enhance the underwriting
process and make sure that not only do we make better decisions because we give our
underwriters better tools, but actually make faster decisions, and able to turn around and
give our clients and our brokers the information they need.
To do that, obviously you need to be connected to all of the developments that are
happening in the technology world. It will come as no surprise to you that there is more
hype than facts in that world. And in many cases what you need to do is go through a
whole lot of proposals and then do proof-of-concept projects, small projects to validate
whether or not there's promise in those things.
And then once you prove them, then start to create a squad to see how you can put that
into effect in your business. And so to do that, our AXIS Digital Ventures is really meant to
be the point of the spear of AXIS towards the InsurTech world and make sure that we are
in the flow of all the ideas that are coming out there.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

I'll take that question. Right now, one, I'd remind you we did already moved the Novae

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

...this year, but right now, it's still early days. We have – actually have our eye on the
expenses and we're looking at it, but we still need to make sure that we continue to
invest in tools and data and analytics; what Albert was just talking about with regard to
AXIS Digital Ventures. So while we think that we're trending in the right direction, we know
we're trending in the right direction on the expenses. We're staying firm right now to our
$100 million as we get out to 2020 and not looking to move that number right now.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. Thank you. And then Albert, you kind of briefly kind of commented about loss cost
trends and kind of expectations. Maybe you can kind of get a little more detail in kind of
what you're seeing there? I know you commented on the professional lines and moreover
in a large classes is where they are seeing it. Any other areas that you're concerned
about?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Concerned, no because, A, we're watching it, we're reserving it properly and we're
pricing for it. And if we're not getting the rates we need, then we don't write it. So I
wouldn't say concerned. We are watching a number of lines. So one that I discussed
earlier in my prepared remarks, we've heard and we're seeing some high loss trends,
especially in large accounts D&O.
You've seen high activity in class actions, but you also know that we started taking serious
corrective action in our professional liability book, probably around $13 million, $14 million
and so we've significantly reduced our exposure to the large accounts, we've reduced our
Page 13 of 24

Date: 2018-10-25

FINAL

exposure to primary, we've increased attachment points. So where we are playing, we're
comfortable with the loss the trends that we're seeing.
We're not that exposed on the primary large account side. We've already spoken to you
about our concern around excess casualty and you'll recall earlier in this year, I was telling
you that notwithstanding the fact that we were seeing mid-to-high single-digit pricing
increases on excess casualty, we were still shrinking the book because we didn't think that
that was good enough the number. We're now seeing that number going into the doubledigits, which I think is more reasonable, and so we're pleased to see that going.
The other area that's obviously an issue for us is and it's affected our results is the
increased frequency around aviation and property. And that clearly needs more work to
make sure that we're not only are we getting the right pricing, but then we're also
adjusting our risk appetite and our portfolio construction to make sure that we get ahead
of that.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you, make sense. And then I'm just curious, on the Ogden, was there any benefit on
the year-over-year basis just in the attritional or loss ratios?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

There was Brian as we're now starting to earn through the rate increases that we got on
Ogden.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Right.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

And it was specifically in the motor book. Off the top of my head, I don't recall what that
number is. I can get that for you if you'd like. But it was pretty small in the quarter just as
it's continuing to earn in. We did get some rate last year in the first half of 2017. So there
was some rate already coming into the third quarter of 2018.

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

And there's a few points of improvement...

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

...in the loss ratio for excess motor as a result of that, but we expected that. Right. I
mean...

Q - Brian Meredith

Yes.

FINAL

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

...that was required because the rates changed after the bulk of the 1/1 renewal in the
prior year. So we had that drag for all of 2017, which obviously we're seeing disappearing
as we're getting through 2018.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Right. Right. Right. What's your outlook for what's going to happen with Ogden rate?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

My guess is that it's going to go up from 0.75%, but it can go to zero, it can go to 0.5%.
We don't have any, as you know, rates in Europe are much lower than they are in the U.S.
So, we don't hold any, any expectation that it's going to be a big number. But for the
moment, we continue to reserve it at minus 0.75%. We know that it's a prudent number,
but that's how we approach it.

Today's next question will be from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. My first question, Albert, in your prepared remarks when you were
discussing the reinsurance market you were alluding to some of the recent storms and
adverse development that we've seen from others is now potentially leading to a floor
with cat pricing.
So, I guess, this year's losses were much lower than last year's losses and it does seem
like they're -obviously there's still a lot of capacity in the market. So what gives you
comfort, I guess, it will be at a floor? And do you have an initial view on what we might see
at the upcoming January 1, 2019 renewal season?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

So, let me first answer the factual question. It's an interesting coincidence that there's
been several $100 million of adverse development that came up soon after the June 1
renewals. So, those were not reflected in the June 1 renewals. You've also seen significant
NAV reduction coming in the number of ILS funds. My view is that those kinds of
developments don't make people eager to reduce pricing even further.

Page 15 of 24



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2018-10-25

FINAL

So, again I'm very conscious of the capacity that there is out there, but I also don't see a
lot of reasons for significant price cuts. Now, there's one thing that I've learned in my
years in the business. It's, you're more likely to be wrong making predictions about the
next renewal. So I'm cautious. I don't expect a lot of change up or down. I'd like to believe
that it will be flattish maybe a little bit up, but whether you're plus 2% or minus 2%, I mean
that's close enough for horseshoes.
I don't expect major price movement either way, but I'd – it would really, I would find it
hurtful to see more pricing declines given the adverse development that we've seen in
this market.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then in terms of expenses you said in the prepared remarks, G&A normalized
was about 13.1%. Is that the right runway for modeling purposes? And then could you give
us a sense of how much of that $68 million of annualized savings to date is falling to the
bottom line?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yeah, Elyse, this is Pete. Right now, that $17 million in the quarter did fall to the bottom line,
so that was impactful on our G&A ratio. When I looked at normalized at $13.1 million in the
quarter, it's been coming down through the course of the year. We will continue to drive
our expenses on a go forward basis, but I think this quarter was an exceptionally good
quarter for us on an expenses basis and well, I don't want to project for your models I
would just say looking at where we are at year-to-date and then coming down from there
would be more appropriate way to look at it.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

And one comment on your question. When we gave the $100 million target Elyse, that
was net of, of additional investments elsewhere, so – and perhaps this is a follow on to
Brian. We fully intend that our gross savings are in excess of a $100 million. But we do
intend to invest some of those savings, so when we're announcing the $68 million, those
are net savings.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then, you guys pointed a couple of times spoke about the non-cat
weather and the impact on your insurance book in the quarter. We did see an impact last
quarter as well. So is it that you guys are looking to take more price to kind of account for
this being a new normal of elevated losses or do you expect the level of losses
normalized to more historical levels? And can we just get a little bit of color? Is this to – in
the U.S. and internationally, is this like fire or water losses? What's really driving this kind of
elevated non-cat losses that you guys saw in the past couple of quarters?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think, Elyse, it's an excellent question. And in fact, I think if you look at it, I would argue
that the last couple of years have been seeing higher than normal attritional losses in
Page 16 of 24

FINAL

property and frankly, we're seeing it a lot in the U.S., but we're also seeing it elsewhere in
the world. And it's not just kind of property, property, it's all property related lines. There's
energy on shore lines, there's some marine business. So when we talk, call it the property
losses, we're talking to the general class.
And I think that's – back to the question that I answered earlier, this is one of the areas
where we're putting extra attention because it's not just one spike quarter. The industry
has seen additional activity over the last several quarters and I think it requires both a
combination of improved pricing and a fresh look at the way we're approaching property
and the kind of risk that we're prepared to write and on what terms.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, great. That's helpful. And last question on investment income, you guys spoke kind
of bullish with the new money rates versus the yield in your current portfolio. Should we
kind of consider modeling, expecting growth on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter
and then continuing when we get into 2019? There was nothing kind of one-off in the
numbers in the quarter, correct?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

That's correct, Elyse. So I'd say there's nothing one-off in the quarter. So you know we are
feeling good about where the new money rate is and the duration of our portfolio, and
we believe that does provide upside opportunity in the future.

Today's next question will be from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. I guess, first question is around the
insurance accident year loss ratio. So if you look at the sequential move, it's roughly about
250 basis points of deterioration. I think you called out roughly 4 points of non-cat
weather, this quarter 3 points to 4 points, last quarter. So maybe you can talk a little more
about what else is driving that sequential change? I think in the prepared remarks you
talked about aviation, which is I think a relatively small component of your overall insurance
book. So any additional color on what may be driving that sequential change would be
helpful?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}
Page 17 of 24



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td

FINAL

I guess what I'd say is in the prepared remarks when I noted aviation that was really – this
is Pete Vogt – the year-over-year comparison to aviation. Actually sequentially from
second quarter to three quarter, aviation got better. Still not where we want it to be
elevated losses and as you know a smaller portion of our book.
With regard to the property, I think it's the same commentary that Albert has talked about
and that now we've discussed is, we're seeing elevated losses across most of our
property classes are coming from a variety of factors. And we are – it's sort of would be
the same issues that we would have seen in the second quarter that we've seen over the
last few quarters. It's just a little bit higher in this quarter than you saw in the second
quarter.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

So I guess I'm still a little confused because I thought you called out kind of 3 points to 4
points of non-cat weather related issues in 2Q, about four just north of 4 points in 3Q. So
on top of that non-cat weather you have additional roughly 250 basis points or 200 basis
points of deterioration property, is that's the way to think about it?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

I haven't looked at it quarter-to-quarter sequentially.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay.

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

So we can get back to you on the details of actually modeling that up, but I do know
property did get somewhat worse from the second quarter to the third quarter. So that
did happen. I don't have the exact numbers in front of me. We'll get back to you.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Okay, I'll follow up offline. And then on Jebi, I see you have about $10 million of losses
there compared to a 1-in-50 PML of just over $50 million. So is it fair to think about Jebi as
a kind of one in 10-year event at the most?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yeah, I think you can look at it as about a one in 10-year event for us. I mean, what we
would say is that we really aren't very heavily concentrated in Asia and so it would be
more of a one in 10 event.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yeah, if you look at our charts you can tell that we've got more exposure on Japanese
quakes than we have on Japanese winds. Historically Japanese wind was less attractive to
us than Japanese quake. And so that's just one part of the market where we have a
smaller market share.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. And then final question maybe more of a clarification point in professional lines, you
talked about loss trends still being in excess of pricing and yet you're growing into the
new – you're growing professional lines through new business. So I just want to be clear
here, the loss trends you were talking about in excess of pricing that's for the overall
market and yet you're seeing opportunities in ex-primary large accounts that are – where
pricing is better than loss trends, is that a fair way of thinking about it?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thanks, Yaron. I appreciate you're asking for the clarification. If you look at our
professional liability book, the bulk of the growth is actually coming from cyber.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And if you look at some of the other lines, frankly, there's – it's pretty stable and in some
cases, it's down. So the bulk of the increase that you're going to see for us is cyber, which
we find to be a very interesting line, just to give you a plug on cyber, I think it's a line of
business which is going to be very important for our industry going forward and we're
establishing leadership early on and we think that's going to be good for us going
forward.

Next question will be from Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks, and good morning. Just a few follow-ups. So the first question goes back to the
discussion on the Japanese PMLs. And I think you alluded to looking at the pricing and
then sort of thinking about the exposure. Is there like an upper limit in terms of how we
can think about what your PMLs could look like even if pricing goes up materially or how
should we think about any changes in your Japanese exposure down the road?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think that certainly, we would have appetite for more growth in Japan. I think if you look
at where we are in terms of the composition adding Japanese growth would probably
improve the diversification and the balance in the portfolio. So from a portfolio
construction perspective, we have some appetite as long as it's in the right price, but I
think we also have to be realistic.

Page 19 of 24



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity

FINAL

The Japanese clients are wonderful clients, they're loyal clients and they don't turn over
their panel willy-nilly every renewal, you have to work hard for every time you have an
opportunity to grow. So I think our appetite to grow would be there, if terms improve, but
we also have to be realistic as to how much potential growth there is given the behavior
of Japanese clients.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Fair enough. The other question I had was if you look at where the stock is trading at and
obviously there's a lot of market volatility and gyrations, have you sort of revisited or
rethought the discussion on buyback going forward in terms of the price to book multiple?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

So there are – there are two ways of – there's two comments in your question. So the first,
I'm happy to agree with you that the price is low, so you can do something about that. But
with regards to the repurchases, as we told you, the best time to do this is when we
finalize the plan, do the 1/1 renewals and we'll be happy to update our intentions on that
soon after the 1/1 renewals.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Got it. And final question, I think it was maybe Kai's question on or maybe Yaron's
question on the non-cat weather volatility. And again this has been in sort of a broader
discussion topic. Is there something which can be done or you might be doing differently
to address this non-cat volatilities, so that I guess the true earnings power can emerge?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I'm sure that's a question that is going through every single property underwriter and
executive in the industry right now because this is not an issue which is particular to AXIS. I
think what we're seeing is just as Peter mentioned earlier and we are looking at every one
of our property divisions higher frequency and certainly what we're hearing from others is
the same. And frankly, we're seeing that too in our reinsurance.
So we see what our clients are saying. I mean, short of not writing the business at all, I
think that you have to expose yourself. But I think if you see what we've done is we've
actually reduced our business in property. You'll recall that a little over a year ago, we
exited the large account property business in the U.S. and we did that because we felt
that there was a lot of volatility in the large account business, you had to put up big limits. I
mean you weren't getting pricing. So we got out of that.
We earlier at the end of last year beginning of this year, we announced our desire to get
out of onshore energy, again, because we felt that the losses weren't there. So I believe
that we are taking the right decisions with regard to markets that we believe are not likely
to move in the near future, and in the market that we believe are close to getting to the
right point of pricing. What we're trying to do is we're trying to modulate a foot on the
price pedal and a foot on the appetite and construction pedal.

Page 20 of 24



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td

Date: 2018-10-25

So I'm not sure that there is a silver bullet. I assure you if there were one, we would have
fired it a long time ago, but we're working through it right now. And my expectation is that
as you see our book emerge over 2019, it will be a modestly different book than we have
currently as we continue to execute on some changes in our portfolio appetite.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you very much. Just curious, if maybe it's possible to do a post-mortem on
Novae. The premium there ultimately did you renew more of it or less of it I think you
thought you would with the competition for that business more aggressive or less
aggressive than AXIS proper and, and how does the pricing you've gotten for those
pieces differ from what you're talking about broadly from the former AXIS book?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

That's an excellent question Josh. Thank you for asking. So I think what I would say with
regards to the book of business and now we've been in that company for over a year is
we've had absolutely no surprises. And I think that's always a good thing in an M&A
environment.
The second thing I will tell you is that we have not yet shed all of the business that we
were planning on shedding on Novae. So when we look at the book business we had a
sense of what we were getting, but you'll recall Josh that we took formal control of the
company only in October of last year, and that frankly limited some of the actions that we
could take in terms of the book of business that renewed at 1/1.
And so there were actions that we've taken subsequent to 1/1, but there are other books
of business where our next opportunity is at 1/1 and so there is more action that we've
been planning to take that we will take at 1/1. So that I think should help you there.
I think with regards to the book of business per se, see it's in the Lloyd's market, the way
the rest the same as the rest of our Lloyd's markets there isn't substantial difference
because in many cases we're competing for similar type business. What I will say is that
where this company has strong leadership positions and I look at lines of business like
marine liability, political and credit risk, cyber, that leadership combined to ours has really
made for a very powerful presence in the market. I'm really pleased with that.

And again, I'm quite aware of the things that were said when we acquired Novae last year,
but let's not deny that that book of business is delivering an underwriting profit year-todate and we're very proud of that accomplishment, and we're ahead, as Pete said, on the
synergies. So it's been a very good acquisition so far.

FINAL

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And given sort of this experience, can you talk about your appetite for pursuing name not
M&A per se, but large tracts of other books that you can improve the profitability of ?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

The truth is that right now our appetite is low. Never say never; I mean it's something
were to be really perfect. We would do it, but we also have to recognize that acquisitions
can be – certain acquisitions can be very distracting. One of the appealing factors with
Novae is that it was very focused on the one market where we wanted more scale, and
we were able to do that in a way that it not overly disturbed the rest of the operation.
Josh, we are so excited about the things that we are doing right now in our company that
I'm not sure that we would want the distraction of a large acquisition.

Let's be honest, I don't think Lloyd's has a choice. I think Lloyd's know it. I'm very excited
by the conversations that I'm having with the leadership at Lloyd's. I think they're
approaching it the right way. We have no choice at Lloyd's, but to reduce our costs and to
bring Lloyd's back to its core value add, which is not to provide capacity for binders and
MGAs, but to be the champion and the world capital for innovation and specialty risks.
And I think a smaller than a more profitable Lloyd's is more attractive to me than a Lloyd's
that just provides capacity at a cheap rate. And I have to tell you I'm not the only one who
feels that way, and I am confident that Lloyd's is going to work in that direction. And you
can rest assured that our voice at Lloyd's will be pushing in that direction.

Okay. And I guess implicit in that is the expectation that if there is incremental margin,
then (00:59:54).

FINAL

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yeah. The things we've been discussing about it is, I can't imagine a lot of executives in
other markets just lining up to say I'm really looking forward for a more of the business
that's so bad that Lloyd's doesn't want to write. I think, at some point, there's got to be
some rationality in the market. And there may be one or two markets that view this as an
opportunity to grow, but my view is that this market needs leadership. I think Lloyd's is
providing that leadership. And my hope certainly is that a lot of people will follow through.
And by the way we talked about one of the fears that some of these businesses could be
written in remote markets, but we've seen a number of companies literally get out of
Singapore. We've seen a stalling of the growth of Middle Eastern markets. We've seen
companies get out of Hong Kong. We see in the U.S. some of the strongest pricing that
we're seeing elsewhere. So, from my perspective, I don't see other than potentially in the
ILS market, I don't see any appetite for deteriorating results.

Okay, no, that's fantastic. And then one quick numbers question, I guess Pete, can you
quantify reinstatement premiums I guess both outward in insurance and inward in
reinsurance for the third quarter?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Well on the reinsurance side, Meyer, it was $33 million last year and I think it was pretty – I
don't think it was any this quarter. So that was a big driver of the year-over-year change in
the reinsurance GWP.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

And...

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

No – go ahead, I'm sorry.

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yeah, it was pretty – and there was really no reinsurance statement premiums on the
insurance side either this quarter.

FINAL

At this time, this will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the
conference back over to management for any closing remarks.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you, Brian. And to all of you, thank you for your time and interest this morning. As I
said at the beginning of today's call, this has been a quarter, we've continued to see
positive momentum in our business. Our transformation program, the integration of
Novae into our business and our efforts to grow market leaderships have generated real
traction.
And if you don't at all mind, I'd like to take a moment to express my appreciation to all the
members of our team for their continued commitment and hard work. Your actions have
helped put AXIS on a very strong fast-forward and together, we're owning our future. And
so to everyone, we look forward to updating you on continuing progress and
achievement in future calls. Thank you for your engagement and goodbye.
