Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our first quarter 2018
results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and
webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on
our website at www.travelers.com, under the Investors section.
Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial
Officer; and our three segment presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance;
Tom Kunkel, of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They
will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They
will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we
will take questions.
Before I turn it over to Alan, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note
included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking
statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves
risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may
differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due
to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in
our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to
update forward-looking statements.

Bloomberg Transcript

Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP
financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release,
financial supplement, and other materials available in the Investors section on our website.
And now, Alan Schnitzer.

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Thank you, Gabby. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. This
morning, we reported first quarter core income of $678 million, generating core return on
equity of 11.9%. Core income was up 10% over the prior-year quarter driven by higher pretax underwriting income and a lower U.S. corporate income tax rate. Catastrophe losses
of $280 million after-tax was slightly higher than the also unusually high level of
catastrophe losses in the prior-year quarter.
Results this quarter were impacted by, among other events, poor March nor'easters. One
of those storms, cat 15, generated high claim counts for us in Virginia, Maryland and
Washington, D.C., with some areas experiencing hurricane-force winds of up to 90 miles
an hour. Both historically and going forward on a model basis, we like the risk-adjusted
returns in the mid-Atlantic. And accordingly by design, we have meaningful market shares
in those states. Our results in the quarter were also impacted by mudslides in California
and a severe winter storm in the UK. So all-in, an unusual weather quarter. Despite the
high level of catastrophe losses, underwriting income increased and record Q1 net earned
premiums were a contributing factor. We achieved the top-line growth, while continuing to
deliver a strong underlying combined ratio of 92.4%.

FINAL

We also continued to invest in the strategic initiatives we've discussed with you, while
carefully managing our expense ratio. Our expense ratio has improved by about a 1 point
from the 2016 level and also down slightly from the prior-year quarter. We accomplished
that through disciplined growth in our top-line, disciplined expense management, and the
successful execution of our productivity and efficiency initiatives. Also noteworthy in the
quarter, pre-tax income from our fixed income investment portfolio increased the first
time since 2008. Jay will have more to say about that shortly.
Turning to the top-line and production, we are very pleased with the continued successful
execution of our marketplace strategies. Net written premiums grew by 5% to a first
quarter record of $6.8 billion, another strong quarter with growth in all segments. To a
large degree, this growth once again reflects high levels of retention and positive renewal
premium change. That speaks to the high-quality of the premium growth.

Bloomberg Transcript

Greg, Tom and Michael will provide more detail on production at the segment level, but I'll
take a minute to comment on the commercial pricing environment. Renewal rate change
in domestic Business Insurance reached 1.6 points with renewal premium change of 4.5
points. In both cases, the highest levels in three years. I'll also note that once again, we
achieved renewal rate gains in the quarter more broadly across our Middle Market
accounts compared to recent periods.
We're pleased with these results, particularly in light of the pricing pressure in the
workers' comp line. There's nothing about the workers' comp pricing environment so far
that surprises us, given the industry's favorable loss experience. Excluding workers' comp,
pure renewal rate change for domestic Business Insurance was up 3.3 points for the
quarter compared to 0.9 of a point a year ago and 2.4 points in the fourth quarter.
Importantly, we achieved pricing improvement and record retention. As you've heard us
say in terms of BI looking ahead, there's a gap between where returns are trending and
where we'd like them to be trending. So we'll continue to seek great gains thoughtfully
and deliberately.
I'll take just a minute to provide an update on strategic initiatives. As we explained at our
Investor Day last fall, we're investing and making sure that our competitive advantages
continue to set us apart in a changing world. We're focused on extending our lead in risk
expertise, improving the experience for our customers, agents, and brokers, and
enhancing productivity and efficiency. One of the specific initiatives we discussed was a
pilot program to complement our local underwriting expertise with centralized
underwriting of less complex accounts in lower-touch business centers.
To-date, we have all four planned business centers online and staffed to support our
Commercial Accounts business with all eligible renewals flowing through them. We expect
that all eligible new business will also be handled through the business centers over the
next couple of quarters. Although it's still early days, we're pleased with the productivity
gains we're seeing which free up our local underwriters to spend more time with our
agent and broker partners pursuing larger, more complex account opportunities.

FINAL

Quote activity is up, with the increases coming across all account sizes. Again, it's early,
but this is the type of outcome the business centers were designed to create. We're also
making progress on key initiatives in both our Bond & Specialty business and in Personal
lines. In Personal lines for example, we're pleased with the progress so far in the rollout of
our new Quantum Home 2.0 product. You'll hear more about that from Michael.
Lastly, before I turn it over to Jay, I'm pleased to report that as a reflection of confidence
in our business, our board of directors has declared a 7% increase in our quarterly
dividend to $0.77 per share. This marks the 14th consecutive year of dividend increases
dating back to the St. Paul-Travelers merger, bringing the compound annual growth rate in
the dividend to about 10% over that period.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay.

Thanks, Alan. As Alan said, we're pleased that core income was up 10% this quarter, $678
million versus $614 million in the prior-year quarter, which resulted in core ROE of 11.9%.
Catastrophe losses were $354 million pre-tax, which was unusually high for the first
quarter although comparable to last year's unusually high first quarter. Two significant
storms in March accounted for almost 70% of the cat losses: cat number 15, an unusual
winter windstorm in the Northeast U.S.; and cat number 17, a tornado hailstorm that did
considerable damage in the Southeast United States.
On a more positive note, net favorable prior-year reserve development, which I'll discuss
in more detail shortly, was $150 million pre-tax or $69 million higher than in the prior-year
quarter with each of our segments contributing. Our underlying combined ratio remained
strong at 92.4%, up only slightly from 91.7% in the prior-year quarter due to normal
quarterly variability in both loss activity, mostly from non-cat weather, and expenses.
Pre-tax net investment income of $603 million was slightly below the prior-year quarter,
but there's an important story underneath. In the past, you've heard me say over and over
again that fixed income NII declined due to historically low interest rates. This quarter, pretax fixed income NII of $500 million increased by $12 million compared to the prior-year
quarter, the first time we've seen an increase in many years. This was driven by the more
favorable interest rate environment, particularly for short-term rates, as well as an
increase on our average invested assets due to growing net written premiums in recent
periods. If you add in the benefit of the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate, fixed
income NII on an after-tax basis increased quarter-over-quarter by $36 million.
Looking forward to the rest of 2018, we'd expect after-tax fixed income NII to increase by
approximately $40 million to $45 million each quarter as compared to the corresponding
quarters of 2017. The non-fixed income portfolio continued to perform well, delivering $113
million of pre-tax NII. Within core income, income tax expense was lower than the prioryear quarter by $30 million, driven by a $74 million benefit in the current quarter that
resulted from the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate for all the tax-exempt income,

FINAL

partially offset by the inclusion in the prior-year quarter of a $39 million benefit that
resulted from successfully closing out our federal income tax exams for 2013 and 2014.
As I mentioned, consolidated net favorable prior-year reserve development was $150
million pre-tax this quarter compared to $81 million in the prior-year quarter. Business
Insurance's net favorable reserve development was $66 million pre-tax compared to $61
million in the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by better-than-expected loss experience
in domestic workers' comp and commercial property, partially offset by higher-thanexpected loss experience in domestic commercial auto.

Bloomberg Transcript

Bond & Specialty's PYD was $35 million pre-tax compared to $14 million in the prior-year
quarter, primarily driven by domestic management liability, while PI had net favorable
reserve development of $49 million pre-tax compared to $6 million in the prior-year
quarter, primarily driven by domestic homeowners and auto. On a combined statutory
Schedule P basis, all of our U.S. subsidiaries, all accident years across all product lines in
the aggregate and all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate, developed
favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development this quarter, except commercial
auto, which developed unfavorably by approximately $50 million pre-tax.
Operating cash flows of $554 million remained strong, although lower than first quarter
2017, primarily due to the relatively high level of cat claim payments. We ended the
quarter with holding company liquidity of almost $1.8 billion, and all of our capital ratios
were at or better than target levels. The recent run-up in interest rates that's benefiting
fixed income NII caused net unrealized investment gains to decrease considerably from
$1.1 billion after-tax at year end 2017 to $133 million after-tax at the end of the first quarter,
and this decrease in net unrealized investment gains was the driver behind a 3%
decrease in book value per share from year end 2017 from $87.46 to $85.03. I'll remind
you that changes in net unrealized investment gains or losses do not impact the manner
in which we manage our investment portfolio or our business. We generally hold fixed
income investments to maturity. The quality remains very high and changes in unrealized
gains and losses have little or no impact on regulatory capital.
Adjusted book value per share which excludes net unrealized investment gains or losses
was $84.54 or 1% higher than the beginning of the year and 4% higher than at the end of
last year's first quarter. We continue to generate much more capital than we need to
support our businesses despite the high level of cat losses, allowing us to return almost
$600 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter, consistent with our
ongoing capital management strategy. We paid dividends of $197 million and repurchased
$401 million of our common shares this quarter, including $350 million under our publicly
announced share repurchase program and $51 million to partially offset shares issued
under employee incentive plans, mostly to cover employee withholding taxes due upon
the vesting and pay out of performance and restricted stock awards. And as Alan said, the
board raised our quarterly dividend from $0.72 per share to $0.77 per share.
With that, let me now turn the microphone over to Greg.

Thanks, Jay. Business Insurance had a strong quarter with segment income of $452
million, up $10 million from the prior-year quarter, benefiting from a lower tax rate as well
as higher earned premium volume. The combined ratio of 97.5% included just under four
points of cat, an unusually high level for the first quarter as it was last year. The underlying
combined ratio of 95.5% was 1.1 point higher than the prior-year quarter, driven by loss
cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing as well as normal quarterly
fluctuations in both loss activity and expenses. The impact from loss cost trends
exceeding earned pricing that I just referenced has moderated from recent quarters and
was in line with our expectation.
Net written premiums for the quarter were $4 billion, up 4% over the prior-year quarter
with domestic net written premiums up 3%, driven by strong production results.
International net written premiums were up 3%, excluding the impact of changes in
foreign currency rates.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to domestic production, retention improved to a record 86% from an already high
level and new business was strong at $525 million. As Alan mentioned, renewal rate
change was 1.6 points and renewal premium change was 4.5 points. We're pleased with
these results, particularly considering the pricing pressure in workers' comp associated
with strong industry profitability.
Outside of comp, we were encouraged that we achieved renewal rate gains broadly
across the product portfolio as rate in auto, property, umbrella, CMP, and GL increased for
the third consecutive quarter on both the sequential and year-over-year basis. Auto
continues to be the line with the highest level of rate, while property has improved
meaningfully from a year ago, particularly in loss impacted areas. Our results for the
quarter reflect our continued deliberate and successful execution in the marketplace.
Turning to the businesses, in Select, as with all our businesses, we're making strategic
investments in technology and workflow initiatives to drive growth and we're encouraged
with the progress we're making. Retention remained strong at 83% and new business
was up 8% from the prior-year quarter. Renewal rate change remains positive. Given the
returns in this business, we're pleased with these production results.
Turning to Middle Market, retention remained historically high at 88%. Renewal premium
change was 3.9 points with renewal rate change of 1.5, up from 1.3 in the fourth quarter
and up a 1 point from a year ago. New business premiums of $318 million were strong and
consistent with the prior-year quarter. So all-in for the segment, it was a good start to
2018 and we're pleased with our market execution. And given the early adoption from our
distribution partners, we're encouraged about the impact that our technology and
workflow initiatives will have on our results.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom to talk about Bond & Specialty Insurance.

Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty's operating results were very strong with segment income
of $173 million, up $28 million from the prior-year quarter due to a higher level of favorable
PYD and higher earned premium volume. The underlying combined ratio was also very
strong at 80.7%, more than a 1 point lower than the prior-year quarter, reflecting
improvements in both the underlying loss and expense ratios. As to the top-line, net
written premiums for the quarter were up 6%, driven by solid growth in both our domestic
surety and domestic management liability businesses. The increase in the surety net
written premium was driven by a mix of relatively larger bonds in the quarter.
Turning to production in our domestic management liability businesses, we continue to
execute our strategy to retain a substantial percentage of our high-quality portfolio, while
pursuing attractive new business. We are pleased that the retention came in at a record
high of 89% for the quarter and that new business was strong, up 11% from the first
quarter last year. Renewal premium change of 3.6 points was up from the fourth quarter
due to an increase in exposure. So, Bond & Specialty results were excellent, and we
continue to feel great about our growth and returns as well as the opportunities that our
strong market positions and competitive advantages present for the future.
And now, I'll turn it over to Michael who will talk to you about Personal Insurance.

Bloomberg Transcript

Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Personal Insurance began the year by
continuing to deliver on our objectives of improving auto profitability, while maintaining
momentum in our Homeowners business. Net written premiums of $2.3 billion grew 8%,
once again driven by higher pricing, primarily in auto and healthy growth in Homeowners
policies in force.
Personal Insurance segment income of $129 million was up from $89 million in the prioryear quarter with an improvement in the combined ratio to 97.5%, primarily due to higher
favorable reserve development. Catastrophe losses contributed nine points to the
combined, an unusually high level for our first quarter, but similar to last year.
On an underlying basis, improved profitability in auto was essentially offset by a higher
level of non-cat weather losses in property. Importantly, we remain pleased with the
expense ratio of 26.8%. It's worth noting that the expense ratio for this segment has
improved by about three full points from 2013, the year we announced the start of our
cost reduction initiatives.
In Agency Auto, the combined ratio for the quarter was 94.8%, down considerably from
the prior-year quarter due to a 2.3 point improvement in the underlying combined ratio,
driven by the rate actions taken in the past several quarters, along with a 2.3 point benefit
from favorable prior-year development. As a reminder, the first quarter combined ratio is
typically a couple of points lower than average due to seasonality.
In Agency Homeowners, the first quarter combined ratio of 98.5% included almost 21
points of cat losses and a benefit of 2.4 points from favorable prior-year development.
Page 7 of 26



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2018-04-24

The underlying combined ratio of 80.2% was 2.6 points higher than the prior-year quarter,
driven primarily by higher non-cat weather losses.

FINAL

Turning to the top-line, Agency Auto premiums grew by 9%, and we achieved 10 points of
renewal premium change, down slightly from the peak of 11 points last quarter, in line with
our plans. Retention declined modestly, as expected, given the pricing actions and PIF
levels in Auto have been holding steady.
In Agency Homeowners & Other, premiums increased by 5%, demonstrating continued
momentum with another quarter of healthy PIF growth. Our efforts to maintain the steady
increase in property policies in force have been successful, even as we have intentionally
slowed the PIF growth in Auto.
As Alan mentioned, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we introduced our newest property
product, Quantum Home 2.0 in three states and so far, the response from agents and
customers is in line with our expectations. Early returns are demonstrating the benefits of
Quantum Home 2.0's flexibility, sophistication and ease-of-use. We'll roll out several more
states during the second quarter and then continue with waves of five or so states at a
time throughout 2018 and 2019. The gradual rollout and implementation should enable us
to sustain the momentum we've already generated and support profitable, steady
growth going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

With that, I'll turn the call back over to Alan.

Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Thanks, Michael. Before I turn it back to Gabby to open it up for Q&A, I'll share with you
that we've just returned from our annual conference with our most significant distribution
partners who collectively represent about half of our premium. We all left with the
continued confidence in the strength of our relationships with these business leaders and
their firms and feeling tremendous support for the strategic initiatives that we have
underway. It's a great reminder that our position with distribution is an important
competitive advantage and one that's hard to replicate.
On the customer side, we also just returned from RIMS, the annual conference for the
large account risk management community. We were honored to receive National
Underwriter's Risk Manager Choice Awards in five lines of business, the most of any
company. Taking together the feedback we're receiving from our customers, agents, and
brokers suggests that we're on the right track in our work to continue to lead the market
in understanding risk in the products and services our customers need and to provide
them with great experiences.
Lastly, as some of you know, after a decade of leading Investor Relations for us, Gabby
Nawi has been recruited away by our own Travelers Personal Insurance team to take a
role in their finance group, which is great for her and great for us. Gabby's insights have
been incredibly valuable to me and the entire leadership team. I'm grateful, and we all
wish her continued success. We'll be announcing her successor shortly.

{BIO 2211991 <GO>}

Thanks, Kai.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Yeah. My first question is on pricing. If I do the math, first quarter increase in BI 1.6%, but if
you look by segments, Select Accounts up 0.2% and Middle Market up 1.5%, which implied
maybe the National Property and Others increased much more. So can you compare and
contrast for us like the deceleration in term price increase in the small accounts, why big
increase in the national accounts?

A - Gregory C. Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Hey, Kai, this is Greg Toczydlowski. Good morning. Just to answer the first part of that
question, yeah, you're correct. The reason why the two of the businesses that are
illustrated in the documents are below the total is because of the National Property
business. We've been very successful in achieving rate, and particularly in the cat exposed
areas in National Property, and that's what you're seeing when that rolls up into that total
number.
In terms of Select, the second part of your question, we've shared with you for some time
now around how we've been thinking about that business and how we've been very
focused of having an adequate set of returns in that business, and we're very
comfortable with the returns in that business right now. So that's a output of a lot of
deliberate execution of really thoughtfully growing that business because we are
returning the returns that are hitting our thresholds today in that business. So that's what's
underneath that.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Great. My follow-up question is for Alan. You mentioned perform and transform in your
annual letter. I just want to follow up on the transform part. And could you tell us a bit
more about initiatives, both internally as well as potential acquisitions on that front?

FINAL

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. Sure, Kai. Thanks for the question. Thanks for reading the annual letter. I guess I'd
refer you back to our Investor Day, and we discussed there the forces of change we see
impacting our business and the need to make sure that our competitive advantages
continue to set us apart in a world that's obviously changing. We've been incredibly
successful over the last decade or two, and the competitive advantages we've had have
served us very well. But we're very mindful that what's going to make us successful over
the next decade to some degree will be different than what's made us successful. And so
at a broad level, we've set two objectives: we want to be the undeniable choice for the
customer, and we want to be an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers.

Bloomberg Transcript

And underneath that, we've got three priorities that ladder up to that. So one of the
things that's made us successful for a long time is an expertise in risk in the products and
services our customers need. We've put that on a pedestal for a long time, and we'll
continue to put that on a pedestal and invest in that. So think data analytics, third-party
data, that type of thing.
In addition, we are highly focused on the experience for our customers and our agents
and brokers, and some of the technology and workflow investments you've heard us talk
about are designed to do that. And then third, productivity and efficiency. We're highly
focused on just making sure that we've got the ability to do more with less, and that
creates flexibility for us. It gives us the opportunity to take the output of the productivity
and efficiency and either let that fall to the bottom line, invest it in new or other strategic
initiatives, or put it in the price if we need to. So there's a lot of things going on across the
company and in all three of our business segments, in our technology group, in claim, but
all of the things that we're working on ladder up really inside of that framework. And we
talked about a lot of those specifically at Investor Day, and so I'd refer you back to that
maybe for more specifics.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Do you need acquisitions to transform the business?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

So do we need acquisitions? I do not think we need acquisitions, Kai, but nobody should
take away from that that we're not highly focused on it, right. I've said for a long time and
I'll continue to say that our shareholders should demand that we are active in terms of
M&A, and that in the lines of business that we're interested in and in the geographies
we're interested in that we are very active, and we are and we will continue to be.
We often say some of the best deals we do are the best deals we don't do, so we're
highly disciplined about it. And we've shared with you many times what the lens is for
Page 10 of 26



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The

Date: 2018-04-24

FINAL

thinking about transactions. So we're anxious to do them if they improve our return
profile, if they lower volatility, or if they provide another important strategic benefit for us,
and so highly focused on looking at things that match up to that criteria. But no, we don't
feel like we need to do it.
And I would say, Kai, that again, you shouldn't take away from this any change or
propensity to think about or do a deal. But one of the things that we think more and more
about today that maybe we didn't 5 or 10 years ago is the opportunity cost and the
potential distraction from focus on all the organic innovation that we're doing. We think it's
really important in a changing world. We think that there's a real benefit to doing that.
We've got the resources. We've got the talent. We've got the intellect. We've got the lack
of distraction. And so, again, you shouldn't take away any change or propensity to do a
deal, but that's a wrinkle we think about when we assess M&A.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Thank you. On the Business Insurance side, when you talk about your retention being now
at I guess an all-time high or certainly a multiple year high, is that the plan? I mean you've
got to balance obviously pricing, new business, and retention. Do you feel as if that
retention is getting up even too high? Or maybe what would be too high?

A - Gregory C. Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Good morning, Jay. This is Greg. Yeah, we spend a lot of time looking at the combination
of retention, new business, and rate all the time. But most of the time it's not at the
macro level of what we're looking at, it really is a very granular and local execution. We
think we have a high-quality book of business, and so we like the retention of where it's
at. We're very comfortable with that, and we're trying to retain that book as much as
possible. Obviously, a competitive marketplace out there right now, but when you look at
the combination of retention, new business, and rate, we're comfortable with where all
three of those are.

FINAL

That's helpful, Greg. Thank you. Just one follow-up on Homeowners, the deterioration
from last year on the underlying number, you mentioned some of that or a lot of it was
due to non-cat weather. Is it possible to quantify that relative to what you normally would
expect?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Sure, Jay. This is Michael. I mean, I think what I would say is when you look at cat and noncat weather, first of all, you have to remember that the way that we parse that between
one category and the other, the dollars can move from one bucket to another based on
the magnitude and the type of the events we're experiencing. So it's a little bit artificial to
give you a number for the non-cat weather variance. But round numbers, you can think of
that as a sort of point or two in the quarter. But, again, some of that is dependent upon
the mix between cat events and non-cat events, but I would say one point or two points
of adverse relative to expectations in the quarter.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks and good morning. Two quick questions. The first question goes back, I guess, to
the discussion on pricing. In your letter you talk about the more significant factor being the
low interest rates and loss cost inflation outpacing pricing gains. Would it be possible to
get your view on interest rates and loss cost inflation with some specificity?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. Amit, I'm not sure what – good morning. I'm not sure what specificity you're looking
for. And what we've consistently said certainly in BI is we think about loss trend as a 4%
across the whole book. Obviously, different lines, different businesses have different loss
trends in them, but over time, we think about it as a 4%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. No, I guess what I was trying to ask if there is obviously a lot of
debate amongst the investors with the rising interest rate and the near-term rise in the
10-year and how should they be thinking about loss cost. And has that changed your view
versus, let's say, going into end of Q4? I guess that's what I was asking. Has there been
any urgency in terms of how you're thinking about pricing versus loss cost. Or based on I
guess your answer, there is no real change based on the long-term view? Is that a fair
assertion?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

I got it. I mean, I got your question. So I would say that despite where loss trends have
been, we always assume that there is a return to a more normal level in inflation. So
certainly, there's no sense of panic or urgency when generally what we've been seeing is
generally inside of our expectations, we see that CPI moving, but as you know from us,
we're most heavily leveraged to medical wage and tort inflation.
And sometimes that's good for us, right. When you've got wage inflation, for example,
that contributes to exposure in workers' comp payrolls would be one example of that.
There's probably benefits on the investment income from a rising rate environment. And
to the extent that there is inflation that is contributing to loss cost that wouldn't
necessarily surprise us because we do expect some of that. What's important is what is
inflation relative to our expectations and do we have the data analytics, knowhow,
wherewithal to see it when it comes, and we think we do. So, no sense of urgency. And I
would say generally speaking across all of our businesses, more or less in line with
expectations.

FINAL

Okay. That's helpful. And my final question is going back to, I guess, Kai's question. In your
letter you talk about you're going to look for opportunities, etc., lower our volatility. Does
that rule out, I guess, the reinsurance companies or hybrid companies making the cut?
The reason why I ask is clearly there's a lot of debate and discussion amongst the other
companies and are we seeing the Validus and XL question, the acquisition? So I'm just
wondering would that be a nonstarter based on your comments regarding the volatility or
am I reading too much into the letter?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Well, let me answer it two ways. Yes, I think you're reading too much into it, in that we
don't mean to include or exclude anything categorically. So I wouldn't read that to exclude
anything. Having said that, I'll tell you that we've been pretty explicit over a reasonably
long period of time that just given our core capabilities and skill sets, reinsurance isn't a
business that's been particularly attractive to us.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

Hi. Good morning. My first question, I'm looking at the outlook in your 10-Q. You guide
within Business Insurance 0.2%, renewal premium changed and you compare it to last
year saying that it's going to be higher than the 2017 level. How do you see the back three
quarters of the year in reference to the first quarter? And then also, if you can tie in your
response to that question, did you see rate momentum pick up as we went through the
months of the quarter, meaning was March rates higher than what you had seen in
January?

FINAL

Yeah, Elyse, so the way we gave the outlook this period was to tell you that for the back
three quarters of the year, it will be higher than the back three quarters of the prior year.
And I think we'll leave it there and probably not comment on where it's going to come in
relative to the first quarter. And, yes, there was some pricing momentum quarter-toquarter throughout the first quarter. I'm sorry...

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

It increased month to month throughout the quarter is what I meant to say.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And then my second question, in terms of the Business Insurance
margin, you guys said that earned rate was below trend in the quarter, in line with
expectations. When you think about your outlook for the year and based off of the rate
you're taking, when do you think in your minds earned rate should start to exceed trend?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

There's a lot of estimation involved with that, Elyse, because there are some components
of exposure that we consider to be economically like rate. So it's hard to give you the
precise date or time at which that's going to happen, but I can tell you that we're getting,
at least on a written basis, pretty close if not there already.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

And in terms of exposure growth that you guys see more or less as rate, could that pick
up in the quarter or two within the renewal premium change?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. I think exposure was pretty consistent – positive, but pretty consistent throughout
the quarter.

Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Thank you. In Business Insurance, the underlying combined ratio deteriorated year-overyear. And I know you gave some insight on that. I was just hoping you can discuss it a little
further, given I think the expectation for the full year was for it to be slightly better yearover-year?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. So we gave you a view on the underlying and it's insurance. There's always going to
be things that impact normal volatility and that's really what we saw. So let's call it about 1
point. About half of that was rate versus loss trend. And by the way, as Greg said, that's
moderated. It's better than where it was in prior quarters, and we think that's heading in
the right direction, as I just said in answering Elyse's question. And the rest of it is just
normal volatility on losses and expenses, and we see that from time to time. So think
weather, think large losses, think mix, all the sorts of things that impact period to period
volatility.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Okay. So you still think for the full year 2018 could be a better underlying in Business
Insurance than 2017?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Well, we gave you the outlook and we said underlying margins higher compared to the
prior year and underlying combined ratio slightly lower compared to same period to prior
year.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

I see. Okay. On the pricing side, that was helpful to give the rate change ex-worker's
comp, but workers comp is a major portion of premium volumes. So I'm wondering should
we expect, given the downward pressure on comp, any overall further improvement in
the pace of rate in BI?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Well, I mean, we certainly give you the outlook in the 10-Q relative to the prior year. And
as you heard me just say, we think it's going to continue to be higher year-over-year and I
think we'll probably stop there.

growth although profitability certainly improved. I'm wondering if given the sharp slow
down in PIF growth, could that go negative in personal auto?

FINAL

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Thanks, Jay. It's Michael Klein. It certainly could. I think we would look at it and say plus or
minus a point or around flat is where we're anticipating, it's going to bottom. And
obviously, it will depend upon our rate actions relative to the market and how they are
absorbed. But at least at this point, if it does go negative, we think it will be slightly, and
our objective would be to put the auto book sort of back on the trajectory for growth
towards late 2018.

Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please
go ahead.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Hey, thanks. I guess just keeping it on personal auto. If you could just maybe tell us about
how the competitive environment has changed, I guess, in the first three months of the
year, if there's been any change following the tax reform bill? Thanks.

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

I would say the competitive environments remain broadly consistent. We track
predominantly, our indicator for that would be tracking rate filings amongst our
competitors, and we see a little bit of bouncing around there. And there was a little bit of
a slow down in competitor rate in the first quarter if you review competitor filings, but a lot
of that has probably more to do with just the typical timing of when filings are made than
it does anything to do with the impact that tax is on rate filings.
And if you broaden that slightly and just say when you think about the tax impact on filed
rate, particularly in auto, our perspective is that it closes the gap, but it doesn't eliminate
it. The estimated industry combined ratio for auto stays – it remains in the 105 to 107
range, depending upon which estimates you look at. So think round numbers, there is at
least a 10 point rate need for the industry there. And all else being equal, maybe tax
reform drops at a couple of points, but it's not going to mitigate the rate need and won't
be a key driver of reduced rate activity in the marketplace we don't think.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

FINAL

That's helpful. And then I guess on the BI side, drilling down into the normal volatility
component of the combined ratio deterioration. Would you say that that just related to
property type losses? Or was there a casualty component as well? I'm curious if you're
seeing maybe an increased frequency in casualty related claims.

A - Gregory C. Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Hey, Ryan, this is Greg. Yeah, just to echo Alan's earlier comments and give you a little
more texture for your comment, it was a mix of different product lines, but it
predominantly was property. You can think about some of the extreme weather that we
had in the first quarter and there would be a cat window of a certain period of time and
you can think frozen pipes that extend beyond that window of time that is the large loss
activity like that would be driving some of the volatility there.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Got it. And then just one more on just your commercial auto, $50 million of adverse
development. That's obviously been a line we've identified as somewhat problematic.
Just curious what you saw this quarter that maybe was different and led to the reserve
addition?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah, Ryan, obviously not a new story. We've been watching it. We react to the data that
we have. It's the line we are getting the most rate in, and we're underwriting for it. And in
the quarter, a little bit more severity on the smaller claims actually is what we saw.

Q - Joshua D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yeah, thank you very much. I want to congratulate you, but also have some questions on
the dividend. You pointed out that over the past 14 years, it's gone up by 10%. But the last
two years, the increase has been 7%. How does the dividend policy relate to your view of
EPS growth? And how do you consider cash flow for repurchases versus dividends? And I
guess I'm getting it finally, why the slowdown in the rate of the dividend growth?

Page 18 of 26



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2018-04-24

FINAL

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Hi, Josh, this is Jay. So in looking at our dividend, we look at that in relation to a number of
things. One is what the dividend yield is, another is what the payout ratio is, how that
compares to others in the industry, and the science behind it as well as a lot of judgment.
If you look back at where things were several years ago, balancing all that out, and also
given the size of the decreases in the average number of shares outstanding because of
all the buybacks, all of that translated into the actions that you saw before. With our stock
price at the level that it's at now, even buying back the same dollar amount, we're buying
back fewer shares.
So keeping the payout in terms of dollars somewhere in the $750 million to $800 million
range, again, getting back to yield and payout ratios has caused us to look at something
more in line with 7% as opposed to 10%. But we look at what we think our future earnings
are going to be over a relatively short period of time and make that determination.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Josh, I would just add to that. We understand that there's a component of our
shareholder base that's looking for the dividend, and we want to make sure that we're
paying a competitive dividend rate for that component of our shareholder group, but this
is also insurance and there's a lot of uncertainty, and we want to make sure that we set it
at a level where under hopefully just about any foreseeable circumstance, we continue to
pay that dividend and don't have to rethink it. So that, in addition to what Jay shared,
those two factors play into the decision as well.

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

And then I would add one other thing to what Alan just said that as you know, we have an
ongoing policy of returning capital that we don't need to support our business to the
shareholders. So whether it's an increase in dividends or whether it's the share
repurchases, all of it balances out to returning the excess capital. And that's not changed.

FINAL

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Larry, it's Michael. Thanks for the question. I would say auto is coming in about where we
expected it. As I think Jay mentioned, we did have favorable prior year development in
auto. But importantly, that was really driven mostly by catastrophes and loss adjustment
expenses. So, sort of more of a one-off driver of that PYD than sort of a change in our
view of underlying dynamics. So I wouldn't read too much into the auto PYD in that
commentary. But I would say broadly it's coming in about as expected, and we're pleased
with it.

faster than it has been in previous quarters and I was hoping you could explain what's
going on?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning, Meyer. So let me start with a total and I'm happy to go further into
the segments. But simply business and FX would be about half of it for the total. And the
other half, now we're getting into relatively small dollars on the total G&A base, the other
half would be timing. So extrapolating out to the segments per Business Insurance, most
of it gets explained through simply business and through FX. In Personal Insurance, it's
variability and contingent commissions and then some timing.

Q - Meyer Shields

FINAL

Thanks, Meyer. It's Michael I'll take it and I think you're right. It could be broader than PI,
but I'll sort of address it broadly. First, they did recently announce that they're making
those changes, but it's important to know that it's not a brand-new initiative for them. So
certainly, and I'm sure you're all well aware that through Harleysville and Allied they trade
with independent agents already as a corporation.
But even underneath the Nationwide brand, they've had a number of Nationwide captive
agents that have had access to the independent agent market already. And in fact, they
have an operation called Nationwide Broker Services that those captive agents can access
other markets through, and Travelers is one of many companies that actually trade with
that brokerage services organization. So a) it's not brand-new. It's something that we've
seen and been monitoring. And in fact, it's a trading relationship that we have.
I would say on balance, we have a couple of observations. First of all, Alan mentioned our
strength with independent agent distribution as a franchise. We think that's continued
competitive advantage for us and is our primary focus in terms of distribution. But I would
say that we primarily view this change as an opportunity to explore additional distribution
points.

Bloomberg Transcript

We will certainly monitor and evaluate Nationwide's performance with independent
agents as we monitor and evaluate any competitor's results in the independent agent
channel. But again, on balance, we'd say something that's been developing for a while
and on the margin probably more an opportunity than a threat.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on your latest thoughts on U.S. tax reform and
the impact of competition. And given you've seen in other industries like mortgage
insurance, you saw one company pass along the entire benefit to customers. Does that
change your view now at all about the impact on competition and pricing?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, Sarah. No, it really doesn't. We've said pretty consistently that we've
got some ground to cover and tax reform helps, but it doesn't close the gap. And you
really have to look at our pricing objectives holistically. So you got to take into account
capital requirements and the adequacy of expiring prices and loss trend and the tax rate.
Page 22 of 26



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The

FINAL

And we put all those things into the blender and what comes out is, as we look ahead of
rate need. So we continue to think current course and speed.
And from a market perspective, again, I'll just remind you that not the whole market
benefits from tax reform. You've got both U.S. and domestic insurers who are positioned
differently from a tax perspective. And even among U.S. competitors those that don't
have a significant underwriting profit or an underwriting loss don't benefit to the same
degree as those with an underwriting profit. So it's not like the entire P&C business. The
trades in the U.S. is all of a sudden flush and returns are, I think, at target levels.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Okay, great. Thanks. And then just following up on the Business Insurance pricing, I think
you've talked about previously pushing for price increases to keep pace with loss inflation
which is about 4%. But do you think you can get there if you are keeping Select Accounts
flat? It seems like you would need a lot of price increase in the other sub-segments of
Business Insurance and I'm just wondering to what extent that's achievable?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yes, Sarah, so it's sort of a broad aspirational comment that we would like pricing to keep
up with loss trend. We think that makes sense, but we don't execute for that headline
number, right? We look at every account. We look at the circumstances of that account
and assign a rate need to it and then try to achieve that. And what you heard Greg say is
what we did on the small end was a function of deliberate execution, given where the
returns are. And so you got that factor, you've got workers comp, you've got all sorts of
things that will drive the headline number. Just as a reminder though, we're really
executing on account-by-account basis.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Gabriella Nawi

{BIO 2211991 <GO>}

Next question, please.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Please go
ahead.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, everybody. First question on Business Insurance and renewal rate
change there. So just given the momentum you've seen months-over-months during the
quarter and the fact that less of your workers comp or I guess less of the renewals will be
workers comp weighted. In the remaining three quarters of the year would it be fair to
expect may be further acceleration of rate change?

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

I'm not sure we agree with the workers comp weighting observation by the way. I'm not
sure that's true.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

I wouldn't say that's going to be a significant driver. And just in terms of outlook, Yaron, we
give you a perspective in the outlook section of the 10-Q and we're probably not going to
go beyond that. So I hope that's helpful.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Okay. With regards to weighting, I was just referring to the 30-some percent of workers
comp premium that renews in the first quarter as opposed to 20-some percent the rest
of the year. And I guess, the other question I had was just with regards to the large noncat weather losses. So if those remain at the level we've seen this quarter, are you still
comfortable with the guidance you offer for the year in terms of margin improvement in
Business Insurance?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

The guidance that we give you, one is on an underlying basis, so it excludes cat. And two,
we do say explicitly in the 10-Q that it assumes a return to lower more normal levels of
weather and other loss activity. So we are assuming a return to more normal levels.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

A - Gabriella Nawi

{BIO 2211991 <GO>}

And this will be our last question please.

Operator
Our final question will come from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks. So drilling down on the Business Insurance pricing just a little bit more here.
Can you talk about how you kind of saw it, it improved I guess month-to-month you said.
But if you were thinking about kind of what the pricing environment looked like when we
had your fourth quarter conference call to today, is it in line, better, worse than you kind of
were expecting it to competitive pressures maybe a little bit more or less?

FINAL

It's probably finer than we want to parse it. We start getting into competitively sensitive
information there. So that's probably finer than we want to parse it. I did say in my remarks
that we did achieve rate gains more broadly across accounts, that's true, and that's a
trend that I think was quarter-to-quarter throughout the year and probably going back five
quarters or so. So I will share that color, but parsing it beyond that is probably more detail
than we want to provide.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. And then just last question here. If I look at the exposure change and you've talked
about how that exposure change, there's part of it that actually has an impact on margins.
Is there kind of a general kind of percentage of that that we should think as part of
margins? Is it half of it, is it two-thirds of it?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

We've always resisted in giving that because there's so much estimation involved. So all
we said is that it's not insignificant, but we've stopped short of really quantifying that.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Thanks. Gave it a try. Thanks.

A - Gabriella Nawi

{BIO 2211991 <GO>}
