{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are
very pleased to report third quarter core income of $798 million or $3.12 per diluted share
and core return on equity of 13.5%. Our bottom line results this quarter reflects strong
underlying underwriting income resulting from record net earned premium of $7.4 billion
and an underlying combined ratio that improved 2.6 points to a strong 91.5%. We're
pleased with the underwriting results in all three segments with improved underlying
profitability in both Business Insurance and Personal Insurance.
In Business Insurance, the underlying result improved due to margin expansion as earned
rate exceeded loss trend. In Personal Insurance, the benefits from lower frequency in the
auto business more than offset higher levels of non-catastrophe weather and wildfire
losses. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, the underlying combined ratio was elevated
consistent with the outlook we shared on the call last quarter. I'll note that the combined
and underlying combined ratios were still under 90%, generating a solid return in a
challenging environment. Profitability in all three segments continues to reflect the
benefits of our strategic focus on productivity and efficiency resulting in a sub-30%
consolidated expense ratio.
Core income for the quarter also included catastrophe losses of $397 million pre-tax
which were meaningfully above the 10-year average for the quarter. I want to
acknowledge the devastation caused by recent catastrophes. We hope for a quick
recovery for all those who have been impacted. I also want to express my gratitude to our
dedicated claim team for taking care of our customers during these extraordinary times.

FINAL

Of the 100,000 or so claim notices we have received so far this year and rising of the
record number of PCS catastrophes in the U.S., our claims team has met our objective of
closing with 90% of the claim within 30 days. A quick resolution results in a better
experience for our customers and a more efficient outcome for us.
I also want to acknowledge the actions our underwriting and risk management teams
have taken over recent years to manage our exposure to weather volatility. In addition to
the property aggregate treaty which has mitigated our losses, recent actions to improve
the balancing risk and reward meaningfully reduced our exposure to wildfires. To illustrate
the point, in the areas impacted by the five costliest California wildfires this season, our
exposure is about a third lower than it was two years ago.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to our investment portfolio, this quarter we again benefited from our well-defined
and consistent investment philosophy, with our high-quality investment portfolio
generating net investment income of $566 million after tax. Lastly, before I turn to the top
line, I'll share that the uncertainty surrounding business interruption claims continues to
resolve favorably and consistent with our expectations, and we remain confident on that
front. In terms of the topline and production, we continue to generate strong results. Net
written premiums in the quarter grew by 3%, driven by strong renewal rate change and
retention in all three segments.
In our commercial businesses, exposure change on renewed accounts was only modestly
negative for both the quarter and year-to-date compared to a much more significant
reduction in economic activity. We believe that in addition to generating a better
underwriting result, our high-quality portfolio of accounts is more resilient to economic
hardship.
In Business Insurance, we achieved record renewal rate change of 8.2%, 4 points higher
than the prior-year quarter, while retention remained strong. We achieved higher renewal
rate change year-over-year and sequentially in each of our lines of business other than
workers' compensation.
In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 4% as renewal premium
change in our domestic management liability business rose to 8.1%, including record
renewal rate change, while retention remained at and historical high.
In Personal Insurance, net written premiums increased by 8%, driven by strong retention in
new business in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners. In our Agency Homeowners
business, we achieved renewal premium change of 8.2%, its highest level since 2014.
Across all of our businesses, we've made good progress in achieving rate gains and
managing other levers of profitability to improve the outlook for returns in those lines that
need it and we'll continue to execute to meet our return objectives. For all the reasons
we've discussed previously, from the loss environment to the interest rate environment,
we expect continued momentum in the marketplace.

Notwithstanding our focus on successfully managing through the pandemic and
addressing other headwinds impacting the industry, it's important to note that we haven't
been distracted from pursuing our strategic agenda. We remain focused on leveraging
our scale and resources to continue to invest and innovate. As we've said before, we
believe the winners in our industry will be those with deep domain expertise that can
deliver industry leading results while innovating successfully on top of a foundation of
excellence. From a position of strength we continue to focus our efforts on extending our
advantage in risk expertise, providing great experiences and improving productivity and
efficiency.
In our commercial businesses, we continue to make progress in digitizing virtually every
aspect of the value chain, while at the same time enhancing our advanced analytics. Just
as one example, our BOP 2.0 small commercial product which we launched in 2019
benefit from both. In the states in which we've rolled it out, we've seen about a 15%
increase in both submissions and new business premiums. This product uses AI and thirdparty data to improve underwriting segmentation, operational efficiency and the age and
experience. To that point, the artificial intelligence eases the burden on the agent and has
resulted in a substantial improvement in classification accuracy.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Personal Insurance, we're balancing sophisticated total account solutions with
streamlined agent and customer experiences. For example, we've completely redesigned
the experience of our IntelliDrive auto telematics offerings and introduced a distraction
reading. We rolled this out in nine states during the second and third quarters and have
plans to launch in an additional 10 states in the fourth quarter. We're serving a nearly 30%
increase in the rate of adoption for IntelliDrive and have received strong agent feedback.
Also in the fourth quarter, we're rolling out an enhanced customer self-service tool in the
new mobile app. In our claim organization, we're advancing the rollout of virtual end-toend claim service tools embracing the pandemic driven trends at accelerated digital
adoption by individuals and businesses. Customer and agent satisfaction are up while
payout discipline remains strong.
To sum it up, (Technical Difficulty) performance in the face of a pandemic and a
challenging underwriting environment. It reflects the importance of a strong underwriting
culture, the benefit of data and analytics and the franchise value we offer to our
customers and distribution partners. All of that, together with our highly engaged and
talented workforce, we're confident that we're well positioned to capitalize on
opportunities as the economy continues to reopen.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Thank you, Alan. Our core income for the third quarter was $798 million, generating core
ROE of 13.5%, both up significantly from core income of $378 million and core ROE of
6.5% that we reported in the prior-year quarter. These increases resulted primarily from
this year's favorable third quarter PYD compared to net unfavorable PYD in last year's

Page 4 of 25

FINAL

third quarter as well as a significant increase in underlying underwriting profit. More on
both of those items in a minute.
Our third quarter results include $397 million of pretax cat losses compared to $241 million
in last year's third quarter. This quarter's cats included Hurricane Laura, Tropical Storm
Isaias, the severe straight-line winds that impacted the Midwest in August and several
large wildfires in the Western United States. The increase in the level of cat activity was
even more pronounced than those numbers suggest as our net cat results in the quarter
was tempered by recoveries under the aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty. We have
recognized a full recovery under that treaty in our third quarter results. With $233 million
pre-tax benefit in the cat line and $47 million pre-tax benefiting non-cat weather in our
underlying results. Recall that last year we did not have any recoveries under the treaty
until the fourth quarter. Of course, the full recovery in this year's third quarter means that
there is no coverage remaining from this treaty as we enter the fourth quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

The underlying combined ratio of 91.5%, which excludes the impacts of cats and PYD
improved by 2.6 points from 94.1% in last year's third quarter. The underlying loss ratio
improved by 2.4 points and benefited from favorable auto frequency related to COVID-19
and the impact of earned pricing in excess of loss trend, partially offset by an increase in
non-cat weather losses including wildfires. The expense ratio of 29.3% is two-tenths of a
point favorable to last year's third quarter results and reflects our strategic focus over a
number of years on improving productivity and efficiency.
Setting aside quarter-to-quarter variability, our year-to-date expense ratio of
approximately 30% is a figure we're comfortable with. Our topline proved to be resilient
with a 3% increase in net written premium as continued strong renewal rate change and
retention in all three segments more than offset modestly lower insured exposures in the
commercial businesses.
For the quarter, losses directly related to COVID-19 totaled $133 million pre-tax, with $92
million in Business Insurance driven primarily by workers' comp and $41 million in our Bond
& Specialty business predominantly driven by management liability. More than offsetting
those losses were lower levels of auto claims and, to a lesser extent, fewer non COVID
workers' comp NGL claims due to lower levels of economic activity. The net impact of the
COVID environment on a consolidated underlying combined ratio amounted to a benefit
of about 2 points, mostly in Personal Insurance.
Given the ongoing uncertainty in this environment, we continue to take a cautious
approach in estimating the net impact of COVID-19 related losses. Consistent with my
commentary last quarter, the majority of direct COVID losses that we've booked year-todate through September is still sitting in IBNR. Looking at the year-to-date impact of direct
COVID losses, net of related frequency benefits and other underwriting items, our
underwriting results have benefited by a little more than $100 million pre-tax or about a
0.5 point on a consolidated underlying combined ratio, including the impact of premium
refunds to policyholders. However, year-to-date net investment income reflects the
significant adverse impact on our nonfixed income portfolio.

Turning to prior-year reserve development. As previously disclosed, third quarter includes
approximately $400 million of pre-tax benefit from the PG&E subrogation. About 80% of
that benefit is reflected in Personal Insurance with the remainder reflected in Business
Insurance. Setting PG&E to the side, PYD results in the quarter were as follows: In Personal
Insurance, net favorable development of $40 million pre-tax was driven by auto results
coming in better than expected for recent accident years; in Bond & Specialty Insurance,
there was no net impact from PYD; in Business Insurance, we recognized unfavorable
development of $295 million pre-tax as a result of our annual asbestos review. While
there was some slight improvement in several of our asbestos indicators, the overall level
of paid losses and general claim activity have persisted at levels higher than we had
anticipated.
This year, as we do every few years, we reviewed certain macro assumptions underlying
our actuarial analysis. Our updated view of ultimate asbestos-related losses resulted in an
increase in the low end of the actuarial range. This year's asbestos charge is greater than
last year's charge as a result of our updated view of the range for ultimate losses not as a
result of increases in paid losses or severity. There are some indications that the
environment is improving in terms of the emergence of new asbestos claims going
forward. Page 19 of the webcast presentation includes the most recent annual data from
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which shows that the total number of
deaths from mesothelioma in 2018 decreased by nearly 6% compared to 2010. Of note,
as you can see on the bottom two lines of the table, the decline in mesothelioma deaths
was much more pronounced in all of the younger age groups. This trend is directionally
consistent with our expectation that over time the high-risk group of people actually
exposed to asbestos in the workplace prior to the late 1970s will get smaller and will not
be replaced by younger people as those who entered the workforce sometime in the
1980s should not have been exposed to asbestos to nearly the same degree as their
predecessors.
Excluding the impacts of the PG&E settlement and the annual asbestos review, there was
virtually no net prior-year reserve development in Business Insurance. Favorable
development in workers' comp was offset by an increase to the reserves from legacy
liabilities in our run-off book related to a single insured arising out of policies issued more
than 20 years ago.
After-tax net investment income increased by 7% from the prior-year quarter to $566
million. The increase was driven by our non-fixed income returns, where results for our
private equity, hedge funds and real estate partnerships are generally reported to us on a
one quarter lag. Because of that reporting lag, the recovery experienced in the broader
markets during the second quarter benefited our nonfixed income results in the third
quarter.
Fixed income returns decreased by $31 million after-tax as the benefit from higher levels
of invested assets was more than offset by the decline in interest rates, consistent with
our comments on last quarter's call. Also consistent with our prior commentary, we expect
after-tax fixed income NII in the fourth quarter to be down $35 million to $40 million
compared to a year ago. Looking ahead to 2021, our current expectation is for after-tax
fixed income NII to be between $420 million and $430 million per quarter.

FINAL

Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $2.3 billion were
again very strong, all our capital ratios were at or better than target levels and we ended
the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $2.3 billion, well above our
target level. Recall that in April, we pre-funded the $500 million of debt coming due in
November with a new 30-year $500 million debt issuance, so our holding company
liquidity at September 30th is temporarily elevated by that month.
Investment yields decreased as credit spreads tightened during the third quarter and
accordingly our net unrealized investment gain increased from $3.6 billion after-tax as of
June 30th to $3.8 billion after tax at September 30th. Adjusted book value per share
which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses was $94.89 at quarter end, up
2% from year-end 2019 and up 5% year-over-year. We returned $218 million of capital to
our shareholders this quarter via dividends. We did not repurchase any shares during the
quarter. Looking ahead, there is no change in our approach to capital management. Until
there is more clarity on the state of the economy, we may buy back some shares in the
coming quarters or we may continue to choose to buy none.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.

Gregory C. Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance produced $365 million of segment income for the
quarter, a significant increase over the prior-year quarter with prior-year development,
underlying underwriting income and net investment income, all contributing to the yearover-year increase. The underlying combined ratio of 94% improved by almost 2 points
driven by more than a point of earned rate in excess of loss trends. A modest favorable
net impact from the pandemic contributed about 0.5 point to the improvement. As for
the top line, net written premiums were 1% lower than the prior-year quarter, with strong
rate and high retention mostly offsetting modestly lower insured exposures and lower
levels of new business. As Alan mentioned, we're very pleased with the resilience of our
top line in the face of the ongoing macroeconomic challenges.
Turning to the domestic production, we achieved record renewal rate change of 8.2%, up
4 points from the third quarter of last year and almost a point from the second quarter of
this year, while retention remained high at 83%. We feel very good about the headline
numbers, but as we've shared before, the quality of the execution and segmentation
underneath the headline numbers are just as important. To that point, while we achieved
meaningful rate increases in all product lines except workers' comp, our underwriters are
making deliberate and granular decisions with respect to rate and retention and accountby-account or class-by-class basis. Thanks to our focus on continuous improvement of
data and analytics at the point of sale, the quality of the execution is as good as I've ever
seen.
New business of $505 million was 9% lower than the prior-year quarter. We attribute the
decline to lower levels of economic activity as well as careful risk selection by our
underwriters. In our core middle market business for example, while submissions are up
our quote ratio is lower as we are taking a disciplined approach, given our view of quality
of new business in the market. As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal rate

Date: 2020-10-20

change increased to 2.9%, marking the seventh consecutive quarter in which renewal rate
change was higher than the corresponding prior-year quarter. Retention of 80% was
down a couple of points from recent periods largely driven by policy cancellations that
were deferred through the second quarter due to our pandemic-related billing relief
program. In middle market, renewal rate change increased to 8.3%, while retention
remained strong at 85%. The 8.3% was up by more than 4.5 points from the third quarter
of 2019 and we achieved positive rate of more than 80% of our accounts this quarter, up
from about two-thirds in the third quarter of last year.
To sum up, we feel terrific about our results and execution in a challenging underwriting
environment. We also feel very good about the investments we're making for the future
and the benefits we're seeing from those investments. Those investments include
enhancing the experiences for our customers and distribution partners, digitizing the
underwriting transaction in creating efficiencies. For example, we've recently launched
multiple pilots to automatically incorporate data from our distribution partners' agency
management systems directly into our systems, substantially reducing the time and
friction in the process while also improving data quality. We're as confident as ever that
our meaningful competitive advantages position us well for long-term profitable growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.

Thomas M. Kunkel

{BIO 16615934 <GO>}

Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty delivered solid returns and growth in the quarter, despite
the ongoing headwinds of COVID-19. Segment income was $115 million, a $24 million
decrease from the prior-year quarter as the benefit of higher volumes was more than
offset by a higher underlying combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio of 89%
increased 5.4 points primarily driven by estimated losses from COVID-19 and related
economic conditions.
Given the products that we write, we expect the results of this segment to be impacted in
times of severe economic downturn. We experienced that during the financial crisis and
we're seeing elevated loss activity in the current environment. We contemplate economic
volatility in our underwriting and in our pricing, and as Alan said, in these circumstances,
we feel good about the returns we've generated in the quarter. We expected the
underlying combined ratio will continue to be elevated at around this level over the near
term.
Turning to top line. Net written premiums grew 4% for the quarter, reflecting strong
growth driven by improved pricing in our management liability business, partially offset by
lower surety production due to the continued economic impact of COVID-19 on public
project procurement and related Bond demand. In our domestic management liability
business, we are pleased that the renewal premium increased to 8.1%, driven by record
rate. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter in which RPC is higher than the
corresponding prior-year quarter. Retention remained at a historically high 90%.

These production results demonstrate the successful execution of our strategy to pursue
rate where needed while maintaining strong retention of our high-quality portfolio. We will
continue to pursue rate increases where warranted. Domestic Management Liability new
business for the quarter decreased $14 million, primarily reflecting our thoughtful
underwriting in this elevated risk environment. Similar to what you heard from Greg in
Business Insurance, submissions are up, while quote activity is down. So Bond & Specialty
results remained resilient despite the challenges brought on by COVID-19. We continue to
be pleased with our strong execution and feel confident about our ability to navigate
through this challenging environment and continue to deliver strong returns over time.
And now, I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance.

Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance this quarter, we are very
pleased with our continued execution in the marketplace as we delivered excellent
profitability and grew net written premiums by 8% achieving record levels of domestic
policies in force.

Bloomberg Transcript

Personal Insurance segment income for the third quarter was $392 million, up $261 million
from the prior-year quarter, driven by the pre-tax impacts of an improvement of $163
million in the underlying underwriting gain and $343 million of higher net favorable prioryear reserve development, partially offset by $174 million of higher catastrophe losses net
of reinsurance.
Our combined ratio for the quarter was 86.4%, an improvement of 11.6 points from the
prior-year quarter, driven primarily by the increase in net favorable prior-year reserve
development. Higher catastrophe loss experience in the quarter was largely offset by
improvement in the underlying combined ratio. The improved underlying combined ratio
reflects the continuation of favorable auto loss experience in the quarter, partially offset
by higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses. I'll discuss both of these dynamics in a
bit more detail next.
Agency Automobile profitability was very strong with a combined ratio of approximately
80% for the quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 81% improved nearly 12 points
continuing to reflect favorable frequency levels. Approximately 8 of the 12 points of
improvement relate to current quarter favorability, the remainder results from favorable
re-estimates of activity in the first half of 2020. We continue to observe lower claim
frequency as a result of fewer miles driven in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
For the third quarter, data from our IntelliDrive program indicates that miles driven
increased relative to last quarter, but continue to be down from pre-COVID-19 levels. In
response to this continued favorable loss experience, we filed modest rate reductions in
a handful of states during the third quarter. We will continue to analyze and incorporate
current trends into our underwriting and pricing decisions as we balance business volumes
and profitability.

FINAL

In Agency Homeowners & Other, the third quarter combined ratio was 92.8%, an
improvement of 9.2 points from the prior-year quarter, resulting from 26 points of higher
net favorable prior-year reserve development, mostly from the PG&E subrogation
recoveries, partially offset by elevated levels of catastrophe losses and an increase in the
underlying combined ratio driven by higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses.
Our catastrophe and non-catastrophe experience reflect a very active quarter with a
record 31 PCS events. West Coast wildfires represented almost half of the total PCS
events in the quarter. Consistent with Dan's comments earlier, the quarter's catastrophe
losses for Personal Insurance were also impacted by the Midwest derecho, Tropical Storm
Isaias and, to a lesser extent, Hurricane Laura.
In addition to pursuing rate increases in property, as we have been for some time, we've
continued to review and modify terms and conditions and implement loss mitigation
actions in response to the elevated loss activity. Our actions to date have enabled us to
reduce or avoid losses we would have otherwise incurred and improve returns as we
continue to grow the line.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to quarterly production, our domestic agency results were again very strong. Our
retentions remained high, quotes and new business were up versus the prior-year quarter
and we remain pleased with our policies in force growth.
Agency Automobile retention was 84% and new business increased 9% from the prioryear quarter, both contributing to accelerating growth in policies in force. Renewal
premium change was again lower as we continue to moderate pricing in response to
favorable loss activity. Agency Homeowners & Other delivered another very strong
quarter with retention of 86% and a 22% increase in new business. Renewal premium
change increased to 8.2% as we remain focused on improving returns and property while
growing the business.
During the quarter, we continue to respond to the needs of our customers and
distribution partners. First and foremost, let me add my thanks to our claim professionals
for delivering on our commitment to be there for our customers and distribution partners
in response to the significant number of catastrophe and weather events in the quarter.
At the same time, we continue to deliver new capabilities in the marketplace. Alan already
mentioned both IntelliDrive and our new MyT-Mobile App, both of which are key tools and
helping us attract and retain customers.
We also expanded the availability of our digital quote proposal, that gives agents and
brokers the ability to send a Travelers Insurance quote to their clients' mobile phone and
interact with them digitally about the terms of the proposal, making the transaction more
seamless for both the agent and the customer. And after reaching our goal of planting
one million trees for customer enrollment in paperless billing, we extended our
partnership with American Forests to plant an additional 500,000 trees by Earth Day
2021. We have already achieved that milestone well ahead of schedule, providing our
customers the digital experience they seek, while benefiting the environment. These

examples and others illustrate our ability to develop and deliver the capabilities our
partners and customers value.

We are very pleased with our performance so far this year, and I'm proud of our team's
efforts to continue to deliver results, while investing in the business for the future.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Mike
Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Hey, good morning. Thanks. First question, if we can talk about some of the reserve
changes during the quarter. Thanks for the commentary, I believe, Greg when you were
talking about business -- the BI segment, you didn't mention any additions to general
liability and I believe that had been -- you'd been adding to that for in prior quarters. Can
you confirm if that's was indeed the case and maybe just overall to Alan or Greg if you
guys can talk about whether your view has changed at all on overall lost expense trend?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning, Mike, it's Alan. Let me start with loss trend and then maybe I'll turn it
over to Dan to talk about prior-year development. So in the quarter, putting aside for a
second the direct COVID losses, in the quarter generally what we saw was favorable loss
activity primarily related to COVID. And so I think people staying home, less economic
activity, lower levels of frequency. As you've heard us say last quarter and as you heard us
repeat again this quarter, we've taken a very cautious approach to recognizing that
favorable news, there is still a fair amount of uncertainty and so we're going to be
cautious about that. But we didn't see anything in the quarter that surprised us or caused
us to think that that loss trends were deteriorating. And Dan why don't you comment on
PYD.

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Sure, Mike. So just to go through Business Insurance PYD just for a second, quick recap of
the summary. So it ended up being about $220 million unfavorable all-in, that's driven by
about $295 million as we said on asbestos. Then there was favorability from BI's portion
of the PG&E settlement and so that was worth about 20% of the $400 million so that's
$80 million of a good guy and that gets you to about $215 million compared to the $220

million. So the other moving parts that you can think about it is as net offsets and those
are favorable in workers' comp, unfavorable for a single account and one-off from policies
that we issued more than 20 years ago. And then we didn't mention the other lines
because there was really very modest activity in the other lines some pluses and some
minuses that basically net to zero.

Q - Michael Zaremski

Okay, that's helpful. My last question is, I guess in regard to the overall competitive
environments. Alan in your prepared remarks you talked about expect continued
momentum in the marketplace. I mean, I guess, I think what we're trying to get
comfortable with is the investment income levels -- thank you for the guidance, right,
clearly they are under a lot of pressure. And I think in our shoes we haven't been in a kind
of a firm to hard marketplace in a while, so we're trying to get comfortable that the
pricing momentum in excess of loss trends to continue because it seems like to offset the
NII pressure we had to get to meaningfully better combined ratios in outer years. So
maybe just some more color Alan, do you guys -- when you say continued momentum, do
you expect pricing to continue moving higher or are these levels kind of good enough for
you guys to start kind of chipping away at offsetting some of the investment pressure?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. Of course, Mike it's related to added loss trend so we're definitely making progress
at these levels and we're not going to give pricing outlook. But we do choose our words
pretty carefully and I'll tell you that, the fact of the matter is that, for us and for the
industry broadly, there are just many lines of business that are not yet read adequate and
the drivers are clearly environmental. So on the loss side, social inflation isn't going away,
we've weather losses, we've got wildfires that are burning. As you pointed out, interest
rates are lower for longer, that's going to be a driver of the outlook for returns. We do
have some capacity issues in some lines as there are some markets that are pulling back
on capacity. So we think this broader environmental -- all of these broader environmental
trends will continue to provide positive momentum in the marketplace.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess my first question is, it sounds like the COVID benefits
you're enjoying are frequency-based, mostly short tail lines. So I should take that to mean
Page 12 of 25



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2020-10-20

that you've continued to book in lines like commercial auto similarly to the type of loss
trend that you thought coming into the year, which I would think would be above your
average loss trend? Correct.

FINAL

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Yeah, Ryan, it's Dan. That's right. So we are -- as we've said, I think last quarter and this
quarter trying to be cautious in our assessment of the net impact of COVID. There is
some benefit in the shorter tail lines, but we're trying to be pretty cautious in terms of
how much that we recognize in the current accident year.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

And in terms of the casualty coverages, as you mentioned. Yes, that's correct.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Right. And I totally understand. I'm just trying to get some perspective on -- clearly, we
don't know what frequency is going to be, there could be delays in reported claims et
cetera, but just from your seat looking at the type of claim activity, it's come in through the
door. If that were to hold true, what's the type of frequency benefit on commercial auto
that I guess we're not at this point seeing in results yet?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. We're reluctant to put a number on that. I think we're not going to do it Ryan, but -and frequency it does develop but it develops certainly a lot more quickly than severity is,
I mean you know if the phone rings or the phone doesn't ring. But I think we're going to
leave it as we've recognized some of it because there was enough of it that we could not
recognize some of it, but we've been pretty cautious in the assessment.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Got it. And then the other follow-up I had I guess probably for Dan is, thinking about just
the aggregate treaty. I guess it kind of worked this year, but it also kind of didn't because
we're going into the fourth quarter and we've gone through the top. How are you thinking
about the strategy about reinsuring cats, I guess, heading into '21? Are you thinking about
doing more aggregate cover or maybe going lower? Is that something that we should
expect potentially be a catalyst for next year?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Hey, Ryan. Before Dan answer that question, I'll just insert that I think the treaty actually
worked just fine, it was the weather that didn't work so well. But, Dan, why don't you take.

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Ryan, I think we'll do as we would do for reinsurance in any -- going into any year, we'll
make an assessment of price versus risk and then decide what and how much we're
going to buy. I think I'd say in summary, we're glad that we've had that treaty for the last
two years. To your question specifically about, do we go to a lower attachment, I wouldn't
Page 13 of 25



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2020-10-20

FINAL

think so. We've got a growing business and if anything, we probably would go naturally to
a higher attachment point just to reflect the growth in the business. But maybe we'll buy
that reinsurance again and maybe we won't, it'll depend how we feel about the risk
transfer relative to the pricing that we can get, because again, we're writing with the idea
that we're a gross lines underwriter. And we said a couple of years ago, it felt like there
was a little more uncertainty in the weather environment, and so we wanted to have that
treaty and we're glad we had it and we'll see how that plays out going into next year.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

And the other thing I would add to that Ryan is, and Dan is exactly right, we bought that
because we were -- wanted to acknowledge the incremental uncertainty that we felt after
some wildfire losses, I guess in '17 and '18. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks,
we've taken pretty substantial steps to try to get that risk reward in balance. So that would
also factor into our view of the value of that reinsurance treaty and the terms we can get
it on next year.

Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes, thanks. My first one I guess is maybe some commentary about workers' comp, I
mean I think that given where interest rates are at some point we should start to see that
line, see some positive rate momentum because that's an important component. But
what are you seeing kind of what are your thoughts on that line right now?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Greg, do you want to take that?

A - Gregory C. Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Yeah, you bet. Good Morning, Brian. First, we like our longstanding competitive and
economic advantages that we've got out of that line and that's why we're the largest
writer in it in the U.S. and ensure there is a little bit of pricing reductions going through that
line right now and that always put some pressure on existing margins. But we aren't
standing still, we continue to invest in our claim practices, specifically around medical
management sophistication, and our underwriters, we're always giving them new tools
and new insight to make sure our risk selection and our renewal segmentation offset
some of those price reductions. And workers' comp is just one piece of our portfolio as

Page 14 of 25



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity

we remind you all the time we're more of an account solution than an individual monoline
writer and we'll continue to write our customers with accounts in addition to workers'
comp. So we continue to feel good about the portfolio and the future of that line.

FINAL

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

And maybe with that improvement in select, was that due to comp maybe getting a little
less competitive, the rate in select?

A - Gregory C. Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Well, all both select and middle market are clearly going to follow the linear trend of the
bureau's loss cost recommendations. And so, in the select business where it's more of a
flow business, where you file that rate structure, you feel it more there than you would in
middle market where you have experienced margin discretionary pricing and you look at
the individual exposure rather than file at a state level. So a little more sensitive to the
reductions in select than you would see in middle market.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. And then just one quick follow-up for Dan. The aggregate cover this quarter, is it
possible to break out how much of that benefit is kind of non-cat weather versus cat
losses?

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, Brian, I gave it actually in my prepared remarks. So...

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

I'm sorry, I missed it.

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

It's quite all right. We said, so $280 million was the total recovery, $233 million went to cat
and $47 million went to underline.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

And that's largely in the personal lines?

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

The split is a little different between the two. The cash split is about 50-50 PI/BI, the noncat split goes more like 70-30 PI/BI.

Q - Brian Meredith

Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is
open.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, thank you. Good morning. My first question is also on the aggregate cover. So given
that you guys have exhausted that cover and this is a comment that is specific to Business
Insurance. How can we think about the improvement within the underlying loss ratio that
you could see there in the fourth quarter? I guess we could expect some kind of
headwind from non-cat weather, just given the absence of the aggregate or how should
we think about the fourth quarter?

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Elyse, it's Dan. The aggregate -- so as I just said in response to Brian's question, not a big
deal to the underlying for Business Insurance in the third quarter. So it got about 30% of
the $47 million that was non-cat. So you could think about that for BI as not being more
than 20 or 30 basis points in terms of its impact on the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. So if we adjust BI for that and then also for like the COVID benefit that you guys
pointed out earlier, is that a good type of kind of run rate to think about for some margin
improvement that we could see in the fourth quarter?

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Well, I don't think I'd expect the COVID impact to cease as of September 30th. Certainly
the cat recovery, the treaty recovery is all contained in the third quarter, and you could
take that out for sure. I'm not sure anybody knows what exactly the impact of COVID is
going to be in the fourth quarter.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Or what weather volatility is going to look like. And I think we're going to get away
generally from trying to forecast margins. But happy to take some modeling questions
offline, if that's suppose Elyse, so we can.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Yeah. And then my second question was on the expense ratio. Dan, I think you said that
30% was kind of a good run rate, but as we're thinking and like maybe this is less
guidance, but I think you guys did guide with at least that. As you're getting a good
amount of price and that's earning in, should we expect that we could see some
improvement in the expense ratio, which is due to the denominator or is it

Page 16 of 25



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The

counterbalanced by some investments that you've pointed out that you guys have been
making internally?

FINAL

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

I think those are the considerations, Elyse, that will go into what it ends up being. I do
think, to the degree that we can get some bottom-line growth, we would -- could be in a
position to continue to see some leverage on the expense ratio. But as we've said, a
number of times over the last couple of years what we like about productivity and
efficiency that we've generated, is it gives us the optionality of whether we make
additional investments in places that we feel are going to provide a bigger bang for the
buck down the road or let some of that come through the bottom line. All I was really
trying to communicate was that, we don't -- we're not seeking a dramatic change in the
expense ratio from where we are right now.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. Thanks for the color.

And our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Your
line is open.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yeah, good morning everybody. Two unrelated questions. The first one is about surety
and can you talk a little bit about the premium volume looked pretty reasonable in the
Bond & Specialty business, what are we seeing in terms of COVID economy for
construction starts and whatnot?

A - Thomas M. Kunkel

{BIO 16615934 <GO>}

Yeah, this is Tom. Josh, good morning. When you think about surety, if you break it up to
the non-construction and the construction side, our regular non-construction surety is
holding up quite nicely. But with all of the decline in tax receipts and the difficulties that
various public bodies are having -- funding public works projects, that's what is really
driving the drop-off in surety written premium. And so we will have to wait and see what
the Federal Government does with any stimulus that might involve construction because
certainly states and other entities have shovel ready projects.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Is there implication for things that have already begun construction, is there a risk that we
start seeing issues with surety claims because they're not able to be finished?

FINAL

A - Thomas M. Kunkel

{BIO 16615934 <GO>}

There are two different issues. As far as the project stopping and unless they were
ordered to stop by Government authority, I wouldn't expect to see a project that is
ongoing, stopping. And then as far as the slower economy causing additional defaults,
that certainly is possible, it really depends on the contractors in a surety portfolio and how
sound their financial position was going in, and how they handle pursuing work or not
pursuing work and shrinking the size of their company when times are lean. So we take a
lot of pride in our contractors and really manage that portfolio. And we think different
sureties will perform differently throughout this.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Josh what I'd just add to that is we're underwriting that commercial surety -- the
construction surety book today the same way we did in financial crisis, and it performed
pretty well through that. So we can't give any assurances, who knows, but we feel pretty
good about our underwriting practices and the people who are making the decisions to
put business on the books.

A - Thomas M. Kunkel

{BIO 16615934 <GO>}

Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And then sort of a philosophical question, if we go back in time maybe 10 years, I don't
know, when you came up with the Travelers definition for catastrophes, and of course, it
varies from the PCS definition. It seems as time goes on the risk associated with non-cat
weather gets greater and greater in terms of volatility on your margins. Is the variance
between your definition and the PCS definition still useful or we got onto a point where
the reasons for that difference are starting to create a certain volatility in results that we
wouldn't otherwise hope to see?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah, Josh. We think about that a lot, so I appreciate the question and maybe someday
offline we'd love to get your thoughts on it. I mean, our view is, from an economic
perspective, the losses are going to be what they're going to be whether they get
reflected in a cat line or in an underlying line. And frankly, we report the numbers the way
we manage the business, and we think that there is a level of loss activity that is defined
as a PCS event that is in a working layer, if you will, and that ought to be managed day-in
day-out year-in year-out by the underwriters that are managing it as compared to a
catastrophe loss which we obviously define as a higher level which get managed and
addressed over a much longer period of time.
So we think it's the right way to manage the business. We think it's the right way to talk
about the business internally. And we make the decision to talk about it externally the
same way we manage it internally. So I guess that it might from time to time cause some
modeling issues or definitional issues, but we think the consistency and the thoughtful
approach to managing it is sort of the right way to run the railroad.

Hey, good morning. Thanks for the call and answers. I was hoping you could home in on
the competitive environment of the auto insurance business in particular. It -- seeing in the
market different things from rate environment obviously you're doing what you're doing,
but is it materially more competitive market today than it was recently. And then I'll just
give you my follow-up question which is, I'd like to know how that competitive
environment moves up with what you're doing in the home insurance business where
you're clearly growing and -- my sense is the home insurance businesses is pretty much
an outright hard market, so a different situation? So those are the two questions.

Michael?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Thanks, Paul. It's Michael Klein. So on the competition in auto, certainly, we are seeing
market rate drop and I think it's fair to call it an intensifying competitive environment. That
said, for the most part, notwithstanding some of that headline numbers you see from
some key competitors, it's still a relatively moderate adjustment in personal lines auto
pricing, and from our perspective, largely reflective of the improvement in experience in
the line. Some of it COVID related, but frankly, some of it consistent with longer-term
trends of favorable frequency that we and other competitors have talked about.
In terms of our ability to compete in that environment, as I mentioned in my prepared
remarks and you see in the webcast script, we're pleased with our improving tiff growth in
auto. As we moderate pricing, again intentionally, to keep pace with those loss trends.
And again as I mentioned in the prepared remarks that does include taking some price
decreases in a handful of states, again mass premium to loss, pricing with loss
experience. So that's sort of our view on the PI competitive environment.
Jumping to your second question about home. I would agree, if you look at the Personal
Insurance industry, right now, it's a little bit of a tail a few cities, right, you've got improving
loss experience and moderating frequency and auto putting downward pressure on
prices, you've got a lot of what we've been talking about here this morning, catastrophes,
non-catastrophe weather, there are still folks in the industry talking about non-weather

water losses as well, but no pressure on lost costs in the property business is upward.

of our Quantum Home 2 products as we rolled that out. And again, as we look at the
property market in Personal Insurance, as we've described it, our objective is to grow
property while improving profitability and that's the path we've been on and will continue

Hi. Thanks and good morning. Just had a question just on NII and the impact it has on ROE
for the firm and so the NII guide of $420 million to $430 million after-tax per quarter. I
guess do you think that you can get enough margin expansion to offset the NII drag to
keep ROE stable in this environment? And is there enough pricing and margin expansion
underneath where you can actually improve ROEs in this interest rate environment?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, we think the answer to that is yes. And if you look at written rate versus loss
trend, margins are improving from here. And we're not going to give guidance, so I'm not
going to predict whether we will or whether we won't, but I mean certainly interest rates
and investment income are an input into our pricing model. And so there is certainly a very
direct link between the investment return we're getting on the product and the price
we're charging for it.

Okay, great. Thanks. And then just another follow-up, you mentioned -- I think Greg
mentioned getting rate in excess of loss trend of over a point in BI. I guess I'm just
wondering if you could elaborate a bit on what gives you confidence that you're getting
rate in excess of trend. Just given the uncertainty around the loss environment, quotes
being closed and just generally the unpredictability of losses in the current environment?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. So just to be clear, we look at rate versus loss trend on a written basis and that's the
rate number you see in production statistics and we've shared before our view of loss
trend, that one point was sort of the earned impact of rate and earned loss trend, so two
different basis there. At this point -- where we've got rate in excess of 8% and we've got
loss trend which we shared last quarter we view on the long-term basis at 5%. Yes, there
is some uncertainty, but that gap is big enough that that we feel some confidence in that.
And it's true that in a circumstance like this, where you've got a disruption in the economy
and some disruption in the data coming through and in a claim process, there is a little
less -- there's a little bit more uncertainty than usual. But as I shared previously, what we're
seeing in losses is actual favorability. And again not perfect clarity into it and it's going to
take some time for us to get more clarity for that uncertainty to resolve, but the thing that
we're not reacting to is favorable news, not unfavorable trends.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, everybody. First question around workers' comp, so clearly or I'm
assuming there is a frequency benefit from non-COVID claims. On the other hand, I would
think that frequency benefit could ultimately result in some severity increase further down
the road. Is that a fair way of thinking about it? And if so how are you think of the lost
specs with that build dynamic?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

It's certainly a possibility and we contemplate that. So yes there is some favorability in
non-COVID related frequency, but we do contemplate when we think about longer-term
trends and when we think about the profitability of the product that there could be down
the road some increased severity due to really delayed access to healthcare. So we do
contemplate that. It's a possibility.

given all the corporate related noise today?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

Yeah, I guess what I can share is we didn't see anything that caused us to believe that
there was any deterioration in those trends. And what we saw was, again as I said a few
times, favorable. We think the extent to which it's favorable is a temporary phenomenon.
So I guess that's why I didn't answer the question. Nothing in the quarter that caused us to
think it was deteriorated.

A - Dan Frey

Q - Jamminder Bhullar
Hi, good morning. So first, I just had a question on pricing in the workers' comp line.
Obviously, it's been declining. Are you seeing any signs of stability in that or any -- what
are your views on where that's headed?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah, I think I'll Jimmy I'd repeat what we said last quarter, which is when we look at our
data we look at the data coming out of the rating bureaus. We would think that we are
somewhere near an inflection point, whether it's now or in the coming quarters, not really
sure, but we would expect in the relatively nearest term for that pricing to come back to
negative and then turn positive. It's not impossible picking that quarter or date that's
going to happen, but that would be our near-term outlook.

Q - Jamminder Bhullar

FINAL

Okay. And then on sort of you mentioned you'll evaluate price sources risk on reinsurance,
it seems like the reinsurance prices are obviously going up at decent amount, what's your
any sort of initial indications of your views on sort of price versus risk given what's going
on in the reinsurance markets versus last year?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean, we certainly expect reinsurance pricing to go up. That's one of the factors
that's driving our pricing and the pricing generally in the primary market going up and we
think that's going to persist. But I guess the thing I would add is that relates to us is, we
are, as we said, many times a gross line underwriter. We like underwriting, we tend to
keep it. And so compared to many of our -- many in the industry, we buy on a relative
basis, less reinsurance. And frankly, we could buy less than we do. We can buy a little
more, we could buy a little less, depending on the risk and reward that we see in that
purchase. But to the extent that we are relatively less reliant on reinsurance than others,
the fact that reinsurance pricing going up is probably better to us.

Q - Jamminder Bhullar
Okay. And then just lastly what are some of the things that you're watching to determine
whether to start buying back stock again?

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

I think, Jimmy, still overall economic uncertainty, right. So even as we sit here today, what's
the depth and the duration is going to be of economic downturn, is there going to be a
second dip in the economy, how quickly are COVID cases going to be brought under
control, how quickly are things going to reopen? There is just a lot of uncertainty that
could impact both our topline and the loss environment in which we're operating, so
we're choosing to be a little cautious here still. And clearly through the third quarter, on
top of all that, we had a very active cat quarter. So just and if you like time to be restarting
buybacks.

Q - Jamminder Bhullar
Okay. Thanks.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Thank you.

Great, thanks. I think it was (inaudible), Alan I apologize for not knowing for sure, there are
talks about how you are taking a conservative view of accident year loss picks in light of
uncertainty and only recognizing the frequency benefit that you had to. Was there a sort
of similar approach taken to reserve reviews in the quarter?

FINAL

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Meyer, it's Dan. I'm not sure I quite understand the question. So the reserves will be a
result of the loss picks that we made in the current accident year during the quarter.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Right, so when you are -- so if I understand correctly there is an overall conservatism
because of the fact that things are developing differently as we work our way through the
COVID and the economic ramifications, and I'm wondering whether that conservatism had
sort of an unusual impact on the selections you made with regard to reviewing prior
period reserves as well?

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Yeah, I wouldn't think so. I think the comment that Alan just made a few minutes ago
around the impact of courts being closed and settlements being down, we see some
disruption in the data, but we're not taking that as a favorability in the development
patterns that we're sitting on a long-term basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. Second follow-up if I can really quickly, just how should we think about
the impact on return on equity or on indicated pricing if corporate tax rates go up?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. Taxes are an input in the income statement like any other expense. So it flows
through our -- flows through the models.

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Yeah. So that would be one of the many things that gets factored into our pricing.
Obviously, it wouldn't just impact us, it would impact the economy more broadly. And as
Alan said a bunch of times, I think if we feel like we've got a level playing field with our
experience in our risk selection expertise, we'll do just fine. But for sure it'll be an input
into what the pricing environment is to be going forward.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, fantastic. Thank you so much.

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Thanks, Meyer.
