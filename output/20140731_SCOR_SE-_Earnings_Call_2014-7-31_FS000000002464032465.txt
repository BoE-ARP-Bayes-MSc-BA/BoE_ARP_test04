Also note, which is indicated on page three, that in the presentation, two sets of financial
data are used. The first set is presented on an unaudited published basis and includes
Generali U.S. figures from the acquisition date of October 1, 2013. Obviously, prior year
comparatives do not include Generali U.S. The second set of data is presented on an
unaudited pro-forma basis and includes Generali U.S. as if the acquisition had taken place
on 1st of January 2013.
With this, I would like to give the floor to Mr. Denis Kessler, CEO and Chairman of the
SCOR Group, who is joined in this call by the whole COMEX team.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Antonio, and good morning, everyone. With the net income of €256 million
and ROE of 10.3%, SCOR has delivered a strong set of results for the first half of 2014
and so that (1:38) confirms the validity of our strategy but also the relevance of the path
chosen with the Optimal Dynamics strategic plan.
Without going into all the details, let me give you a few highlights of what has happened
over the last six months. First of all, the group has paid €243 million in cash dividends to its
investors during the second quarter, once again demonstrating its ability to deliver
consistent and strong dividends. Its business engines have been performing in line with
Optimal Dynamics strategy plan. For instance, since the beginning of the year, SCOR
Global P&C has delivered strong renewals with broadly stable profitability on a net basis.
SCOR Global P&C has also strengthened its London market presence with the launch of
our Lloyd's Managing Agency and has continued to implement the Optimal Dynamics
strategy plan with the creation of a new business unit dedicated to the Alternative
Solutions initiative to provide our clients with an even wider range of solutions.
On the Life side, we have completed the integration of Generali U.S., and we paid in
advance a $228 million bridge loan, and meanwhile, SCOR Global Life has continued to
enlarge its footprint in the longevity and financial solutions markets in line, again, with the
Optimal Dynamics plan.
On the asset side, SCOR Global Investment has conducted a prudent rebalancing of the
investment portfolio, again, in line with the Optimal Dynamics orientations. As such,
through the first six months of 2014, the two targets of Optimal Dynamics, profitability on
one side and solvency on the other side, are firmly on track with a return of risk-free rate
of over 1,000 basis points and a solvency ratio according to our internal model, which
reaches 231%. To give you more color about the 2014 solvency ratio, which confirmed the
group's very strong capital position, I will now pass the microphone to Frieder, who will
present the next slide.
Frieder?

FINAL

Thank you, Denis. Moving on to page five, SCOR's solvency position has developed very
favorably during 2013. The required capital is almost unchanged at €3.3 billion, as the
business growth has been offset by further improvements to our capital shield and
favorable economic developments. The available capital has grown to €7.5 billion, mainly
due to the strong value of new business written during 2013, and the rise in interest rates.
This has increased the solvency ratio based on the 2014 group internal model to 231%,
that means slightly above the Optimal Dynamics target of a solvency ratio in the range of
185% to 220%. Given the expected fluctuations of any economic capital model, we do not
consider this a material deviation from this optimal range.
Our internal model is used extensively for managing risks, solvency, and capital, and we
are working closely with our European regulators towards being able to use it also under
Solvency II beginning in 2016.
With this, I will hand over to Mark, who will take you through the financial details of the
results.

Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Thank you, Frieder. Going to page six, I will you through the financial highlights of our first
half results. SCOR wrote more than €5.4 billion of gross written premiums for the first half
of 2014, which represents an 8.9% increase at current exchange rates, and 12.5% increase
at constant exchange rates. This growth is fueled by healthy SCOR Global P&C renewals
since the beginning of the year, by the increased strength of the SGL franchise, thanks to
the Generali acquisition, and by major new contracts signed by the SCOR Global Life
team.
The net income for the first six months stands at €256 million which generated a 10.3%
return on equity. Both SCOR Global P&C and SCOR Global Life delivered an operational
performance well in line with our Optimal Dynamics assumptions. The P&C combined ratio
stands at an excellent level of 90.9% while the Life technical margin reaches a solid 7.2%.
SCOR Global Investments delivers a return on invested assets of 2.9%, while slightly
increasing the duration of the investment portfolio as indicated in Optimal Dynamics.
Moving on to page eight, the shareholders' equity reaches €5.1 billion after the payment
of €243 million of cash dividends during the second quarter. The book value per share is
now well above €27, standing at €27.39 per share and the financial leverage stands at
20.8%, which is below the 25% ceiling indicated during Optimal Dynamics.
On page nine, the operational cash flow is €2 million for the first six months since it was
affected by several non-recurring items, most of which we discussed in Q1 including an
anticipated tax payment relating to the restructuring of the acquired Generali block of
business: the Mediterráneo Vida financing commission and timing differences on P&C cap
payments and their corresponding retrocession recoveries.

On a normalized basis, the net cash flows from operations would be approximately €400
million. Additionally, during the first quarter, SCOR repaid in full, the $228 million bridge
loan facility used to help finance the Generali U.S. transaction. Overall, the total liquidity
position decreases to approximately €1.8 billion in line with previous indications.

FINAL

Now, I'll turn it over to Victor for the P&C results.

Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Good morning. (7:52 – 8:10) And the answer is that based on the information available todate, which is yet very preliminary, our estimates of each of these losses on a net basis
for us stand at a low-single digit between $10 million and $15 million and between $10
million and $20 million pre-tax, respectively. Therefore, none of these losses is going to
have a material impact on our results, which is in line with our voluntary non-positioning on
the aviation war business. Again, based on the very preliminary information available,
especially for the Tripoli Airport attack, to-date, the total net burden from the suite of
those losses seems likely to be in the range of $25 million to $35 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Coming back to the slides, the results we are showing are very much in line with the
assumption that we've made for Optimal Dynamics across all metrics, whether they be
related to growth or technical-expected profitability. With these results, there is not much
to say but that we are on track at mid-year to have a full-year €5 billion gross premium
income in line with the indication that we have been giving since the publication of the first
January renewals results.
As far as the net combined ratio is concerned, SCOR Global P&C delivers an excellent
technical profitability with a net combined ratio of 90.9% which, as of today, could be
expected to be at the high end of the 93% to 94% Optimal Dynamic assumption on a
normalized basis. To be sure that we are all clear, when I talk of a combined ratio on a
normalized basis, I mean a combined ratio with a nat cat loss activity of the second half of
the year which would make us to catch up with our annual budgeted ratio of 7%, and the
management expense ratio trending down towards its normal annual run rate of 6.5%. It's
worth mentioning that these results are based on the continuation of our present
reserving policy unchanged, and do not include any reserve release, nor any reserve
strengthening.
Regarding the June-July renewals, here again they went through without surprises worth
being mentioned that it confirmed the high level competition in the markets, as well as
the importance of franchise in the negotiations and the lendings of these negotiations in
terms of share allocations and signings.
As you can see from the dancing (10:41) boxes that represent the walkthrough from the
renewable to the renewed and newly booked premiums, the proportion of cancelled and
restructured is increasing up to 15% from the low levels of the recent past, which is
reflecting the underwriting discipline that has been applied.

FINAL

In complement to the detailed information that is provided in this slide, I'd like to mention
that on a year-to-date and underwriting basis, not accounting basis, looking at the January
to July activity, the Treaty P&C and Specialty Lines gross premium income increases by
6.7% at constant exchange rates and by 8.2% when including Lloyd's business, which is in
line with Optimal Dynamic assumptions.
The overall price decrease on the renewed contracts is contained to minus 0.6%, with
minus 3.6% price decrease on non-proportional business being partly compensated by
0.5% price increase on proportional business.
The expected profitability deteriorates compared to 2013 by around 1 percentage point in
terms of gross underwriting ratio and return on risk adjusted allocated capital, which is
planned to be partly compensated by the equivalent of 0.5 percentage point coming
from the increased efficiency of the retrocession program.
The ways in which these indicators are moving mean that with a business that is being
retained or put in the books, the overall portfolio continues to meet the target profitability
criteria. Additionally, as time goes by and the competition remains or intensifies, the terms
and conditions are getting closer to the minimum required in a number of markets and
lines of business which is when we expect that all the work that we have done to create a
company culture of capital and risk management will be a real differentiator in our favor.

Bloomberg Transcript

On this positive note, I'll let Paolo to comment on presenting the life activity and results.

Paolo de Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Thank you, Victor. Moving on to page 13 of the presentation, SCOR Global Life delivers a
strong set of results in the first half of 2014, continuing the execution of the Optimal
Dynamics plan. Gross written premium reached €3 billion, which translated into pro-forma
growth of 2.6% at constant exchange rates. As new business profitability continues to
meet the group ROE target, the solid premium growth reflects a healthy new business
flow globally. This is driven, among others, by Longevity in Europe and Financial Solutions
in Europe and Asia, as illustrated earlier in the year by the Longevity transaction signed
with Aviva and the value-in-force transaction entered with Mediterráneo Vida.
Looking at our in-force book of business, we continue to enjoy strong performance, both
in terms of premium persistency and emergence of results, with mortality trends in line
with expectations. This translates into strong technical performance with a technical
margin of 7.2%, confirming the ongoing evolution in the underlying mix, and in line with the
Optimal Dynamic assumption of 7%.
Moving on to slide 14, as you remember, we closed the acquisition of Generali U.S.A. (sic)
[Generali U.S.] (13:56) on October 1, making us the U.S. market leader based on 2012 data.
10 months after, we're happy to communicate that the integration of the acquired
business in SCOR is essentially completed, and the market leadership has been securely
maintained.

The smooth integration of Generali U.S.A. (sic) [Generali U.S.] (14:16) confirms on one side
SCOR's discipline and detailed execution framework. And on the other side, the strength
of the acquired team, which brings into SCOR Global Life a strong complementarity of
skills, technology and market know-how. This has allowed the new combined platform to
maintain the market leadership position with no material loss of client.

FINAL

With this, I turn it over to François for the investment results.

François de Varenne
Thank you, Paolo. Moving on to slide 15, SCOR's total investment portfolio, which is €23
billion at the end of June 2014, with an invested asset portfolio of €14.7 billion compared
to €14.1 billion at the end of December 2013. In a slightly improved economic and financial
context, SCOR Global Investments continues its policy of progressively reducing its
liquidity in the second quarter 2014, while selectively increasing the duration of the fixed
income portfolio in line with Optimal Dynamics.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thus, cash and short-term investments represent 11% of the assets at the end of June
2014 excluding (15:22) down 3 points compared to December 2013. Cash has been mainly
reinvested in corporate bonds and loans throughout the first six months. The duration of
the fixed income portfolio, which is 3.8 years excluding cash compared to 3.4 years at the
end of December 2013. This increase in duration is mainly done on GBP and USDdominated portfolios. Given the fall in euro rates in the second quarter of 2014, the
increase in the duration of the bond portfolio has been temporarily suspended.
The quality of the fixed income portfolio has been maintained with a stable average rating
of AA-. At the end of the first semester, expected cash flows on the fixed income
portfolio over the next 24 months stands at €5.3 billion including cash and short-term
investments, facilitating dynamic management of the reinvestment policy.
In the first six months of 2014, the invested assets portfolio generates a financial
contribution of €208 million. The active management policy employed by SCOR Global
Investments has enabled the group to record capital gains of €50 million. The return on
invested assets is well in line with Optimal Dynamics' expectations and stands at 2.9% for
the first six months of 2014.
And now, I will hand over to Antonio Moretti for the conclusion of the presentation.

Antonio Moretti

{BIO 17681290 <GO>}

Q&A
Operator

FINAL

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now move on to the Q&A session. Our first
question today comes from Tom Dorner of Citigroup. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas M. Dorner
Hi there. I've got two questions on the P&C reinsurance business. The first one is
something that you mentioned in the slides about sort of elevated management
expenses and that there's a timing issue. I just wonder if you could say something more
around that. And then second the question I had was on the Optimal Dynamics plan for
the P&C reinsurance business more generally the 93% to 94% combined ratio. I think you
assumed broadly stable pricing and I can see you've shown in this quarter that you are
steering the portfolio to try and offset some of the pricing pressure. But looking forward
into next year, are you still sort of comfortable with those base assumptions given what
seems to be happening in the market?

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thanks, Tom. Victor, on that questions, please.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, you are right that our Optimal Dynamics was assuming stable pricing overall. And
you're also right in saying that we've been managing the portfolio in order to contain the
impact of the price reductions. I think in a number of areas, we are getting close to the
minimum required, and I believe that the technicality and the discipline in the market will
contain the further reductions in some areas; in other areas, while recent events may give
rise to price revisions. So, overall, I don't think we have reasons to-date to deviate from
the plan. I think we still have enough of the franchise and leverage to contain the price
reductions for the next year.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Just regarding the P&C expense ratio, they are slightly elevated at H1. Some minor
expenses coming from a variety of areas, a little bit in Lloyds, but we still think that a 6.5%
combined ratio for the division is well in sight for the end of the year. So, it's probably
more of a timing issue which should trend down a bit, nothing that alarms us on our side.

Q - Thomas M. Dorner
Okay. Thanks.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question today comes from Michael Huttner of JPMorgan. Please go
ahead.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thanks. I've got two questions. One is can you say what's the benefit of this high
solvency? If it were me, I'm sorry I'm a little jerk, I would go home and count it at night, but
you probably do better things at solvency – yeah, yeah?

FINAL

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Michael, we couldn't hear what you said at the beginning. Can you repeat?

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay, right. On solvency, what is the benefit for shareholders? Are you going to increase
the dividend more, do buybacks, or does it just mean that you're waiting for the S&P
upgrade? And the second is now that you've completed Generali, so you've completed it.
You've repaid the bridge loan and the leverage is low. Are you now looking for next deal?
Thank you.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Next question please. Mark, what are we going to do with the excess solvency?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Yeah. So first of all, it's a nice position to be and to be approximately 5% above what we
outlined as our optimal solvency range, so we're very happy with that. I would caution
based upon I think the slide we tried to put forward, tried to balance this risk, but we are
in a transitory period for the next 12 months with the ACPR domestic regulator just like
other companies would be in Solvency II's framework.
We're trying to get our model approved, and so if there is potential for model
adjustments to be made and until that is secured, we're going to stand still with this
solvency and excess capital level as we see it at the current time. I think in 12 months,
once this thing is finalized, we can start entertaining questions like that.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

On the second question, now that we have integrated Generali that we have paid back
the loan. We spent the time to define, let's say, what we're going to do for the Life
activities of the group. And I'm going to give the floor to Paolo to say what's the strategic
reviews that he has been doing over the last six months. So, Paolo?

A - Paolo de Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Yeah. I think we're going to give a wider update when we meet for the Investor Day. I think
we reviewed that all markets, and I think at this point we can really confirm that the
Optimal Dynamic targets are in sight and reachable in the period of 2016. I think, at this
point, on the Life side, we don't foresee any need for further acquisitions. I think that we
have a very good global footprint, and I think we now need to leverage it.

Our next question today comes from Daniel Bischof of Helvea. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Thank you and good morning. Two questions. Firstly, on the casualty initiative, which has
been bleak given the market conditions, could you give an update what you're seeing in
the marketplace and how you look at casualty in the short term?
And then, secondly, again, on solvency, thanks for slide five. Could you talk about the
potential effects of the model changes? I mean, first of all, in which direction you would
expect it to move, and secondly, what kind of magnitude you're talking about.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Daniel. Victor, on the casualty initiative and how we see the casualty
market.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

I think the casualty initiative is on track in the sense that it is very client focused, it was
driven by basically our E&S clients focused in the U.S. On that, I think there are movements
in that particular market regarding the reinsurance purchase that allows us to continue
with the initiative. Well, we are progressing. I think to-date on this year, the total premium
income from that initiative stands at about $30 million. I remind you that we have an
objective of $150 million over three years. So, I think we are on target for the first year.

FINAL

We see tensions in the market. But within that particular segment, I believe that while our
pricing levels will stand very much in line with what we expected. And, again, as we are
taking a global view of those clients across all lines, Treaty P&C, Specialty Lines, while we
believe that on an overall basis this is still very relevant for us to strengthen our position
with that particular client base which is in between 25 and 40 clients in the U.S. market.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Frieder Knüpling on the model changes?

A - Frieder Knüpling

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. We are just now finalizing the pre-application process with European regulators, that
is, I mean, the first review of our internal model which they have conducted over the
course of the past two years, and this is now coming to an end. And we are now going
into a phase where we are discussing the high level observations and recommendations
which come out of this review and this is going to take place in the next six months really.
So, it's a little early to comment on the likely outcome of this and, really, I don't want to
speculate about individual outcomes there. So, I hope that by the end of this year, we'll
have more clarity and then we'll obviously prepare everything which needs to be done for
filing the internal model for approval next year. That's going to be possible only starting in
April, and we'll do it soon afterwards once all the Solvency II literature and the draft text
have been transposed into national law. That's something which still needs to happen, so
there's still a considerable amount of uncertainty around the details of the process, but
our target is to get through this process by the end of next year, in time, before Solvency
II comes in in 2016.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Thank you. Our next question today comes from Kamran Hossain of RBC. Please go
ahead.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions. Just coming perhaps to the capital position.
Could you give us an update on where you stand versus the S&P AA range? And I guess
kind of second one on that. To what extent is achieving a AA rating an aim score at the
moment? And what's S&P's view? How do they accept your internal model at the
moment? Do they look to that and give you more credit for that? So, if you could give
some of your comments around that. That'll be helpful. Thanks.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Okay. So, maybe, Mark on this issue.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}
Page 10 of 22



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2014-07-31

FINAL

Yeah. So first of all, with the level of excess capital on S&P's model, we've updated that
just recently, so we're significantly above the AA level of capitalization that's required in
their model, won't get into more precise figures other than to say that it's significant. I
think last year, we gave you some comments that it was right around that level or
marginally above. So, there has been an uptick. The risk credit provided for the model,
they did spend extensive time with us as did a couple of the other rating agencies. It's not
strictly S&P that's interested in it. So, that's reflected.
And then with respect to the AA- aim or ambition, this is more of a nice-to-have, not a
target of the group. For us, the internal model is paramount with what we do and how we
run the company. The rating agencies and some of the regulatory measures that we have
globally serve as additional constraints, but the company is firmly run by the internal
model.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Perfect. Thanks very much.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Of course, if S&P is on line, may I add that it's not only nice to have, but it's certainly very
nice to have. So, we hope that the message has been sent through.

(29:10) combined ratio, versus a 2.5 points on return on capital. And also, I just – I'm not
sure I caught – you mentioned the retro impact on that. Was that – reduces the impact by
0.5 point on the combined ratio?

A - Antonio Moretti

{BIO 17681290 <GO>}

Will, would you mind saying that again? We missed the first part again.

Q - William Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Okay. Let's try that one more time. I was just hoping to understand the math, really,
behind the 1 point combined ratio deterioration from the June-July business versus the
2.5 points on the return on capital. Is it just the required capital amount is going up
significantly because of the deteriorating margin? And then the second part was just – I
actually misheard, ironically, regarding the retro impact. Was that half-a-point on the
combined ratio?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Victor?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Okay. So, the second part, what we are saying is that basically, on a year-to-date basis, we
have a deterioration of the gross underwriting ratio, as well as the return on allocated
capital of about 1 percentage point on each. And what we are saying is that, because of
the efficiency that is of the retro program, that has been improved at its renewal (30:27)
end of last year. We believe that half of the deterioration of the combined ratio of the
gross combined ratio is going to be compensated by the impact, or the effect, of the
retro session program.

Q - William Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Right. So just to be clear, Victor, 1 point is the gross impact?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

That's it. Yeah, we measure the gross impact, which is basically what you measure with
your underwriting and pricing tools. We work on gross and then you add to that the effect
of your retro session.

Sure.

FINAL

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

As far as the first point, well, the relationship between the deterioration on the return on
capital and the combined ratio is basically that your return on capital takes into account, as
you rightly say, the variation of capital intensity by line of business which reflects, first of
all, your loss models, and if you strengthen your loss models, which is what we have done
in certain areas and in particular in nat cat, well then you've got capital intensity increases
that is reflected in your return if the prices are not following.

Thank you. Our next question today comes from Thomas Fossard of HSBC. Please go

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good morning. I've got two questions. The first one will be on your newly Alternative
Solution initiatives. Could you tell us what is the aim? What you're willing to achieve? How
you want to position yourself compared to the competition which has been, I would say,
very lively and innovative over the past two years? What SCOR is bringing to the table on
that side of the business?
Second question will be on the financial assets. Could you just update on the expected
return investments for the full year, now you achieved already six months? And maybe
also, could you give a bit of more granularity around the €30 million of gains extraction on
the fixed income book in Q2? Thanks.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Victor, on the initiative.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, the initiative consists in basically regrouping activities that were done within the
business units in a specialist unit dedicated to what we call Alternative Solution and that,
that will encompass both clients from the insurance world as well as from the large
corporate. This goes with the fact that reinsurance purchase is more and more driven by
Wealth Capital Management. And we have been providing ourselves, through our various
business unit solutions, to help our clients to manage their capital. And we want really to
capitalize on that and by adding a dedicated unit, we believe that we can develop more
specialist resources and more efficiencies in addressing the problems.
This unit will work like a specialty line. It means that the relationship, the prime relationship,
will stay with the underwriters, with the P&C treaty underwriters for instance, as far as
Page 13 of 22



Company N ame: SCOR SE

insurers are concerned, with business solution as far as large corporate is concerned, but
the specialist team will come and back them up in order to strengthen the offer to the
clients.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

FINAL

Correct.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Today, I think, to give you an idea, probably today I would say that, depending on the
definition of alternative solution, that varies from one market to the other, or one
reinsurer to the other, probably around 10% of our total premium can be assimilated
today to Alternative Solutions. So, we are not starting from scratch. We are starting from
an existing base, which is already sizeable, but we want to further specialize that and
regroup it into a dedicated unit.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Let's segue to (34:56) François, do you expect a return for the full year?

A - François de Varenne

Bloomberg Transcript

So, Thomas, we indicated at the beginning of the year the expected retail invested assets
for the full year, so which mean, including income, dividends, (35:12) income, and realize
capital gains in the range of 2.4% to 2.9%. We run the portfolio today for the first six
months of 2014.
We then annualize return on invested assets of 2.9%. I confirm the assumption of 2.4%,
2.9%, probably, let's say, given current market levels, we should be in the mid part of the
range indicated previously.
In terms of granularity on the types of gains we took on the fixed income portfolio
recently, as you know, we have an active management of the portfolio and especially on
the fixed income part, so which means it's not only a pure biannual strategy, it could be
the case for some assets like loans. But on the fixed income portfolio, we like to detect
collective values on names and securities, so which mean we trade those names or those
securities when we think – or assumption, initial assumption on relative value is reached,
so it could be on rates on spread. So, it's spread between the risk covered bonds, agency
MBS and corporate bonds.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi there. Two questions. Firstly, for Victor, I just wanted to clarify, because there's quite a
lot of different metrics you're looking at the evolution of the P&C profitability. I think you're
saying that you still are maintaining confidence on the Optimal Dynamics 93%-94%
combined ratio. But is it fair to say after a lower expected volume than maybe you'd
hoped for, because you're having to possibly restructure more of your book given price
declines and the opportunities for deploying capacity are reducing as well, so is it the
case that you're reiterating confidence in the margin, but you'd be more cautious on the
volume?
And the second question on the investment side, François, more on the reinvestment
rate. In Q1 you reiterated – well you said that you felt that the average expected
reinvestment rate for 2014 I think was 2.6%. You lowered that slightly to 2.5% in Q1. Where
is it now? I mean, I'm guessing if you're no longer extending duration and given
benchmark yields have fallen, the 2.5% has fallen again. Just give us an update on that.
That would be helpful. Thanks.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Victor, please.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

We'll address that in details at the Investor Day in September, but I think the first thing and
the most important thing as regard to Optimal Dynamics on the top-line side is the
foreign exchange impact. And I think the way Optimal Dynamics was planned, at which
exchange rates, and where are we today on the exchange rates and where are we going
forward. We will do an update on that at the Investor Day.
Besides the exchange rate impact, your dollar and pounds and other currencies versus
euro, well I think our growth business-wise at constant exchange rate is today more or
less in line with what we thought it would be. So, we have no reason to believe that for
this particular year we are very much outside of the Optimal Dynamics assumptions.
For next year, well for us, it's very simple, we'll do whatever we can to maintain the
portfolio. Obviously, we already see that in certain areas we have to let business go. As I
have said, our cancelled and restructured is increasing again. If it's necessary, well, we will
do what we need to do. But, again, no particular reason to warn on the possible deviation
today.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

François, on the reinvestment rate?

A - François de Varenne
So, on the reinvestment rates, indeed, I mentioned in Q4, in the presentation of Q4 result
and Q1, reinvestment rate of 2.5%, 2.6% for the full year 2014. I just remind the definition
of the reinvestment rate. So, that's the average reinvestment rate on the entire portfolio,
Page 15 of 22



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2014-07-31

FINAL

so not only on the fixed income. So, that's all asset classes. We could include loans, real
estate and other investments on top of the fixed income portfolio. And of course it
excludes cash and short-term investments since here the remuneration is at almost zero.
So, as of today, despite, let's say, the recent movements on rates and especially on the
euro ones what we see is that our reinvestment policy is targeted today on asset classes
that are less sensitive to interest rate movements. That's clearly the case of loans and
some corporate bonds we select on the portfolio.
So, at this stage, despite the recent movement on the euro rate, we still have an
assumption for the full year 2014 of, let's say, an average rate – a reinvestment rate of
2.5%, 2.6%. I'll just draw your attention on slide 39 and the evolution of the income yield
on the portfolio. It was for the fourth quarter 2013, 2%. 2.1% in Q1 2014 and 2.4% in Q2
2014. So, even if there is a part of seasonality due to dividend in Q2, that we estimate
around 8 basis points to 10 basis points, you see that – hopefully see and the fact that we
reinvest today at a higher average rate, it start to be visible in the income.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

And the reason it's not fallen much is that there's a bigger weighting of the reinvestment
to pound and dollar versus euro. Is that the main reason why it hasn't fallen?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - François de Varenne
Yeah, because if you remember, I mean, the split for currencies in our portfolio, you know
that we are very strict on currency policy. But especially after the Transamerica Re and the
Generali U.S. acquisition, the invested asset portfolio is nominated for 44% today in USD
and for 11% on British pounds, so which mean more than 50% of the portfolio is
denominated in currencies where we start to see since, what, last summer, one year ago,
a nice increase of interest rate. And we expect this increase to continue especially after
the publication of the GDP in the U.S. yesterday. And the euro, it's just one-third of our
portfolio. So, we have a huge diversification in terms of currency, and we take benefit of
course of this diversification per currency bucket.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

And you could start lengthening duration again in those currencies in Eurozone where
you're not going to be lengthening at this point?

A - François de Varenne
So, you're right and that's what I mentioned in my speech and you'll have the full update
also during the Investor Day early September. We started to increase the duration. And
you see just here the aggregate number on the total fixed income portfolio. And as I
mentioned it, we started to increase the duration at the end of 2013, so after the
summer, mainly on the USD and GBP portfolio. And we wait a little bit given, let's say, the
current mess in the Eurozone.

Thank you. Our next question today comes from Maciej Wasilewicz of Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead.

Q - Maciej K. Wasilewicz

{BIO 16462204 <GO>}

Hi. It's Maciej from Morgan Stanley. Two questions if I may. Number one is on the
movement in yields year-to-date. I would have thought that given that you've got a short
asset duration portfolio, the downward movement in yields would have a negative impact
on your economic capital and perhaps also on your available capital under your economic
capital model. I'm wondering if you could outline what impact, if any, the movement in
yields year-to-date might have had of that kind of nature.
And the second question I'd have is, I think if I remember correctly and correct me if I'm
wrong, that you were looking to increase the cat business over time to balance out your
portfolio. Can you tell me whether or not your P&C PMLs have moved up or down year-todate because you might also have pulled back from some treaties that were
unprofitable? So, I just wanted to know whether there's been any major movement in the
last renewals, upwards or downwards, in the PMLs. Thank you.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Victor, maybe you could start by...

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, we had in the plan a strengthening of our U.S. cat underwriting. And this is being
processed as planned with a bit probably of slowing down considering the market
conditions. But overall, the plan is developed normally. So, yes, we have an increase of
P&L in the U.S., but well within the plan and totally within the risk management limitation
that we had defined in Optimal Dynamics, and at returns that are well within our targets.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Frieder, on the part of interest rates on the available capital?

A - Frieder Knüpling
Yeah. Our asset portfolio is slightly shorter than our liabilities. I think we disclosed the
matching position last year at the IR day. So, increase in interest rates are beneficial for
our economic capital. They also slightly reduce our required capital. And that's what we've
seen last year, that the increase in interest rates up until the end of the year has added to
the improvement in the solvency ratio. And then, as far as FX is concerned, it's relatively
neutral because we've got a fairly good match between required and available capital as
far as currencies are concerned. It's not perfect, but movements in the U.S. dollar-euro
exchange rates broadly have a comparable effect on available capital and required

Page 17 of 22



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2014-07-31

capital. So they don't move the solvency ratio significantly. And we'll provide more
detailed sensitivities on that at the IR day in early September.

FINAL

Q - Maciej K. Wasilewicz

{BIO 16462204 <GO>}

So, would it be fair to say then, because yields have come down this year, year-to-date,
that there'll be some negative impact on that solvency ratio on the available capital from
that decline? Would that be fair to say? Maybe offset by other factors, but nevertheless.

A - Frieder Knüpling
Yeah. If you look at this effect alone directionally that would be the case. I mean you would
see broadly an opposite effect of what we saw last year. It's not going to be very material,
but in principle, that's true.

Hi. Good morning, everyone. So, my first question is on the slide 34. Apparently, you had a
pretty good performance across the board regarding inflows. Is it something that we
should extrapolate, and can you make an update on this part of your business? And my
second question is, I think for Victor, on the aviation market, this recent accumulation of
losses in a market that was already – that was in a situation where prices were very low,
do you expect it to create some opportunities for you and, in particular, can you comment
on your potential appetite for the war part of this aviation business, and more generally,
how can you leverage this? Thank you.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thanks, Thomas. François, on third-party asset management?

A - François de Varenne
Yes. So, if you come back to slide 34, so indeed, I'm pretty proud of those numbers,
including commitments on some club deals we did recently. Today we manage a little bit
more than $1 billion, which is a nice achievement after 18 months. I maintain a target of
(48:57) an assumption of managing €1.5 billion at the end of the plan, so by the end of
2016. So, the idea is really here is, given the platform at the marginal cost to really
develop and set up a fee business without putting any capital at risk in the group.

With select investors, which is quite rare. On the airline, Victor, or do we have the time for
war coverage?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, the series of losses that we have seen in the past weeks, I think has got an impact
on the two sides of the market, from the war market definitely and the non-war market as
well, since some of – part of that risk, especially the passenger liability, stays within the allrisk excluding war market. So, if we take the all-risk excluding war market, well, we have
been hoping for a turn in that market for quite some time now. So, I think that has the loss
activity intensified. But there should be greater hopes that the market is going to turn. So,
yeah, let's hope and see.
On the war risk itself, the market is very small. Like aviation is no different from marine in
absence of war or war-like situations. This market tend to go to very distressed type of
conditions whether they are pricings or brokerages. I think the market had gone through
that sort of bad direction for quite some time. So now the market is hit by a series of
losses. This market will probably react hopefully, pretty strongly, and time will tell.
As far as we are concerned, we are not a war-risk player through our aviation underwriting
units. And I don't think we – well, we don't intend to become a war-risk player, even if the
market turns. I think this is a market that, in our opinion, is too small and too unbalance. So,
we are not going to change our underwriting policy on this. And I said that we had no
position in this market in Re and GAUM, which are our two main aviation underwriting
contracts. Well, do not have much appetite for that either. So, I think that would stay –
continuity of the current policy.

you cancel a restructured business, but also on the lines of business within your treaty
book of business, which grew as well by 5%. We have to split by geographies, but could
you also comment on the lines of business that grew there? And the second question is
on the life book of your business, there had been some significant longevity deals in the
first half of this year. So, could you comment a little bit on how you see the competition
there, and whether there is pressure on pricing right now?

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thanks. Victor, on the cancellation of some lines.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

If we segment the market, I think our projections were that, if you make the distinction
between local insurers, regional, global, monoliners, I think our projections was that our
portfolio of local insurers would suffer from increased competitions, whether it is in the
U.S., on the regional market, or in certain other regions of the world. That is what is going
on. So, most of the cancel and restructure is within that segment of local insurers.
And again, in the IR Day, we will show you the trends by segment. And this will really
appear very clearly. It's not a surprise for us. We know that this is an area that is getting
very competitive when the market is softening. That is what is going on, and we have to
selectively and strategically increase our selections of client, and let some business go, to
protect the overall margin.

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

On Longevity, Paolo?

A - Paolo de Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

On Longevity, we are, as you know, strong participants in the market. We participate one
of the biggest deals, the Aviva deal, in the first quarter. We are right now pricing deals,
both in the UK and outside the UK, as we think the Longevity line is slowly developing
towards a global product line. Whether it would be more competitive than the rest of the
market, I think it's a healthy competition. It is competitive. Some of the business is
brokered or somehow intermediated by banks. So, it does tend to be competitive.
On the other side, some of the deals requires extensive capacity, so that counterbalances
some of the push towards a very competitive price. But we think it's still very attractively
priced. It is a very good diversification for us given our mortality focus. So, we are a strong
participant in the market.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

Well, the line that hasn't increased overall is motor. So, anyway, the treaty book, Treaty
P&C means what it means, property, casualty and motor. While most of the increase that
we see at this renewal, because we are talking of this renewal and this June-July renewal
is basically Latin American, Caribbean, Australia and U.S. cat. So, obviously, the increase is
driven by property line because of the structure of the renewal. I mean, that's definite.

Q - Olivia S. Brindle

{BIO 17273762 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi there. I just wanted to clarify something on the attritional loss ratios. And I'm sorry if I've
misunderstood your previous comments but it seems like you're saying, on a net basis,
the deterioration and underwriting margins is 0.5 percentage point. So, the one of growth
and taking half of that adjusting through retrocession. So, the number that we should be
applying that to is the attritional loss ratio from last year because that was at 58.5% if you
take out reserve releases. So, that would point towards about 59% of attritional for this
year which, given you're at 57% so far at the half year and the plan within Optimal
Dynamics is also around 57%, just wondering if you could explain how those reconcile.
And also, I guess depending on your answer to that, what sort of trend should we expect
for that 57% of attritional? Is it a case of that you've achieved Optimal Dynamics more
quickly than you thought and maybe there's a bit more there as you continue to rebalance
the portfolio, continue to buy retro more effectively, or is it just a number now that we
should expect to be broadly flat going forward? Thank you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

I think we said last year that we were a bit ahead of Optimal Dynamics in the sense that
our attritional was improving faster than expected. We are now around 57%, and I think we
are stabilized there. What I meant is when I looked at the projection from the pricing tool,
if I project a deterioration of 1 point, first of all, this deterioration is not going to come
immediately. It's going to come with the earning of the premium which is over time. So, it
has got delayed impact and half of it being taken away by the efficiency of the
retrocession.
You can say that we are within a margin of negative evolution, and that's what I wanted to
say that there is no real threat of ourselves deviating from the 93%, 94% today because
the variation is within 0.5 point, which I think is something that is marginal. So you can
consider that our portfolio on the run rate today is, yes, around 57% of attritional, which is
in the metrics of Optimal Dynamics. Whether we can further improve it, depends on the
opportunities in the markets. As it is extremely fragmented, it's difficult to see general
trends, and we are really managing renewals as they go. So, I can't really predict. If we
Page 21 of 22

can, we would be happy to. I think we will definitely, and I think we are in a position to
maintain it at least where it is.
