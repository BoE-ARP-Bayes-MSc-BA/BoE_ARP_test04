Good day everyone. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call of Everest Re
Group Limited. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks
and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice
President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

{BIO 1986541 <GO>}

Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, and welcome to Everest Re Group's fourth quarter and
full-year 2014 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the
company's President and Chief Executive Officer; John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting
Officer; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer.
Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include
extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note
that statements made during today's call which are forward-looking in nature, such as
statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various
risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or
expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in
connection with such statements.
Now let me turn the call over to Dom.

FINAL

Thank you, Beth. Good morning. We were very pleased to report record operating
earnings for the year and quarter. Net income was slightly below that in 2013, due mainly
to less realized gains on investments. However, as a result of share buybacks, net income
on an earnings per share basis was higher year-over-year at just under $26 per share.
Most areas of our operations had excellent results, which contributed to the overall result.
The reinsurance segments continue to be the main engine, and another good year was
posted with the absence of any major cats. The underwriting result was flattish year-overyear and while the combined ratios slipped 2 points, the portfolio is still generating
above-average returns.
This slippage in combined ratio points will be discussed in greater detail by Craig and
John. But a couple of general factors accounted for this increase. These would include
business mix shift and, in our international operations, a higher attritional loss ratio due to
shock losses and storm losses not classified as cats.

Bloomberg Transcript

Declining rates overall are also a factor, but we have muted much of that by moving
attachment points to more attractively priced layers and buying external reinsurance in the
capital markets and from traditional providers.
The flexibility and adaptability to the market has been one of our hallmarks. In fact, in
many cases due to our capital structure, which effectively includes Mt. Logan and our
sponsored cat bonds, we have the ability to put out more capacity with the same or less
net peak zone PML exposure at better risk-adjusted returns. Overall, the net returns on
the cat portfolio in 2014 were higher than the gross returns due to efficient capital
management with the purchase of third-party reinsurance.
As a result, the absolute margins on our property portfolio on an expected basis were up
despite an annual expected loss from cats of approximately 12 points on our underwriting
combined ratio. This resulted in an increase in the ROE in this business as we deployed
our aggregate across a more diversified portfolio rather than expanding net exposures in
any of our peak zones. One of the few challenges in the portfolio last year was our crop
book, which suffered a $64 million loss, primarily due to a severe commodity price decline
which accounted for $36 million, with the remainder coming mostly from crop-hail losses.
Over the past couple of years, the industry has suffered a bit in this class, but over the
longer term it has been a good business. The crop division caused our insurance
operations to incur an underwriting loss for the year.
However, the improvement in the balance of the book has been notable. Excluding crop,
the insurance operation produced an underwriting profit of $15 million. On an accidentyear basis, that portfolio is now running around a 95% combined ratio. This has been a
good turnaround story.
Workers comp continues to benefit from rate increases, and our growth initiatives in
property and casualty E&S lines and specialty lines are all contributing to premium growth
and profit.

FINAL

Among other notable items in the quarter was the adjustment in our various reserve
positions. Overall, the impact from reserves was minimal but yet favorable. We did add
approximately $140 million to our asbestos reserves, enabling us to increase our survival
ratio to its historical levels. It had recently dropped due to an increased level of payment
activity during the year.
This area is difficult to estimate, but we felt it prudent to increase these reserves to a
more conservative position. Other reserve adjustments were in the insurance segment
for run off-lines.
These various charges, however, had no meaningful net impact on results due to
redundancies in other areas. Overall, a very sound reserve position with a track record of
favorable accident-year development in each of the last 10-plus years.

Bloomberg Transcript

Investment income continues to trend downward due to low rates in the fixed-income
markets. However, the fourth quarter was a bit stronger than earlier quarters due to
limited partnership income in our alternative-asset category. We have no immediate plans
to make significant shifts in our allocations, so at these interest rate levels you should
expect the downward trend in book yield to continue into 2016. The impact on net
investment income of a declining yield will be somewhat offset by any increase in
investable assets.
The rate of premium growth into 2015 will likely slow due to a decline in reinsurance price
environment and our increasing selectivity. However, we continue with new products in the
reinsurance segments, and our insurance segment will continue to be an area of greater
focus.
Of note is that more than half of our expected underwriting profit, after consideration for
normalized catastrophe losses is derived from non-cat exposed businesses. These other
lines of business have therefore been an important area to focus on as a mitigator to rate
pressures as well as providing a more diversified portfolio.
Share buybacks continued in the fourth quarter as well as an increase in our dividend.
Capital returned to shareholders totaled almost $650 million in 2014. Nevertheless, equity
capital increased $500 million during the year, which gives us capacity for growth
opportunities during 2015 and beyond.
Given the market conditions ahead, we would expect to continue share repurchases in
2015. Since 2006 we have repurchased 36% of outstanding shares and returned $3.4
billion of capital, and at the same time grew equity 46% from $5 billion to $7 billion. The
level of share repurchases in the future will, of course, be dependent on business
opportunities.
We remain committed to finding profitable growth from new initiatives and increasing our
returns from capital alternatives. Our responsive, flexible, and adaptive style will no doubt
continue to create opportunities in the year ahead.

FINAL

Thank you, Dom, and good morning, everyone. Everest had another strong quarter of
earnings, with net income of $340 million or $7.47 per diluted common share. This
compares to net income of $365 million or $7.54 per share for the fourth quarter of 2013.
Net income includes realized capital gains and losses. For the year, Everest had net
income of $1.2 billion or $25.91 per share compared to $1.3 billion or $25.44 per share in
2013. The 2014 result represents a return on equity of 17%.
Operating income for the year was $1.1 billion or $24.71 per share. This represents a 15%
increase over operating income of $21.47 per share last year. These record operating
results were driven by a strong underwriting result, foreign exchange gains, and lower
income taxes compared to 2013.

Bloomberg Transcript

The increase in underwriting income was partially offset by a lower derivative result and
lower net investment income compared to 2013. The results reflect a slight increase in the
overall current year attritional combined ratio of 82%, up from 81% last year. This measure
excludes the impact of catastrophes, reinstatement premiums, and prior period loss
development.
All reinsurance segments reported underwriting gains for the quarter and for the year.
Total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $275 million for the quarter compared
to a $390 million underwriting gain last year. For the year, total reinsurance reported an
underwriting gain of $862 million compared to an $877 million gain last year.
The insurance segment reported an underwriting loss of $36 million for the quarter
compared to a loss of $156 million last year. For the year, the insurance segment reported
an underwriting loss of $49 million compared to a loss of $147 million in 2013.
The 2014 results reflected a crop loss of $64 million for the year, comparable to last year,
but lower prior period loss reserve development in the insurance segment.
The Mt. Logan Re segment reported a $26 million underwriting gain for the quarter
compared to a $4 million underwriting gain for the same period last year. For the year, Mt.
Logan reported an underwriting gain of $73 million compared to a $9 million gain in 2013.
Everest retained $14 million of the underwriting income, and $59 million was attributable
to the non-controlling interest of this entity in 2014.
The overall underwriting gain for the group was $265 million for the quarter compared to
an underwriting gain of $238 million for the same period last year. For 2014, the
underwriting gain was $887 million compared to a gain of $739 million in 2013. These
results reflect $15 million of current catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter of 2014

related to the Brisbane, Australia, hailstorms. This compares to $30 million of cats during
the fourth quarter of 2013.
The fourth quarter of 2014 also included favorable development on prior-year cat losses,
primarily from Sandy losses in 2012. For the year, catastrophe losses were $62 million in
2014 compared to $195 million in 2013. Our reported combined ratio was 82.8% for the
year 2014 compared to 84.5% in 2013. The 2014 commission ratio of 22.0% was slightly
up from 20.6% in 2013, primarily due to higher contingent commissions on several years
of profitable results.
Our expense ratio remains low at 4.6% for the year compared to 5.0% in 2013. Everest
has one of the lowest internal expense ratios in the industry. We believe each point of
lower expense ratio translates to about a half point of higher ROE. This is truly a strategic
competitive advantage for Everest. On reserves, we completed our annual loss reserve
studies. The results of the studies indicated that the overall reserves remained adequate.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the fourth quarter, we booked prior-year development in the insurance segment and
for asbestos, which was more than offset by favorable development in the reinsurance
segments. The $20 million of prior year reserve development in the insurance segment
during the quarter was largely related to construction liability and umbrella business.
These run-off programs were discontinued by the company several years ago.
The $30 million of favorable prior-year development in the reinsurance segments reflects
$167 million of favorable development. This was offset by a $137 million increase in
asbestos reserves. The asbestos charge can be split into two components. First, the
reserves associated with the company's assumed reinsurance business were
strengthened by $100 million after completing our normal exposure analysis, in part to
bring the survival ratio more in line with our historical trend.
Second, the asbestos reserves related to Mt. McKinley's direct insurance business were
increased by $37 million. Everest has entered into a letter of intent to transfer the Mt.
McKinley asbestos reserves to another company. The proposed transaction indicated $37
million of funding would be required for the other company to assume the liabilities. So no
additional increase will be needed should the transfer be completed.
The $167 million of reinsurance favorable development mostly related to treaty casualty
and treaty property business, both in the United States and internationally. These
redundancies have developed over time, but we don't react until the position becomes
more mature. We continue to hold our estimates for the more recent years.
For investments, pre-tax investment income was $134 million for the quarter and $531
million for the year, a $17.4 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was below last
year as anticipated. This result was primarily driven by the low-interest-rate environment
and the decline in limited partnership income. Also, the cash flow used for share buybacks
and the redemption of debt contributed to this lower income.

FINAL

The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.2% as compared to 3.5% in 2013. Limited
partnership income was down $6 million year-over-year. However, our diversified
investment strategy enabled us to exceed our planned investment income for the year.
The increased allocation to equities was also a benefit to net income, as the year
reflected $55 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $197 million last
year. These gains are mainly attributable to the fair-value adjustments on the equity
portfolio.
A derivative loss of $16 million was recorded in the fourth quarter, reflecting a change in
the estimated valuation of our equity index put option contracts to include a better
estimate for expected future dividends. This change resulted in cumulative catch-up loss
adjustments over the seven open option contracts.

Bloomberg Transcript

On income taxes, the 2014 operating income effective tax rate was 12.2%. This 12.2%
effective tax rate for the year was in line with our expectations for a year with much lower
than planned cat losses and the additional foreign tax credits utilized. Strong cash flow
continues, with operating cash flows of $1.3 billion for the year compared to $1.1 billion in
2013.
This is primarily due to our premium growth and lower catastrophe loss payments.
Shareholders' equity for the group was $7.5 billion at the end of 2014, up 7% compared to
the $7 billion balance at year-end 2013. This is after taking into account capital returned
through $500 million of share buybacks and $146 million of dividends paid in 2014. The
company announced a 27% increase to its regular quarterly dividend and paid $0.95 per
share in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we repurchased another $36 million of stock after
the year-end close. These purchases will be reflected in the first-quarter 2015 financial
statements.
Book value per share increased 14% to $166.75 from $146.57 at year-end 2013. Our strong
capital balance positions us well for potential business opportunities as well as continued
share repurchases.
Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide the operations review.

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Thank you, Craig. Good morning. As Dom highlighted, we had a strong Q4 finishing a very
successful year. Our group gross written premium for Q4 was $1.4 billion, up 7% from Q4
in 2013, with the growth coming from all reinsurance segments. Our group net written
premium was $1.3 billion, which was up $40 million or 3% over Q4 2013.
For the full year, our group-wide 2014 premium was $5.75 billion, up $530 million, or 10%,
from 2013. Our group net written premium was $5.26 billion, up $250 million, or 5%.
Let me start with our reinsurance segment. I will focus more on the full year results for
2014 then turn to our January 1st renewals to give you some color on what we are seeing
in the market and some themes as to how we are navigating it. For our global reinsurance

FINAL

segments, including both total reinsurance and Logan, gross premium was $4.5 billion, up
15%, with growth coming predominantly from our U.S. and international reinsurance
segments.
Net premiums were $4.2 billion, up 7% as we continued to pursue our retrocessional
strategy to lay off some of our catastrophe exposure and lower our cost of capital. Our
reinsurance book, including Mt. Logan, generated $935 million of underwriting profit, a 5%
improvement compared to 2013.
These results highlight the success of the initiatives we have put in place over the last
couple of years to achieve profitable reinsurance growth, including the introduction of
several new reinsurance products such as PURPle, Everest's pillar product. Deploying
increased capacity to pro rata deals where we saw attractive original pricing, terms, and
conditions, pursuing new credit-related opportunities to various territories, developing
new strategic relationships across the globe with several key reinsurance clients,
increasing line capacity on several attractively priced property catastrophe treaties aided
by Mt. Logan, developing increased penetration and breadth of our international
facultative book, growing our regional footprint and leveraging our competitive strengths
to become lead reinsurer on various treaties in multiple countries, allowing us to drive
terms and conditions.
These initiatives have broadened and enhanced both our broker and client relationships,
which in turn has provided new opportunities to expand our writings whether it is on new
programs or layers or larger shares of existing treaties with our longstanding clients. And
despite a challenging rate environment, we achieved profitable growth as evidenced by
the results of 2014.
So what are we seeing for 2015? Certainly, it continues to be a challenging market, with
rates off between 5% and 15% depending on the line of business and territory. But having
said that, we were able to achieve better than market results given our rating,
longstanding client and broker relationships, broadly diversified portfolio, and our
underwriting diligence and flexibility.
We take an objective view of each deal at renewal and will scale back or non-renew deals
we do not like and redeploy capacity to deals and layers which we find to be better
priced. This mitigated the downward impact on our portfolio.
Let me provide you a bit more color on the January 1 reinsurance renewals in which we
wrote about $2.1 billion of treaty premium, which represents approximately 45% of our
annual reinsurance treaty premiums. Catastrophe excess of loss business represented
roughly 25% of this renewal. This is an important point. As you have all heard, market
participants expound on the double-digit rate declines in this sector. While we are not
immune to these pressures, 75% of our renewal was in-line outside of property cat
excess of loss, which speaks to the diversity of our portfolio and a mitigant to just
following the general market down.

Page 7 of 19

FINAL

We also have Mt. Logan, which provides efficient capacity to support this line. We continue
to see robust, ongoing investor appetite for the Everest Logan value proposition,
highlighted by Logan's best-in-class, risk-adjusted returns to investors. As of 1-1-2015, we
raised approximately $270 million of additional funds and Logan now stands at about
$690 million of assets under management. And 100% of Logan's capacity was fully
deployed at the 1/1 renewals. During 2014, Logan generated approximately $28 million of
earnings for Everest including fees.
Property related and short-tail business outside of catastrophe excess of loss
represented another 50% of the renewal writings. And while much of this has a cat
component, it is balanced by risk premium. Putting up larger capacity on short-tail deals
we like and in general, moving up attachment on property excess of loss layers softened
the impact of some of the rate reduction.
Our 1/1 cat-exposed premiums saw a couple of points of deterioration in the combined
ratio, but both our expected cat premium and dollar cat margins are approximately flat
compared to last year. USA rates held up pretty well, but we saw more competition this
renewal in Latin America, Canada, and China. Rates in Europe were also under pressure.
For PURPle, we saw some undisciplined competition in that space, so we redeployed
some capacity away from PURPle to some of our long-standing retro clients.

Bloomberg Transcript

Overall, we did see a three-point drop in our expected ROE at this 1/1 on our worldwide
property XOL book, as the deals that many of the clients are now buying are more capital
intensive.
We believe this highlights and validates our property retrocessional strategy with the
increased use of Logan, Kilimanjaro issuing $950 million of cat bonds, and other nontraditional and traditional sessions to manage our net cat PML and lower our cost of
capital. As a result of these strategies, our net ROE continues to be greater than our
gross ROE on our worldwide property cat book.
Casualty remains challenging, especially pro rata due to demands for expanded terms
and conditions. As a result, we continue to withdraw from some contracts, move from
quota share to excess of loss, and deploy capacity at higher layers on others.
We saw new opportunities at 1/1 outside of the mainstream that meaningfully added to
our top line. This includes a large motor quota share in Europe, a large international
professional liability quota share, increased lines for some of our global clients that were
only offered to Everest, and surplus relief deals that were not widely marketed to many
reinsurers. These new deals offset some of the premium from the quota share deal and
excess of loss deals which we non-renewed at 1/1/2015.
Four themes helped us this 1/1. Number one, we have one of the lowest internal expense
ratios in the industry, with our total reinsurance segment carrying only a 2.9% expense
ratio. Therefore, we get more dollars of margin and a higher ROE on the same premium
than others do.

Number two; we are more diversified than most of our competitors. We use our capital
across more zones and perils, and that naturally lowers our internal cost of capital.

FINAL

Number three, the retrocessional strategy of Logan, Kilimanjaro cat bonds, ILWs, and
other traditional and non-traditional sessions lowers our cost of capital further.
And number four, our reinsurance operational structure is another sustainable competitive
advantage. Everest has one view of risk around the globe. But we deploy capacity to our
clients by senior lead-market experienced underwriting teams in a decentralized fashion
and empower those teams to make decisions.
This allows us to know our customers very well and move quicker and in scale, better and
faster than our competitors who write only a few lines of business or who write out of
one, only one or two offices.

Bloomberg Transcript

Across all classes on a constant foreign exchange basis, our gross reinsurance premium at
1/1/2015 was approximately flat compared to last 1/1. Our net reinsurance premium
declined by about 2% this 1/1 as we reinsured more of our book with the growth in Mt.
Logan's AUM and the capacity provided by the Kilimanjaro cat bonds, in addition to
increased use of other traditional reinsurance to effectively protect our net position.
We are pleased with the outcome of our 1/1 renewal despite market conditions and
expect 2015 to be another strong year for our reinsurance book. Being innovative and
providing ideas and solutions to our clients, as well as our ability to execute quickly and in
size, is now more important than ever. Our focus on new business opportunities, new
products, new distribution sources, and leveraging our competitive strengths remains key
to our underwriting success.
With our balance sheet, ratings, and ability to nimbly deploy both rated capacity and
unrated capacity in size, to support our business, we have more tools in our toolkit to
compete and win against non-traditional capacity as well as other traditional reinsurers.
Now, turning to our insurance operations. We wrote $300 million of insurance premium in
the fourth quarter and wrote $1.2 billion for the year. For both the quarter and the full year,
that is down about 5% compared to the same period last year.
But removing crop insurance, both the quarter and the full year are up approximately 10%
in premium, with growth coming from each of our insurance units.
Insurance growth initiatives that we have put in place over the last couple of years have
been providing benefits to the top and bottom-line. These include staffing up
underwriting operations and expanding broker relationships, both property and casualty,
increasing our property insurance geographic footprint, driving international insurance
expansion, including growing our existing Canadian platform, and building out new
product, distribution and strategic relationships within our specialty insurance operation,
both in the U.S. and internationally.

FINAL

Insurance calendar year results ran to a loss due to our crop results, which is consistent
with what we have been discussing on prior earnings calls. Excluding crop, our insurance
operation ran to a $15 million underwriting profit. This was almost $100 million
improvement in underwriting results year-over-year.
Our crop insurance book had an underwriting loss of $22 million in Q4, resulting in a
calendar year underwriting loss of $64 million in 2014. These results were driven by four
issues: lower commodity prices during 2014, particularly for corn; below-average results in
Minnesota, our largest state and typically our most profitable; significant losses in crop hail
due to an unusual number of hailstorms throughout the Midwest; higher expenses
associated with new technology and IT initiatives.
We anticipate improved underwriting results in our crop book in 2015, with a larger, more
diverse book of business and increased operating efficiencies derived from an updated
systems infrastructure. In other lines of business, in terms of rates, we continue to see
rate increases in our California workers comp book of about 7%, but the rate increases
have slowed as more competition has come into that space.
General liability was up about 7% for the quarter. Professional liability rates were down
about 5%, and property insurance rates were also down about 5%. As before, we
continue to roll out many new insurance and reinsurance products in 2015. We are hopeful
for meaningful growth in our insurance operations as we capitalize on opportunistic
expansion, both geographically and across product lines.

We have our first question from Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Your line is open. Please go
ahead.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Thanks, and good morning, and congrats on the quarter. Just a few clarification type of
questions. Number one, just going back to the discussion on Mt. McKinley, how much –
what's the size of the reserves that is being shipped off from that?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Mt. McKinley is about $150 million of reserves that would be transferred.

And that's in Q1?

FINAL

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, we don't know when the transaction will close. We have to go through all the
regulatory approvals and things like that. But I would suggest that it probably would be the
beginning of Q2.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. The other question I had was on – this goes back to the discussion on
renewals and thank you for the expanded commentary this quarter. In terms of some of
the new opportunities which you talked about, I think you mentioned a motor quota share
and a large international account, do you have some sense of – I guess, why was it shifted
to you and how did it perform previously? I'm just trying to get a sense why it was nonrenewed by the previous reinsurer?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I'm not sure, Amit, that we can really get into that level of detail relative to prior reinsurers.
In some cases, it might not have even been a transaction that had been in the market. A
number of these deals that John had referenced are surplus-driven or financially-driven
transactions. They do have risk transfer in them, of course, but its capital relief type
products in some cases. And in other cases, it's helpful to companies as to how they
manage their capital at various subsidiaries around the world. So they're all different.
Why is Everest the company of choice? Some of the things that John mentioned, I think,
are important to us. I think in the community at large, I think we hope that we're viewed as
an innovative market and a market that's quick to respond, flat organizational structure so
that any significant transaction can quickly get to John's desk or my desk if it needs that
level of approval and a strong rating and the global footprint. And those are all reasons
that we've been emphasizing, and that's what we found as why we're a market of choice
in many of these unique transactions.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

I guess, what I was trying to figure out is – and I'm just a bit surprised that you've had
these opportunities for a few quarters. And I'm just trying to figure out if it's a size issue,
why some of your peer companies have not been able to capitalize and find similar
opportunities?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Oh, I think it's hard to generalize. I do think in part, it's a size issue. It could be a ratings
issue. It could be the fact that these are not the types of transactions that this company
has shown an interest in or had a risk appetite for. It's hard for me to explain what the
reasons might be.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Okay. And just finally, any change in the buyback philosophy versus as it relates to your
discussion on premiums? Do you expect – should we anticipate that to be any different
versus what we've seen in the past? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

I think what I've tried to emphasize in my comments was that, we've bought back a
significant – returned a significant amount of capital in the past several years. I would
anticipate that we would continue to do that given the current market conditions. But
obviously if the market changes then we would change direction on how much capital we
would return. So, I don't anticipate any major change at this point, what I think would be

Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Thanks. Just a couple here if I could. The expense ratio in international reinsurance in
Bermuda in particular lifted in the fourth quarter. Was there something that happened that
was kind of fourth quarter specific, in particular, in Bermuda, or maybe there were some
other driver? Thanks.

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Michael, this is Craig. In the fourth quarter, we typically have compensation related
accruals at year end. And if you recall, again, we had a record quarter of results in the
fourth quarter as well.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay. So, but even with the year-over-year comps – I mean, fourth quarter of last year was
pretty good, too, right? So that's all just incremental comp on that we should be thinking
about, and it's just specifically in Bermuda?

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

No. The majority of it is where you're seeing it maybe even in total segments compared
to third quarter into fourth quarter.

FINAL

Michael, I wouldn't look too much into individual segments because each of those are
subject to individual accruals and year-end adjustments. I think the main topic is the overall
group, and the difference in the fourth quarter was what Craig specified, which was
predominantly compensation adjustments as it relates to putting it in line with our yearend results. So, the individual segments can be a myriad of factors that are local.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay, great. Thanks. And then, Dom, you mentioned the net ROE versus the – I'm sorry,
John mentioned the net versus gross ROE. Just trying to understand – I imagine that
includes the difference is in part Mt. Logan because you cede some business to Mt.
Logan. So I'm just trying to understand the relationship of the ROE at Mt. Logan versus the
ROE at Everest.

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Good morning, Michael. This is John.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Good morning.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Yeah, we've been talking about this for several quarters that there's different – by having
rated and unrated capacity, there's different constraints, there's different capital
requirements. And it's not just cost of capital, it's also that there's different ROE for a
rated company is impacted by how rating agencies think of the capital that you need to
hold to support the businesses. And so it gives us the ability to find the right fit for
business.
But deal-by-deal and across the portfolio, Logan is very critical for that. But it's also part of
a broader strategy that involves the cat bonds and other traditional sessions that we
have, and it allows us to kind of – and also within Mt. Logan, we have different investor
appetites low risk, medium risk, high risk that results in lower return, medium return, and
higher return. And having that combination gives us a lot more flexibility to be able to
deliver the most value for our clients and have the best net position for Everest.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it, okay. And then Dom, I think you had mentioned that, I think, in your opening
remarks that cat business represents about half of the underlying profit or of the profit on
a run-rate basis, I guess, when you adjust for model cats. Can you share, what was that
percentage in 2014 on an actual basis? Do we have that?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

The number is probably somewhere between $300 million and $400 million of
underwriting profit, non-cat.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay, got it. Great. Thanks. And then last one if I could sneak one more in. I think John, you
mentioned last quarter that you were seeing some 20% return opportunities in, I think,
somewhere more on the financial side in terms of those types of transactions. Just would
love an update on that. Is there still an opportunity to generate that level of return in that
part of the portfolio? And thanks so much for all the answers.

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

The short answer is yes. We continue to see – and, again, we've been talking about this
for a while. Not just do we have a large balance sheet and a high rating, but we also have
a lot of underwriting expertise bringing underwriting accounting tax, legal, contract
wording, and actuarial and bringing that all to the mix and solving clients' needs and
creating some one-off structures. And we continue to look for those.
And I think in general, we think the more it's less commodity, less plain vanilla, that seems
to be under more pricing pressure. So having the ability to execute kind of multijurisdictional insurance/reinsurance combination deals gives us the ability to really solve
the clients' problems and use a lot of the different competitive advantages that we have.
And we continue to think that there's a lot of runway for that.

Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith from Evercore. Your line is open. Please go
ahead.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. The first question is on the increase of the combined ratio for next
year, that's 2015. You talked about, I think, a couple of points increasing the combined
ratio from the cat business. So, I was just curious as to – so when you shake it all together
for the other lines of business because pricing is down, where do you see it sort of
coming out to?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

What was the last part of that?

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

So for the cat business, I believe you said that the combined ratio would increase maybe
about a couple of points for the cat business. I was wondering also for the non-cat
business. So, if we shake it all together for the company as a whole on the reinsurance
side, how many points of an increase on the combined ratio do you think you got of the
Jan 1 renewals?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah, you're really leaning us more towards giving earnings guidance, which, Vinay, we
really try not to do. I think – or we expect, let me just say it this way – we expect our
insurance operations combined ratio to improve. I'm not really going to give you any
guidance on what that expected combined ratios would be in the insurance portfolio.
On the reinsurance portfolio, a lot of that is dependent upon the types of transactions
that we see. Certainly we will strive to maintain a combined ratio targets that we've been
accustomed to. And that will likely mean that some of the transactions that we were on in
2014, will probably not renew, and then we'll look for other types of transactions. As John
mentioned, we're doing some new products, expanded our capabilities into the credit
area. And a lot of that reinsurance we expect to run at better combined ratios than our
traditional reinsurance book. So, part of it is dependent upon the mix and that's the best
answer that I can give you at this point.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure. Fair enough. And on the cat business, you said that it's going to be about a couple
of points higher, but pricing seems to be a lot lower. I was just wondering what the
difference is – the difference, the retro that you guys are buying.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

No, that's – the retro really is a capital issue, Vinay. The combined ratio on a gross basis –
those were gross basis comments. And what – a lot of that, again – and we keep trying to
articulate this to you that it's – that the ability to move between product, between layers,
between clients to redeploy capacity from one product segment to another, as we try to
utilize the cat capacity that we're willing to deploy at any renewal, and really be able to
move seamlessly between that.
And one example is within our treaty property department, it's the same team that writes
pro rata, risk, cat, and retro. And that, having the ability to dynamically allocate capacity to
help where the clients' needs are and where we think the best pricing is as well as moving
up and down attachment points within a layer and ask, again, we think because of our
market position, we have the ability to get more the signings in the layers we want. And
that really helps drive what you're seeing.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure. So it's a mix issue besides the pricing, right? Okay, okay.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

The mix influences the combined ratio.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure, sure. Fair enough. Then just a 50,000-foot view, we've seen a lot of M&A in the
industry. You guys are about a $8 billion market cap company. Curious about your thoughts

on M&A.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

FINAL

Thoughts in what regard?

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Are you interested in combining with others? Do you think your size is large enough that
you don't need to? And also, do you think you're going to get some more opportunities?
If you guys don't combine and the others do, do you see some more opportunities sort
of within the industry for your premiums?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, I think we have been emphasizing our scale and diversity for some time. So,
obviously, I think we've been communicating that. We think we have sufficient scale. So we
don't really see the necessity or urgency for combinations. Others may view it differently.
But I think in essence what you're seeing in the marketplace, in that regard, somewhat
validates what we've been saying have been the Everest advantage. So that's what I'll
really say about that.
In terms of the combinations and what it means to the marketplace in general, it all
depends on execution. Many times, these combinations can be disruptive; maybe they
won't be. We will see. It can affect market, it can affect shares of programs. It can affect
teams of people. There's always some churn that will occur as a result of any kind of a
merger in any industry.
So time will tell, and we'll see how that will evolve over the months ahead. Perhaps it
creates opportunities, perhaps not. What I will say is that, in some regard, this could be
good for the industry in the sense that perhaps some of the capital does come out of the
business and creates further discipline. So that could be a good outcome for some of
these combinations.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Fair enough. And then, just really on Mt. Logan Re, so it appears that you guys have
increased capital by maybe 60%, because you raised about $270 million more, correct?
So would it be fair to assume that the premiums also would be up a similar amount
because you've already deployed all the capital as of January 1?

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Yes. This is John. Yes, we would expect there to be some increase in the ceded session
to Logan.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay, all right. Thank you.

FINAL

And just – Vinay, one more thought relative to your size question. Keep in mind, as you
mentioned, an $8 billion market cap company, we're also – you add in the Logan piece
and the sponsored cat bonds that we have, so essentially, you can almost argue that
we're operating more like a $10 billion capitalized company.

Fair enough. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, please
go ahead.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. I think you made a very compelling case about your expense
advantage compared to your competitors on this call this morning. I don't know if that
translates necessarily to the insurance business, though. Why is Everest better in the
insurance businesses than their peers? And we've seen some variable results from
different reporters of crop insurance. Why have your results been weak this year while
some others haven't seen such weakness?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

I will let John talk about the crop piece because I think he hit some of those points in his
prepared remarks. But let me just perhaps admit that I don't know that we are better than
the industry on the insurance side. Our comment about the expense ratio was a
reinsurance comment and why we feel we're getting superior returns there.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Does it make sense – okay, go ahead, John, and then we'll come back.

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

So in terms of the crop insurance, we have a great team at Heartland and we – but we
know we need to grow that book. We need to diversify the book. A lot of it there is fixed
expenses, those high fixed expenses with infrastructure and systems. And so we know
that, so in all – a lot of the things we're talking about what we're doing on the reinsurance
side, we're trying to do that with our – with various insurance books including the
Heartland crop book.
And we would expect that with a better geographic footprint than we have, a bigger and
better geographic footprint will give us more diversification, better risk-adjusted returns. It
will also give us economies of scale. And I think some of the competitors may buy quota
shares. We do not buy quota shares. And then they get an override from the reinsurers,
and that may be impacting their expense ratio as well.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

We have some work to do there. But, again, to remind you that a significant portion of
that crop loss came from crop hail and not just MPCI.

FINAL

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

That's a great answer. And then coming back, if you are not necessarily better than your
peers in the insurance business, does it make sense to you to continue in that business?
I'm not telling you have to sell it or anything. But when you think longer-term, might it be
worth more to somebody else than it is to you?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Right now, Josh, we think it is a good diversifier for our platform. We have the ability to
deliver, we think, again, because of the diversification effect, a greater ROE. It's also a
source of business for us into any capital market platforms that we've talked about earlier
as well. So we do – here, again, when we talk about our net ROE being IRR gross ROE,
there's an opportunity to leverage that as well. So for the time being, we think that the
diversification and access to risk, being able to build out that platform is important to the
future of Everest.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

We also feel – we spend a lot of time looking at the trends, and we buy each of the
business units that we have. And the trends are favorable. We've been growing our
footprint whether it's our A&H operation, the SIG operation, our property facilities around
the group, the workers comp, the FI and professional teams, the casualty and
environmental teams, the trends have been favorable. And we are going to continue to
give those teams support and capacity and help them grow their footprint, to help them
get economies of scale, additional economies of scale, and leverage, again, the financial
strength and rating and ability to execute that Everest prides itself in.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

The in-force portfolio is delivering great results for us now, and we recognize that we've
had over the last couple of years a drag from discontinued books of business. And
obviously, as you can tell from this year, that's been greatly diminished. And so we think
it's a bright future there.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Well, congratulations. Certainly a great year overall.
