Presentation
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ageas event call. I am pleased to present CEO,
Mr. Bart De Smet. (operator instructions) Gentlemen, please begin.

Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, all for dialing in into this call and for
being with us for the presentation of the Third Quarter 2011 results of Ageas.
As usual, I'm joined in the room by my colleagues of the Executive Committee and our
Investor Relations team, and a number of other colleagues.
For the first time, we also have Christophe Boizard with us. As you know, Christophe
joined us in early September as our new CFO. He has more than 20 years' experience in
insurance, has been active in various European countries.

FINAL

Antonio Cano, the CEO of Ageas Insurance, is also present to answer some of your
questions.
Ladies and gentlemen. for a number of quarters now, we have been confronted with
significant volatility brought about by the challenging financial markets. It remains difficult
to predict how and when this will be resolved and in light of these uncertainties, we took
the decisions two weeks ago to pre-announce a number of important decisions with
respect to the Third Quarter results.
This included the decision to further impair our entire Greek sovereign portfolio, based on
the fair value at the end of September, with a net impact on our Third Quarter results of
EUR353 million; and secondly, an impairment charge of EUR85 million on our equities
portfolio.
Despite these significant impacts, our insurance solvency and shareholders' equity
remains strong at 210% and EUR7.9 billion respectively.
We also confirmed that we would not be in a position to maintain our net result outlook
for the full year, or provide any updated forecast due to the impairment charges and
ongoing volatility in the markets. But at the same time, we gave a clear indication that we
expect Ageas to be in a position to pay a dividend for 2011.

Bloomberg Transcript

Ladies and gentlemen. today we have released the full quarterly results as planned. Let
me elaborate on some of the key headlines.
We announced an insurance net result for the first nine months of EUR209 million
negative. However, excluding the impact of the financial turmoil, which year to date
amounts to EUR615 million, the insurance result would be up 22% compared to last year at
EUR406 million.
From an operational level, I am pleased to report further improvements in our Non-Life
performance, with a Group combined ratio remaining at 101.2% and at 100.2% if we
exclude Workmen's Compensation.
The inflow levels continue to show a mixed picture. Non-Life inflows are up by more than
30%, while Life inflows are 16% down, which is in line with the general market trend and
also reflects our conservative offer in a low profitability market environment. In this
context, it is important to note that our funds under management have remained constant
compared to the end of last year.
Our Group net results year to date amounted to EUR534 million negative, with a net loss
in the general account, which increased in the Third Quarter to EUR325 million. This
included a charge of EUR259 million (sic; see slide 2) related to the quarterly fair value
adjustment of the legacies. And of this amount, a charge of EUR190 million is explained by
the fair value adjustment of the acquired Fortis Tier 1 debt securities.

If we now look to the Third Quarter, we note that the inflows were at EUR3.9 billion, a
decline of 5% compared to last year. Life inflows were down 17% at EUR3.2 billion and
Non-Life inflows, at EUR1.2 billion, were up 40%.

FINAL

The insurance net result was EUR320 million negative, including the impairment charge of
EUR437 million. On slide three of the presentation, you will find an overview of the
impairments on fixed income and equities split by segments and by asset class.
Also in the Third Quarter, we had a net loss in the general account of EUR155 million,
including an additional charge of EUR150 million related to the valuation of the Fortis Bank
Tier 1 debt securities.
From slide six until 17, you will find the traditional details on our financial performance by
segment. Total inflows year to date amount to EUR12.9 billion, which is 6% down on last
year, and this figure includes EUR4.5 billion from our non-consolidated partnerships,
basically in line with last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

The insurance net result year to date, breaks down into a higher contribution from our
Non-Life activities at EUR57 million and from our UK Retail operations, the other segment,
at EUR23 million, and a negative result of EUR288 million in Life.
As already mentioned, Non-Life continues to perform well, with year-to-date inflows
totaling EUR3.7 billion. The promising results of our different Non-Life activities across the
various regions are evidence of the success of our strategy and, in particular, the
importance of having a well diversified business model.
Let me elaborate on this briefly. In UK, inflows are up 86% year to date at EUR1.5 billion.
We are benefiting clearly from recent investments, as well as from strong organic growth.
In its first year of operations, the inflows from Tesco underwriting are in line with our
original expectations at EUR680 million. Furthermore, the successful migration of
customers to Tesco underwriting has been achieved on schedule and according to plan.
Today, the Company covers some 1.4 million customers.
But in addition, also Ageas Insurance is performing strongly, with an overall organic growth
up 15%. The household activities and our commercial lines are both up 13%.
In Asia and Continental Europe, Non-Life inflows grew by more than 20% year to date.
Both Thailand and Malaysia are doing well. And in Continental Europe, I'd like to remind
you that our Turkish acquisition, Aksigorta, is included in these figures for the first time for
the months of August and September, contributing inflows of EUR66 million.
And finally in Belgium, the inflows continued to grow, fueled by a strong performance in
both our motor and fire activities and driven by a combination of higher tariffs and higher
volumes.

Page 3 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V

In terms of net results for the Non-Life activities, our performance improved by 40%
compared to last year, helped in particular by the continued strong performance in UK,
but also the higher contribution from the Asian operations.

FINAL

On the business level, motor is the best example of this improved performance, where in
both Belgium and UK, the combined ratio has remained substantially below 100%. And on
a segment level, the UK reported a year-to-date ratio just below 100%.
Only in Belgium, we do remain above 100%, as explained by the negative weather
impacts on fire and the Workmen's Compensation business. If we exclude the latter, the
combined ratio would have been at 100%.
The Third Quarter result includes a EUR12 million charge related to the severe summer
storms hitting Belgium at the end of August and also an impairment charge of EUR21
million in the Third Quarter. On a yearly basis, adverse weather cost some EUR35 million
of exit charges overall, while impairments amount to EUR31 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

If you exclude these significant non-recurring events and also 2010 for exceptional
developments, the operational performance has improved in Non-Life by more than 70%.
So all in all, we can be fairly satisfied with the performance in Non-Life so far.
In Life, the inflows amounted to EUR9.2 billion year to date, 16% below the levels of last
year. But to put these things in the right perspective, at levels similar to 2009. The
decrease, compared to last year, mainly stems from our consolidated activities in Belgium
and Continental Europe and is very much a market trend in these markets, reflecting also
a more conservative offer in a low profitability market environment.
In Asia too, we have noticed a slowdown, with the exception of Thailand, where inflows
have grown by 40%. But in general, we see European and Asian banking partners still
being focused on liquidity, combined with the reduced appetite for insurance savings
products.
The Life financial performance is, of course, massively distorted by the impairment
charges amounting to EUR584 million and impacting, in particular, Continental Europe and
Belgium. Adjusting 2011 and 2010 for the impairment charges and realized capital gains
and losses, the intrinsic Life performance is actually remaining resilient with, for instance,
an improved quality of the Asian results.
And this brings me to our investment portfolio at slides 18 to 21. The portfolio of almost
EUR60 billion is fairly stable compared to the end of last year, with no major shifts
between asset classes in the Third Quarter. Nevertheless, we see within our sovereign
bond portfolio a clear move towards Belgium and, to a lesser extent, Dutch bonds.
The total unrealized gains before tax and including real estate have increased to EUR2.6
billion compared to EUR0.7 billion at the end of June. This is primarily related to the higher

Page 4 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2011-11-09

fair values in fixed income, both on sovereigns and corporate bonds at the end of
September; but also the impact of the impairment charge on Greek sovereigns.

FINAL

Our exposure to Southern European sovereigns at the end of September amounted to
EUR3.6 billion at amortized costs and after non-controlling interest. The fair value of
equities came down from EUR2.6 billion at the end of June to EUR1.7 billion as a result of
divestments and a lower fair value.
Now with respect to the general account, the year-to-date net result amounted to
EUR325 million negative, with a net loss in the Third Quarter of EUR155 million.
The quarterly fair value adjustments of the four legacy issues; RPN(I), the call option on
the BNP Paribas shares; the valuation of the equity stake in Royal Park Investments; and
the Fortis Tier 1 debt securities explained EUR259 million of the negative result on an
annual base and EUR129 million in the Third Quarter.
With respect to the Tier 1 debt securities, you will remember that the National Bank of
Belgium gave its consent to acquire these securities in mid August. 95% of the
bondholders opted to sell their securities and, as such, we acquired them on September
26 for EUR953 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

With respect to the valuation of these securities, we decided to take an additional charge
of EUR150 million in the Third Quarter on top of the EUR40 million in the Second Quarter.
And this results in a valuation of these securities at 80% of par.
To end my overview, let me provide you with an update on our net cash position, the
shareholders' equity evolution and solvency. You will find this on slides 28 to 32 of the
presentation.
We announced at the Investor Day that we would abandon the concept of discretionary
capital, in order to focus in the future on the net cash position. We believe this is to be the
best indicator for strategic flexibility of the Group.
The net cash position as at September 30 amounted to EUR0.8 billion, compared to
EUR2 billion at the end of June. The decrease in the Third Quarter is mainly explained by
the acquisition of the Fortis Tier 1 debt securities; the acquisition price paid for Aksigorta;
and the amount expensed in relation to the share buyback program.
Our shareholders' equity bounced back to EUR7.9 billion or EUR3.15 per share at the end
of September, up from EUR7.5 billion at the end of June. This reflects the direct impact of
the improved unrealized gains and losses on our equity position, partly offset by the
negative result of the Third Quarter and by the negative impact of the share buyback
program.
And to conclude, there are some words on our solvency position. Here too, we
announced a slight change to our reporting methodology. This allows us to align fully with
Page 5 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2011-11-09

the regulatory view of our solvency by adding the equity positions and by reporting a
Group solvency ratio alongside our insurance solvency ratio.

FINAL

At the end of September, the total regulatory capital under IFRS amounted to EUR9.3
billion, including EUR2.1 billion from the general accounts, compared to a regulatory
minimum requirement of EUR3.4 billion. So the solvency excess amounts to EUR5.9 billion,
corresponding to a Group solvency ratio of 270%.
The insurance solvency ratio at 210% is slightly up compared to June, despite the
impairments taken in the Third Quarter. As in previous quarters, this is a clear illustration of
our prudent solvency calculation methodology whereby net unrealized losses are included
in the solvency calculation at an early stage.
Well, dear ladies and gentlemen. I would like to end my remarks here and pass the word
to Frank, Head of Investor Relations.

Frank Vandenborre

{BIO 15168443 <GO>}

Thank you, Bart. Ladies and gentlemen. this concludes the introduction and we would now
like to open the floor for questions. Maybe we can ask to limit yourselves to two questions
and obviously if you have more questions, you can come back in the queue and ask more
questions later. Thank you.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) Farooq
Hanif, Morgan Stanley.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

I've just two questions. Firstly, on your combined ratio outlook, could you comment again
on the one-offs that in your numbers that were negative that could disappear going
forward, just give some quantitative direction there?
And also comment on bodily injury claims in the UK, which has been a big issue today with
another insurer reporting; so just the combined ratio outlook in the UK, but also one-offs
generally.
And the second question is on your Fortis Bank Tier 1 bond (technical difficulty).

A - Frank Vandenborre

Hello, this is the operator. Shall I open the line; the line has been closed. I'll open the line
from Farooq Hanif. Thank you.

FINAL

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, can you hear me now?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Yes, we had the first question. So if you can repeat the second one.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

The second question was on Fortis Tier 1 debt that you value to 80%. Can you give us
some direction on the basis of getting to 80%? And what would be the key factors that
might change that valuation going forward?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay, the first question. If you look to the elements in the results for Non-Life that impacts
the year-to-date results, as mentioned in my speech, there are two elements.

Bloomberg Transcript

First of all is impairments also impacting Non-Life but this is, of course, not impacting the
combined ratio. The element is weather-related events and there we can say, if we
exclude them, for Belgium the combined ratio would be at 99%.
In the UK, we did not have a serious impact in Q3. There, already earlier announced, we
had an impact at the beginning of the year, due to the consequences of the very hard
December month. But already without that, we are under 100% in the UK.
For the second part of the question, bodily injuries, we look, of course, to our UK
combined ratio, specifically also in motor, taking into account all the elements. What we
can say is that the motor combined in the UK is under 100%, at some 98%. And this is due
to a reduction in loss ratio of more than 5%, although there has not been a specific
support from releases of reserves. On the contrary, the reserves released have been
lower than the previous years.
Then the second --

A - Unidentified Speaker
I can take the Tier 1 question. Okay, so on the Tier 1 valuation, the Tier 1 valuation, it's
based on two assumptions.
The first one is that the instrument will be called early 2013, due to the fact that it will lose
its equity credit under the CRD4 Regulation. So our assumption is that the called debt will
be March 2013. This is assumption number one. So it means that we have -Page 7 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2011-11-09

And the second one is on the yield to call. The yield to call has been taken at 13%. Both
assumptions lead to a valuation at 88%, on which we apply 8% discount due to the lack of
liquidity and that's -- and you end up with the 80% we booked in the accounts. So the Tier
1 instrument, this one is booked at 80% of the (inaudible).

FINAL

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

And just to follow up, I'm sorry to take so much time, but I'm presuming on the Tier 1 bond
there's no -- there'll be no reason during 2012 that you can think of that would really
change that? So I mean essentially it's not going to be necessarily a very volatile item.
And also just following up on the combined ratio, could you just tell us the impact of
reserve releases overall in your combined ratio in the Third Quarter or nine months. Thank
you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Releases, combined ratios, I'll give it for the two main operations, AG and UK. So in -- for
Belgium and it's in Q3, it has been 2.8%, so year to date 5.8% compared to last year 5.2%.
And in Q3 last year it was 6.9%, so it's less, and that's all together. If you then go to the
UK, it was 1.3% strengthening of five years' reserves compared to 1.1% reduction -- release
a year ago. So it's about 2.4% less support from prior year reserves.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That's in Q3?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

And in Q3, in the UK, Q3 plus 0.6% strengthening compared to 2.4% release last year, so
a delta of 3%.

A - Unidentified Speaker
Okay, maybe to follow up on the Tier 1 question; two things. The first one is that the -some more details have been given in the financial statement about the sensitivities, but
what I would like to highlight is the accounting treatment in the future. If we stick to the -our assumption, it means that we will have a positive impact in the coming years because
we will gradually convert to 100% at the call date. This value can be reviewed in case we
have other news regarding this Tier 1 instrument. But without any change in the
assumption, we will progressively convert to 100% at the call date, March 2013.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay, that's very clear. Thank you, very much.

Q - Duncan Russell

{BIO 15944951 <GO>}

FINAL

A couple of questions. Could you give a bit more detail on the Greek bond impairments;
how much was in the technical result in Belgium; how much is in the non-technical result
maybe at the nine-month stage and also the First Quarter discrete?
And then secondly, the second question was, could you give some indication on the
duration of bonds or the term of bonds you're buying with the proceeds from the
disposals in Southern Europe for Belgium and the Netherlands?
And then the third question was on the BNP Tier 1 debt, have you looked at ways to
hedge out the credit risk associated with that or even to dispose of that asset, given the
substantial exposure you now have to BNP?

A - Unidentified Speaker
On the last one it's a very simple question, the answer is no. So we have not
contemplated the idea of hedging the credit risk vis-a-vis BNP Paribas. And we've seen
the future but it's not our idea at this moment.

Q - Duncan Russell

{BIO 15944951 <GO>}

And why not?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Unidentified Speaker
Honestly we have not studied the question so far. We have a huge exposure vis-a-vis BNP
Paribas. We have some other instruments like the CASHES and it has to be dealt with in
another way, taking the whole BNP Paribas exposure. So it's a matter of concern, but it will
be taken in a broader range, taking into account the full exposure, which is much larger
than the EUR1 billion of the Tier 1. But it's a matter of concern. It's on our radar screen, you
can be sure of that.

Q - Duncan Russell

{BIO 15944951 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Can you take the other one?

A - Unidentified Speaker
On the Greek bond impairment, so the net impact on the technical result is EUR91 million.
You know we -- at 100% -- you have to make a distinction between the part that is in
technical result which is affected to specific portfolios, then the operating margin is the
rest of the insurance book and the non-allocated result is what is against the remaining
part. That's called the equity.

Page 9 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2011-11-09

So if we look at the total impact before tax it's about EUR848 million. EUR91 million is in a
specific portfolio, so that's in the technical results. EUR581 million is in the operating
margin, so that's the rest, bringing the insurance impact up to EUR672 million and the
remaining EUR268 million is for the equity part.

FINAL

If you take that EUR848 million gross net at 100%, it becomes EUR615 million and at 75%
it's EUR470 million.

Q - Duncan Russell

{BIO 15944951 <GO>}

That's the -- is that nine months or Third Quarter?

A - Unidentified Speaker
That is the third -- nine months year-to-date impact.

Q - Duncan Russell

{BIO 15944951 <GO>}

Do you have the Third Quarter at all?

A - Unidentified Speaker

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes but I would have to look that up for a second. Do I have them in the details? So the
net technical result impact would be 40%. The operating margin would be EUR451 million.
The profits before tax total EUR629 million and net it would EUR460 million, as Bart
announced.

Q - Duncan Russell

{BIO 15944951 <GO>}

Great, thank you.

Operator
Albert Ploegh, ING.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Two questions from my side. First of all, you took some impairments on the equity
portfolio in the Third Quarter, and also I saw you've been lowering the exposures there.
Can you maybe give some feeling for what the impact will be given the situation today on
the equity portfolio for the Fourth Quarter? I expect somewhat more loss to be realized
there also if the markets will not recover.
And the second question is a bit more general one on China in terms of inflows. You're
mentioning quite a lot that the bank focus on deposits has hurt the inflows on the
insurance side. We should now see some more signs of a soft landing and also inflation
expectation a bit moderating. Do you see already some signs that the bank distribution
efforts are being stepped up a bit into the Fourth Quarter or is that still too early? Thank
you.

Page 10 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity

A - Unidentified Speaker

FINAL

On the equity portfolio, of course that's a volatile element and in terms of impact, it's
mark-to-market as you know. As for impact on profit and loss, it will only influence if one of
our impairment reviews[ph] would be hit again. Let me remind you about those. It is either
being for a prolonged period, over one year below the acquisition price, or a 25%
decrease.
Now if you look at the general trend with ups and down, I would tend to say it's more a
little bit up now than it's down, so up to now I would not expect any major elements on
the equity side.
I think that due to our rules that we have two criteria and this is either a significant
decrease. So it means that all the hit has been taken at the end of September, most of
the hit has been taken at the end of September and the equity markets have been not so
stable; volatile but without a trend. So we are not close from where they were at the end
of September, which means that at this very moment, we can't expect much impairment
or much differences on the equity portfolio, so pretty stable.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Unidentified Speaker
Okay, then on China. Maybe first of all, starting with the top line figures because that was
the attention point. After three quarters we had some EUR2.7 billion inflow compared to
EUR2.9 billion last year and compared to EUR2.37 billion two years ago. So we are, you
could say, some 15% up compared to two years ago and some 6% lower than last year.
If we look then to the type of premiums, what we see is that the decrease is mostly in the
single premiums where we also have in China, like in a number of other Asian markets,
banks are giving more attention to current accounts and to short-term savings products.
Whereas the regular premium basis that we have been promoting a bit more because it's
also more profitable, is almost in line with last year and there we have this book of
business that is increasing year after year.
If we look to the distribution channels, we see that in China the importance in the
premium mix from bank insurers has reduced from 70% to 60% because this has been
compensated by increased sales by the agency force and more alternative distribution
channels.
And finally, also I think an important element is that in terms of retention persistency that
we see that both in bank insurance as in agency channels, we have a persistency rate of
above 90%, so it means it's a stable business. There are no huge lapses and so we, as
we see everywhere, see a reduced appetite in pure bank sales of single premium
investment products and we try to focus this on more sales of regular premiums that are
upwards of 24%. That's for the whole book.

Francois Boissin, Exane BNP Paribas.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Three questions please; the first one on your dividend policy. You mentioned that your
results excluding impairments are good. Do we have to assume that for the dividend on
2011 results you will apply a payout ratio of 40% to 50% on your results, excluding
impairments?
The second question, just a follow-up question; the Fortis Bond Tier 1 bond, how will it be
considered going forward? Will it be an AFS asset mark-to-markets re equity on a
quarterly basis, or will it be reviewed at your discretion given -- along with those market
circumstances?
And the final question on GIPs. Did you make any significant move in Q4 to date? Thank
you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay, the first question, I don't think that I have said what you have tried to have me say.
So what we said is that first of all we have a dividend policy that is clear, where we say we
pay a dividend that's 14% or 15% of the insurance results, stop.
What we said in the release some two weeks ago and repeated in this one is that take
into account a number of strong elements, which is the solvency position, the net cash
position but also the quality of the underlying profits of the insurance activity that we will
present or propose to the shareholders to pay a dividend on the year 2011. I would say
nothing more than that. And I think you all believe or understand that it's impossible to
make further commitment in that perspective.

A - Unidentified Speaker
On the Tier 1 I can give you the answer. So due to the lack of liquidity of the instrument
because we are the owner at 95%, the liquidity will be extremely low. So our choice in the
account is to book this instrument in loan and receivables, which means that we won't do
a mark-to-market exercise in the future. And that as I said previously, we will progressively
converge to the 100% value in March 2013, so no mark-to-market exercise in the future of
this Tier 1 instrument.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay and then the exposure on sovereigns, you'll find it on slide 20 in the ER
presentation. So you see that our part at amortized cost has been reduced from EUR5.5
billion midyear to EUR3.6 billion at the end of September. But if you go back to the August

FINAL

24 announcement, there we already announced additional sales mainly on Italy and Spain
between the end of June and that date. And if I remember well, at that moment, you
were at some EUR4.3 billion exposure, so the EUR4.3 billion has been reduced now to
EUR3.6 billion and this is mainly of course by the impairment and some additional smaller
sales.

Just a couple of very quick questions. Firstly, just following up on Duncan's question on the
impact of the impairments in the Belgian technical result, can I just clarify whether that was
-- the numbers you gave were for the whole of Belgium or just for the Life business?
And then the second question is, could you just give the solvency ratio, the regulatory
solvency ratio of the Portuguese operations please, as at the end of nine months and also
how that's moved over the quarter? Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay, the impairments that have been mandatory, the insurance was the whole of
Belgium, so it's a like-for-like combination[ph].

On Portugal, we are around 140%, somewhat higher. At Belgium we are -- in the local
ratios we are at 108%, so Belgium is more or less equal to the situation we communicate

Three questions. The first one is, considering Ageas Insurance will probably book a deep
loss in the full year 2011, what are your profit-sharing assumptions for the full year, as of
today?
And I was wondering if you need any regulator approval in order to pay profit sharing in
2011, if your Belgian subsidiary is loss making? The situation at this time is slightly different
than in 2008. So could you just guide me on that one?
And then in the net inflow in Life in Belgium, which was slightly disappointing; at which
point do you start to have net outflows there? I think you have EUR900 million of gross
inflow, but at which point do you make actually net outflow on your assets under
management?
And I would like to have your thought on the risk of the tax reform in Belgium on the
Branch 21. What are your assumptions there?
And then finally on Continental Life, Europe, it's a loss of EUR17 million. I think you
mentioned you have EUR18 million coming from Greek and equity impairments but just
leave us with a small EUR1 million profit adjusted; and I was wondering if there is other
negative items impacting this business? Thanks.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

As we have the CEO of AG Insurance amongst us, I will ask Antonio Cano to give you a
short answer on the question you raised with respect to profit sharing. Also, intentions of
the regulator, and impact in terms of lapses.

FINAL

For the potential consequences of decisions on the Belgian level with respect to future
tax treatment of life insurance products; first of all, no decisions have been taken, or have
been communicated. Like always, there are a number of ideas that are launched also to
check.
What is clear is that, also as a sector, we clearly made it a point towards the parties
around the table, that after the introduction of a tax in summer 2005, and a deposit
guarantee rule that has been introduced last year, that the life insurance sector in
Belgium, which is also a rather important investor in Belgian debt, is not at all expecting,
even accepting further tax impact on life insurance.
And, as far as I have seen, the ideas around it disappeared a bit. So never say never, but
it's certainly that the point has been raised, and that we expect the politicians around the
table to take the smart and the right decisions in that perspective.
Antonio?

Good morning. So on the profit sharing, I'll start off with the second question with respect
to the regulation. There is indeed a regulation in place. Bear in mind the profit sharing is
ruled by local accounts, so it's not the IFRS accounts. And they are not necessarily the
same thing. There are also other types of provisions in the local accounts which would
allow for a profit sharing.
The rule is that the technical life insurance account, the local accounts, should be positive.
If you have that, then you can, in principle, give profit sharing.
The first question was whether we would give any profit sharing at all; I'm exaggerating
the question a bit. Well, we still do intend to provide a profit sharing, but the year is not
over yet. I would not like to make any very specific remarks on that, but it's not per se the
case that given the impairments on Greece, we would not give any profit sharing.

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

Sorry, just to come back on that one. I'm not a Belgian GAAP specialist, so what do you
expect in terms of treatment of the Greek impairment on the Belgian GAAP? Are you
going to have a positive or negative technical life results?

A - Antonio Cano

{BIO 16483724 <GO>}

On the technical life results, might be positive.

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

So you are going probably to be able to pay profit sharing, according to the regulator?

Bloomberg Transcript

That is not disclosed. Actually, those are numbers that are filed only on a six-month basis.
And they are public at full year end.
On the inflow, we still have a positive growth; well we have still growth in funds under
management, so the net inflow is still higher than say the lapses and the maturities.
Except for the unit-linked business, where there is a slight decrease in the funds under
management inflow[ph], a net outflow level, that would be the case in the unit-linked
business, as we are facing maturities and lapses that are not compensated by inflow.
On the surrender, on the normal business, the non unit-linked business, we don't see any
blips. Also bear in mind, if you're worried about a higher surrender rate, we do have here
in Belgium, at least for AG, a market value adjustment. So if customers would surrender
today, in fact there would be a market value penalty, unlike some other countries.

A - Unidentified Speaker
Then the second question, I hope I understood it correctly, was what the impact has been
on the result of Continental Europe from exceptional impairments.

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

Yes, it was a loss of EUR17 million; I think you mentioned EUR18 million coming from Greek
impairment and equity impairments. So it's a kind of adjusted net of EUR1 million, around
EUR1 million, which is quite small, actually. So I was wondering it is over items, negative
items, in this figure?

Page 16 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V

A - Unidentified Speaker
So the impact on Continental Europe from impairments on Greek bonds and equities was
EUR15 million.

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

FINAL

No, just on Q3.

A - Unidentified Speaker
No, that was the whole Q3 was EUR18 million.

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

Is there more negative, over negative items in Q3 to take into account?

A - Unidentified Speaker
No. But I think if you look, it's EUR50 million net, but gross on the EUR20 million, yes. So
it's under EUR20 million, yes, profit sharing, tax and so on.
And for nine months, if you look through the net profit of Continental Europe being
negative, you should, after correction, have somewhere normalized in the profit of EUR45
million to EUR47 million, for Continental Europe.

My first question is back on the dividend. Bart, apologies, I heard exactly what you said,
and I heard you say that it was impossible to make further comments.
So forgive me if I'm stretching your patience, but I did just want to double check. Your
wording of what you said about the dividend would not, strictly speaking, preclude purely
a token or notional dividend for this year; which, in the context of your buyback, your
capital position and the rest of it, would be, at least for me, something of a disappointing
shock.
So I'm just wondering if you could say anything a little bit more reassuring. Again, I know
what you've said on the dividend, but I'm hoping that that does still try and go beyond
something that is just a token dividend.

FINAL

And then secondly, at the very high level, with your insurance results; you've kindly
stripped out the impairments on Greece and equities to get us this EUR406 million for the
nine months.
I appreciate there's an awful lot of other funnies going on and so I just wondered, do you
think we should take the EUR406 million as a base line for judging you this time next year,
because all the funnies basically end out as a wash? Or is there anything particularly you'd
like us to adjust?
And once we've done that, do you think this is a base line from which, given all your
opportunities, you can grow? Or given the headwinds of things like low yields and
uncertain markets, and the rest of it, it's a base line from which you'll be very happy to be
flat at best? Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay, the first question if I understand correctly what you mean by a token dividend --

A - Unidentified Speaker
0.5%[ph].

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Let's say again, and I'm sure you can understand that we cannot say it will be x euro cent
or something, but if we bring this message, it is because we also are aware of the fact
that we are a dividend paying share and Company is a point that's appreciated by our
shareholders. So this is an attention point, and we do not intend now to give the
impression, to give something that will be the minimum minimorum. But again, it will
depend on the remainder of the months to come and also on what, at the end of the day,
we will present to shareholders, and what shareholders will accept or not accept.
But it's not -- today our intention is to say we go for the minimum we have to give to be
somewhere respecting what we said.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

That's reassuring. Thank you. There's another --

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Sorry, there was still a second question, which was more about the EUR406 million, and to
what extent this can be taken for future.
So as you know we don't publish official underlying results, but if we look to whether you
take the results we have now, corrected for the impairments, or if we really try to make
and analyze this past year, this year, taking out exceptional elements last year, this year,
you somewhere come to a result for three quarters, about EUR400 million to EUR410
million.
Page 18 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V

FINAL

What we can say is that, and I'm sure that you have seen that the tendency is set, that we
still believe that improved results in Non-Life are possible, so we see a number of trends
that we continue. For instance to increase rates in such a way that it even does really
hamper our growth. Also in October, for all business lines, Ageas Insurance announced
rate increases of 2.5% and in some products, specific elements, to 20% that will further
support the improvement. The UK is in a continuous way to perform better.
The second part is the other, so the Retail businesses in the UK where we are also with
some first year integration costs that will give benefits. We expect that this will be able to
improve our other Retail results in the coming years. And both should be offset maybe to
Life that will not be booming but where we expect that again, taking away all the
exceptionals, that due to the volume we've got and new initiatives to bring in new product
lines, that we will do slightly better in the future taking into account of course that we have
had, due to de-risking of the portfolio, a slight impact on the yield for the future.
So overall, the EUR400 million to EUR410 million on three quarter base, we believe this is
certainly a base to project future profit expectations.

I've only one question remaining. Given that you significantly reduced your periphery
sovereign exposure during Q3, do you expect any negative impact on your earnings from
Q4 forward due to lower investment yields? Thank you.

A - Unidentified Speaker
No we do not expect any significant impact for the Q4 numbers. You should -- if you look
at the numbers, you should of course take into account that we have a significant amount
in cash that will contribute to the yield when it is re-invested. And in terms of yield, the
impairment does not mean that there is no yield coming out of those assets at this
moment. And of course, as we've said before, we have been looking forward and will
continue to further improve our investment mix.
And regarding the asset allocation, we are moving to corporate bonds so if you take the
yield of corporate bonds, it is very much comparable to the Belgian Government bonds.
So it means that this move will allow us to maintain the deal in the future. So there is no
real concern regarding the yield in the coming months.
Due to this move regarding the cash, our intention is to buy and to invest in corporate
bonds so that this amount of cash will be significantly reduced by the end of the year.

So I think to summarize; three elements. First of all, the fact that we have a considerable

shareholders when we re-invest it. Secondly, that we, due to the de-risking of the
portfolio, also moved in some countries to shorter maturities where (inaudible)
anticipating expectations on increasing rates. And then the further reorientation of the
investment portfolio that Christophe talked about should be preventing us from
considerable yield losses.

From me, I have two questions remaining; the more detailed question first of all. You were
already talking about inflows in Belgium and the tax which still is uncertain if there will be
any changes there. But does that uncertainty also have an impact on the inflows in the
near future; could you a little bit elaborate on that?
And secondly was respect to the RPN(I), in your calculations you have assumed dividends
of 6.1% yields on Ageas shares. First of all, what is the basis for that assumption and what
would a reduction of let's say 200 basis points have on the value of the RPN(I)? Could you
give us some feeling on that one?

A - Unidentified Speaker
Okay, the first question inflows in Belgium. So what we see maybe has not been
highlighted, in any case not in this call, is that the area where we are most behind to what
we expected in last year is more the unit-linked business; two reasons.
First of all, the reduced appetite of customers for votes[ph] where they have to take
themselves part hold of the risk. But second is also that in July, the FSMA, so the Belgian
authority that's looking after the interests of the policyholders, so the consumers, asked
the whole sector to enter into a kind of moratorium where new products that are
considered to be complex would not be launched unless approval by the regulator before
they are launched. And so this has also stopped a bit the launch of new products in Third
Quarter.
We do not expect, and this is of course without tax changes, we do not expect
considerable increases in inflow in investment products in Belgium. But neither do we
expect further decreases. And of course the team in Belgium is looking at alternatives to
compensate what we can expect also in other areas, in other countries, a reduction in the

Page 20 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2011-11-09

pure investment products in Life towards more products with additional features where
also the profitability can be improved.

FINAL

I take the question on the RPN(I). So on the RPN(I) there is no real uncertainty on the
dividend or other factors. But the price of the CASHES, this is the main factor; you have
more detail in the financial statement. This is not note 19 in this, but what I can tell you is
that really the main rival is the price of the CASHES.
And to give you some flavor about this, you may have noticed that at the end of
September, the CASHES were very lower at 33.2%, it's the reason why the RPN(I) amount
is so low. In case we had a price of the CASHES at 43.2%, so plus 10percentage points,
the impact of the RPN(I) is more than 60%. So it is extremely sensitive.
It means that from EUR145 million including the set guarantee, it would have -- the change
would have been up 60%/61% so that's the main rival. So when you reap the price of the
CASHES you have a direct impact on the RPN(I). All the other factors are of second order.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I also would like to come additionally to the first question, but even in a broader sense
than Belgium because we have also some consequences of the lower decrease in what
we call savings business mainly through banks. First of all, this has as a consequence that
all the funds under management development is lower than if you have a continuous
increase in inflow. So lower funds under management or reserves also means that that
consumes less capital.
Secondly in terms of valuing new business, the pure savings business is not the most
important in terms of value creation. It's clear that mortgage-related insurance complex,
also insurance complex on the longer term with savings. Plus also a Life component create
a higher value. So that is something where the teams[ph] as well as Belgium, Portugal,
also some Asian markets are working on. And the Group Life business, which is a very
important part in Belgium not in the first place in volume, but in profitability, is rather
stable and is a bit more forecast to have a further growth.
So all that together will have a flattering effect, where of course as assets under
management would increase less or go down. This will undoubtedly also bring attention
to lowering cost ratios, or lowering costs to maintain the low cost ratios we already have
today in Life.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Just coming back on my question on RPN(I) because on page 25 you have a 6.1% dividend
yield. I assume it's just taking the current market consensus on dividend on Ageas, or is

agreements.

I presume you take into but could you confirm, you take into P&L the interest in
account[ph] from Greek bonds on full nominal[ph] as long as it is paid. When the EU
exchange in principle at 50% take place, could you confirm then the loss of yield?

A - Unidentified Speaker

Bloomberg Transcript

The answer to your first part of your question is indeed correct; we do take those into
account. As for what will happen after the possible change, we'll have to see what that
possible change is going to be and it's only then that we can react. That could trigger
different reactions of course if that would turn out to be much better than the current
market expectations, then you could even have a possible revaluation going through our
accounts. But that would be an -- that would then have to be a new credit event, and be
recognized as such, of course.

Q - Marc Debrouwer

{BIO 2406451 <GO>}

Yes. But today you receive a certain interest rate on the full nominal, and after that it's
difficult not to believe there won't be any loss of yield, as the exchange is -- would be -- is

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Just a couple of questions remaining. First of all, on the UK Non-Life side, can I just confirm
that the Tesco's JV is probably roughly performing at break-even at the moment? When
can we expect that to reach a target level of profitability?
And secondly, on UK Non-Life, can you just confirm that you're relatively comfortable with
your motor bodily injury provisions which have been causing some problems elsewhere?
And separately, in terms of the Belgian Workers' Comp business, I see you've made
some price increases and other operational changes. When can we expect to see
material improvements coming through in that line of business?
And then finally, on the RPN(I) and BNP relationship; given the very sharp fall in valuation of
that liability, and the confidence you seem to express that the core Tier 1 instrument will
be called in 2013, are the chances of providing some overall resolution to these rather
unusual and volatile items any closer? In other words, could we expect some kind of
discrete transaction between you and BNP over the next 12 to 18 months?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Unidentified Speaker
Okay. First question, UK Non-Life Tesco. So at half year it was EUR1.7 million negative, so in
meantime it's break-even and you have to know that we have a kind of a target return for
Tesco that is by the (inaudible) some guarantee to us over the period of five years.
So I would say, from a top line point of view, we are very pleased. From a bottom line of
view it is in line with the expectations, the budgeting we made. And from an operational
point of view, in terms of client satisfaction, operational performance, it's really a huge
success.
Life -- no, UK bodily injury. I already answered that in the UK we look to the overall
profitability as such, that we have seen a very sharp improvement in Motor combined
ratio, and that of course has been mainly realized by increases of rate. And I just repeat,
21% overall in 2009, 26% in 2010, and by the end of Q3 another 11% increases. So this
brought us, together with a very low cost ratio, to be very competitive in the market. And
if there are changes, (inaudible) changes, we will of course react accordingly.
There was also a question on Workmen's Compensation. On Workmen's Compensation I
think we are not at the stage where we say this is for us an acceptable situation. What we
have done is, a combination of actions have been included in the renewal of a part of the
portfolio that took place -- that will take place on January 1, (inaudible) conditions have
been negotiated with clients in the month of September, is on the first place everywhere
a minimum increase of 2.5% of the rates; and you have to add that the indexation,
because it's based on salary, and salary are indexed in Belgium.
Page 23 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2011-11-09

FINAL

And then on the more corporate side, it has been a rate increase on an injury[ph] base,
on top of the 2.5% between 2.5% and 15%. There have been also some pruning actions,
so where structurally non-profitable contract F4[ph] they have been cancelled or there
have been agreement on preventions.
And so all this together should bring us to the combined ratio, as we already mentioned
earlier, not of 100%, because you have huge reserves and thus financial income in
Workmen's Compensation, but where we said two years ago that 115% is a combined
ratio where in Workmen's Compensation you have a return of 12%. In the meantime, due
to the reduction of yields, you could say that the target should be more going towards
110% combined ratio for Workmen's Compensation.
We are not there yet, we follow it very closely, like we did in the other product lines, and
we are confident that this is possible in the coming quarters.

Bloomberg Transcript

So on your question regarding all the links with BNP Paribas, you -- as you know, we have a
lot of instruments, we have the production, we have the RPN(I), we have the Tier 1. So a
lot of things to -- with BNP Paribas. We are (inaudible) so you will see we are really
monitoring this very carefully. It's a matter of concern. We have a commitment to
(inaudible) our operation, but these instruments are extremely volatile. Things change
from one day to another, and even though we have a lot of banks visiting us on a quasi
daily basis, we cannot say that we have reached -- we have attractive solutions.
What we can say is that at the end, each of these instruments is very volatile, but all in all
you have some kind of natural hedge. If you have the (inaudible) and the Tier 1 on one
side, compensated by the RPN(I) when the market go up and down, so it is true. But it's a
matter of concern. There is not a feeling of urgency, but we have this definitely on our
radar screen, and if the market conditions improve, and if BNP Paribas is willing to reach an
agreement with us, something will be done; but nothing in the foreseeable future.

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

So I propose to give some closing remarks very shortly. Ladies and gentlemen. thank you
for your very good questions. To end the call, I would like to summarize the main
messages.
First of all, significant impairment charges have impacted our results in the Third Quarter,
but nevertheless I would like to stress a good underlying performance from our insurance
activities. Excluding the impairments, our results would be up considerably versus last year.
At a Group level, we see that the volatility remains significant as a result of the fair value
movements related to the legacy issues.

Bloomberg Transcript

And lastly, we decided, with respect to the net result, not to maintain a 2011 outlook
