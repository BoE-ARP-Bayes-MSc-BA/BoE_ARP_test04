MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this conference call on Sampo Group's First Quarter
2015 Results. I am Jarmo Salonen, Head of Investor Relations at Sampo. And with me here
in the studio I have our Group CEO and President, Kari Stadigh; Group CFO, Peter
Johansson, and Deputy Head of P&C Insurance, Ricard Wennerklint.
As we are very tradition oriented, we'll have the same process as always. Kari will start
with a presentation of Q1 results and numbers, and after that we will take your questions.
And at this stage, I always remind you of the fact that you can follow this transmission on
our website, sampo.com/results, where a recorded version will later be available.
With these words, I'll hand over to Kari. Kari, please?

Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Thank you, Jarmo. Welcome to the conference call on my behalf as well. Before I present
our excellent ﬁrst quarter results, I would like to comment on some recent investment
market development.

FINAL

The nervousness we have seen in the bond market in the last few days might this time
turn out to be something exciting. I must say I have been waiting for this, as the artiﬁcial
demand created by the regulation and the ECB has clearly created a bubble. Bill Gross
said, he sees the short of the century in the long-dated sovereign debt. It is easy to agree.
Look at the cash price of a 30-year bond that went from €1.59 to €1.28 (01:47) in less than
three weeks. For those who invested a few weeks back at the peak, they have been facing
an almost 30% capital loss, remarkable indeed. Why do I start our earnings report by
commenting on this? Well, if you compare Sampo to its European peers, we are unique
and best positioned to beneﬁt from rising interest rates.
Sampo is actually a perfect hedge in a portfolio of insurance stocks that might suﬀer from
rising interest rates. We have one of the shortest durations for interest-bearing assets in
the industry. In If the duration is 0.9 years and in Mandatum Life 0.7 years. We have
burdened our results and still excelled with signiﬁcant amounts when discounting our
liabilities with lower rates.
In 2014 alone, the discounting cost us in the P&L of our non-life unit €179 million and in
other comprehensive income €122 million. In the ﬁrst quarter, the P&L eﬀect – this year in
the ﬁrst quarter, the P&L eﬀect was €50 million and in other comprehensive income €47
million, together €97 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Despite of this, If's return on equity in Q1 was 35%, and the combined ratio, best-ever Q1
combined ratio at 89.2%.
I also want to point out that we have also stated in our present release that in Q2 we will
further lower the discount rate in Finland to 1.5% in If, and that will cost us over the P&L
€110 million. If we can well do (03:54) and aﬀord without our combined ratios suﬀering in
Q2, as we will also in Q2 book through our P&L a gain of €155 million from the changes in
our Norwegian pension liability. When and if (04:16) interest rates start to increase, it is
clear that If is more prudently discounted than its peers in general.
In Mandatum Life, we have discounted our liabilities with 2% for 2015, 2.25% for 2016, and
at 3.5% thereafter. This at the cost of €142 million, out of which we burdened the present
Q1 results by €25 million.
A few comments on Nordea and low interest rates as well. Clients are shifting to and
creating a high demand for long-term savings products and other fee creating products
or fee-generating products. Nordea's strong market position and signiﬁcant client base is
the base for this, and it's seen in the results; best-ever Q1 and quarter in general for the
operational proﬁt, excellent trading income, and highest ever assets under management.
Nordea is a winner in this environment. Naturally, Nordea is also, and therefore Sampo as
well, well-positioned to gain from rising interest rates and volatility in the currency and
interest rate markets. I continue to see value in the Nordea franchise, and therefore see us
well-positioned compared to other pure insurance plays.

FINAL

All in all, a very strong quarter. And maybe – ﬁnally a few words about the ﬁrst quarter for
the Sampo Group; best-ever Q1 and quarter in general with an operating proﬁt of €487
million, up 31% from the corresponding quarter in the previous year. If reported, as I
already said, the best-ever combined ratio for the ﬁrst quarter of the year at 89.2%.
Sampo's share of Nordea's proﬁts grew by 31% to €223 million. Also, Mandatum Life
showed excellent progress; premiums up 54%, unit-linked premiums all-time high, and
unit-linked assets under management highest ever. In the parent company, we had some
one-oﬀs, which you should not expect to see every quarter.
All in all, a very strong quarter, and we are well-positioned to deliver also for the full year.
And as always, we remember that we are a dividend stock with a very strong underlying
cash ﬂow.

Q&A

Bloomberg Transcript

The ﬁrst question comes from Mr. Jakob Brink, ABG. Please go ahead.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Thank you. I have two questions, please. The ﬁrst one is regarding premium growth in If. I
don't know. It seems like, I mean (07:36), premium growth in local currency is negative in
all countries except for Sweden, where it's however quite high. This looks almost opposite
of what it used to do. Could you maybe give some details on what is going on in all the
countries?
And then secondly, on claims, now we talk about you having – or in Q2 you're going to
lower the discounting rate in Finland. Why is that exactly? I mean, looking at rates, as you
said yourself, Kari, it seems like rates are now coming up again. Should we then – I mean,
what is the sensitivity? And when would you then have to increase it again? Yeah, that's a
bit – my second question. Thank you.

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

(08:21) by addressing premium growth then, well, the Swedish growth is driven by good
sales, particularly in the retail segment in business area Private. Its sales from the
distribution channels, the Web, and distribution channel through Nordea. But remember
also that the Swedish portfolio still had a need for premium increases. So, part of the
premium growth you see are premium increases. So, it's not all a growth in number of
customers. In the other market (09:03)...

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Are you done...?

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

FINAL

Sorry.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Are you done with the premium increases in Sweden, or are there more to come?

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

I think that there is still room for premium increases in the Swedish market, generally
speaking, yeah.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

On the discount rate, we did the lowering to – we will do the lowering to 1.5% in the
second quarter. Sensitivity to increases, I think that we need to see long-term interest
rates on a higher level than today for a longer period of time before we would even
consider increasing the discount rate.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

This is Kari, Jakob. I would also like to comment these one-oﬀs, because you know very
well that I hate one-oﬀs. And it's very unfortunate, when you have these pension liabilities
that when you increase your liabilities, you are not taking them over the combined ratio.
You take them over, Peter, other comprehensive income, right?

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

But then for some reason, which I don't understand and no one – they have tried to
explain it to me, but I don't still understand it. When you get some good news, then you
get it over the combined ratio. So actually, this €155 million will improve our combined
ratio unnaturally in Q2, even (10:40) the IFRS rules that we have. And I think that that also
gives us a possibility to do a one-oﬀ discount rate lowering, so they take out each other to
a big extent. I wouldn't like to see one-oﬀs like this pension thing that we have. But the
fact is this is the case, and unfortunately, we will have these distorting numbers in the
second quarter. I hope you will follow in the future the underlying combined ratio, which
is much more important, to me at least.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And so, just coming back to the other countries regarding premium
growth and negative development.

FINAL

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Yes. The other markets that we operate in are ﬁrst aﬀected by the simple fact that the
need for premium increases aren't really there. The general growth in the market is
deﬁnitely not there. And in some of the markets, we have seen an increased distribution
capacity, especially the Norwegian market. So, that's the natural result of these eﬀects
(11:57). Then, of course, we are to some extent inﬂuenced by a recession in the general
economy, for instance, in the Finnish market. That also aﬀects our premium growth.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks a lot.

Operator
We have a question from Mr. Christian Hede at Nordea. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you and good afternoon. I have two questions. I guess they both relate to
Norway. One is on the competitive situation. As we can also see on the premium growth,
or lack of premium growth, I guess, competition is still pretty ﬁerce. Do you expect
anything to happen now you've actually seen a Q1 with winter weather, whether that's
going to improve your situation?
That's one question. And the other one is on the change to the pension scheme in
Norway. I'd just like to hear if you've got any pushback from unions or employees, et
cetera, because I assume that this is a pure negative thing for the employees; or for most
of them at least. So, those are my two questions. Thank you.

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Competition in Norway, nothing new really to report. Again, growth is, I think, primarily
disappearing for the lower need for premium increases; so really nothing new to report
on the competitive situation in the Norwegian market.
When it comes to the pensions in Norway, the unions are 100% behind what we have
proposed today. And I don't expect to see any pushback from neither them nor (13:41) the
employees.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I think that also it's a much more modern way to have a deﬁned contribution plan instead
of a deﬁned beneﬁt plan. I think also, especially the younger employees, they see this as a
much more modern way to prepare oneself for one's pension.

FINAL

Then on growth, I would like to comment also that I have never seen the Nordic P&C
market as a growth industry. And I think that it's natural that when you have a recession or
you have new commerce that you see even lower growth numbers. And I think that the
valuable thing is the discipline in the industry, and that we still continue with very high
ROEs and strong cash ﬂows.

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Just one more comment on the Norwegian market. You commented on the winter, we see
the ﬁrst (14:37) quarter winter as a fairly benign winter compared to what we expect
normally. However, we have seen markets' combined ratios increase in Q1. So, of course,
everything else being equal, it pushes premiums up rather than down. So, that's good
news for us.

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

Yes, obviously (15:01). Thank you very much.

Operator
We have a question from Mr. Matti Ahokas at Danske Bank. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. Three questions, please. Firstly, if you could, Ricard, talk us
through a bit about the run-oﬀ gains and losses on a gross amount. You've, obviously,
reported the net amount, but I assume there's been fairly signiﬁcant movements within
that number.
Then, the second question is regarding how much was the storm impact all together in
Norway in the ﬁrst quarter?
And thirdly, I noticed that the net debt in the holding company is extremely low in the ﬁrst
quarter, and, obviously, the interest-bearing asset has gone up quite a substantial
movement. Could you shed some light what is behind that movement? Thanks a lot.

A - Ricard Wennerklint
Okay. Let's start with run-oﬀ gains, losses. First quarter, as always, signiﬁcant movements
from individual large claims. In addition to that, in the ﬁrst quarter we had run-oﬀ losses
coming from lowering of discount rates in the Swedish portfolio to the extent of
approximately €50 million. And that's actually all I have to comment on the run-oﬀ
situation in the group.
The second question, the storm in Norway, if I add all these – actually three minor storms
in the ﬁrst quarter, it was €21 million aﬀecting our P&L.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

That was net?

A - Ricard Wennerklint
Net €21 million, yes.

FINAL

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

This is Peter. And, Matti, on net debt, yeah, it's seasonally always at the lowest level end of
Q1, because in Q1 we had received the €533 million dividend from Nordea. Plus we
received €100 million from Mandatum, and then we paid out now in Q2 almost €1.1 billion.
So, net debt is back to close €1.5 billion after our own dividend.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great. Thanks.

Operator
...from Mr. Jonny Urwin at UBS. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hello. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two questions for me today.
As you sort of get some insight into premium growth in each of the markets – so thanks
for that – I was just wondering if we could drill down a little bit into the actual rating and
pricing movements versus claims inﬂation, just to get a view of where the underlying
margin is sort of headed in each country markets.
And secondly, obviously, we've seen bond yields tick up a little bit this week, but still at a
very low level. I'd just be interested to know where you're getting your yields sort of that
tick up from; particularly in Mandatum Life, I saw that the running yield was surprisingly
resilient in Q1, so just some color on that would be great. Thanks.

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

On claims inﬂation and premium growth, a general comment would be that claims
inﬂation is 2.5% to 3% for the group. We are not fully pricing for claims inﬂation currently
due to the simple fact that our combined ratios are very low. So, given the current
proﬁtability, no need to price fully for claims inﬂation; and of course, that aﬀects premium
growth to some extent as well.

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Yeah. On the bond yields, actually it looked a bit surprising that there was a pickup on the
running yield in Mandatum Life, which was roughly 20 basis points. But the explanation is
that we were able to invest roughly €300 million of zero-yielding cash to bonds, credit
bonds. And roughly two-thirds of those are investment-grade bonds and one-third are
high-yielding local names that we know very well, so that explains partly the pickup in the
running yield.
Page 7 of 17



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2015-05-07

And then, of course, Mandatum paid also €100 million in dividends. So, technically that
reduced zero-yielding assets. And we sold the remaining roughly €130 million worth of
negative yielding government bonds. But the pressure is most likely on the running
yields. And going forward, the expectation is that it will trend downwards.

FINAL

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay, great. Thanks very much.

Question from Mr. Paris Hadjiantonis at KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

Yes, hi. Good afternoon from me as well. I have a couple of questions today, ﬁrstly on
Mandatum Life. If we look at your economic capital ratio there, that continues to decline. I
assume that currently is probably higher than where it was at the end of March. But I
would like to get your thoughts on whether or not you can continue getting out (20:27)
€100 million per year from Mandatum Life without taking any action in there.

Bloomberg Transcript

And the second question would be on your discount rate for Swedish annuities within If
P&C. From what I can see, this is now below 0%. Do you actually discount with something
which is below 0%, or do you cover (20:50) that zero? Thanks very much.

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

On the ﬁrst question on Mandatum Life, yes, you're correct that if we take the impact of
full discounting like we normally do on the liability side adjustment. So, yes, our available
or adjusted solvency capital is lower than our own internal capital requirement. But there
if we think of Solvency II and SCR, so we're in the process. We have applied for the
transition rule from the Finnish regulator. So, there will be a huge diﬀerence between the
transition period, where actually the weak (21:34) proﬁt balance sheet will gradually run
oﬀ.
So, that will save us capital with end of Q1 numbers roughly around €700 million to €800
million in Mandatum Life. So, in that sense, by the time we get the approval on this
transition period, then I don't see any risks on dividends in Mandatum Life. The Swede
(22:01) discount rate, yes, in Sweden you have a ﬂoor, which is 0% for the nominal interest
rate, but then when you have to take also into account the expected inﬂation, so we
actually discount it (22:12) with minus 15 basis points. But yields have moved up somewhat
from end of Q1. So, probably we are close to zero or maybe even positive in Sweden right
now.

We have a question from Gianandrea Roberti, Carnegie Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, good afternoon from me as well. Peter, just to come back to what you just said and to
be absolutely clear, your expectation is that you will be allowed to pay dividends up from
Mandatum Life under transitional rules, right? That is correct, what I understood (22:48)?
It is (22:50) something you've discussed already with the Finnish FSA, or just your
interpretation and you base your comments on this? That's my ﬁrst question.
And the second question, it's a little bit (23:00) if you can elaborate a bit more on what
has happened on the holding company in the ﬁrst quarter, because of course plus €26
million (23:05), I think it was, the operating result, it's very high. And in that context, if I
can double-check that in a normalized year, you should still have around minus €50
million (23:15) negative result in the holding company or something around that. Thanks.

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Yeah, so the transition rules, it's correct. We have an application in the Finnish FSA
and expect to get the formal approval that we can use the transition rules. And I don't see
any reason why we wouldn't get that, and especially because we don't underwrite new
business on – with high guarantees.
Then, on the holding company, this €26 million it's an exceptional quarter, like Kari
mentioned, because we have actually some one-oﬀs. There is a €50 million FX gain
because we have some dollar assets, close – around $150 million, roughly €120 million.
And due to stronger dollar in Q1, we made a €50 million (24:11) FX gain, and then we have
some trading gains from equities, around €60 million (24:20). A small part of that is
actually dividends received. So, that's – technically you could say that there is €31 million
of one-oﬀs.
Now, of course, we have somewhat more ﬁxed income assets, and interest rates are down
on the liability side. So, I would adjust probably the gross funding cost for the €2.1 billion,
€2.2 billion that we had gross debt, because the interest rate is now at 1.65%. So, that
gives you around €9 million per quarter on interest costs.
But on the other hand, we have close to €5 million of interest income on the parent
company level, and then (25:05) normal operational cost between €5 million and €7
million from 50 people working on the holding company level.

FINAL

And one additional item, actually, you could add, because we get an asset management
fee from Mandatum and this segregated portfolio that we took over from Suomi Mutual
and the mutual pension company, Kaleva. So, we have actually assets under
management, €8 billion. And that we get 20 basis points asset management fee from
that, which means, from €8 billion, it's around €60 million per year. So, that's reﬂected in
other income.
But you shouldn't expect this type of one-oﬀs going forward. So, we are...

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

That's correct.

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

The question is from Mr. Daniel Do-Thoi at JPMorgan London. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. Three questions for me, two on capital and one on the dividend. First
on capital, two questions, actually. The 5 percentage point quarter-on-quarter decline in
the economic solvency ratio, part of this appears to be driven by higher market risk. Is this
simply a function of higher equity holdings, and should we expect this to decrease over
time as you readjust?
And then secondly, I mean, I know you don't have a target on this, but is there a level in
terms of solvency ratio, which you would not wish to fall below?
And then lastly, on the dividend, I know it's a bit early to ask, but the reason I do is
because Nordea will be announcing later this month updated ﬁnancial targets at its
Capital Markets Day, and I guess inevitably (26:54), also be addressing the issue of capital
management and dividends. If that ultimately leads to a change in their dividend policy,
should we expect that to have a knock-on eﬀect on your thinking around the progressive
dividend? Thank you.

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

If I start with the economic capital, so there was – of course, proﬁtability was good in Q1,
so that improved group solvency. Then, on the other hand, because of lower discount
rates means again that the negative eﬀect on adjusted solvency capital came down. So
that consumed capital and then marginally higher market risk because of equity markets
Page 10 of 17



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2015-05-07

performing so strongly in Q1. So, market risk grew slightly both in If and Mandatum. So,
those are the two factors.

FINAL

On the minimum targets on how much do we actually want to maintain, we have an old
target of maintaining at least 120% solvency, economic solvency, above the group
minimum requirement without diversiﬁcation. But this will deﬁnitely be updated then
when we have the ﬁnal numbers on Solvency II and also on Basel III on the banking side.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

On dividends, I don't want to comment on Nordea's dividends. But if we look at the
Nordic banks in general, I think it's clear to everybody that the Nordic banks have been
able to meet all regulatory requirements from their operational cash ﬂow. And in an
environment with low growth and continuing very strong cash ﬂows and clients moving
more and more into fee-generating business, that also ties less and less capital.
I would be surprised if the banks in the Nordics in general would not follow their
guidance and increase their payout ratios and also payouts in absolute terms. On Sampo,
we are clearly a dividend stock. And as management, we are committed to propose to the
board and the AGM increasing dividends. That is all I can say this time of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay. And if I could just try and follow up on that last point, Kari, if hypothetically you had
an increase in the dividends that you received for the 2015 ﬁnancial year, would that – how
would that aﬀect your thinking about the graphically (29:48) beautiful dividend that you're
trying to create at Sampo? And would you deviate from that due to this one-oﬀ hype
(29:58)?

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I think it would support my view, wouldn't it?

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay. I guess that depends on what we hear (30:06) later this month.

Q - Mika Koskinen

{BIO 1557965 <GO>}

FINAL

Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Could you please comment a bit on the investment
income and if I may ask by division, especially if – and also the holding company to some
extent? But on the investment return side within equity income, how much has been
gained in dividends and how much has been gained in trading proﬁts?
And the reason I'm asking is that I'm trying to capture some kind of a picture how much
we should expect then equity income to come down in Q2, Q3, Q4, compared to the ﬁrst
quarter, which was very strong. Thanks very much.

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

I don't have the exact number on dividends, but I think at least in Mandatum Life we took
some proﬁts on certain lines, certain equity lines. So, there are some relatively sizeable
amount of realized gains in equities. The total investment income was 4.2% in Mandatum
Life. In If we had a mark-to-market. The Swedish equity market performed extremely
strong, but there is not that much realized gains in If, but somewhat more. So sales gains
in Mandatum Life was altogether €95 million.

Q - Mika Koskinen

{BIO 1557965 <GO>}

Okay.

And when you – dividends are booked – actually, if you look at the notes where you have
the investment income items, you can see there's available for sale, the ﬁxed income line,
and then equities' line. So, dividends are booked there.

Q - Mika Koskinen

{BIO 1557965 <GO>}

Yes. But you don't split the dividend and the realized gains. They are clustered together.

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Mika Koskinen

{BIO 1557965 <GO>}

May I then just ask, thinking about the second quarter, in the ﬁrst quarter do you have a
gut feeling, did you receive half of all the dividends that you were expecting to receive
this year, or did you receive more or less, if a (32:31) dividend stream going to be
substantially less in Q2 against Q1?

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

If I'm not completely wrong, I think a big part of the dividends come in Q1.

Yes.

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

FINAL

My guess (32:46) would be two-thirds and one-third, roughly, at least in Mandatum Life. I
don't remember so exactly in If, but it's normal in Q1.

Q - Mika Koskinen

{BIO 1557965 <GO>}

Okay. And do you have any plans on a group level, if we assume that the interest rate
environment doesn't change much because you can, of course, manage very much the
reported investment income that you have. Do you have any plans to smoothen out the
investment income in 2015, as long as markets remain on the relatively strong levels
where we are now?

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

In Mandatum Life, that's typically something that we had done in the past and most likely
so also in the future. If ﬁxed income running yields keep coming down, then we need to
harvest some of the unrealized gains.

Q - Mika Koskinen

{BIO 1557965 <GO>}

Yes. And how about If?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

If, if they continue to deliver such strong combined ratio, so the need is not as high. And
now also when we have lowered the discount rates signiﬁcantly in If, so actually the
unwinding discount which has been a relatively big number actually in the past is
becoming lower and lower. So, there is less pressure on the investment income side.

Q - Mika Koskinen

{BIO 1557965 <GO>}

Yeah, okay, very good. Thanks very much.

We have a question from Mr. Jakob Brink at ABG. Please go ahead.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Yes. I just have one follow-up question, actually. I think, Kari, you were trying to – at least,
that's the way I read it. You said that you didn't like one-oﬀs like the ones we're going to
have in Q2. So, I understood that the Finnish discount reduction was more or less taken
because you could. What about the Finnish – the fact that rates in the Finnish – sorry,
Swedish discounting curve has actually come up quite substantially here quarter-to-date.
Should I then read that the same way that you're going to ﬁnd something negative to
oﬀset that with – especially given that you will have a €45 million one-oﬀ already, or how
should we read that? Thank you.

FINAL

The changes in the Swedish discount rate has historically not really inﬂuenced the
reported combined ratio for If. Not giving any estimates for movement on interest rates in
the future, but at least the movements we have seen historically has not been really visible
in the overall group combined ratio.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

And, Jakob, as you know, we have never blamed a storm as a one-oﬀ. We have never said
that something – some movements in some investment products are one-oﬀs. And we
have never done anything – hold to maturity or mark to model. We have everything markto-market. So, I hate these one-oﬀs, but I also hate positive one-oﬀs. So, I think there, I
diﬀer, from my colleagues in the industry.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

(35:58) with positive one-oﬀs.

We have a question from Mr. Paris Hadjiantonis at KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

Yes. Sorry, a follow-up from me as well. If I look at the Danish combined ratio, I
understand there was, let's say, a one-oﬀ in that as well, so a larger duration of some
industrial claims. Can you give us an idea of how much was that, or can you give us an
idea of what the underlying combined ratio excluding that was? Thank you.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

First, before Ricard answers, I want to say that claims are never one-oﬀs in our – we are an
insurance company and we cover claims. That's our business. So Ricard, please?

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

Fair enough.

A - Ricard Wennerklint
Yes, true, the Danish combined ratio was inﬂuenced by one individual large claim, that
was a prior year claim. So that's some more disclosure into the run-oﬀ losses that I think

Matti asked for earlier. Your question is basically normalized combined ratio in Denmark.
We are...

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

FINAL

Indeed.

A - Ricard Wennerklint
There is nothing in the normalized proﬁtability of the Danish business that makes us act
diﬀerently than we did last year. There's nothing new during the ﬁrst quarter, nothing
relating to the weather, premium levels, or really anything else. So, it hasn't changed our
view on that. We've run a proﬁtable business in Denmark.

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

A smaller size of a book gives more volatility if there are some bigger claims.

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

Sure.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Ricard Wennerklint
Of course (37:48), and once again that we have reinsurance based on group coverage
rather than individual markets. So, we have no problem with the volatility that we see per
market.

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

Okay, understood. Thank you.

Question from Mr. Blair Stewart of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon and apologies if this question has been asked already. I was
on one of the other seven results calls I've had (38:15) today. I wish I was joking. The €110
million from the discount rate adjustment in Finland, will that have an ongoing positive
eﬀect on the results going forward, I guess, through higher investment income? I just
wonder how that will play out over time, because it doesn't seem to me that it's entirely
lost money. Thank you.

Company Name: Sampo Oyj

That's correct. Yeah. So net investment income, in a sense, because each and every year
you see the unwinding of discount. So, if we discount with lower and lower interest rates,
then the unwinding eﬀect will be smaller. So, there is less.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

FINAL

And where will that come through in the income statement, Peter?

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

You can actually see it when you look there is the so-called risk-free interest rate
allocation, which don't exist anymore on the insurance technical result. And then you can
see on the lower end how much – when that will be netted oﬀ from the investment side,
then there's another number. So, the diﬀerence between those two numbers is the
unwinding of discount.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

And would you think that that €110 million will just bleed through into the numbers over a,
what, 10-year to 15-year period? Is that the way to look at it?

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Yeah. The duration is very long and the Finnish liabilities I think it's – they're over 10 years,
10-year duration.
