{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

All right. Thanks, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to
join us today. So earlier this morning, we announced a strong ﬁnish to 2014. Our fourth
quarter net operating income per share of $1.84 was well ahead of last year, beneﬁting
from a benign cost environment, favorable weather conditions, as well as our initiatives to
improve proﬁtability.

Bloomberg Transcript

From an underwriting perspective, we ended 2014 with a full-year combined ratio of
92.8% with good contributions from both Personal Lines at 92.7% and Commercial Lines
at 92.9%. 2014 was a productive year and that our hard work and at times diﬃcult
decisions began to pay oﬀ. Clearly, we had some help with losses from catastrophes
closer to our expected level at about half the level of 2013. In combination, these factors
led to an operating ROE of 16.3%, much improved from the 11% we reported a year ago.
Turning to our two primary ﬁnancial objectives, 2014 signiﬁcant rebound and net
operating income per share, put our trend back on track with a 13% annual average
growth since 2011, above our target of 10% per year growth over time. From an ROE
perspective, we target to outperform the industry by at least 500 basis points every year.
We've done so by 710 basis points on average in the past three years. And based on the
most recent industry data at September, we've outperformed by 900 basis points so far
this year.
When I look at the results we generated in the fourth quarter, I'm pleased with the broadbased nature of the earnings contribution. Personal property's performance was
outstanding with a combined ratio of 73.6%, clearly better than what is to be expected on
an ongoing basis. For the full year, this line reported a combined ratio of 89%, slightly
better than our expectation. Personal auto's 93.7% combined ratio was a solid
performance for a fourth quarter, improved from 2013, reﬂective of less severe driving
conditions and higher favorable prior year development.
In commercial P&C, we've now seen two consecutive quarters where the environment was
favorable after a string of diﬃcult quarters. For the full year at 94.2%, commercial P&C's
combined ratio was closed to 10 points improved versus 2013. Across all lines of business
of IFC, an 88.2% combined ratio in Q4 is 8 points better than a year ago.
In Ontario, our process of reducing automobile rates began in early last April and has
been focused on existing customers. In the fourth quarter, we ﬁled a 2% rate reduction to
reﬂect the beneﬁts we expect from Ontario's Bill 15, which was recently passed. It also
reﬂects the comfort we have with our ability to protect margins in this business as the

FINAL

government has been proactive on this ﬁle. That being said, additional meaningful cost
reduction measures will be necessary for the industry to achieve the government's rate
reduction target. Overall, we're quite comfortable to grow in this market.
I mentioned last quarter that we expected to improve upon the 1.3% underlying pace of
top line growth shown in Q3. Q4's growth did indeed accelerate to approximately 3% as
mid single digit growth in commercial lines and personal property oﬀset slower growth in
personal auto. We've talked about being an early mover with our 10-point improvement
initiative in personal property while the industry continues to move and as market
conditions are ﬁrmed and our relative position has improved. Units were down less than a
point in personal property during the quarter despite the headwind from our full product
changes and rate actions.

Bloomberg Transcript

When it comes to our outlook for the industry, we foresee low single digit growth in
personal auto while we expect upper single digit growth in personal property from
continued hard market conditions. Commercial P&C has ﬁrmed in the past year. Rate
increases at renewal for IFC in this segment were close to 5% in the fourth quarter. The
low interest rate environment and minimal proﬁts at the industry level gave us comfort in
projecting a mid single digit level of growth for the industry in 2015 in commercial lines.
Now I realized that this commercial lines outlook diﬀer slightly from that of the U.S., where
many are calling for the return to soft market conditions in 2015. Well, I believe it reﬂects
the market reality here in Canada. As for Intact Financial, our growth ambitions have not
changed. Our ﬁnancial position at year-end was strong with $681 million of excess capital.
Our objective is to leverage our underwriting outperformance by reinvesting our capital
to expand our position right here in Canada.
Organically, I expect growth to improve for a couple reasons. One, the industry outlook is
conducive to organic growth. And two, our multichannel distribution strategy is actually
gaining momentum. I expect that we'll have a more focused branding approach by the
end of the year, which should allow for a more impactful marketing spend.
We've also been very clear that our direct and distribution operations are key areas of
focus for growth in the near term. At the same time, we expect further consolidation to
take place in Canada and intend to lead on that front. We're continuing to pursue our
strategy to expand beyond Canada in a prudent manner with the objective of building an
organic pipeline with meaningful impact past 36 months.
So in conclusion, I'm proud of what was accomplished this past year, and I want to thank
our thousands of employees from coast to coast for their tremendous eﬀorts. I believe
they've enabled our company to begin 2015 in an excellent position, a position that
should lead to proﬁtable growth in the period ahead.
We recently reached the 10-year mark of being a publicly traded company. And today, we
announced a 10% dividend increase, our 10th consecutive annual increase. Our track
record of value creation speaks for itself, I think, as we've generated a 274% total return
for shareholders in the past 10 years, well above the TSX as well as our peers. So we look
Page 3 of 21

Date: 2015-02-04

forward to many successful years to come as we strive to maintain this track record of
value creation.
With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Louis Marcotte.

FINAL

Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles. Good morning, everyone. I will focus on three topics this morning: our
operating results, our lines of business, and our balance sheet. As Charles mentioned
earlier, we delivered exceptional fourth quarter net operating earnings of $247 million or
$1.84 per share on a combined ratio of 88.2% compared to 96.3% in the same quarter last
year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Weather was clearly a factor. Warmer temperatures were observed across the country. We
incurred lower cat losses and we've seen lower frequency in all our businesses. But our
own proﬁtability initiatives, particularly in property lines, paid oﬀ as well as rate and
product changes helped drive our overall underlying current year loss ratio to 62%. This is
the best fourth quarter showing in the past ﬁve years.
On a full year basis, we reported a 92.8% combined ratio despite having experienced a
challenging ﬁrst half of the year and a fair level of cat losses. Strong underwriting results in
the quarter were further complemented by healthy investment income of $111 million. This
income reﬂects a higher level of invested assets on the back of strong operating cash
ﬂows. We expect the continued low yield environment to pressure our investment income
in 2015, making it diﬃcult to match the level recorded in 2014. Net distribution income in
the year was $75 million, unchanged from 2013. We maintain our $100 million target of
distribution income in 2015 as we continue to grow and support our broker channel.
On the expense side, better underwriting results in the quarter drove variable
commissions higher, oﬀset by savings in general expenses resulting in a slightly higher
expense ratio compared to last year. For the full year, the expense ratio improved close to
1 point to 30.1%, driven primarily by savings in general expenses.
Moving on to lines of business, personal auto premiums increased 1% in the quarter,
including the mandatory rate reductions taken in Ontario, which impacted both premium
and units. The combined ratio improved 4.7 points from Q4 last year despite $13 million
lower proﬁts from pools. Favorable prior year development was higher in Q4, but
comparable to historical levels on a full year basis. The underlying current year loss ratio
of 73.5% improved 3 points year-over-year, driven largely by lower frequency. As Charles
mentioned, we recently ﬁled an additional 2% rate reduction in Ontario in anticipation of
savings from the recently passed Bill 15 as we pursue growth in this market.
Personal property premiums grew 4% in the quarter as rate increases initiated in
November 2013 under our Home Improvement Plan more than oﬀset a small decline in
units. Now that we have completed one renewal cycle, we expect rate increases to
moderate going forward. All initiatives under our improvement plan have been rolled out
and we estimate that the beneﬁts were roughly 70% earned in the fourth quarter. Our
Page 4 of 21

FINAL

combined ratio for the latest quarter was a remarkable 73.6% and led to a full year
combined ratio of 89%, both signiﬁcantly improved from 2013.
On the commercial side, auto premiums were up 9% year-over-year as we successfully
acquired a number of large accounts. The commercial P&C business saw a good top line
growth as well, thanks to ﬁrming market conditions and the completion of our eﬀorts to
reduce earthquake exposure in BC. In terms of proﬁts, we experienced some quarterly
volatility in commercial auto leading to a combined ratio of 99.5% in Q4, 1 point better
than last year. On a full year basis, the combined ratio improved 4 points to 89.6%.
In commercial P&C, lower frequency of claims and our actions to improve proﬁtability
paid oﬀ as we've reported a strong combined ratio of 87.1%. Our actions, which were
initiated in mid-2014 after reporting ﬁve unproﬁtable quarters, are too recent to be
considered fully responsible for this quarter's strong combined ratio. Like commercial
auto, the full year combined ratio of 94.2% is more reﬂective of the true performance of
this line of business. We will continue with our commercial P&C action plan with the goal
of running this business in the low-90%s on a sustainable basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

Finally, a few comments on our ﬁnancial strength. Our investment portfolio was of high
quality and well diversiﬁed. The asset mix includes recently added U.S. exposure being
12% of our bond portfolio and 17% of our net common share portfolio. We believe that the
beneﬁts of geographic and sector diversiﬁcation, as well as maintaining currency
exposure on the U.S. common shares, outweigh the slightly lower yields on U.S. securities.
The portfolio generated net investment gains of $48 million in Q4 before recording $51
million of impairment losses. Such impairments do not impact our operating earnings nor
book value as the assets are mark-to-markets. Of the impairments, approximately twothirds were related to the energy sector. And as a reminder, only 6% of our total portfolio,
net of hedges, is investment in energy securities.
We maintained our strong ﬁnancial position at quarter end with an estimated MCT OF
209%, $681 million in excess capital, and debt-to-capital ratio below our target. Our book
value per share increased 11% in 2014, primarily on growth of operating earnings. Our
adjusted ROE reached 16.8% for the year, including the impact of carrying substantial
excess capital.
We are clearly in an enviable position to pursue growth opportunities. On the basis of our
balance sheet strength and earnings power, we are increasing our dividends by 10% to
$0.53 per quarter, which represents a 12.5% annual growth rate when considering every
dividend increase since the IPO in 2014.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Dennis.

Q&A
Operator

FINAL

Certainly. We'll pause momentarily to compile the Q&A roster. Your ﬁrst question comes
from the line of Geoﬀ Kwan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Morning, Geoﬀ.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Just had a couple of questions. First oﬀ, in terms of your investment portfolio and the
investments in the energy space, I believe you do some kind of total return swaps and the
like. But I just wanted to get a sense as to the variability that we're seeing in the energy
markets and what that impact might be on the investment book?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So on that ﬁrst question, as we mentioned, 6% of the overall portfolio is in the energy
sector. So that includes bonds, spreads, commons, and what we call energy includes
pipeline infrastructure, oil and gas producers, as well as integrated. Maybe, Louis, you
want to add some color there.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

No, that's exactly right. So it's important to notice that we're not that heavily invested into
producers, which are more likely hit. Important as well when we talk about the total return
swaps that you net out the growth exposure. So we consider 22% of our net equity
portfolio to be invested in energy and that represents a bit north of $350 million a year.
And because they're invested in high quality companies, not so much in the producers,
varied between pipelines infrastructures as well, the volatility is not as important as we
see. There is no high yield securities in the portfolio. That also limits the impact for us.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay. And just the other question I had was with the kind of expansion with Berkshire and
CNA from what they've already got in Canada, just wanted to get your sense or your
thoughts on what that might mean and whether or not they may also look to go further
into Canada and how that impacts how you run your business.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Page 6 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

Date: 2015-02-04

I'll let – both Berkshire and CNA are operating in upper-end commercial lines as well as
specialty lines. I'll let Alain comment on their presence.

FINAL

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Well, I think you hit the ﬁrst point, which is if you look at their license in Berkshire
Hathaway, they look for licenses not only in Canada but in other countries. And their
target is international and very large accounts, which is not necessarily the space where
we operate mainly, since we – focus is more on small and mid size account.
That being said, we live currently in a very competitive environment. Adding another
competitor and they're, in general, disciplined competitors, well, we think we have
suﬃcient and we have the competitive advantage to face that competition. We have like
the largest database in Canada, and we have all the expertise and the capacity to exploit
that database.
We have a very good service both in terms of clients, customer and broker. We have a
very good support of our broker going forwards. Our supply chains is well managed, and
all of those advantage are not easily replicated – easily to replicate. So we think we have
the competitive advantage to face any of those competition coming in. But as I said,
they're moving in a space where we're not really present.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. And I think the bottom line is that if Berkshire Hathaway sees value in Canada, I'm
glad with that perspective.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Aiken with Barclays. Your line is open.

Q - John C. Aiken

{BIO 21267604 <GO>}

Good morning. I guess, just a follow-on question to that. Charles, what are you seeing
about the distribution landscape, about the potential entrants and possible disruption
along those lines?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well, I think there are important changes in distribution taking place in the near term and
we think there will be even more important distribution changes taking place in the mid
to longer term and we're clearly focused on managing the business with the mid and
longer term in mind. And that's why, as I've mentioned in my remarks and as I've
mentioned at the Investors Day, you can expect our brand architecture to become more
streamlined and stronger. And you can expect our distribution platform to become more
diversiﬁed precisely to prepare against these threats.
Page 7 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2015-02-04

FINAL

The other thing that we're putting a lot of emphasis on is digital leadership. We want to
make sure that the interactions with our various business units, be it BrokerLink, Intact
Insurance or belairdirect is leading when it comes to digital experience. So that being
said, I mean, there are – we're seeing, in the near term, certainly diﬀerent patterns and
diﬀerent regions, but companies tend to reach out in other channels.
You can think about the acquisition that was announced last year by one of our
competitor in Québec that's actually extending its reach in the tight agency distribution.
They're involved in broad distribution and in pure distribution like we are in the west of
the country. For us, that's a very concrete example of branching out other than your core
distribution network.
Because at the end of the day, I think consumers – you want to make sure your product is
available to consumers regardless of how they want to do business with you, and we think
that many of our competitors are headed towards that direction. So I think this though is
just people branching out in existing modes of distribution today. So that's the short term.
And I think we're well ahead of the parade there given our multichannel distribution
platform.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think the bigger play is what happens three years, four years, or ﬁve years from now or
maybe less than that when you have big technology players who are not in the market
today, who have strong brands, who have a very good understanding of consumer
behavior, who have agile technology come in and start disrupting how the business is
distributed.
We're not overly concerned about disruption in manufacturing per se, given our position,
but certainly when it comes to distribution, it's fair to expect a disruption. We've seen that
in other markets. And while there are a number of barriers in our market, I think, overall,
we're getting prepared for some disruption. And I would say I would put at the top of the
list big technology players here.

Q - John C. Aiken

{BIO 21267604 <GO>}

Great. Thanks, Charles. And if I can just tag in quickly for Louis. The distribution
contribution, which is a net number within your sub-pack, dropped, I understand from the
commentary it was related to some accruals. Can you us some additional color around
what was driving that?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Yeah. I would say the quarter four is the one where distributors accrued their respective
CPC. So, in 2015...

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

That's proﬁt sharing.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}
Page 8 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2015-02-04

Proﬁt sharing; variable commissions, I mean. And so in 2013, they had more and a bit less
in 2014. So there's a gap that actually looks like the reduction. But it's really, I would say,
conservatism on the part of how they accrue for the expected proﬁt share or variable
commissions during the year.

FINAL

Q - John C. Aiken

{BIO 21267604 <GO>}

(23:50).

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

So that is, in our view, sustainable. It's a bit seasonal in the distribution sector. So it's
nothing that we think is sustainable. It's just the quarterly volatility.

Q - John C. Aiken

{BIO 21267604 <GO>}

Great. Thanks, Louis.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning, everybody. A couple of questions here. First one, Charles and Louis,
I wonder if you could kind of dive in a little bit more into what's going on with kind of the
underlying loss trends here. What should we expect here going forward? I know you said
in commercial kind of think the annualized number is a better one than kind of we're
looking on a quarterly basis. Is that the same for property and auto lines given the
favorable weather we had in the quarter?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think if I just take an aggregate picture of the results, all line combined, you see the
combined ratio improved by 8 points. There's about 4 points of cat. And that is purely
biased towards the property line. So a portion of the improvement in personal prop and
commercial P&C is cat driven and as such, one has to take that into account as you think
forward.
If you leave that aside and you look at the current excellent year performance, which
improved by about 5 points, I think about that in three ways. The ﬁrst way and probably
the most important one is the fact that our corrective measures have brought in
aggregate close to 3 points of rate increases, if you take all lines combined. And you
know roughly what these numbers are by line of business.
But a big portion of the current excellent year performance is actually driven by corrective
measures. This has been helped, from our perspective, pretty much across all lines by a
stable cost environment. And by that I mean you see frequencies dropping in all lines of
business; some lines more than other, but all lines of business.

Page 9 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2015-02-04

FINAL

And I think beyond frequency, we're operating in a fairly stable cost environment. There
are many things that we do in particular in claims and underwriting that are not part of the
corrective actions that we're talking about that are aimed at improving severity and cost
inﬂation. And if I look across the business in Q4, I mean, there's been – even though
frequencies have dropped, there's been no inﬂation in the system. Normally, when you
see a drop in frequency, it often comes with a pickup in severity. This time around, we're
seeing zero increase in severity across the book.
So I think that beyond cats, it's not all about weather. I mean, corrective measures are an
important portion of the equation and then stable cost environment in part inﬂuenced by
what we're doing is there. But the fact that we're seeing frequencies drop across all lines
of business certainly add weight to the fact that we've had a milder Q4 with less
precipitations.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. So it sounds like a better point or two is maybe due to just the favorable weather,
if I add up what you're saying?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. As you know, this is hard to put your ﬁnger on it, but it makes sense.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Right. On the severity, you did mention that you had some severity issues in the quarter in
the commercial auto. Can you dive into what exactly that was? As I recall, there were some
issues in the fourth quarter of 2013 as well.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. So I'll let Alain Lessard, SVP Commercial Lines, talk about the commercial auto
severity.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, if you look at the commercial auto combined ratio in the quarter at 99.7%,
there's a lot of volatility quarter to quarter. In this quarter, there was, as we review our
reserve on a quarterly basis, there was an adjustment that related and generated about 6point adjustment in the quarter...

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

(28:01)

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

...adjustment was booked in the quarter, but relates to the full year, and this is what has
driven the severity up. If we eliminate that adjustment, the severity is about 2.5% increase.
The current year loss ratio would have been 6 points better than last year reﬂecting better
weather in current situation.
Page 10 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2015-02-04

So we go back saying that the way we look at the proﬁtability of this line is very much on
the basis of the annual result of 89.6% and basically the 99.7% it's just kind of a blip
related to adjustments.

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. And for the sake of clarity, Brian, when you do an IBNR adjustment on the current
excellent year, it shows up...

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

...as severity.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. And then just lastly, quickly, we had a bunch of snow
down here recently, I'm wondering if you guys experienced the same up there and any
thoughts on kind of weather activity so far in the ﬁrst quarter on losses?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So Canada tends to experience snow, Brian. That's part of how we live. I haven't looked at
the weather stats compared to last year and the year before. If we look at claims activity,
Mathieu, just at the operating level, anything abnormal that you want to report?

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

No. I'd say we have a normal January, yes. It's a winter month, but (29:25)

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Clearly, there's seasonality, but we're not coming to the oﬃce with our shovels.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

environment and maybe some global observation platforms as well if you can just
elaborate on that, please, Charles. And then I have a follow-up.

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So with regards to the Ontario automobile market, when you said it wouldn't be an Intact
call, no, I think that our view has not changed one bit there, Tom. I think we're still pretty
clear that we'll see 15 points to 20 points of market share change hands. I think the
combined ratio at the industry level certainly points in that direction, in particular with
further compression on investment income.
I think that the changes we're seeing in distribution as well and at the distributor level and
the repositioning that is taking place, from my perspective, is another indication that at
the manufacturing level you'll see further consolidation. So I think everything points in
that direction as well.
I think capital requirements are still shifting. I mean, there are capital requirements taking
place in our industry. It happens to be very good for us. There are capital requirements
shifting for banks, capital requirements shifting globally as well, and I think this adds to
our view that there will be consolidation.

And as a follow-up on the commercial lines, you said to be looking at – working towards
your goal of low 90%s. And I think you had said in your – look maybe more at the annual
94% something and so there's still some room to go. I think you had said at the Investor
Day that you're looking at an 8-point combined ratio improvement by 2016 in commercial
lines. I think you were going to get 40% of that improvement in 2014, 40% in 2015, and
the rest in 2016.
So should we really look at a continuation of a trend of probably in the area of a few point
combined ratio underlying – underlying combined ratio improvement in the commercial
lines in 2015 and maybe a little bit more in 2016 if – in order to kind of hit that forecast that
you had indicated at the Investor Day? Do you still kind of stand by that?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Yes. I think the number you quoted were pretty much in line with where we see it right
now. We have about so far earned a little bit of about 3 points, and we still have
something like about 4 points to go. So, basically, we're still aiming at low 90%s. We don't
consider 94.2% as being low 90%s, but we still have a few point to go in 2015. And
probably some little things left also to be earned in 2016. So I think we'd pretty much
stand with what you quoted.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Obviously, that's not on – that's on the entire reported basis. Is that the way we should be
looking that with normalized cats? Is that how we should be looking at that number then?

FINAL

Yeah.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

And then would that be – then the question actually becomes whether it would be
normalized cats and that kind of thing in that kind of business. But I assume they've got to
be somewhere around 2 points on the combined ratio would be more normalized cats for
the commercial lines? Is that the way to think of that?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think we might have to come back on this one. I don't want to venture...

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

...into a cat normalization for one of four lines. I think, Tom, 94% is getting close to the
zone as far as I'm concerned. But I mean if you look at the performance of that line of
business, 94% is made up of 106% in Q1, 101% in Q2, 85% and 87%. So if I look at the work
that the guys in commercial lines have done, what we've seen in the past six months, I feel
pretty good about our ability to be in the low 90%s next year. It might be worth spending
30 seconds, Alain, on what is in the pipeline in terms of corrective measures at this time.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, basically, our plan aims on four elements. The ﬁrst one is rate increase at
renewal, and we've been pushing rate increase to the tone of about 5% this year and
that's on top of something close to 2.5%, 3% last year. That's about 7.5% cumulated since
two year. Those rate increase at renewal are pretty much segmented.
And to give you an idea of the segmentation like the worst 3%, 5% is getting high double
digit increase. The next 20% is getting pretty much 10%, 15% increase, and the rest of the
book is getting minimal increase. So it's very much segmented approach. We spend a lot
of time on managing, I would say, tail exposure. So we've reduced our earthquake
exposure and the cost associated with that. That is behind us. It's pretty much done by the
end of the fourth quarter this year.
We've also invested a lot in managing ﬂood exposure through geo mapping, so I think we
now have – and we presented that at the Investors Day, but we have now very good maps
that give us the elevation of the risk compared to the body of water. So we can look at not
only the distance to water but also elevation. We've adjusted the price according to it.

FINAL

And we've invested a lot in segmenting our new business pricing to new algorithm. The
GLM algorithm was implemented in July last year and the property algorithm will be
implemented by the end of Q1 this year. So we think that those four factor combined
together are really generating the plan and the necessary actions to get back to the low90%s.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Thanks, Alain. And I think that maybe to add to the context here, Tom, when you speak
with operators in the insurance business and you talk about the state of the market, often
you'll hear about the last bad tough market example, the last anecdote. And while
anecdote are interesting, we try to look at broader basis of data.

Bloomberg Transcript

And for me there's two data points that I track to assess the state of the market. The ﬁrst
one is our closing ratio. Our closing ratio is basically the number of times in commercial
lines that we sell in relationship with how often we quote. And to put things in
perspective, at the start of the year in Q1, we sold one policy for every three quotes
basically, a little less than that. At the end of the year, we're closer to selling four policies
for every 10 quotes. In other words, all that while we're doing what Alain has just
described. So for me that's a clear sign that there is something happening in the market in
the right direction.
The second key metric that I'd like to keep an eye on to put in perspective the anecdote is
how much of the business will retain. So Alain is talking about rate increases close to 5%.
Our retention between the start and the end of the year is up a couple of points, which
sort of adds to the closing ratio picture for us to see, you know what, we're doing what we
think is right in terms of getting towards the low 90%s and the market seems to be
absorbing that positively. So I think we will keep plowing in 2015 and hopefully get into
low 90%s.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks for the color.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Holden with CIBC. Your line is open.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Good morning, Paul.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

So your 2014 results with a 16% ROE and a 93% combined plus a lot of what you're
messaging signals that we should expect the growth and the number of insured risks to
Page 14 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

start accelerating from here. So I want to ask two speciﬁc questions on that. I guess, ﬁrst is,
how do you feel about rate adequacy and growth prospects in personal auto outside of
Ontario? And then secondly, sort of same question on personal property, but then
inclusive Ontario.

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I'll ask Patrick Barbeau, SVP – Personal Lines, to give you some color on that.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

So if I start with the auto piece outside of Ontario starting from the west, we've seen, in
the past couple of years, more activity on the BI side. We recognized it early and we're at
ease with where it's going on the bottom line, but that put some pressures up on rate.
Hailstorm in Alberta also is putting some pressure upward on rates. So we expect upward
rates to continue for a while in the west.

Bloomberg Transcript

If I look at the Quebec situation, the rates have been stable and results as well for many
years. So that's probably more ﬂat outlook. And in the Atlantic, although it's small in terms
of rate volume, this is also somewhat upward from a rate perspective. Units, though,
overall, in all of those regions are fairly stable, but we believe we're in a good position to
grow.
On the property side, the hard market conditions are likely to continue for another 12
months or 18 months. We've had outperformed the industry at the end of September by
more than 8 points in that line of business. So it's clear that some of our competitors still
need corrective actions. Our own rates will continue to go up, because of the unwinding
of the capping, but to a lower extent than what we've observed in the last 12 months. And
that situation on property is pretty much the same across the land.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Good. Thank you. I think, Paul, I don't want people to think that growth will explode here,
but there's clearly a change in trajectory the way I've sort of put on the call in Q3. And
again, if we go back to data and just look at insured risks growth this year, we started Q1
with a unit shrinkage of 1.2% move to Q2 with a unit shrinkage of 1.1%, Q3 we shrunk by
0.9%, and Q4 we're growing by 0.4%. So I think you see that there is a trajectory there.
We're not talking about double digit growth here, but certainly operating in an
environment that's more conducive to some of the things that we're doing on an organic
basis.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

So right. So I wouldn't be expecting double digit growth, but how is sort of mid single
digit type growth, which would be a big change from what we've seen over the last 12
months.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

That would be a big change from what we've seen...

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

...in the last 12 months.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. Fair enough. With respect to investment income, you provided some guidance at
the Investor Day, which suggests that it should be relatively ﬂat in 2015 versus 2014. Yields
have come down surprisingly a large amount since then. So should we expecting now
probably lower investment income year-over-year?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

I would say so compared to what we had in 2014, slightly below.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. Okay. Good.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So just a notch below, but potentially (42:44) we won't reach the levels of 2014 as we see
it now.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Got it. And then in terms of commercial P&C, if you look back at that string of, I think it
was ﬁve consecutive quarters of unfavorable results and at that time or at least for the ﬁrst
few, you're sort of saying it looked like it was bad luck. There's no common factors that cut
across all of the quarters. If you look back at those quarters now, would you still have the
same conclusion that it looked like it really was just bad luck?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think, Paul, there were a couple of factors that showed up to inﬂuence these full results.
One was cat and the other one was an abnormal level of large losses. I think our point was
that it was diﬃcult to establish a root cause for these large losses to a certain extent. So
just providing some color on that basis and I'll ask Alain to give his perspective, because I
suspect he thinks about that a lot.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, I think what historical patterns have shown is that we're subject to higher level
of volatility than some other line in commercial lines. And in fact, when you look at
commercial P&C, it's made up of all sorts of lines. You've got surety losses there, you've
got basically marine business, you've got E&L business as you've got your commercial
property and liability regular business, and that's what we saw in the last quarter.

Page 16 of 21

FINAL

The sources of the variation was coming from all sorts of diﬀerent line. So I think that when
– that's why I said, when we look at the overall perspective and we look establishing the
proﬁtability of that line of business, we never focus on a single quarter but looks at
normally even more than one year and adjust for trend and things like these.
So I think when we look at the string, our view that we were operating slightly higher than
our, I would say, expected target of low 90%s and we needed an action plan, that for me
is still the case, and we're continuing on the action plan, but I see that we were subject to,
what I would call, normal volatility in the results. You may call that luck, but I would call it
that's normal volatility from quarter-to-quarter of the results.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. It's just that when you have normal volatility ﬁve times in a row in the wrong
direction, you start doubting and you put some action in place. But the view has not
changed. And I go back to my perspective on our ability to carry on with our action plan
and what it does to the top line closing and retention and new business production. The
market can absorb it. So, in my mind, we're at 94%. Interest rates are coming down. The
industry is losing money. We keep doing what we're doing.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. Good. And then ﬁnally, it's been just over a year now since you've launched your
telematics oﬀering. So I think it's probably fair to start asking some questions on that.
What have you learned over the last year? Is the analytical predictability that comes at the
telematics as powerful as you would have thought? Is it less powerful? And what kind of
penetration are you getting through the broker channel versus the direct channel?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

All questions are good. I'll ask Patrick to comment on our perspective today.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yeah. So we're now oﬀering our UBI program in Ontario and Quebec, both channels, as
well as in the New Brunswick in the broker distribution. The plan is still to launch in
Alberta and Nova Scotia later this year. So far, both channels together, we have more than
60,000 clients enrolled in the program. That represents more than 250 million kilometers
driven by those clients.
So we'll start to have a good database to analyze and conﬁrm as you said how predictive
it is. And we're very happy with the way it's going. The predictiveness of those new
information that we gather are in line with our expectation. Of course, there will be
adjustments down the road as we dig into that data.
From a take-up rate, it has picked up more quickly in the direct channel. When oﬀered,
the take-up is in the above 80%. But if you look globally on our new business, it's around
50% of our new business in the direct channel that go for it. In the broker, it's a bit lower,

Page 17 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2015-02-04

because not all brokers are as proactive as some others in oﬀering it, but it's accelerating
right now and we're close to 20% in the broker channel as well.

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So, Paul, I mean, this is a higher take-up than I originally anticipated in your number one,
ﬁrst point I'll say. The reason why we haven't launched in Alberta is because the regulator
is not ready to see UBI in Alberta just yet. We're looking forward to do it, because
consumers beneﬁt from it and ultimately that's why we're doing it.
And then I think we're learning to deal with the massive amount of new data coming our
way. I would say that it's one thing to work on predictability, it's another thing to create
agility with such a new source of information and I would say that's focus number one
right now. But that being said, so far, so good.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Young with Desjardins. Your line is open.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. And I'll be the guy with Ontario auto questions, Charles.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I would have been disappointed if you wouldn't.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

I didn't want to let you down. So, Ontario auto, you've stated you've cut the rate 7.3%.
You've mentioned further rate cuts have to be accompanied by further cost reductions by
the government. So what I'm trying to understand is what are those additional cost
adjustments are you anticipating? And I guess I'm kind of taking aback a big picture here.
So if there is no further cost reductions that are implemented, can you just not reduce
rates by the full 15%? Just trying to get a sense of how to think about that.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Let me start with the last part of your question. I'll ask Mathieu to talk about some of the
cost reduction measures in the pipeline and some of the cost reduction measures that we
think will come. The industry is running at a combined ratio of 100% in Ontario auto, nine
months into the year with the reforms that have yet to take hold.
Page 18 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2015-02-04

So it's pretty clear, especially as interest rates decrease, that you won't get to 15% if there
are not more cost reduction measures. I think it's clear at the macro level and I think the
government gets that. That's why we feel there is momentum and a certain amount of
productivity in terms of coming up with more meaningful cost reduction measures.

FINAL

On that, I'll ask Mathieu to comment on what these could be.

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

So, ﬁrst, Bill 15 introduces mainly three things that could help us control the cost. The
prejudgment interest is lowered as of January 1, and we're expecting a reform of the DRS,
the Dispute Resolution System, and regulation on the tow and storage costs. So those
three things should help us reduce the cost. This is in the pipeline.
Pre-adjustment interest is eﬀective right now. But the last two, we expect throughout the
regulation toward the year-end this year. That should help us. We're also discussing in
conjunction with IBC and government what could help us going forward on the accident
beneﬁt and on the bodily injury coverage reduce the cost.

Bloomberg Transcript

And accident beneﬁt, we're talking about a new deﬁnition of the cat impairment. What
could that be? Could we go back to what it was before the case load that weakened that
deﬁnition. We're talking about shortening the med rehab beneﬁts from a 10-year period
to a 4-year period, which is the case in most jurisdiction in Canada, introducing a
psychological component in the minor injury guideline. That's on the AB side.
And on the BI side, we're talking about removing the fact that the deductible disappears.
So keeping the deductible in our case at $30,000 on the general damages. And reducing
the fees that are allowed to be recovered on the BI side. Those are some of the measure
we're discussing right now to provide further relief on the rate side.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

And there's a sense that the government understands as more needs to be done for you
to get to the full 15%. So the reality in the situation I portrayed where the government
doesn't do anything and you still reduced the rates only 7.3%, that's a very low proﬁtability
would you say?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

Yeah. We get a sense that they understand that they need symmetry on the cost side to
have on the premium side.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think they get that.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Okay. And then just – I know getting to the end of the hour here, but the other
question that I wanted to ask, Charles, and again bigger picture, your positive reserve
development has been running consistently about 4% to 5%, sometimes a little bit higher
than that over the last while. And obviously, since you did the AXA transaction, should we
be thinking about reserve developments now in the 4% to 5% range versus your historical
3% to 4%, and if not, why not?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. I think there's no structural reason to start thinking about reserve development
above the 4% range. I think that we stick by our perspective of historical or pattern of 3%
to 4% in part driven by the fact that we use provision for adverse deviation in reserving in
line with the Canadian Institute of Actuaries guidelines. And we try to be cautious in how
we reserve. But there is no structural reason to think about a higher favorable
development pattern.

Bloomberg Transcript

Clearly, there have been contributing factors to a higher pattern in the past few years.
Obviously, when reforms pan out to be better than what we anticipated, as you settle
claims, your caution ﬂows through favorable development. You've seen that for a few
years here. So that would push us above historical pattern.
Clearly, the acquisition of AXA was an outstanding acquisition. And as I've mentioned,
early in the process, the balance sheet was stronger than what we thought. And what that
means in practice is that the reserves were stronger than what we thought. And that
certainly helped go above the historical pattern of favorable development and a few
other factors of that nature. But overall, one shouldn't plan for necessarily much more
than what we've been guiding to in the past. When it's above that, that's good. We're
happy. But that's not our plan.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

And sorry, I lied. I want to just kind of go back Ontario auto for one additional thing. Just
the deﬁnition of what constitutes a cat accident, I mean, that's been going on for a long
time. And do you feel that we're – because we've gone through iterations where FSCO
and the government and you've created a new deﬁnition, it doesn't seem like that ﬁle has
moved forward. Are we to a point where you think we could be breaking through on that
particular issue?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. I think that – it's one-third of incurred losses an accident beneﬁt. So if you want to
move the needle, you'll have to get down to business on these things, and I think they do
want to move the needle. They realize that there's a lot of excesses. There have been
leakage in terms of what is deemed catastrophically injured.
The objective is to protect the victims that need it the most, but to make sure that this
deﬁnition indeed sends the money and the indemnity towards the victims that need it the
most, not those that don't. And I think that the government clearly understands that. I
Page 20 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

think that they're thinking through how – I suspect they're thinking through how they can
do that in a way that'll protect the victims properly, which is clearly our objective as well.
