Good morning and welcome to Fairfax 2017 Second Quarter Results Conference Call.
Your lines have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct
a question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any
objections, you may disconnect at this time. Your host for today's call is Prem Watsa, with

Mr. Clarke, please begin.

Peter S. Clarke

{BIO 15243793 <GO>}

Good morning and welcome to our call to discuss Fairfax's 2017 second quarter results.
This call may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ perhaps
materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements as a result of a variety
of uncertainties and risk factors. The most foreseeable of which are set out under risk
factors in our Base Shelf Prospectus, which has been filed with the Canadian Securities
regulators and is available on SEDAR.
I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Prem Watsa.

Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Thank you, Peter. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Fairfax's second
quarter conference call. I plan to give you some of the highlights and then pass it on to
Dave Bonham, our CFO, for additional financial details.

FINAL

In the first half of 2017, book value per share increased by 5.7% adjusted for the $10 per
share common dividend paid in the first quarter of 2017. Our insurance companies had an
excellent first half, with a combined ratio of 94.7% with excellent reserving and
underwriting profit of $216 million.
In the second quarter, all our major insurance companies had combined ratios of less than
100%, with Fairfax Asia at 85.9%, Zenith at 89.5%, OdysseyRe at 90.5%. Second quarter
operating income was very strong at $184 million and net investment gains in the quarter
of $205 million, which arose primarily as a result of net gains on equities of $237 million,
offset by some losses on bonds, including treasury locks and CPI-linked derivatives.
As shown on page 35 of our quarterly report, we realized losses on our investment
portfolio of $83 million in the quarter, more than offset by unrealized gains of $288 million.
All in all, we had net earnings of $312 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our insurance and reinsurance businesses, net premium written was up in the second
quarter by 6.6%, primarily due to modest growth of our insurance and reinsurance
operations and the acquisition of Bryte Insurance, AMAG and Fairfirst Insurance, while the
combined ratio for insurance and reinsurance operations was 94.9%. Excluding the
acquisitions, our net premium written was up 4.8%.
At the subsidiary level, the change in net premiums written and the combined ratios in the
second quarter were as follows: OdysseyRe, premiums up 4.7% with combined ratio
90.5%; Crum & Forster, premiums up 5.7%, Crum & Forster's combined ratio was 99.2%;
Northbridge, premiums up 9.5%, and this is in Canadian dollars, our combined ratio was
99.7%; Zenith, premiums up 4.1% with the combined ratio 89.5%; Fairfax Asia, premiums
flat with combined ratio 85.9%; and Brit, premiums up 6.3% with a combined ratio of 97%.
Net investment gains of $205 million in the second quarter of 2017 consisted of the
following. Please refer to page 2 of our press release. Net gains on net equity exposures
of $237 million resulted from net gains of $323 million on long equities and an $87 million
net loss on individual short positions.
We realized losses of $14.3 million on equities, principally from realized losses on EXCO
Resources due to an increase in ownership that resulted in the equity method of
accounting and the sale of IBM, partially offset by realized gains on (4:50) and the Bank of
Ireland.
We also had gains of $65 million on our bond portfolio, primarily due to the effect of
decreasing in interest rates on our government bonds, offset by losses on our CPI-linked
derivatives of $13 million. The loss in the other category consisted of losses on our
treasury locks that offset the gains on our government bonds.
As we have mentioned in our annual meetings, annual reports, and quarterly calls, with
IFRS accounting where stocks and bonds are recorded at market and subject to mark-tomarket gains or losses, quarterly and annual income will fluctuate and investment results
will only make sense over the long term.

FINAL

As I said in our AGM, we continue to hold our CPI-linked derivatives with a notional value
of $114 billion, which produced unrealized losses of $13 million in the second quarter. If
some of the unexpected risk come to pass, these CPI-linked derivatives could become
very valuable. We will hold them for some time.
When you review our statements, please remember that when we own more than 20% of
a company, we equity account. And when we own about 50%, we consolidate so that
mark-to-market gains in these companies are not reflected in our results.
As you will see on page 12 of our quarterly report, the fair values of our investments and
associates is $5.1 billion versus a carrying value of $3.6 billion and unrealized gain of
approximately $1.5 billion, which is not on our balance sheet.
During the second quarter of 2017, the company completed the acquisition of the
business and renewal rights acquired from AIG in Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia,
Poland and Bulgaria. The acquisition of AIG's insurance operations in Chile and Colombia
just closed, while Argentina and Uruguay are expected to be completed in the second
half of 2017, and Venezuela is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2018.

In July 2017, the company decreased its ownership interest in ICICI Lombard to 22% by
selling a 12.2% equity interest to certain private equity investors for net proceeds of $380
million and realized a net gain on investments of $232 million after tax.
This transaction values ICICI Lombard at $3.1 billion, which implies Fairfax's remaining 22%
equity interest has a fair value of approximately $688 million. On July 14, 2017, ICICI
Lombard announced an initial public offering whereby Fairfax will reduce its equity interest
in ICICI Lombard to 10% which will permit us to establish a general insurance company in
India, Go Digit General Insurance Limited, under the leadership of Kamesh Goyal.
Early in July, Fairfax together with certain co-investors completed the acquisition of 94.6%
of the outstanding shares of Allied World. At the closing of the acquisition of Allied World,
Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, the pension fund manager for
government employees in the province of Ontario, Alberta Investment Management
Corporation, an investment manager for pensions, endowments and government funds in
the province of Alberta, and certain other third parties invested $1.6 billion for Allied World.
The remaining 5.4% of the outstanding shares of Allied World are expected to be
acquired in the third quarter of 2017 for purchase consideration of approximately $229
million, consisting of approximately $109 million in cash and $120 million by the issuance of
approximately 275,000 subordinate voting shares for a total share issuance for Allied
World of approximately 5 million shares. Fairfax will ultimately own approximately 67% of
Allied World and our partners 33%. A big welcome to the Allied World employees again.
In June, Fairfax Africa agreed to invest a minimum of $130 million in Atlas Mara Limited,
comprising of a participation in an offering of new ordinary shares at a price of $2.25 per
share, expected to raise $100 million. Fairfax Africa will purchase not less than 30% of the
equity offering and have the ability to purchase any shares not taken up by existing

FINAL

shareholders. And also, a $100 million convertible bond that will convert into new ordinary
shares at a price of $2.25 per share upon closing of the equity offering. The convertible
bond investment closed on July 17, and the equity offering is expected to close in the third
quarter of 2017. Atlas Mara is a financial services institution listed on the London Stock
Exchange that operates in seven sub-Sahara African countries.
Also, on July 13, 2017, Fairfax India increased its equity interest in Bangalore International
Airport to 48% through the acquisition of an additional 10% equity interest from a whollyowned subsidiary of GVK Power and Infrastructure for a purchase consideration of
approximately $200 million. Bangalore International Airport owns and operates the
International Airport in Bangalore, India through a public-private partnership.
As far as our investments are concerned, as you know, in the past few years, we had
played defense, we are expecting to play offense, but always with a long-term valueoriented philosophy. We will continue to pick good companies, which provide significant
downside protection and potential appreciation over the long term. We have agreed to
invest about $550 million in bonds or preferred shares with warrants recently in about five
companies, which include Altius, Chorus, Mosaic Capital, Westaim and more recently AGT
Food. We get 5% to 6% plus upside through the warrant.

Bloomberg Transcript

As of June 30, 2017, we have $12.3 billion in cash and short-term investments in our
portfolio, which is about 43% of our total investment portfolios to take advantage of
opportunities that come our way. As a result in the short-term, our investment income will
be reduced.
Now, I'd like to turn it over to David Bonham, our CFO, so he can give you some more
information on the underlying financials. Dave?

David James Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Thank you, Prem. So, in the second quarter of 2017, Fairfax reported net earnings of $312
million or $12.67 per share on a fully diluted basis. That compares to the second quarter of
2016 when we reported net earnings of $239 million or $9.58 per share on a fully diluted
basis. So, year-to-date, in 2017, Fairfax has produced net earnings of $394 million, $15.70
per diluted share. And that's an improvement over 2016 when we had net earnings of
$188 million or $7.07 per diluted share.
Underwriting profits at our insurance and reinsurance operations in the second quarter
and first six months was $108 million and $216 million, respectively, and with combined
ratios in those periods of 95%. The underwriting profits somewhat higher than the
underwriting profits of $82 million and $204 million and relatively consistent combined
ratios compared to 2016, second quarter 2016, 96%, and six months was 95%.
Quarter-to-date and year-to-date underwriting profit increased $26 million and $12 million.
And that was primarily due to lower current period catastrophe losses, partially offset by
lower net favorable prior year reserve development. Current period catastrophe losses in

Page 4 of 17



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2017-08-04

the second quarter of 2017 totaled $45 million or two combined ratio points, and was $84
million or two combined ratio points in the first half of 2017.

FINAL

By way of comparison, cat losses in the second quarter and first six months of 2016 were
$158 million and $189 million, that's 8 and 5 combined ratio points. Those losses primarily
related to the Fort McMurray wildfires.
Our combined ratios benefited from net favorable prior year reserve development in the
second quarter and first six months of 2017 of $108 million and $211 million, translating into
about 5 combined ratio points in each of those respective periods. That compared to net
favorable prior year reserve development of $175 million and $260 million in the second
quarter and first six months of 2016, about 9 and 7 combined ratio points in each of those
respective periods.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net premiums written by our insurance and reinsurance operations increased by 7% in the
second quarter and 9% in the first six months, reflecting growth in almost all of our
operating segments. The increase in the second quarter and the first six months of 2017
also reflected the impact of the consolidation of the net premiums written by Bryte
Insurance of $22 million in the quarter and $108 million year-to-date. Bryte was an
acquisition that we made near the end of 2016.
So turning to our operating company results, starting with OdysseyRe. Odyssey reported
underwriting profits of $56 million and $104 million with combined ratios of 91% and 90%
in the second quarter and the first six months of 2017, compared to underwriting profits of
$30 million and $74 million, and combined ratios of 94% and 93% in the same periods last
year. So, that reflects lower current period catastrophe losses, lower extraordinary losses,
partially offset by lower net favorable prior year reserve development.
Catastrophe losses at OdysseyRe in the second quarter and first six months totaled $25
million and $54 million and translating into 4 and 5 combined ratio points in those
respective periods, a significant decrease from the cat losses of $75 million and $102
million in the second quarter and first six months of 2016.
OdysseyRe's combined ratios in 2017 included the benefit of $31 million and $67 million of
net favorable prior year reserve development, that's in the quarter and first half, that
principally related to property catastrophe loss reserves. In comparison, there were $68
million and $103 million of net favorable prior year reserve development in the second
quarter and the first six months of 2016.
OdysseyRe wrote $661 million and just over $1.2 billion of net premiums in the second
quarter and the first six months of 2017. Net premiums written increased by 5% in the
quarter, 9% in the half year, reflecting increases in almost all of the divisions except for
Latin America.
Moving on to Crum & Forster. Crum & Forster produced underwriting profits of $4 million
and $6 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017. Combined ratios of
about 99% in both of those periods compared to underwriting profit of $6 million and $16
Page 5 of 17

FINAL

million with combined ratios of 99% and 98% in the second quarter and first six months of
2016. Net prior year reserve development was either nil or very nominal in the second
quarters and the first six months of both 2017 and 2016.
Current period catastrophe losses were $7 million and $10 million in the second quarter
and first half of 2017 compared to cat losses last year of $14 million and $16 million in those
respective periods. Crum & Forster's net premiums written increased by 6% and 4% in the
second quarter and first six months of 2017, reflecting growth in their accident and health
and commercial transportation lines of business, partially offset by decreases in excess
and surplus in marine lines of business.
To Zenith National, Zenith National reported underwriting profits in the second quarter
and first six months of $21 million and $58 million, translating in the combined ratios of
90% and 85% compared to underwriting profits of $32 million and $63 million with
combined ratios of 84% in each of those respective periods in 2016. The combined ratios
included 6 and 12 combined ratio points of net favorable prior reserve development in the
second quarter and first six months of 2017 compared to 10 and 12 combined ratio points
in the same periods last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Zenith wrote $170 million and $502 million of net premiums in the second quarter and first
half of 2017, increases over $163 million and $491 million in those respective periods last
year. Those increases and about 4% and 2% in the quarter and half year principally
reflected growth in exposure, partially offset by modest price decreases.
Moving to Brit, in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, Brit produced
underwriting profits of $12 million and $23 million, combined ratios of 97% in each of those
periods. Compared to underwriting profit of $400,000 and $14 million and combined
ratios of just under 100% and 98% in those same periods in 2016. There were no current
period catastrophe losses in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 in Brit,
compared to $32 million and $35 million of current period catastrophe losses last year in
those periods and again principally related to the Fort McMurray wildfires.
Brit experienced net favorable prior year reserve development in the second quarter and
first six months of 2017 of $8 million compared to $22 million in those same periods in
2016. Brit's net premium written increased 6% and about 2% in the second quarter and
the first six months of 2017, which reflected the impact of new business initiatives and
measured growth in its core lines of business offset by the impact of additional
reinsurance purchased.
Moving on to Northbridge, Northbridge's underwriting profit was $1 million in the second
quarter, $3 million in the first six month of 2017, translating the combined ratios of 99.7%,
99.3% in each of those respective periods. That compared to underwriting profits of nil
and $3 million and combined ratios of 100% and 99% in those same periods of 2016.
Underwriting profits in the second quarter and first six months included $4 million and $5
million of current period catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses in the same period last

FINAL

year were $21 million in both the quarter and half year, and again, the Fort McMurray
wildfires being the major contributor.
Northbridge's underwriting results in the second quarter and first six months included the
benefit of net favorable prior year reserve development of $24 million and $30 million.
That represented 10 and 7 combined ratio points, respectively, in comparison to the
favorable development that we had last year, $38 million and $37 million, representing 17
and 9 combined ratio points in the second quarter and first six months of 2016.
In Canadian dollar terms, net premiums written by Northbridge in the second quarter and
first half of 2017 increased by 9% and 11%. And that was reflective of increased renewal
and new business writings combined with modest price increases right across the
organization.

Bloomberg Transcript

Fairfax Asia's underwriting profit of $12 million and $17 million and combined ratios of 86%
and 90% in each of the second quarter and first half of 2017 had decreased slightly when
compared to the underwriting profits of $13 million and $25 million in those comparable
periods in 2016. The combined ratios in the second quarter and first six months included
$19 million and $25 million of net favorable prior year reserve development compared to
$16 million and $30 million of net favorable prior year reserve development in those
periods last year.
Insurance and reinsurance other, that segment produced an underwriting profit of $4
million in the quarter, $5 million year to date, combined ratios of 98% and 99% in those
respective periods, compared to underwriting profit of $1 million and $9 million in the
same periods in 2016. The improvement in the second quarter in underwriting profit
reflected increased profitability, primarily at Group Re and at Advent.
Runoff reported operating losses of $40 million and $80 million in the second quarter of
2017 and the first six months and that compared to operating losses of $1 million and $16
million in those same periods in 2016. The increase in the operating loss of Runoff
reflected higher net adverse prior year reserve development and lower interest and
dividends that occurred in 2017.
Looking at our consolidated interest and dividend income, that decreased quarter-overquarter from $161 million to $107 million in 2017 and from $314 million in the first six months
of 2016 to $236 million in the first six months of 2017. The decrease reflecting lower
interest income earned as a result of sales of U.S. treasury bonds and municipal bonds in
2016 and early in 2017.
Fairfax recorded income tax provisions of $44 million and $69 million in the second quarter
and first six months of 2017, representing effective rates of about 12% in the quarter, 15%
year-to-date. The lower effective tax rate relative to the Canadian statutory tax rate
reflected the benefit of non-taxable investment income and income that has been taxed
at lower rates in other jurisdictions. So, particularly in the UK in respect to Brit where the
UK tax rate is lower than the Canadian statutory rate, and then partially offset by income
that's taxed at higher rates, particularly in the U.S. where the U.S. tax rate is higher.

We ended the second quarter with an investment portfolio inclusive of holding company
cash of $28.7 billion compared to $28.4 billion at the end of 2016. And our total debt to
total capital ratio decreased to 27.4% at June 30, 2017 from 28.7% at December 31, 2016,
reflecting an increase in consolidated shareholders equity and our non-controlling interest.

FINAL

So, with that, I'll pass it back over to you, Prem.

Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Thank you, Dave. Now, we are happy to answer your questions. Please give us your name,
your company name and try to limit your questions to only one so that it's fair to all on the
call. Okay. Natalie, we are ready for the questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We have our first question and it's from Paul Holden of CIBC. Your line is open.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Hey. Good morning, Paul.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Good morning. Two questions. The first one is just a quickie. When I look at your table of
net gains losses on investments, it includes a foreign currency loss of $33.5 million on
underwriting activities. So, just trying to figure out exactly what that is and why it's in the
investment gains and losses.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Dave, you want to answer that? Dave?

A - David James Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

I can do that. So, it's in investment gains and losses because that's where we record all of
our foreign exchange gains and losses on all aspects of our operations. So, we bring that
all into net gains and losses. And the quantum of the amount is just having to do with the
mix of our insurance assets and liabilities and the jurisdictions where we hold them and
the rates that apply there. So, I hope that's helpful.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Page 8 of 17



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2017-08-04

Okay. So, it's more of a mark-to-market sort of net book value of your insurance
operations. Is that correct?

FINAL

A - David James Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Yeah, actually, so nothing to do with investments at all. It's really the technical reserve. So,
it's the biggies that drive the valuation. There will be the revaluation of foreign currency
denominated claims, liabilities, reinsurance, recoverable, those type of assets and
liabilities.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Understand. Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then second question, so I am getting
lots of questions from shareholders and interested investors asking about capital ratios
and how I think about capital ratio. So I might answer, but curious to think about how
you're thinking about in the context of your high cash position, your low underwriting
leverage, but somewhat offset by relatively higher financial leverage. I guess, really, the
point of the question is how do you think about excess capital, if there is any, and your
ability to deploy that excess capital?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah. So, Paul, your question on capital is a good one. We're in a transition phase right
now because we just acquired Allied and we have sold, as you know, in early July, a 12% of
ICICI Lombard. There's an IPO and we plan to sell about the same, 12%. And then, we'll
have a 10% in the marketable ICICI Lombard common shares. And all of that is through $1
billion when you look at it. So, our focus is on, by the end of the year, to have more than $1
billion in cash and marketable securities. And our leverage likely will come down by that
time. But this is a transition time and the middle of the year as we've just done Allied and
we're going through the sale of ICICI Lombard.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Great. Thank you.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Thanks, Paul. Next question, Natalie.

Operator
Our next question comes from Tom MacKinnon of BMO Capital. Your line is open.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone.

FINAL

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Question with respect to your comments about we're going to play some offense right
now, 43% in cash and I think that's up a little bit from the quarter prior to that. But if I look
at your common equity plus your investment in associates, plus your preferreds and then
your share of Fairfax India and Africa, we're up into the $8 billion or $9 billion, which would
be about – so, let's call that equity and that would be about 30% of your total invested
assets. So, it sounds like playing offense – well, you tell me. It is playing offense mean
getting more equity and how comfortable are you with your equity concentration being
about 30% of your total invested assets? Do you have room really to take that any higher
or is playing offense just continuing along this convertible bond...

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah. That's exactly right, Tom. We're looking at – we just did the AGT. You saw that. I think
it's 7% at 5.375 percentage coupon, pretty secured. So, we have a good bond for seven
years that give us a little more than 5%. And then we've got a warrant, which has the
ability to do well over that time period. And we like AGT, the company, we like the founder
who is running it.

Bloomberg Transcript

And so in these markets, you have to be careful. We've said many a time. But long-term
value-oriented approach that we have followed for a long time, it's a stock pickers market
to choose your spots. These are all Canadian companies who are looking in the United
States, but rarely will we buy common shares. We'd rather buy a convertible and in the
form of a bond plus one, sometimes just a straight convertible.
And the interesting thing, Tom, is that we're having the opportunity. People want us to
have a significant shareholding in that company, quite often 20%, 25% because over 32
years, we've demonstrated that we are not hostile, we are friendly, we back good
management, we back it for the long term. And that's coming to be a big advantage for
us as we look for these opportunities. But our cash is not going to burn a hole in our
pockets. We're going to be careful and invest it as and when we see the opportunity like
we did with AGT.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Are you comfortable in having convertible bonds be 20% to 30% of your total investment
portfolio? And what does this mean in terms of capital as well? Would these things hold a
higher capital charge in backing your insurance subsidiaries than, say, treasuries or
corporates?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah. So, the bonds that we have, there's a capital charge, but it's not as significant as
equities. And our equity positions are, as you have said, 25% to maybe a little higher than
that. And we're comfortable with that at the moment looking at the composition of what
we own. But in terms of investing it, as I said, if we can look at – opportunistically, if we
come across companies which we like and we have the ability to get a convertible type
structure, that's where we'll be looking at.

But, of course, we have many investments that can change. And for example, Eurobank
has done very well in the quarter. It's back to $1. Greece in the last 10 days have issued a
five-year bond. First time in three years that they've come into the capital markets at
4.4%, a five-year bond, $3 billion worth. And as I said to you, any country that does not
have access to the bond market is in deep trouble that it cannot survive. And Greece has
now accessed the bond market for the first time, plans to access it again. And today, they
relaxed the capital control some, getting close to the time period when capital controls
will no longer be there. The yields are still about 5%, 5.5%, 5.25%. And in the case of
Cyprus, which had capital controls for two years and took them off. And Cyprus got
access to the bond market. That 10-year bonds are in the 2.5% area.
So, you are seeing changes like that and we will react to them both on the plus side,
meaning, adding to it, and then the – and the ability to sell our positions as and when we
think it's appropriate. And so, the markets keep changing and we take advantage of it. We
like where we are. We like our position. We like the strength of Fairfax today with the cash
in the holding company. But the fact that we've just completed a – for us, a transformative
acquisition, I can't put it in any simpler language. I mean, Allied World, a public company,
listed in the New York Stock Exchange. We think acquired at a good price and with a great
leader in Scott Carmilani, all of that is a plus for us, but, of course, always in the long-term.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

And if I could just squeeze a quick one in with respect to – for Dave. On the tax rate, what
should we be looking at for the tax rate going forward? I mean, this quarter was helped
by a – a little bit by some prior period recoveries – prior year recoveries. And there's
always that advantage of these tax-advantaged debt securities. But how should we be
thinking about it going forward? The 12% seems low, but what should we be thinking
about for tax rate?

A - David James Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Yeah. Good question. So, the tax rate is going to be, in any given quarter, a little bit
difficult to predict because it's going to be dependent on where we earn money or lose
money in different jurisdictions and the tax rates that apply to that. So, we've got a little
bit of change in our mix this quarter, which has resulted in probably a little bit of an unusual
– usually low-tax rate. I saw your note there this morning and I think the rate there that you
have in mind maybe between in the low 20s is probably a little more reasonable on an
ongoing basis.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. And with bringing in Allied World, would you expect your tax rate to modestly
increase?

A - David James Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

With Allied World, I don't think we're going to see much of an increase there. So, no, I
would say no.

Our next question comes from Mark Dwelle of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now
open.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning. Just a couple of questions. First related to the Allied acquisition, will
there be any meaningful, I'll call it, acquisition-related charges that you'd be recognizing in
the course of the – probably the third quarter? Just from getting that put together and – I
know there's not a lot like integration charges, but inevitably there's lawyers and other
aspects that just result in a meaningful number.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, Mark. Dave, you can add to this, but we don't think there's going to be any
significant cost expenses charges. But, Dave, you want to expand on that?

A - David James Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Yeah. It won't be material, tens of millions of dollars
on the low end, but nothing significant.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. And then, related to – you mentioned there is obviously a laundry list of AIG units
that were acquired or then were acquired in July or so forth. I mean, could you give an
idea of amongst the ones that have been completed? What the kind of annualized
amount of premium associated with the ones that are already closed? I know the total of
all the units was meant to be around $700 million to $800 million gross written premium.
Just trying to get a sense of kind of what proportion in premium terms has actually now
been done.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Dave or Peter, you've got to take a crack at that. We've told you the ones that we have
closed, Mark, and the ones that still have a month or two to go. But Dave or Peter, you
want to add to that?

A - David James Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2017-08-04

Yes. Sure. So if you're looking in the six months, the contribution so far is not very much.
So, of the ones that have closed, the AIG branched contributed about $6 million. So it's –
we're kind of a standing start right now, but that will ramp up over time toward the
estimates that you mentioned in your question.

FINAL

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. Maybe I can ask it the other way around. Of the couple that are still outstanding, I
think it was like Venezuela and Uruguay and maybe there was one other I can't recall, are
those ones pretty tiny compared to this entire – in terms of the entire total? I'm just trying
to get an idea, as we look forward, what portion is kind of done and what portion is kind
of still in process?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

So, perhaps, Dave or Peter, if you've got that total that we expected from Eastern Europe
as well as Latin America, the AIG acquisitions, in total, they were running at – Dave?

A - Peter S. Clarke

{BIO 15243793 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. This is Peter here. Essentially, by the end of the year, the majority of the premium
will be on our books, but you have to remember that it will be on a written basis because
we're basically starting from zero. So, that premium will take up to 12 months to come
through the numbers on an earned basis. But by the end of the year, essentially,
everything will be closed out. Venezuela is very, very small. And so – yeah, so by the end
of 2017, we'll be writing all the premium on our own books.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. So, it sounds like at least the expected earnings impact to these ones will be pretty
de minimis over the course of the balance of this year. It will really be more into next year
that we start to see a meaningful pick-up in earned through premiums and then obviously
we'll have whatever combined ratio associated with that.

A - David James Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

That's right.

A - Peter S. Clarke

{BIO 15243793 <GO>}

I think that's right.

A - David James Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

That's right, Mark.

FINAL

Yes. Our next question comes from Andrew Hollingworth of Holland Advisors. Your line is
open.

Q - Andrew Hollingworth

Thank you and good afternoon. I'm calling from London. We're shareholders of yours. I
wonder if I could just ask, Prem, a couple of direct questions. And these sort of go back
sort of six months or so to when references were made to sort of Henry Singleton and
cancellations of shares and so on. We'd be very interested to understand sort of what led
to that sort of change your sentiment? And whether that is a function of the attitude
towards valuation of the company today? Whether it's a function of the scale of the
underwriting facilities that's now been built? And therefore, it's not a sort of lasting
change that we expect to have been in place for many, many years and decades to
come, or is it more tactical to do with a sort of undervaluation of the corporation you
observe today? So, that'd be great if you answer that one. And then, I've got one very
small follow-up.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 1896571 <GO>}

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah. We talked about this, Andrew, at our annual meeting and it's a good question. Our
share buybacks are basically – I made the point that first we have to be financially very
sound and then our focus will be on share buybacks. And so, right now, we've just
completed Allied World. We want to make sure that the ICICI Lombard transactions, which
I mentioned earlier, go through, make sure that our cash positions are through $1 billion at
year end.
And as the excess cash comes in, we just think our shares today are not expensive and
now we think it's appropriate for us to buy them, buy as much as we can. And so, that's
how we look at it. We'll never buy stock at the expense of our financial position. And it's
only after our financial position is very strong that we'd look at buying back stock.

Q - Andrew Hollingworth

{BIO 1896571 <GO>}

Can I follow up from that? I just observed that, obviously, the group – I mean, in terms of
the logic of being a value investors buying your own shares back at a good price is
obviously very compelling. But, obviously, there's a big difference between the stocks that
Fairfax has issued in the last 10 years or so in order to buy other businesses. And then,
obviously, that's the very opposite extreme to the large cancellation of stock that
Singleton did that you referred to. So, just help us understand, from an operational
perspective, is there a – we have now built a global collection of assets. That means that
we don't need to build more and add more shares or to buy further assets and further
businesses, or is it not like that? That's not how this has come about?

Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td

No. I think we have the ability to buy some very fine companies like we bought Brit, and
then we bought Allied, and we did them with the idea that we'd be financially sound. So,
we issued some shares. We also got some third-party financing, as you know, like OMERS
and AIMCo. So that would be minimized, the dilution in terms of share issuance. But we do
think, Andrew, when you look back in the next few years and you look back at what we've
acquired that you as an investor and all our shareholders, we think, will be very pleased
with it. Right now, as those shares are being issued and it gets digested, it takes some
time. But I think, long term, we'd like to think that the companies we've acquired are very
significant in terms of the opportunity going forward.
But, as I said in our annual meeting, we're not really looking – we think we are well
structured. We've got plus minus $14 billion premium worldwide. We've got $37 billion, $38
billion with Allied, $40 billion investment portfolio. We got lots of cash. So, we think we are
well structured. And for whatever the market brings, the stock market or the economy,
and we think our company is structured to do well. But we're not oriented towards issuing
any more shares for buying companies. We want to digest the companies we've acquired
and we wanted to look at how we can organically expand our business because there's a
lot of revenue possibilities for us, no expense synergies. We don't believe in that. But
revenue possibilities among our companies is very significant, so we're focused on that.
And at the right time, right opportunity, all things being equal, we'd look at buying back
stock.

Q - Andrew Hollingworth

{BIO 1896571 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That's really, really helpful. Thank you. Can I have just one quick follow-up on that?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Andrew Hollingworth

{BIO 1896571 <GO>}

And that's, you (46:35) earlier on described sort of the appetite for the convertibles and
answered the other gentleman's question. Is it just tactical on your view that there's a sort
of change of opportunities that's available there? Or is there a little bit of reflection inside
Fairfax? So it sort of looks that from the investment side of things that hasn't gone quite
according to plan as you might like in the last four or five years. And maybe in some way
that overshadowed the brilliance that's been achieved in the combined ratios. And
therefore, there's an attitude that says, let's have a slightly more vanilla investment
function that means it ensures its operations get to shine through or is it not like that? It's
still exactly the same investment operations that existed before.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah. So, as someone questioned earlier, our stock positions are pretty significant. We
have the stock positions. We balance that with a big cash position. But when we see good
companies – and this is the plus factor of Fairfax, all over the world, I may add. People
want to join us, businesses want to join us. Allied World, being a great example. This AGT
company which is a fabulous agriculture company, terrific track record, built by a guy by
the name of Murad from scratch in the last 15 to 20 years. And they were comfortable

issuing fully diluted approximately 20% of their stock, prior to the issuance, maybe 25% of
the common shares, through a one structure. And we think we'll be able to help them.
And we think over time, that company is going to do well.
So, we have opportunities like that. But it also reflects, as you pointed out, a cautious view
on the marketplace, as stock prices are high. Earnings are coming up. Some of the
positives of the new administration is coming through in terms of less regulation. We'll
have to wait and see in terms of tax, whether they'll be able to put that through. The risk,
of course, always is about trade, whether trade will come down significantly because of
some of their actions. But barring all of that, we think the way we are structured and the
way we are trying to go forward make sense to us.
