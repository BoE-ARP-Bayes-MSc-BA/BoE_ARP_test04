Bloomberg Transcript

For the full year 2019, we assume combined ratio has improved from between 89% and 90% to
between 86% and 87%, excluding any runoff in last three quarters of the year. The profit forecast
model for 2019, has been upgraded by DKK 250 million, to between DKK 1,250 billion, and DKK
1,350 billion excluding runoff in the remainder of the year. These are the main points of my
presentation. Pretax earnings increased DKK 220 million to DKK 564 million in Q1 2019.
In technical non-life, profit increased DKK 129 million to DKK 465 million. The improvement was due
to higher runoff profits and lower claims trend in theft and motor. On the other hand, large-scale
claims increased DKK 24 million. The investment return in non-life increased DKK 25 million to
minus DKK 20 million.
The relatively low investment return was accounting-wise impacted negatively by DKK 200 million
due to a change in the method for calculation of the volatility adjustment component. Profit in life
insurance increased DKK 67 million to DKK 111 million in Q1 due to a higher investment return and
improved result of sales and administration, and an improved risk results. The claims trend
improved 4.9 percentage points to 63.0 percentage points in Q1 this year. Adjusted for run-off
profits, weather-related claims, large-scale claims, and other positions including change of risk
margin, the claims trend improved by 0.9 percentage points to 68.7 percentage points.
Improved adjusted claims trend was primarily due to a lower -- a level of claims in motor insurance
due to a mild winter and a lower level of theft and fire claims. Furthermore, claims handling cost
have been reduced as a consequence of Topdanmark's efficiency improvement program.
Premiums increased 2.6% in non-life. For the -- the premium growth was split between a 1.7%
increase in the personal segment, and a 3.7% increase in the SME segment.
Topdanmark continues to see a net inflow of customers in the personal agricultural and in the SME
market. We continue to assume, a premium growth for 2019, higher than the growth of 1.7% in
2018. As stated the combined ratio was 80.1 in Q1, an improvement from 85.2 in Q1, last year. For
the full year, we have adjusted the assumed combined ratio from between 89% and 90% to
between 86% and 87% excluding runoff in the last three quarters of the year.
This improvement was caused by the positive development in Q1 2019 with runoff profits a lower
level of weather-related claims than assumed and by a generally better claims trend than
assumed. Profit in life insurance increased DKK 67 million to DKK 111 million in Q1 2019, due to a
higher investment return, and an improved result on sales, and administration as well as on risk
insurance. For 2019, the assumed profit on life insurance has been upgraded by DKK 50 million to
between DKK 250 million and DKK 280 million. The life company holds a good competitive
position.



FINAL

This was reflected in a 12.8% increase in premiums split between a 24.7% growth in single
premiums, and a 7.4% decline in regular premiums. Adjusted for the loss of the distribution
agreement with Nykredit, regular premiums increased 3.9%. For 2019, the assumed growth in the
regular premiums continues to be around 10%. The investment return for the Topdanmark Group
excluding life, and adjusted for revaluation, and return of the non-life insurance provisions was DKK
18 million.
This includes the result of Topdanmark's asset management company of DKK 20 million. The
investment return was impacted by the change in a method for calculating of the VA component in
the end of Q1 2019, which had a negative one-off effect of around DKK 200 million. The changes in
the VA component, is a pure accounting issue and has no impact on the cash flow in Topdanmark.
The investment return was on the other hand higher than assumed on equities Danish mortgage
bonds and on properties.
Based on a number of assumptions described in the Q1 report, the assumed post-tax profit for
2019, has been upgraded by DKK 250 million to between DKK 1,250 billion and DKK 1,350 billion,
excluding runoff in the last three quarters of the year, representing earnings per share of DKK 15.0.
