Thank you, Andrew, and good afternoon to all of you. I'm very happy to be with you for
these half-year earnings, and we will do it as usual. We will split the presentation between
Gerald and myself, and afterwards, we'll have enough time for your questions and our
answers.

Bloomberg Transcript

When you look at the highlights of the earnings, it is a very good mix between a very solid
top line, 4% growth and focus very much on the preferred segments, and at the same
time a very strong growth on the bottom line, 10% plus underlying earnings per share
with a strong performance across all geographies. The new kid in the family, AXA XL is for
the ﬁrst time with us and as of the ﬁrst half of this year. And you can see that also AXA XL,
is progressing very well and very much in line with the 2020 earnings target that we have
set ourselves.
All of this is happening on a very strong and solid balance sheet, 190% solvency. You've
seen that the shareholders equity has increased, and also that the return on equity of
18.3% is very solid. And we have continued the delivery on the selldowns and
deleveraging. AXA today is really transformed with 80% coming from technical results.
And when you look at its positioning globally, you see that it's very uniquely positioned,
the largest insurer in commercial lines and one of the largest global insurers in Health &
Protection, and in combination that is scarce and very diﬀerentiating.
Let's have a look at the top line growth. I said 4%, which is a very good number, driven
mainly by the preferred segments, and when we talk about preferred segments, we talk
not about a dream, we talk about the majority of the AXA portfolio being in their plus 6%
on Commercial line P&C, which is mainly fueled by XL. Certainly through a very good
pricing momentum, but also through gaining good businesses in a phase where we were
still in integration.
Health, which is 12% of our revenues, has grown by 5%. Again, we are very strong in six
markets across the globe, and we can see that all of these markets have contributed to it.
Protection at the level of 3%. When we look at the bottom line, we also see that it's a very
strong technical proﬁtability, like-for-like all technical ratios in P&C in Health & Protection
have improved. When you look at the P&C combined ratio, we have improved again, likefor-like, because last year XL was not part of the AXA Group by minus 1.2% at a level that
was already low to 93.3. Health combined ratio improved by 0.7 points and on Protection,
improved by 1 point, you see for the ﬁrst time that the AXA Equitable results are not in
there anymore, since AXA Equitable is de-consolidated.

Let's zoom on AXA XL, because as I said earlier, it's the ﬁrst time that we have AXA XL into
our accounts for the ﬁrst six months of this year. I am very pleased to see that AXA XL has
performed well both on the top line and the bottom line. You have plus 9% on premium,
which is great. Coming from three things: one, obviously taking beneﬁt of a improving
pricing environment, certainly the strongest in the US, but also quite strong in Europe,
improving the business mix more towards US, more towards specialty, but also winning
quite a few new businesses, which makes me in particular very happy because in a period
of integration, it is where you mostly lose business and we have seen exactly the opposite.
At the same time, we have delivered on the earnings EUR0.5 billion for the ﬁrst half year,
when we look behind the earnings is very much fueled by the price increases, by the
growth in business, but also by delivering on the synergies, both on the cost side and the
revenue side. And with this EUR0.5 billion, we are very comfortable to be on a good track
to reach the ambition of EUR1.4 billion by the end of 2020.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the Group, this results in an underlying earnings growth of plus 7%, and here I would
like to diﬀerentiate two pieces: one, is how has old AXA or previous AXA performed?
Because this was the piece that remained constant. And what we see is that there is a
strong performance across all geographies, be it France, be it Europe, be it Asia, be it the
international markets, plus 5% is very robust and very strong. And then we have a plus 2%
from the transforming piece, which is getting XL into AXA, slowly disposing of AXA
Equitable with reduced ownership, but also having signiﬁcantly higher holding and
ﬁnancing costs due to the eﬀect of this transformation.
This results in a 10% underlying earnings growth per share, both on underlying earnings
and on adjusted earnings per share, which is very much in line with the ambition that we
have given between 3% and 7% and for the half year certainly above this corridor that we
have given ourselves, and as an ambition in 2020 in June 2016.
As I said earlier, all of this has happened on an already very strong balance sheet, which
has become stronger. As we said, one of our priorities was reducing the ownership in
AXA Equitable. We've IPO'd AXA Equitable last year on the 10th of May, and since then
we have done several sell downs, we have seen the recent one, which has brought us to
39% of total ownership, but 30% of economic ownership. As we always said, our aim is to
go to zero, but depending on market conditions.
This has led to a reduced debt giving, which was our third main priority. We've seen that
we started at the end of last year at 32%. We are now at 3.8% and with the available cash
to be repaying additional debt, we've come down to 30.2%, again, which is well in line
with our aim of getting to 25% to 28%, because as you remember, we had three sources
to fuel the deleveraging: one was the further selldown of the AXA Equitable; secondly,
the disposable of AXA Life Europe; and thirdly, the transformation of our Group Life
portfolio in Switzerland.
190% solvency range, which is very strong, which is exactly in the middle of -- in line with
the range that we have given ourselves, published last year November, 170% to 220%.
And you've also seen that the ratings have been reaﬃrmed, and even on Moody's, the
negative outlook that was given at the time of the AXA deal has been removed.

When you look at the transformation and look at what does the new AXA look like, you
can see that we are exactly in line with what we said, shifting from ﬁnancial risks to
technical risks and creating a global insurer that is strong in Commercial lines and strong
in Health & Protection of preferred segments. You see that we have, if we assume that
AXA Equitable is fully sold down, that 82% of our earnings come now from technical
sources, and this was 66% two years ago. So a massive shift, fully in line with what we said.
And when you look at its global positioning, as I said earlier, a very remarkable position in
Commercial line, the largest commercial insurer of the world, the most global one. And at
the same time in our preferred segments, Protection & Health, one of the very large
global ones, a scarce asset, that is very diﬃcult to copy with great market positions and a
very diﬀerentiated proposition. And certainly, what makes me very proud for the 10th year,
the number one brand in the insurance sector.

Bloomberg Transcript

We've also accelerated on our payer-to-partner strategy. Last year, at the full year, we
spoke a lot about what we have achieved in telemedicine in Europe. We have now added
another leg to our payer-to-partner strategy in health, which is concerned mostly the
emerging markets. This is very much around vertical integration. In those markets, you
have very limited medical infrastructure, and therefore, also limited access for many
people to this infrastructure. And so we thought, can we create an ecosystem that has
clinics. And clinics are small clinics of eight to 10 doctors, not hospitals, where you can
receive customers and patients, where you can help them immediately and where you
can also create a combined positioning and proposition between the clinics and the
health insurance. We have launched this in Mexico with a strategic partner Keralty, who
have been in this business for a long time, and we've also launched it in Egypt on
ourselves.
At the same time, we have continued the same approach of payer-to-partner, which is
how do we go beyond the insurance coverage, how do we augment and combine the
insurance coverage with services on the Commercial side because when you think about
health payer-to-partner, we talk about the individual. On the Commercial side, we talk
about the health of the company. And so, let me take one example of three, the
connected cargo. We are working together with a company called Contguard, where
we've also taken a large share, where it's about positioning sensors on containers to really
help avoiding claims to understand where do thefts happen, where do ﬁres happen, what
are the most dangerous cranes, what are the most dangerous route and how can you
optimize your logistical ﬂow in order to beneﬁt from this inside, which goes well beyond
our own claims experience.
All of this combined with our very important role in society because being an insurer also
means giving back, also means being there to ensure that the social cohesion that we
create in our own portfolio is also created in the society. And therefore, we've focused in
the last six months on a continued engagement on climate, mainly focused on
biodiversity because we do believe that this is a very co-element to the climate change,
and I'm very happy to see that we have worked well with WWF, but also XL with the
Ocean Alliance has really contributed a lot to that. And we have also been very close in
links with the G-7 in order to work on this. And the second topic is very much the launch
of an Impact Fund around the same topic to make sure that we also mimic our behavior
and take our insights that we've drawn from these studies into the way we invest.

results. Thank you very much.

Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon. So here you have the -- let's start with the underlying
earnings. Underlying earnings are up 7% that EUR3,620. As you can see on the right hand
side across the board, all our markets have positive contributions with one exception,
which is in Transversal, which is IM, and that I will -- slide dedicated to it. As explained by
Thomas it represent all these markets represent a contribution of 5% out of 7%, and then
we have AXA XL, so 77 that you can see in the ﬁrst half of '18 corresponding to AXA
corporate solution and AXA Art. And the contribution this year -- this ﬁrst half of XL is
EUR502 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the United States it was EUR465, EUR283 for the ﬁrst half just corresponding to the
consolidation, we consolidated 93% one year ago and now it's 53% last on Central
Holdings, so we have a negative contribution, which is increasing and it's mostly due to
the ﬁnancing of XL and the AXA Equitable Life sell down like the hedging, US dollar-euro
hedging and for the ﬁnancing of XL some temporary debt. On top of this we had some
speciﬁc tax on extraordinary dividend coming from our subsidiaries for EUR30 million, so
that explains most of the diﬀerence and most of the increase in Central Holding.
Let's us go through the France, ﬁrst. As far as France is concerned, we have a strong
growth of 7%, plus 7% at EUR873, ﬁrst explained by a strong technical improvement. As
you can see on the right hand side, we have a P&C combined ratio at 90.8%, meaning an
improvement of 2.9 points and Health combined ratio is at 97.7% minus 1 points. Second,
we have the strong top line in Health and P&C commercial lines all together we have plus
7%. We had last year a favorable prior year development, and it doesn't exist this year,
which is roughly EUR30 million. So it's -- it was an element of last year, which is nonrecurring this year.
Let's move to Europe, as far as Europe is concerned, so plus 4% on underlying earnings at
EUR1,333 million. Explained ﬁrst by technical improvement, just like France, we saw P&C
combined ratio down 1.1 point, with Health combined ratio down 0.8. And this correspond
two countries like Germany, UK and Ireland, Spain and Italy. We have higher volumes in
P&C and Health, you can see on the top, right, plus 4% in P&C commercial lines, plus 3%
in Health, and we have lower investment income.
In the Asia. Asia plus 8%, a strong performance, I would say was an improve -- at EUR620
million and across the board we have an improvement in underlying earnings in Thailand,
in China, in Japan and in Hong Kong.
Next is international. International and new market. And here it's typical case of a strong
top line growth, plus 6% with across the board technical improvement, which as you can
see, combined ratio going down by 1.5 points in P&C, 0.6% in Health. So we have really
good beneﬁt from a leverage here, which explains the plus 16% underlying earnings
growth.

FINAL

Let's move to AXA IM now. As far as AXA IM is concerned, we suﬀered like a lot of asset
management company from lower fees, we saw business mix, which was less favorable
with a bit less equities and more ﬁxed income, which means that on average we have our
fees, which are going down from 17.2 basis point to 16.6. This is partially oﬀset by lower
expenses. In the end earnings are down 12%, i.e. minus EUR16 million.
AXA XL, as explained and as mentioned by Thomas, we have a very good ﬁrst half
earnings contribution from XL EUR502 million, explained by ﬁrst strong top line growth
plus 9%, 6 % in specialty -- 6% in specialty, 15% in P&C insurance, 2% in the reinsurances
of which minus 7% in Property Cat, but as you know, that's a point that we discussed many
times and that we discussed, I remember six months ago, when we presented the 2018
accounts. So we walk the talk. We said that we would decrease somehow the Property Cat
to avoid some part of volatility, that's exactly what we did. It didn't prevent us to have a
strong performance, we beneﬁted of aﬃrming pricing cycle with Insurance at plus 5% and
with Reinsurance at plus 2.4%. And as mentioned before, these trend is still there. And we
have the ﬁrst delivery of expense synergies, roughly EUR50 million, and we add plus and
minus, plus with favorable developments from Q4, '18, notably California Wildﬁres and
Hurricane Michael, which is oﬀset by elevated level of non-cat large losses. We are on
track for the EUR1.4 billion target underlying earnings target for 2020.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's move to the United States. So it's quite simple roughly speaking, the -- at 100%, the
underlying earnings from the US went up by 1%. But we have reduced ownership, which
explains most of the decline between EUR465 and EUR283.
Let us go to the adjusted earnings. So adjusted earnings are up 8%, again these ﬁgures
are constantly ﬁxed. And we have underlying earnings of EUR3,620 million, net realized
capital gains at EUR386 million. Don't expect us to be fundamentally diﬀerent for yearend, we beneﬁted from excellent market conditions in the ﬁrst half, especially on the
equity market. As a whole we are at EUR4 billion in adjusted earnings.
Let's move to net income, so net income was, down 19% to EUR2,333 million in the ﬁrst
half. And starting on the right hand side, starting from adjusted earnings, you have mainly
two adjustments. The ﬁrst one, is the change in fair value and ForEx coming from
derivatives, ﬁrstly equity hedges. If you remember that we mentioned these equity
hedges, which are long-tail hedges, up to the end of 2020, and it's mark-to-market. In
face of these equity hedges, of course, we have signiﬁcant capital gains which are NOCI
[ph].
The second element of derivatives is interest rate swaps, which are here to manage the
duration of the debt and being a way to lengthen the duration of their liabilities. It's a
negative 0.3, but again, it's oﬀset by signiﬁcant gains in -- as we will see in a second,
signiﬁcant gains on the investment side, on ﬁxed income side. So second element is a
minus EUR705 exceptional and discontinued operation, you remember that in March,
when we announced the second sell down, we mentioned that we would incur a loss at
that time, we said it would be EUR0.7, so in fact, it's EUR0.6. It's due to the fact that we did
the consolidation of AXA XL -- of AXA Equitable Holding. We had to markdowns 310
million shares at a price of $20.50, which was the price of the disposal of the second sell

Page 6 of 26

down meaning that in the future, so long as we will sell at higher price, it will fall into a -- it
will be a proﬁts that will oﬀset part of these losses.

FINAL

Shareholders equity, up from EUR62.4 billion to 66.7 billion, mostly three items, that I
could comment here. So change in net unrealized capital gains you have in your book,
you have the detail, maybe you will have questions in the appendices on the changing
unrealized capital gains mostly from ﬁxed income, but also from equities.
Net income for the period 2.3% and a dividend of EUR1.34 billion that was paid in May
minus EUR3.2 billion. You can notice adjusted ROE, which is at 18.3% quite strong level,
where as our target was between 14% and 16%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's move to the assets, we have out of the -- as you can see here on the left, we manage
EUR547 billion previously, one year ago it was EUR597 billion in the meantime we include
the XL, but they consolidated AXA Equitable Holdings. No big change on that side.
Mostly, we are invested in ﬁxed income. What is quite interesting is the yield on assets,
yield on assets on Life went down from 3% to 2.8% and P%C from 3.2% to 3%. And on the
right hand side you have the details and the elements relative to the ﬁxed income
investment.
In the ﬁrst half, we invested EUR28 billion again mostly in ﬁxed income. We invested an
average at 2%, of which 1.9% in Europe. Investment margin now, so the investment margin
is down in Life. I would say slightly down only because we have a lot of ﬂexibility. Many
times, we mentioned to you that we had a signiﬁcant potential margin, because we have
quite low interest rate guarantees, which gives us some margin in order to limit the
decrease of the Life and Savings investment margin at EUR0.67. On the P&C yield at
constant scope excluding AXA XL, we dropped 6 to -- we dropped the investment
income by 16 basis point quite in line with a 10 to 20 guidance that we gave before. It's
3% investment income including AXA XL.
Let's move to the performance in P&C with a combined ratio starting ﬁrst on the left,
including AXA XL -- including AXA XL, you can see here that the current year combined
ratio is at 96.8%, of which 2.7% coming from nat cat, including natural events. I remind you
that the normalized level is 3%, so we are slightly below the normalized level. Prior year
development minus 1.7%, so we gave a guidance between 1.5% and 2.5% and here we are
slightly below the midpoint.
On the right hand side, you have the evolution between the ﬁrst half of '18 and 2019,
starting with the current year combined ratio, which is down 96.8% to 95.4%, minus 1.4
points of which 0.9% coming from the nat cat and natural event, and the rest being a 0.6%
-- 0.5% coming from the improvement in the attritional ratio. You can see that the prior
year reserve development is slightly lower than one year ago minus 2.1%, meaning that in
the end our all year combined ratio improved by 1.2 points at 93.3%, and we can say that
we are very proud of this performance.
Solvency now. So our solvency is at 190% from 193% one year ago. You have the
sensitivities on the right hand side, solvency roll-forward in the -- at the bottom of the
Page 7 of 26

FINAL

page of the slides, with operating return plus 12 points, dividend minus 5. I could say that
the 12 point is slightly higher than the guidance, which is between 15 and 20 points.
Market impact minus 9 points, so it's due to the decline in interest rates.
Equitable selldowns its plus 4 points, so roughly it's we sold roughly speaking 100 million
shares, and it correspond to plus 4 points. And then we have the XL treatment, that means
that we moved XL to the standard formula, which is minus 3, then we have the VA
reference portfolio, plus UFR dropping by 15 basis points all of this representing minus 3
points, oﬀset by a positive FX eﬀect of plus 2 in the end, we are at 190.
I hand over to Thomas for the conclusion.

Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Gerald. If we look at what are the main message of the half year, I
would summarize them in three ways. Number one, a balanced achievement of growth
and proﬁtability, 4% top line growth, 10% underlying earnings per share, and a very good
performance of AXA XL. Second headline, good progress on the priorities we've set
ourselves. Number one XL integration; number two, the selldown of AXA Equitable;
number three, the reduction in the leverage; and number four, advancing on payer-topartner. Third big message, the strategy is paying oﬀ and you really see a shift in the
portfolio from ﬁnancial risk exposure to much more technical risk exposure, 66% to 82%
of the earnings that come from technical risks.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you very much, and we now come to your questions. Let's start with Nick.

Questions And Answers
Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Nick Holmes of Societe Generale. Just two questions, the ﬁrst is
what would you say are the key drivers of the favorable P&C pricing at the moment,
especially in commercial lines? And to what extent do you think low bond yields will help
to maintain pricing discipline in the hot market?
And then second question is on the equitable divestment. Just wondered, do you think
there might be an opportunity for further divestment this year? Thank you.

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

So I suggest that Greg takes the ﬁrst question. I'll do the number two and three, which
was about the lower bond you and AXA Equitable.

A - Greg Hendrick

{BIO 1649843 <GO>}

So it's -- I think the ﬁrst thing to start with is, not only those the numbers to the half year
we see in the second quarter an acceleration of the aﬃrming. I'm not ready yet to call this
a hard market in a classic sense, but deﬁnitely aﬃrming in a ﬁrm market. And in the
Page 8 of 26

FINAL

second quarter, the plus 5% insurance, was plus 8% and the plus 2.4% and reinsurance
was plus 4%. So the second quarter is accelerating, getting better and I can tell you from
just having been across The Street, both in the Lloyd's building and in our oﬃces at AXA
XL, it's continuing to aﬃrm even more.
Your question about why is that happening, I think it's kind of three things, and Thomas
said he would cover the last one. So I'll start with that one, which is, there is just -- it's a
lower investment yield. So anything long tail is under pressure there. The second is,
you're seeing, as you look around the industry, you're seeing a pressure on results across
many lines of business. We've talked about here about slightly elevated man-made losses.
These things are not unique to AXA XL. We almost never are right in these areas or 100%
of a risk for taking the share it on these big large covers, and so others are experiencing
this.
So there's a realization that while we haven't destroyed as an industry capital, we have put
pressure on earnings and results. And that is a very common theme as I talked to
colleagues in the underwriting. And I think on the third point, the broking community.
Brokers and clients are now accepting of the fact that the price of risk has gone up, that it
needs to pay more. Of course, there is the usual give-and-take of, not my account.
Someone else's account. But the general theme now in the conversation is very much
around the price of risk has gone up. So I think those are the three big drivers.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Greg. So maybe hooking on to the lower bond yields. I also believe
that this will be a further driver of price increase. Nevertheless, if I take our own company,
one mustn't overestimate the eﬀects because we've always given a guidance that our
bond yields will -- on the P&C side decrease by 10 to 20 bps. so we are very well in the
guidance. Let's assume we would deviate from that by 10 bps. This would translate into a
combined ratio -- on a necessary combined ratio improvement at AXA of 0.2%. So it is
feasible, but in general, the low bond yields do cry out for continued good pricing
environment that we have seen so far.
On your third question, Nick, on AXA Equitable, yes, our aim is clearly, as we always said,
to go to 0 shareholding in AXA Equitable. We have so far, between May 10 and now,
always found good windows of decreasing our ownership to today 39% or 30% in
economic terms. And those transactions have all been done at $20 or above. And so our
aim is clearly to continue this trend of the selldowns, but I repeat again, not at any price.
We need to ﬁnd the right moment in the interest of our shareholders.
Let's just move one in front. It's diﬃcult to see with the light.

Q - Nick Holmes

Yeah. Hi, good afternoon. Ashik Musaddi from JPMorgan.
Hi, good afternoon. Ashik Musaddi from JPMorgan. Just couple of questions. First of all, I
mean, clearly, pricing is moving up in XL. You mentioned volumes are moving up. Having
said that, the results were still EUR 0.5 billion, which is -- which looks like your earlier
expectation as well. So had pricing not moved up so ﬁrmly, then clearly, these results
would have been tough. So what's going on? Can you give a bit more dynamic if there is
something we are missing? And just linked to that, I mean you're expecting EUR1.4 billion,
which is like a run rate of EUR1 billion going to EUR1.4 billion next year. And that's a big
jump, again, so what will bridge that gap? That's the second one. Yes, that's it. Thank you.

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Good. So I would suggest, Greg, you do the ﬁrst one, on -- has the pricing made it all or
hasn't. Clearly, the answer is, I guess, it hasn't. And then, Gerald, you will talk about the
question of how to get from EUR 1billion to EUR1.4 billion.

Yes. I think, so pricing in the large P&C and Reinsurance -- so if you look at what we do on
the Insurance and Reinsurance side, earns in somewhere over 12 to 24 months. If you're
writing reinsurance on a treaty basis, you're getting the risk earning in over a 2-year
period. So the driver of these results is not all by rate. There is a component of rate, but it
would be much more that lower rate that we've seen booked in the ﬁrst half of the year in
total, not that 4% to 8%.
That's going to come in later. Also, we tend to have a philosophy, that is again another
example of where XL and AXA share philosophies is that we take bad news fast and good
news slowly. So we're not moving loss ratios right away just because we've gotten a little
bit of extra rate. We are waiting to see how everything plays out. In that, the result is a bit
of the expense synergies that Gerald talked about. Some of the reunderwriting that we've
talked about over the -- in the past 6 months and a little bit of -- in one terms, on the cat
side, a little bit of fortuity that is lower -- than slightly lower than average on the cat side
when you look at prior year development and current year.

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

On EUR1 to EUR1.4, yes.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

On the EUR1 to EUR1.4, the message is quite -- it's quite simple meaning that you
remember that we said that we would have a $500 million of synergies of which expense
synergies which represents $100 million. Let's say it's EUR260 million it -- in the ﬁrst half, I
mentioned that it was EUR50 million, so that means that we have EUR208 million and
EUR210 million to come.

And on top of this, think about the revenue synergies, so meaning that taking into
account of revenue synergies, plus the remaining signiﬁcant part of expense synergies
what is left, maybe just to make it simple EUR150 million. If it's EUR150 million, it means 1%
of loss ratio and taking into account, what was said above the price increase, I don't
believe that it will be extremely diﬃcult to achieve, that's why we are conﬁdent.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, thank you very much. It's quite notable that excluding XL, your attritional loss ratio is
really low versus history. Now some of that's luck and some of its technical pricing mix, I
just wondered --

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Yes, it skidded all over.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

It slightly double my number for 2H is what I want to know? Question one. So can you
give the guidance? And secondly, you know, similar kind of question for XL. We're used
to Commercial P&C insurers giving us a normalized combined ratio. So could you tell us
some of the pluses and minuses, we should take into account in Re and primary for XL. In
the ﬁrst half when we're thinking about, sort of, a normalized picture? Thanks.

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

So I would suggest we cut this answer in half. We ﬁrst let the very skilled CEOs of France
and Europe talk about how they have achieved this EUR93.3, because the main drivers is
coming from Europe. And then, Greg, you will talk about the AXA XL piece, and how the
loss ratios are developing there. Jacques, why don't you start?

A - Jacques de Peretti

{BIO 18970697 <GO>}

Thank you, Thomas. So for XL France we decreased the combined ratio in P&C by 3%, 3
points this year, down to 90.8%. And this decrease is made of three ingredients. First -one part is the decrease of the attritional losses that is because we are very, very
disciplined in underwriting and we don't go stepping, for example, the battle on the retail
world between banking insurer and mutual. That's the ﬁrst thing. The second, we have
had a nat cat charges that was lower than last year. And also, we had more favorable prior
year development in our losses. So we have a -- we consider that due to the expertise we
have in underwriting now, in Commercial line and in retail line, due to the transformation
of network with more digitalization, less cost, et cetera, et cetera, we are able to sustain
this sort of combined ratio for the next years.

Antimo, on the rest of Europe.

FINAL

A - Antimo Perretta

{BIO 18246589 <GO>}

Thank you very much. The answer is very similar. So we have only less loss ratios, and this
was also the main driver that increased our combined ratio. The second element we
increased the price in some business lines. And the third element was also a cost
discipline. So overall, I would say, good technical results and better underwriting with a
lot of innovation using data and logically also a better discipline in other costs. So that we
make a lot of conﬁdent that we can continue to improve our combined ratio in the couple
of next years.

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

And I think before we go to Greg, Farooq, I think it's important when you look at like-forlike, our prior year developments are in the guidance between 1.5% and 2.5%, but relative
to some of our competitors rather at the lower end than at the higher end when you look
at these numbers. Greg?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Greg Hendrick

{BIO 1649843 <GO>}

Farooq, I'll just give you the big leverage as I think about them. Gerald has already
touched on the expense synergies, right, that we did recognize some in the ﬁrst quarter,
but we expect those in nominal terms to accelerate. The second one of the positive is the
aforementioned rate increases. Although I would hesitate to quickly add -- sorry, I
wouldn't hesitate -- I will not hesitate to quickly add that those are going to earn in over
time, but they are accelerating, they are accelerating at a pretty good pace.
And cat, to say normalized cat, I will say, the half year was normal at expectation.
Obviously, in front of us is hurricane season and it's always earthquake season. So there's
no way for me to help you think about normalizing that. And the other piece to the
downside in the ﬁrst half of the year was the large loss, man-made large loss activity. That
was a bit of a drag on the ﬁrst half result. There is -- to Thomas' point, there's a lot of skill
on that, but there's also a amount of fortuity of what happens as we go from here.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Just one quick question. The man-made bit in the attritional loss ratio, how much was that
above? Is it a point or half point? What you'd roughly expect?

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

I look to Gerald.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

It's -- I would say that it's less than one point relative to the global loss ratio.

microphone, and then we move over.

FINAL

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Thank you. Jon Hocking, Morgan Stanley. Got three questions, please, on XL. Firstly, the
portfolio reshaping that you spoke about at the full-year and you mentioned it again
today, can you talk a little bit more in detail about that? And given what's happened with
the rate and the momentum there, is property cat something that actually you might think
about diving back into a little bit given what we know now we didn't know back in the end
of the year?
Secondly, the multi-year contract that you wrote, I think it came from Q1. Can you talk a
little about why you did that, given the rates are going up? And is that something that you
would do now with hindsight given the rate momentum we've seen year-to-date?
And then ﬁnally just like to say -- Greg, it's for you, and everybody I think in the industry is
very keen to say this isn't a hard market. What's your sort of best read in terms of what
needs to happen for this to become a hard market versus something that sort of a
rebalancing of pricing just peters out? What do we need to see some exogenous fact [ph]
to really drive pricing back into a hard cycle? Thank you.

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Greg, I guess, these are all for you.

A - Greg Hendrick

{BIO 1649843 <GO>}

Maybe I'll just come stand next to you.

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

You can stand straightaway.

A - Greg Hendrick

{BIO 1649843 <GO>}

So the portfolio reshaping, there's nothing that I would say that we've learned so far that
would change what we're trying to do, which is a little less short tail which comes with a
little more volatility and a little more long tail and then geographically a little more US
than international.
The cat piece, to be speciﬁc now, property catastrophe treaty reinsurance, so the large
book of excess loss business that we have. The reason it's down 7% is we really went hard
at 1/1 to try and move rate to try and get it closer to a level that we would ﬁnd acceptable
to come back and say, actually you know what, we are gaining a good return now, we
might want to talk collectively as a management to say we want to take more risk. It didn't
get anywhere near that. And so we cut the book heavily on 1/1. It was about a 1.5% rate
increase in that book at 1/1. It's now a 4% -- sorry, 6% rate increase at June and July 1,

FINAL

which is much better, but still a long way to go for what I would ever want to come and
see and have a conversation around I think AXA Group want to take more of that now.
We're just not there yet. So there's nothing in this movement that I've seen that makes us
think that the trajectory we're on should change.
The large account, it's multi-year. It's right in our sweet spot. It's what's called a global
program. So we needed to issue compliant policies in about 30 diﬀerent countries. It's
got a captive, which keeps the ﬁrst $12.5 million of each and every loss net. So that's a
gross premium ﬁgure that we have. The net written premium is lower. And we bought a
fair bit of reinsurance protection on so that what's left to us net in the end was something
that we were comfortable as AXA Group to retain.
Would I do that again? I would absolutely do that again. That is our core sweet spot that
has -- it was a strength of legacy XL. It was a strength of Corporate Solutions -- AXA
Corporate Solutions. It is the calling card of AXA XL. So we'd deﬁnitely do it again.

Bloomberg Transcript

And the third one was for me? Yeah. A hard -- so pricing is heading in the right direction
to actually if you went purely for the pricing component of this conversation, you would
say a few more points and we'd be going into a hard market pricing environment. To me,
the hard market really happens when you're dictating terms and conditions, when you're
making wholesale changes to the way the business is sold. We're not there yet. We're
doing things in certain classes that need to happen, because as an industry, the results
have been challenging, but we're not in that space yet of being able to say that at all in a
measurable fashion.
What would have to happen? I think continued -- it could be a continued drag on poor
under expectation, under hurdle rate returns, but more likely, classically, it's been some
kind of capital event that causes that to happen. You haven't seen a turn -- I haven't seen a
turn like this in 30-years of doing this hard without any capital destruction, eﬀectively. And
so I think some more tough years of results will keep the momentum going. That's why I'm
pretty positive about. This is not a one-year and done rate increases, certainly not for long
tail likes of business.

Thanks. It's Andy Sinclair from BofA Merrill. Just two for me. Firstly, apologies to go back
to AXA Equitable Holdings' stake. I just wanted to check, as I understand that you might
lose a bit of control when you go under 30%. I just want to know if there's any change in
strategy for your sale out of AXA Equitable Holdings once you go below 30%?
And secondly, well, just on AXA Life Europe, just wondered if you could give us an update
on the process there and when sale proceeds might be available for liquidity? Thanks.

A - Gerald Harlin

Yes. First of all, the change of control below 30%. So of course, we have some agreement,
and our rights will decrease, as long as we will decrease our shareholding. But from a
pure ﬁnancial point of view, there is nothing speciﬁc to mention. So that's for the ﬁrst
point. As far as AXA Life Europe is concerned, I could say that like this type of deal it's
subject to the approval of the supervisor. So it takes some time. I'm still optimistic on the
fact that it should take place in the second part of the year.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Thanks.

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Let's go to James.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks. It's James Shuck from Citi. I had three questions, please. On AXA XL, the
investment income EUR500 million on a EUR39 billion portfolio looks like annualized is
about 2.5% yield. Can you just talk a little bit about what derisking plans you have on the
investment portfolio? And directionally, which way that yield should trend over by the
included in the 2020 target for example?
Secondly, just focusing on France a little bit more obviously lower pack, so I don't think
you have a particularly strong presence in employee savings. Could you just talk a little bit
about your positioning with packs and the potential for Life & Savings products? Equally, I
think you launched a new motor product in France, but I can still see that the policy count
in personal motor was still outﬂow, so you're still losing market share. So what's going on
in that part, please?
And then ﬁnally, on the gearing levels, 25%, 28% is the target that you've talked about
and are being pretty insistent on getting to by the end of next year. Is it the bottom end of
that range? Would you consider doing buybacks in the midpoint of that range? Or do you
actually want to get to 25%? Thank you.

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

So Gerald, I would suggest you take the ﬁrst question. Jac, you take the second one on -of your part and MonAuto and maybe to -- Jacques, you should also talk about our
position in the employee saving markets, because it's actually the opposite. We are one of
the leaders in France. And then I'll take the last one on the gearing. Gerald?

FINAL

Okay. So 2.5%, keep in mind the fact that we went through PGAAP exercise, which means
that we mark-to-market the assets last year. And it means that we can expect, for sure, we
have a decline in the interest rates, but as far as -- I would say as far as AXA XL is
concerned, the decline should be less and, at the same time, the decline on the US dollar
is less severe than on the euro. So that said, I believe that as far as your question is what
about the next plan, we will see on the next plan. But anyway, we are still investing today
at rates, which are quite strong.
And keep in mind as well that the plus from XL -- for XL is that now we can diversify much
more our assets than what we did in the past. Roughly speaking, when you invest in -when we invest on the P&C company today, we invest, let's say, 80% in traditional ﬁxed
income, which is A, BBB, but at the same time we have 20% of alternatives. And these
alternative is a tilt which makes that in the end we can invest at a higher level. So this is
true for the rest of the group. This is true now for XL. The gearing?

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

You can do the gearing straightaway.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

No, it's up to you.

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. You can do it.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Okay. As far as the gearing is concerned, we have an objective of 25% to 28%. It will
completely depend at the pace at which we'll do the other sell down. You notice what
Thomas said. So it's zero intention to go to zero, meaning that if we would sell the totality
of XL by the end of 2020, we would be without any doubt at 25%.

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

And then let's quickly answer the second bit of your question, which was would you
consider share buybacks in the interim period between 25% and 28%. Again, we've
clearly stated that we have three priorities: integration of XL, sale of our Equitable and
reducing the debt gearing. And we are fully motivated and fully focused on implementing
those. And before we haven't implemented these, we are not thinking about anything
else. Jacques, La Pack [ph] and MonAuto?

A - Jacques de Peretti

{BIO 18970697 <GO>}

So in France, you are right. We have new La Pack in July, and this La Pack concerns the
retirement market and the objective is to encourage the development of the retirement
market. On this market, we are number one, both in group environment, but also in
individual environment. And we expect to take advantage of the change in order to
develop our business. This business is very proﬁtable, because the share of the unit links

Page 16 of 26



Company Name: AXA SA

Date: 2019-08-01

FINAL

is more than 50%. And with the new ease to underwrite this business, we will issue the
contract, the adaptive contract -- the adapted contract by October, and we will be the ﬁrst
insurer probably to be ready to take advantage of this change. And that is normal
because we are the largest one on this market.
Concerning MonAuto, you know, that concerning, let's say, the retail market, you know,
that in the past years, we didn't want to step in the battle between bank insurer and
mutual on this retail market. For bank insurer, it was, let's say, a new product in order to
oﬀset the decrease of the margin on the retail banking business. For mutual, it was, let's
say, the diﬀerence of their core business. For us, it was not that position. We prefer to
privilege the proﬁtability. It's why we, in the past three years, we regularly increased the
proﬁtability of our retail business down to 90% now in term of combined ratio.
And now we consider that the pressure is less important than it used to be. That means
that we -- thanks to the work we have made during this time on the transformation of
network ﬁrst. And we decide to take two initiative this year. First, the launch of two
products, one on called (inaudible) on car -- on motor called MonAuto leveraging the
experience of direct insurance in sophistication of pricing.

Bloomberg Transcript

And secondly, we decide to improve drastically the quality of service we deserve to our
customer. Thanks to these two initiatives, we will regain market share, and for example, for
the ﬁrst half of the year, our net -- our negative net contract in MonAuto that last year was
at that time of the year 41,000 contract is now only 4,000 contract. Let's say that we are
nearly at close to 20, and we aim next year to regain market share.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Thank you, Jacques.

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

You can keep it. Let's go to Johnny.

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi, it's Johnny Vo from Goldman Sachs. Just three questions. First question, I guess,
is on PYD. You mentioned that you're towards the lower end of your range of 1.5% to
2.5%, but I guess the diﬀerence is that you've got XL in the business now, and therefore,
by deﬁnition, you've said before that XL itself won't be releasing so much reserves and it
was relatively marginal for this half. So is it feasible to expect the PYD to move much more
than where it is? Or are you really at a reasonable level, particularly given like France for at
least quite a lot? That's the ﬁrst question.
The second question is just in relation to capital generation and the low interest rate
environment. Obviously, it's having an impact. Is this or can this have an impact on
remittances of the group overall?

Page 17 of 26



Company Name: AXA SA

And the ﬁnal question is just in relation to the AXA Investment Management. Obviously,
it's a tough environment, as you've highlighted, very diﬃcult. What are you doing
operationally or strategically within that business to potentially have a turnaround there?
Thank you.

FINAL

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Very good. Thank you very much. I suggest Gerald, you take the ﬁrst two questions, the
one on PYD, lower range -- lower end of the range, what does XL mean and the second
one capital generation versus low interest. And since Alban will soon be responsible for
the whole investment, including AXA IM, we'll ask him afterwards on what operationally
will be done in AXA IM.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So as far as the -- I believe that -- I encourage you to go to Page B33. I don't want you,
Johnny, to ﬂip too much pages. But I believe it's quite interesting to see the evolution.
You remember that when we moved from 1% to 2% to 1.5% to 2.5% at the group level, we
said that it was justiﬁed by the fact that we had a level of reserves -- of reserving ratio,
which was pretty high. And look at the situation today, it's even more relevant. So that's
why I believe that you can consider that at the group level, the 1.5% to 2.5% could be
used, including for the totality of the Group, even if you have signiﬁcant diﬀerences from
one country to another. You remember Johnny that I mentioned last time that taking into
account when I commented in November on the PGAAP of XL, that you could not
expand, you should not expand in the foreseeable future any release. That's still true. But
nevertheless, at the Group level, the comment of the 1.5% to 2.5% is still relevant.
Your second question was about capital generation in a low interest rate environment.
First of all, I believe that the way I see it, the way I see it is that on the local Solvency
position so long as we are pretty well matched, I don't believe that there are so much
constraints. On the life side, so the key question won't be so much on the life side,
because the margin as I said on the life side, we should keep a strong level of margin,
especially on the spread business. It's much more a problem on the -- it could be a
problem on the P&C side. But taking it into account the obvious improvement on the
technical side, I don't have any speciﬁc fear as far as remittance is concerned.

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

When you say matched on the life side, are you seeing matched assets to the UFR or
matched assets economically?

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

No. I mean matching assets to the liabilities from an economic point of view. So that's
mostly it.

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

And when you think about the shift of the earnings mix, ﬁnancial risk versus technical risk,
obviously, we've moved away quite signiﬁcantly from some of these questionable faces.

Alban, on AXA IM.

FINAL

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

So on AXA IM, we really have two businesses, one which is a traditional institution
business, which, as you know, is being commoditized globally. So what you do is what you
would expect, which is to work on the simpliﬁcation of the structure and the reduction of
our expenses in order to be -- to oﬀset the pressure that we have on fees.
And then we have a very strong position on the second part of the business, which is
about alternatives, so real assets and structured credit, and we want to go full steam on
that one where the margins are much higher. So it's really as you would see in the
business, which is commoditized on one hand and high value added on the other hand.

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Let's move on. I can't see.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. Three questions, please. Firstly, sorry to make Greg
stand up again. But on XL, you reported a 26.3% expense ratio in the ﬁrst half for this year
and obviously there's a lot of restructuring costs to come. When you knock those oﬀ, you
get to a pretty low number. So I'm just wondering if that's sustainable. And I guess also
given that the EUR1.4 billion was set before pricing, upward pressure has been more than
you anticipated at that time, should we think about the EUR1.4 billion actually is probably
being pretty conservative given the developments you've seen to-date?
And then two quick numbers questions, please. Firstly, on the slide where we were just on
actually, I hope I wasn't asleep just now and you didn't mention it, Gerald, but would you
be able to give us the reserving ratio excluding XL just so we got the like-for-like
development?
And then ﬁnally, on the reinvestment yield, you give that overall, is it possible to split it life
and non-life? And if we had at the end of the period rather than across it, that would be
very helpful as well. Thank you.

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Good. Greg is used to standing up, and he'll certainly answer to your question, but
because he'll be too humble to talk about the EUR1.4 billion, the EUR1.4 billion will stay
the EUR1.4 billion. Greg?

A - Greg Hendrick

{BIO 1649843 <GO>}

Thank you for that, Thomas. Yes. And on the expense ratio side, yes, it helps a little bit, but
the focus of all the eﬀorts is very much on ﬁnishing up integration. We fortunately now
gone through what's called the consultation period in all the core European countries. So

Page 19 of 26

FINAL

we're able to really execute hard on the last bit of people leadership announcements and
get going on that point. And then we've got a plan to deliver that all the way through.
I'd say if anything, we've been holding back collectively at AXA XL and any kind of real
hiring other than a few core positions to make sure we got through that process in a fair
way. And so there's a clear little bit of a balance against the run rate at this point. It would
be a little bit harder when you would normalize for some of those positions that we didn't
hire just because we're going to get to through consultation, but the expense synergies
are on track. That ratio should play through.

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Thank you, Greg. And then, Gerald, on the two items, reserving ratio excluding XL and
reinvestment yield, life, non-life.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. So the reserving ratio excluding XL would be at 218%, meaning that it would be up,
compared with 213% that was level of reserving ratio, both half year '18 and full-year '18.
Then your question, Peter, on the reinvestment yield, I would say that it's not so easy to
answer. The way I would answer it is as you know that have a diﬀerence in terms of
duration, so the duration in life is more something like nine years where it's ﬁve years on
the P&C side. So -- but at the same time, on the P&C side, we have a bit more ﬂexibility, as
I said before, in terms of diversiﬁcation in alternatives. So that's what I can tell you.
So the reinvestment for the time being -- the reinvestment we could say that, as we said,
in US dollars, if it's roughly $2.5 for P&C and if it's around EUR1.5 on euros -- $2.54 in P&C,
roughly EUR1.54 in P&C, it would be slightly higher in life. But I don't believe that the
diﬀerence will be so important. And I remind you on top that in life for signiﬁcant part of
our reserves in life, it's a spread business. So as long as it's the spread business, it's not
the absolute number, which counts, but much more the guaranteed rate. And you have all
the details in the appendices on the guaranteed rate. And as you can notice, roughly
speaking across the Board guaranteed rate over the ﬁrst half dropped by 20 basis points.
So that's what I can tell you about the reinvestment rate.

Good. Let's move on. Yes. Oliver?

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Oliver Steel, Deutsche Bank. Two questions. I mean, I think, what one of the things that
stands out from these results is just how well the original AXA is doing. And I remember
one of my competitors asking about a year ago whether we should be expecting a tick up
in the progress of your ﬁve-year plan. And I think the answer at the time was to play it
down, but equally, we are seeing an improvement, quite a sharp improvement coming
through both in P&C and in Protection and in Health. In Protection you're actually now
beating your own targets, and in fact, in P&C you're beating your own targets. As Farooq
put -- but it is -- is that just luck or actually can you continue to improve on the results that
you've seen today? So that's question one.

Second one is a bit shorter, which is the 12 points improvement in the Solvency ratio in the
ﬁrst half from operational delivery, how much of that is sort of genuine underlying
operational delivery? And is there anything exceptional in that?

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Good. I suggest -- thank you, Oliver. I'll take the ﬁrst question and then Gerald will do the
second one. I repeat, again, what I said to Farooq earlier. These numbers are not luck;
these numbers are skill. And certainly, those two gentlemen and their colleagues amongst
others have worked extremely hard to get there. And when I look at them they are
continuously willing and motivated to even further improve. We set in our Ambition 2020
that we want to aim at an underlying earnings per share improvement between 3% and
7% over the cycle between 2016 and 2020. And we are, as you've seen on the full-year,
but also now, well on this journey. If I take your words, Oliver, old AXA is working well, but
new AXA is also working well. So we are reaﬃrming our targets of Ambition 2020,
because again, we will measure at the end of the period where we are.
Today, we can see that we are still fully in line in this range that we've given to ourselves,
3% to 7%, depending on the development of capital markets. And so we will stick to that
because, as you have heard earlier, there is also question on how do the capital markets
evolve? And we started with low interest rates in 2016. It improved slightly, and we are
rolling back into low interest rates, and therefore, for us, it's very clear. We do everything
we can to do operationally better every time. 5% increase in underlying performance is
quite tough, and it makes me very proud to see that these two gentlemen with their
colleagues have achieved it. They're willing to continue all the eﬀorts to do the same,
again, but again, we have what is in our hands and we have what is not in our hands, and
therefore, we want to stick to what we said in June 2016. Gerald, the second question.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Yes, Oliver. So we had indeed a strong 12% operating return in the ﬁrst half, which was
slightly higher than the 15 to 20 points annual guidance that we gave you. The diﬀerence
is due to -- we had some favorable operating variance in the ﬁrst half. It's a couple of
points, notably from France and from Switzerland and could be -- it is partially explained
by the fact that what I explained before. That means that we have strong reserving
position, as you know, and our Solvency II, we are using BEL, best estimate liabilities, so
this explains also why we had some positive operational values.

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

I'm sorry. I can't see. Let's just move one row back, the light is -- to the other side exactly.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hi, thank you. It's William Hawkins from KBW. Gerald, just coming back to couple of your
answers, just the 12 percentage point increase in the Solvency II ratio from operating
items, can you tell us how much of that came from own funds and how much gain from
the SCR, please?

And then secondly, could you add a bit more color in terms of what you -- the slide you
just referred us to for the life investment margin, there's been a small drift, as you
highlighted. Could you maybe give us a bit more color about what's driving that small
drift in terms -- obviously, yields are going to the big negative, but then crediting rates not
guarantees and business mix may be oﬀsetting that. And I'm just trying to get clear my
mind how those moving parts are working?
And then to the extent the guidance for next year is between EUR55 billion and EUR65
billion. EUR65 billion is almost no change, EUR55 billion is a massive change. So can you
just give us a little bit more color on how you think that ﬁgure is drifting from here? Thank
you.

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Gerald, three questions for you.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Yes. Okay. Two questions. So the ﬁrst one is on the funds 5%. So we have -- most of it I
believe -- do we have -- we should have a detail on this.

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

But yes -- because the way we are managing it makes that it's mostly from the AFR. You
can see it -- look at the shareholders' equity, so there is a direct link between what I said
on the shareholders' equity and the AFR. So it's mostly it, but -- yes. And the SCR, we try
to monitor the SCR so that we limit it part of our risk appetite. The EUR55 billion, EUR65
billion and --

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Can I just ask you just directionally, I guess, you're operationally gone down or up in the
ﬁrst half?

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Alban, why don't you -- I mean, you've got the details? Do you want to come here?

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

But I think it's on the slide itself, the SCR has slightly gone up as you see, the required
capital, from 30.2% to 30.5%.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Yes, I'm sorry, I mean just from the operating items, presumably markets have taken the
SCR up.

return comes from the development of the AFR.

FINAL

Thank you, Alban. Gerald on the --

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Yes. On the EUR55 billion to EUR65 billion, I believe that we are above EUR65 billion.
We'll go and that's unavoidable between EUR55 billion and EUR65 billion, but I would say
that it should be normally at a relatively low pace. Why? For the reasons I just explained
before. And I could comment, but I believe that you have all the elements in the
document. And notably, in the appendix, you will see that, as I said before, the
guaranteed rates are going down as well. So that's why we can expect that it will go
down, but at a relatively slow pace.

A - Thomas Buberl

Andrew?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Yes. Andrew Crean at Autonomous. Couple of questions. Actually following up on that
one, when you set that EUR55 billion, EUR65 billion, the EUR55 billion was the interest
rates now are below where you set them. So if you're going to come in higher than that, it
must mean essentially what you're oﬀering the customer is less than what you've planned.
I suppose a general question. How do you -- what is customer proposition when
investment rates are 1.5% in Europe? What does the customer get from that?
And then second question. Before you did the AXL deal, you were quite focused on
acquiring in health protection and SME commercial. I'm not sure, XL ﬁts into SME
commercial too easily. If you do still have plans in those areas, do you think you will
execute them organically some of the examples you gave in the health market? Or do you
think that it'll have to be more M&A?

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, Andrew, for the two questions. For the ﬁrst one, I would like to, Jac, may
be to -- that we'll give the answer together because you are confronted to this question of
what do we do in the low rate environment. And since France is a very, very strong Unit
Linked markets, they've sort very well about it what is the best proposition. And just in
general, it is absolutely true that in a market where interest rates are very low, you need to
fundamentally rethink what is the right balance between risk and upside. And certainly
most of our markets have drifted more in the space of capital-light instruments where you
have on a long duration a more Unit Linked proposition with a limited guarantee. And
when I talk about guarantee, more about capital production, but where there's also much
higher upside. And Jac, if you could give some examples of what you have done with real
estate, with private equity as very innovative propositions in France.

A - Jacques de Peretti

{BIO 18970697 <GO>}

Yes. As you know, we have developed in the past years, let's say, renewal of proposition
to our client because we are facing this regular decrease of the yields. And what we have
to sell to them is something on one side, which guaranteed, let's say, a part of their
investment, but on the other side, which permits them to get opportunities. And on unitlinked for example, we developed successively -- in the year 2008, we developed what
we called (inaudible) which is not now something we can develop because of the low
interest, but that was the sort of promise of -- at the same time, let's say, guaranteeing
their capital, but giving some upside, that was unit-linked.
We are the ﬁrst one in the French market to develop it. And in the years 2011 or '12, we
developed unit-linked on real estate. We are one of the largest player in France, and that
is something very interesting because our people believe in real estate. They trust real
estate, our customers, and we can make some package very interesting and we reach
large success. And now we are working on unit-linked on infrastructure, that's something
also very interest.

Bloomberg Transcript

And with all these initiatives, ﬁrst, secondly was the training of our people taking into
account the proﬁle of our clients and also the duration of their investment. And thanks to
Robert also to be, let's say, regular with, what I call, the duty of advice because we -- that's
very important. We are able to develop regularly, if you look on the long period, the part
of unit-linked in our investment for our customers.
On the other side also, we -- on the marketing side, it's true that we privilege the
customers that are ready to take some risk, and we don't look especially to those who
want, let's say, guarantee and only guarantee. That's also our marketing policy. All that
together that permitted us to develop our business, to develop our proﬁtability on a
regular manner. And we have also very prudent reserving in order to face, let's say, longer
period of low interest rate, but to give at the same time again, again as we say in France
contract to our clients. So it's something we have managed in the past, and we will
continue to manage. And we are not -- we trust in the future. We are very, very conﬁdent.

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Thank you, Jacques. Let's maybe take another example from Asia. Etienne Bouas-Laurent,
who will succeed Gerald Harlin is still currently the CEO of Hong Kong. As you've seen,
the numbers in Hong Kong have moved very well and the Asian proposition is a very
diﬀerent one to the French. So what you can tell us?

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Yes. So ﬁrst of all, there was a change in regulation called the N15 [ph] some years ago,
which prevented the unit-linked business called ELAS in Hong Kong to work eﬃciently,
because the distribution had no means to be remunerated. And we have started, a few
months ago, reinitiated a strong lobbying to the government and the regulator to favor
the unit-linked business again in this context of decreasing interest rates. First point.

Second point. We tended to lose market share in the past in Hong Kong because it had
become, again a general comp market. So what we have done over the recent months is
to revamp completely our product range and to refocus our products on participating
products. We have much lower level of guarantees and a higher level of beneﬁts
illustration, and you can do that through slightly more aggressive asset allocation. So the
NBV margin is slightly higher. The risk is lower, and this is what -- this is this product is
kind of product which explains that AXA in Hong Kong is regaining market share, is
increasing its agency force again.

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Etienne. And Andrew, to your second question, which was around acquisitions
Health and Protection SME, our strategy is very clear. We want to focus ourselves on risks
that are less focused on ﬁnancial market risks, so-called technical risks Health and
Protection and the commercial space from SME to reinsurance. We have made a
signiﬁcant shift over the last couple of years in this regard. I've just mentioned earlier that
if we are ready exclude the remaining ownership of AXA Equitable, we are at 82% of our
earnings coming from those technical risks. So the additional journey to go is getting
harder and not that much anymore. We will certainly continue to focus our organic eﬀorts
in growing signiﬁcantly higher in the preferred segments, which we have seen
consistently in every presentation that we have given.
Nevertheless, we will also always have a look at opportunities in those spaces where we
still have wide spaces. You have certainly seen that with the ﬁle of AXA Tianping where we
have bought the remaining 50% of our P&C operations in China. Nevertheless, I would
like to remind you that we are really focused on our three priorities, integration of XL,
deleveraging and reducing our stake in AXA Equitable, which should not distract us -- we
should not be distracted. So we have to manage this in a good balance.
I guess, we need to go back to the questions that might be in the webcast, Louis?

Operator
Yes. There's one question on the webcast from Rahul Parekh from JPMorgan. He says,
given declining interest rates, how are you looking at money allocation in alternative
assets and real estate? Do you have any speciﬁc targets there?

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Very good. Gerald, you can easily answer that question.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

No problem to answer the question. I believe that I covered this point already. I said that
today, we aim at -- we have, roughly speaking, including real estate, EUR100 billion, which
are investing in alternatives. But including real estate, we want to increase it progressively
maybe by EUR10 million -- EUR10 billion more to give you a ﬂavor per year.

And roughly speaking, again, it means that we will invest 80% in ﬁxed income and 20% in
a mix of alternatives. What is important for us is to captures these premiums on
alternatives. We can aﬀord it because it's premium corresponding to liquidity. It doesn't
mean that we will take much risk in term of taking, I would say, much non-investment
grade risk, not at all. But exactly on the way Jac explained that for our own policyholders,
we try to capture the premium from infrastructure, from private equity and so on. That
exactly what we try to do and to adapt depending on the diﬀerent portfolios.
So in a nutshell, yes, we will increase, but progressively because again, our job is still to
match assets and liabilities. So it can be a part, but marginal part, and we focus much
more on alternative credit.
