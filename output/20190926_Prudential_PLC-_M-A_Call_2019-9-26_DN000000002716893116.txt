Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today for the Investor and Analyst
Conference Call. We will now go live into the venue. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Well, thank you for joining us everyone. I'm Mike Wells, I'm Group Chief Executive of
Prudential. And today, I'm joined by Mark FitzPatrick, CFO and COO, and also here to take
your questions are Nic Nicandrou, CEO of our Asian businesses, and Michael Falcon, who
leads Jackson, our US business.
Yesterday, we were pleased to confirm the timetables for the demerger of the M&G
business. Subject to shareholder approval, trading in M&G plc shares will begin on
October 21, a little less than four weeks from now. Yesterday, we also published the M&G
perspective and the circular for Prudential. You'll be able to hear John Foley and his team
summarize the M&G story tomorrow. What we've done for you today is to bestow the
Prudential circular and do a short presentation highlighting our particular strengths and
clear-sighted strategy. Mark and I will talk to some of the key points and then we'll be
happy to take your questions.

FINAL

The demerger will benefit both the businesses in a variety of ways. To sum up the
rationale, it's about two things. It's about alignment and it's about focus. The demerger
will help both businesses become more closely aligned to the interest of our
stakeholders, that's our customers, our regulators and of course, you, our shareholders,
and the demerger will sharpen the focus of both businesses. Management will be able to
focus more closely on improving operational outcomes. And as separate groups, I
believe, we'll be able to allocate capital even more effectively.
There are four core principles that will drive the way we manage the Group. One, we will
continue to grow Asia profitably. Two, we will enhance Jackson's ability to generate cash.
Three, we will continue to be active managers of the Group's portfolio and to allocate
capital with discipline. Four, we will build long-term shareholder value and pay progressive
dividends.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have a global portfolio of businesses, each of which is executing on meeting a large
and growing consumer need. In Asia, the growing middle-class needs to save more to
protect themselves from ill health. In the United States, the growing aging population
needs more access to secure retirement income. And we are operating in markets in
Africa, the total population of almost 400 million people.
Each of our businesses have leadership positions in their chosen segments or in the case
of Africa, are expected to become leaders in the near future. While our portfolio is
diversified across three continents, to be clear, this is an Asian-led group and over time it
will become even more so. Over 60% of our embedded value be in Asia. And Asia has
the largest portion of the world's population and almost all the new entrants in the global
middle class. Asia is also where there is a largest unmet need for financial protection and
long-term saving services we continually provide. And the penetration rates on the right
side of the slide are a good proxy for this. Asia is where we see strong community
support for what we do. There is recognition among policyholders who are an essential
element of the broader social safety net and Asia is where we see the fastest technology
innovation. This is aimed at improving efficiency and scalability as well as expanding the
market, again by improving distribution and creating unique product categories, and
unique customer experience. And this is where we see the most attractive investment
opportunities for your money.
I've talked about the Asian opportunity. I want to say a few words about our capability.
First, we have breadth. This is a portfolio of 14 different markets, all of which have
structural growth. We have depth. We do protection, health, savings and asset
management. And our customers range from high net worth individuals in affluent cities
and marketplaces to people in emerging markets buying their first-ever financial product.
In China, for example, we are now in 20 provinces and 89 cities, giving us access to
regions with about 80% of the country's GDP. And we distribute these services through
multiple channels.
We have scale. Three businesses produce over GBP300 million and five more generate in
excess of GBP100 million. We are innovating at scale. Pulse, our new digital health app is
not unique just in the diverse services it offers, but also in its pan regional size and its
ambition. Our brand and our digital capabilities are making us an attractive partner, for

example, with OVO, Indonesia's largest digital payment technology platform. And finally,
we have a strong growth-oriented and disciplined management team.
In the United States, we have a very strong business. It's a leader in variable annuities,
delivering a great return on equity and consistently producing large quantities of cash for
the Group. As we've said, at the half year, we can further improve the cash generation
power of Jackson and its remittances through diversifying our product mix. We look to do
this both organically and inorganically. Organically, Jackson is creating new products to
build its position in fixed index and fixed annuity markets. More than 30% of the sales in
the first half of the year were from products other than variable annuities.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the inorganic side, we had a strong record here in bolt-ons, most recently buying the
book from John Hancock, and we've proven capability and advantages in this area. As we
said last month, in funding this diversification, we are open to a third-party financing and
reinsurance, and to be clear what this means, it's our intention that diversification in the US
will be achieved without the Group investing additional capital. Jackson is a good
business, which we can improve to drive greater shareholder value. We have clear
objectives here and we're executing on.
Over the past few years, while growing profitability and investing for future growth, we've
also exited countries, withdrawn from product lines, and sold businesses. This slide sets
out just some of the highlights. We have always been active approaching the
management of the full portfolio across the Group. To be clear, nothing is off limits. And
the demerger of M&G is merely the largest transaction and a continuing craft to optimize
the shape of the Group. The result has been an increasing focus on the most attractive
opportunities in Asia.
The stats on the right-hand side of the slide show in Asia over the past decade, we've
now invested GBP3.6 billion in running new business. This has supported delivery of
GBP8.4 billion of high quality revenue. And this has contributed to an average operating
return of just under 30% on IFRS equity. This active approach to the portfolio
management and capital allocation will continue. Everything we do is geared toward
creating long-term shareholder value. That means, aiming to deliver profitable growth
throughout the cycle and I've spoken about the focus on structural growth opportunities,
our investment in new capabilities and new distribution and again, our disciplined
approach to portfolio management.
A final key element is the focus on resilient, high quality earnings. In Asia, more than 80%
of the operating income comes from insurance margin and light fees. The proportion of
our sales to this regular premium is 93% in Asia, and our customer retention rates in the
region are well over 90%. What sits behind these impressive metrics is a unique mix of
skills and distribution, customer service, risk management, and investment management.
There's also about deep and trusted relationships with consumers, governments,
regulators and business partners, some of which date back almost a century. These
attributes combined to create a highly sustainable competitive advantage.

FINAL

I'm extremely proud of this Group's track record. Compounded annual growth across all
key metrics over the past decades are well into the teens. Few other businesses of our
size can put up a chart like this. What drove our performance in these decades at a
structural opportunity, quality income, disciplined capital allocation will continue to drive us
through the next decade and beyond.
We have an opportunity to further accelerate our performance. We are now better than
ever with innovation. We are better developing partnerships, including with the world's
best technology players. We're better at applying best practices quickly across the Group.
This allows us to scale up even faster the pace. We have a culture that's more passionate
than ever about improving the customer experience and delivering positive growth. I'm
confident that for Prudential the best is yet to come.
I'd now like to hand it over to Mark, who can talk about the metrics, dividends and our
disciplined capital allocation. Mark.

Thank you, Mike. Over the next few minutes, I want to cover off two main areas. Firstly, the
key financial metrics of Prudential plc post demerger, covering Asia and the US, and
secondly, our approach to capital management. And as part of this, I'll take you through
our new dividend policy.
But before I get into those elements, for anyone who is new to us, a brief financial profile
of Prudential plc post demerger. By any measure, we are a growing business with scale
and strength. 2018 for the Asia and US businesses combined, our new sales were GBP5.3
billion and our new business profit GBP3.5 billion, with the lion's share of our new sales
and new business profits driven by our Asia business.
In the first half of this year, our Asia businesses grew both new sales and new business
profits by 10% on a constant currency basis. This geographic weighting is reflected in our
EEV operating profit before central expenses, which in 2018 was GBP6.7 billion, of which
GBP4.5 billion is in Asia. On a similar basis, 2018 IFRS pre-tax operating profit was GBP4.1
billion, of which Asia was GBP2.2 billion.
At the end of June, on a pro forma basis, our Group IFRS equity was GBP14.5 billion and
on an EEV basis, GBP43 billion. Our pro forma core structural borrowings are GBP4.4
billion. And finally, we are strongly capitalized. On the basis of the LCSM measure that will
apply post demerger, our cover ratio, again on a pro forma and June basis was 338% with
a surplus of GBP7.6 billion. Although interest rates have fallen since June, our estimated
LCSM ratio remains healthy and resilient. To help you better navigate LCSM, we will
provide you with the sensitivities with our financial year '19 results.
So having given you that brief overview of our new financial profile, let's get started on
our key financial metrics. For Asia, this is to continue to focus on generating high quality
growth, driven particularly by regular premium health and protection business, which
grows embedded value over the longer term. As you have heard from Mike, the objective
Page 4 of 20

FINAL

for Jackson is clear; grow statutory capital, to grow remittances. At Group, we are focused
on capital management. Allocating capital to create long-term value and overseeing an
appropriate return on that capital, including disciplined focus on central expenses and
managing central liquidity. And outworking at this is our new dividend policy, which I will run
through shortly.
So how do we do this? Let's dive into this in a little more detail. As I think about our Asia
business, I see that we are well positioned in growth markets. We have a track record of
strong growth and continue to see a very significant opportunity ahead of us. We are
focused on selling high quality business with over 80% of our operating income coming
from insurance margins and life fee income, which are relatively less correlated to market
conditions. 93% of our new business sales are regular premium business, and we have
around a 95% retention rate, thereby compounding earnings and creating long-term
value.

Bloomberg Transcript

PCA's first half 2019 performance evidenced the strength of our strategic and operational
delivery. Now, to bring this up-to-date, our year-to-date sales, excluding Hong Kong, to
the end of August saw broad-based double-digit growth. Hong Kong's first half domestic
sales growth momentum has continued, notwithstanding the sector wide slowdown of
sales to Mainland China customers. Overall PCA new business sales continued to grow
year-to-date.
I also want to point out the strong and growing profit contribution of our Eastspring asset
management business, which you can see in the gray on the chart on the right-hand side.
In the two-month period since the half year, Eastspring has maintained its positive
momentum in both net inflows and fund. Eastspring is an important strategic asset as well
as a source of differentiation compared with many of our competitors. Our high-quality
new business creates long-term value as evidenced through our sustained growth and
embedded value. Over the five-year period to 2018, new business profits increased by a
CAGR of 19% and contributed to a combined increase in embedded value of GBP10.9
billion as at the end of June this year. This powers the nearly three-fold increase in
embedded value for the life business since 2013 to GBP27.1 billion at the half year.
Our embedded value messaged us because it is a present value to shareholders of the
future cash flows that would emerge from our in-force life businesses over time. This,
combined with the release of capital requirements as the in-force business matures,
creates free surplus. And it's this free surplus, which provides a capital to write new
business, fund inorganic investments, and support remittances. As you can see on the
right-hand chart, operating free surplus generation from our Asia asset management and
in-force life business has been building steadily and remittances have increased broadly in
line with this over time.
Moving on to Jackson, I'd simply like to emphasize its long track record of resilient capital
generation. Since 2012, Jackson's cumulative remittance totaled $4.4 billion and you will
have seen that it delivered $525 million to the Group in the first half of this year. Jackson's
sales trends in the third quarter show a higher mix of FIA, continuing the trend seen in the
first half of 2019. And for fixed annuities, sales have increased following new product
introductions. The third quarter VA sales are exhibiting similar trends to those at the half

FINAL

year, reflecting the industry-wide slowdown with monthly sales continuing at broadly the
same levels seen in the first half. So to sum up, the Group continues to focus on high
quality Asia-led growth, measured through increasing embedded value and growing free
surplus generation over the long term.
Now moving on to the second part of my session, one of the key strengths of this Group
has been the disciplined approach to capital allocation, and this rigor will continue after
the demerger, our capital management priority to drive profitable growth in Asia. So let
me take you through the steps we used in the framework.
Firstly, capital is allocated to prioritize profitable organic growth. The key performance
metrics we use to drive this are new business profit, i.e., shareholder value created by
writing new business and investments in new business, i.e., the shareholder capital
required to support this new business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, inorganic growth. Given our size and scale, we get to see just about all the
inorganic opportunities in our markets, but we're very disciplined about how we use our
capital. These are assessed by reference to expected shareholder returns and payback
periods relative to risk-adjusted hurdle rates, which is set centrally. The assessment also
considers a range of other factors. These include a strategic rationale for the investment,
the extent to diversification with existing risks and our experience in managing similar
businesses. Assessment of these opportunities is also reviewed and approved centrally
within the Prudential Group's governance framework in order to maintain a rigorous
approach to capital allocation.
Thirdly, we want to retain a resilient balance sheet and associated local and Group capital
and liquidity position. As we previously flagged, under the new Hong Kong Insurance
Authority-led regime, our regulatory Pillar 1 capital will be the Local Capital Summation
Method, rather than Solvency II.
And the final element is how we view dividend. Firstly, we have set out our expectations
for the combined 2019 dividend across both Prudential plc and M&G plc, which subject to
financial performance and market conditions are expected to total 51.82p per share. This
represents a 5% increase on the 2018 dividend of 49.35p per share and is equivalent to a
total cost of GBP1.345 billion across the two groups. Of this amount, around GBP425
million represents the first interim dividend already declared in August 2019. Around
GBP510 million is expected to be paid from Prudential plc and GBP410 million from M&G
plc in May 2020. Now please bear in mind that the GBP510 million expected Prudential
plc's second interim dividend will be declared in US dollars and paid in May 2020. This will
be translated into US dollars, using the 2019 year-end exchange rate. Of the GBP1.345
billion total 2019 dividends, GBP750 million represents the total 2019 contribution of the
post-demerger Prudential Group to which our new dividend policy will apply going
forward.
Secondly, we have set out the new progressive dividend policy for Prudential plc, which
applies from this level, albeit future dividends for Prudential plc will be declared in US
dollars. And applying this progressive dividend policy, the Board will consider a range of

Page 6 of 20

FINAL

factors, looking to the medium term and beyond, including capital generation capacity,
financial prospects and investment opportunities as well as market conditions.
Over the medium term, we would expect future central outflows to be covered by
remittances from business units. These central outflows include dividend, debt interest
costs and other central expenses, which encompasses central payments for
bancassurance distribution agreements and restructuring costs, net of tax recoverables.
So in calibrating your forecast, you should consider the scope of our Asia and US
businesses to grow their capital generation, which over time will govern their respective
remittance capacity. We discussed Asia's record of OFSG and remittance growth a
moment ago and in respect of our US business, Jackson has paid the Group a 2019
remittance of $525 million and we expect over time a strategy of diversification to
enhance cash generation.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to central outflows, the table here follows our holding company cash flow
disclosure. The central outflows reflect the Group's current pre-demerger structure. There
were four key points to bear in mind going forward over the medium term. They are, one,
net interest paid and at post-demerger our annual interest costs on our pro forma core
structural debt is expected to be around GBP230 million. Two, on corporate activities, the
historic numbers here reflect the Group's current structure. Post demerger, we expect
these costs to reflect our new footprint with two major business units, not three.
Note that unlike IFRS reporting, our central corporate expenditure, the holding company
cash flow does not include the cost of our Asia regional office. Those cash costs are really
net off against the Asia remittance. You may also have seen from the circular that the
M&G group expects head office and group function costs in the range of GBP80 million to
GBP100 million per annum. In the short term, we expect to incur restructuring costs to
align our corporate overhead with our new footprint. We will provide more details on this
in due course.
Three, on tax received, after the demerger completes, we will no longer generate profits
in the UK, but with the London head office, we will continue to incur some costs in the UK,
including interest on Group debt. Post-demerger, the absolute level of holdco tax benefit
is expected to materially reduce. Over time, this is expected to be partially mitigated by
changes to the Group operating model.
And finally, four, other movements. This line includes a number of components, which vary
from period to period. And if you double the half year '18 level you see here, that is more
indicative of the annual run rate we would expect over the medium term for 2020 before
one-off effects.
Summary to conclude the section, our capital management policy supports our approach
of active capital allocation across the Group to create long-term value. So, to sum up,
looking forward, post-demerger from a financial perspective, we have a proven powerful
Asia life and asset management business, and our priority is to drive its growth, with
embedded value development, a key measure of this. We have a successful and
profitable US business in Jackson and a clear strategy. Growth in statutory capital

FINAL

generation and remittances is our priority. The capital management framework I outlined,
which is very much a continuation of our long established and, I think, successful approach
supports these objectives and our progressive dividend policy. And finally, to repeat
Mike's message, we have a long record of -- as active allocators of our shareholders'
capital. We aim to grow long-term value. The long successful record across measures of
growth, earnings, and cash that you see here is powerful evidence of this.
I will now hand you back to Mike.

Mike Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Thank you, Mark. So again just to reiterate, Asia-led, focus on structural growth markets,
look to Jackson to enhance its cash generation through participation in the world for its
retirement market, stay an active manager of the portfolio and develop long-term
shareholder value, underpinned by a progressive dividend policy. So again we think highly
compelling.
I'm going to hand it over to Patrick now, our Head of Investor Relations to give you a quick
briefing on the timeline for the demerger. If you would please, Patrick.

Thank you, Mike. So on to the next steps in the demerger, with the circular on M&G
perspective published yesterday, we have the M&G investor and analyst presentation
tomorrow, Friday, at 10:00 a.m. UK time on 27th September. There is a detailed timetable
in the circular with significant dates being the General Meeting on the 15th of October,
2019 and the listing of M&G expected on Monday the 21st of October, 2019. This is in line
with our earlier guidance for Q4 completion. To remind you, the qualifying shareholders
will be entitled to receive one M&G share for each Prudential share held by them at the
applicable record time. Our tickers will remain unchanged and are shown on this slide. The
demerger doesn't affect any of our listings. Going forward, we will report in US dollars. We
retain our premium listing in London and membership of the FTSE 100 with continuing
listings in Hong Kong and Singapore.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everybody. I've got three questions, please. Firstly, starting with the
dividend. I wonder if you could give some more color about what the anchor for the
dividend is going forward. I think if you look at underlying dividend rebasing that's
happened for the pre-plc Group, I just wondered, given we don't have a fully developed
capital framework to look at for the Asia business, how is that dividend anchored and how
did you decide that the starting level should be modestly lower? And should we think that
we'll go back into the old pattern of periodic rebasing of the dividend upwards. That's the
first question.
Second question, can you be more specific, please, in terms of the slowdown in Hong
Kong in August? I think there has been a very sharp fall in the mainland tourists in all the
key --give some quantification about the specific percentage fall in sales. And then just
finally, on Jackson and the remittances, what impact would there be on future remittances
if interest rates were to stay where they are now given the elevated level of hedge costs?
Thank you.

A - Mike Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Okay, Jon. Thank you. I think we'll divide this into three parts as we could. Mark, if you
please address the dividend issue, Nic a bit of a trading update or just impact on the
resilience of the Hong Kong business, if you would, and Michael, a general comment
please on interest rates at Jackson. So, Mark?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark FitzPatrick

{BIO 20178326 <GO>}

Jon, hi, thanks for your question. In terms of the dividend, when we look at the element
around the progressive dividend and the level of growth and how we think about the
element of the dividend going forward, it's very much in terms of around the capital
generation that we have and we will also then be having a good look at the financial
prospects and investment opportunities we have as well as the market conditions. So
those are the factors that we are going to be looking at in taking into account in terms of
where we're at and how we go forward.
Overall, as you've heard me say before, we only bring up to the center, cash that we
need from the business units in any one year and that takes into account the level of
central cash stock and other potential investment opportunity or uses of central liquidity.
And given where we are and given the starting point 750 [ph] was an entirely sensible
and appropriate number for the business and in light of the capital generation we have in
the report that we sent.

A - Mike Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

And, Nic, on Hong Kong, just the general feel that (multiple speakers) business to sales.

A - Nic Nicandrou

{BIO 15589153 <GO>}

I mean, as Mark said, so in Hong Kong, we have been impacted by the sector-wide
slowdown in mainland China customers. The coming -- the disruptions that have been
Page 9 of 20



FINAL

Company N ame: Prudential PL C
Company Ticker: PRU L N Equity
Date: 2019-09-26

caused are impacting their ability to come across. Now everything that we see indicates
no change in purchase intention and it's simply that the number of visits are being
postponed. Now, conversely, the domestic demand and the activity to fulfill that demand
remains robust. Our sales through July and August were actually up in the domestic
market year-on-year, aided by the new annuity and the health offerings. Actually this lands
weight. So I believe that structural purchases are much more resilient that more
discretionary or transactional purchases. Therefore that Hong Kong picture taken together
with the continuation of double-digit growth that we saw earlier in the year in the nonHong Kong part of our portfolio, these are through July and August -- our overall sales
were up.
The activity, as you can imagine, the -- there is no letting up -- no let up in the focus of
Derek and his team to push forward. We continue to launch new products. We launched
the new juvenile education product only a few days ago. We've launched a number of
promotional activities on some of the very bespoke offerings that we have on
Evergreen's favor, and some of the protection products. We're rolling out Pulse in Hong
Kong in the course of the fourth quarter. And actually even though despite the disruption,
we're stepping up on agent recruitment. So through July and August, our recruitment was
20% up on the equivalent period last year. So the businesses remains in good health and
keeps on focusing on capturing an opportunity that is structural as we move forward.

And Nic, percentage of recurring premium retention just real quick again, that market...

A - Nic Nicandrou

{BIO 15589153 <GO>}

No, thank you for that, Mike. It's 98% recurring premium and the other fact that I think it
may be relevant to mention is that the mix of business that we go through July and
August is identical to what we saw earlier in the year indeed to what we see -- what we've
seen historically, so which tells me that the needs that we are covering are structure and
in real.

FINAL

So there is a couple of things. Clearly, and obviously through the first half results, the drop
in rates have been a headwind and we saw that in August as well. So it's surfacing that -we're within our -- despite that with the hedging portfolio being effective, we're within our
risk limits on all of our capital and sensitivity measures. So that's important. Going forward,
we do have the shift coming to the new regime, the new NAIC regime and that model is a
lot less sensitive to rates.
I know, I think earlier and last year we had indicated based on where rates were at the
time, which were obviously much higher that that shift to that regime was going to be a
bit of a headwind. It's actually at a point -- we're in a point in the curve now where that
shift is actually accretive as well which we disclosed in the first half year results, the
permitted practice, which I'll talk about in a second is also right now a headwind where
generally it had been a help.
We are not renewing that permitted practice going forward. And in fact, we'll leave that
and I think in our published numbers, the capital drag on tax for the permitted practice at
the mid-year was about $570 million. So that's a good lift. Again, it's not just that there
isn't rate sensitivity in capital formation next year, but I think at this point, we're more
susceptible to further declines, though at a much less sensitive level in the new regime
than the old.

Q - David Motemaden

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just a question on the target debt to capital levels post
demerger, you're at. I think, 26% pro forma, including short-term securities. I guess where
do you want debt to capital to get to and over what time period? Second, just on the
holding company cash balance. Could you give us a sense for what the holdco cash
balance will be post demerger and what the minimum level of holdco cash you intend to
hold is? And finally, I was hoping to get a little bit more elaboration around the plans to
reduce the corporate overhead going forward. Any sort of targets you may have and
separately just on the TSAs that you have with M&GPrudential, I guess how faster are
those going to be rolling off and how are you planning to offset the stranded overhead
associated with those? Thank you.

So, David, thanks for the questions. On the overhead, no, we're not going to give targets.
We will rightsize their capabilities obviously to the size of the Group and the tasks at hand.
And -- but we're not going to give a public target on that. On the TSAs, they are fairly
minimal between the entities. And again, they have got a -- both sides have -- you have
plans to in-house, if you will, various services that are currently shared. The decision on
having TSAs as a function of us wanting to keep the pace of pull forward the timing of the
demerger, not any capability development issue on either side. So that's more of a when
do they fit on the project list of each of the two entities, it's not in our lens.
But do you want to go to target on where we are in debt to capital and holdco cash?

A - Mark FitzPatrick

{BIO 20178326 <GO>}

So, it's Mark here. Thanks for your question. In terms of the debt leverage kind of the mid2026 (inaudible) We're comfortable with that leverage. We think it works for us, and it's
not one that causes us concern and conversations we've had with ratings and co, they are
comfortable with that level as well. In terms of holdco cash balance at the year-end, as we
said at the half year, the holding company cash is expected to reduce in the second half
of 2019 and the level at the half year, but we haven't set out an exact number. And I'm not
minded to set out an exact number at this stage.

Got it, thanks. And if I could just follow up on the -- around the $200 million or sorry
GBP200 million of other movements that is expected to be sort of a run rate going
forward in the medium term. There are few different items in there. What's really driving
that going forward?

A - Mike Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

So as I mentioned, I think there are a number of components in there and those do vary
from period to period. And you can see the way those numbers have bounced around a
bit. So one of the things I just wanted to give you a sense of is, what we think going
forward will be helpful from an element of a run rate for your modeling before any oneoff effects.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Just few questions. First of all, I mean, if I
look at this cash plan, which is Slide Number 21, and if I apply some growth for US and
Asia, I mean I kind of get the number of which kind of suggests me that there is no net
cash accumulation after the payment of dividend based on the new figures. Now, I
Page 12 of 20



FINAL

Company N ame: Prudential PL C

appreciate that you mentioned that you take out dividend, the amount that you want, but
then, where is the dividend flexibility from subsidiaries, how much are we talking about in
Asia because I'm not sure if there is a lot of flexibility in US at the moment. So, any
thoughts on that would be great. Secondly, any progress on the US diversification plan?
Where are we on that? Any progress? I know, we were just talking about this last month,
so might be there is nothing at the moment, but any thoughts on that? And thirdly on this
other movement, sorry, going back to that, again what is that GBP200 million? Is it like
you're giving us some normal numbers for potential M&A or bancassurance payments or
is there some cost that is a recurring cost. So these three questions would be good.
Thank you.

A - Mike Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

So let me just comment on the diversification. So, Ashik, we're not going to comment on
any work in progress we have on strategic issues in the United States. So the answer to
that one at this point would be no comment. Do you want to address the other two
questions?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark FitzPatrick

{BIO 20178326 <GO>}

Yeah, so in terms of the element of the cash build, if you look at Slide 17 of the deck, it
shows the element of the OFSG level, for example, in Asia across life and the asset
management business versus the net remittance, and therefore shows you that there is
actually considerable capacity and capability that we want to be able to hold in the ground
close to the businesses to be able to provide the maximum flexibility for the businesses
to be able to pursue investments and growth opportunity on that particular piece. And as
for the other element in terms of that GBP200 million, it is, as I've -- I've got the risk of
repeating myself, it's a number of different components and they do bounce around
quite a lot and what we've tried to do is, give an element of what we think that number
could be on a go-forward basis, as I said, before any one-off effects.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah, sorry, what I was trying to understand on that is, is it a recurring number or is it
something like you believe that on a normalized basis, some different items may come to
this GBP200 million number? I'm just trying to understand that, is this a cost today that is
there, like for example like corporate center costs? We understand it is there, it will
remain unless you do the efficiency, et cetera. So what is that GBP200 million? Is it like just
a normal view of what year in, year out, should be or -- yeah?

A - Mark FitzPatrick

{BIO 20178326 <GO>}

So it is -- as the slide indicates, it's an element of things that include the element around
bancassurance distribution includes things around restructuring costs and some of those
things and some of those aspects as we know are going to shift and change depending
upon our activity in any one year.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay, that's very clear. Thank you.

We now have a question from Johnny Vo from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.

FINAL

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

Yeah, hi. Thank you very much. Just could you give us the -- because the LCSM is so new,
could you tell us what the LCSM has been over the past few years, so we have a track
record? And also, can you remind us of what ratio you have included the US business in
that LCSM and therefore, what it would be if the RBC ratio was closer to 400%? Also, in
terms of the debt leverage capacity, do you have an upper range at which you wouldn't
want to go above, so say 30% range? And the final question is just in regards to OFSG. Is
that based on a minimum requirement of 100%? Thank you.

A - Mark FitzPatrick

{BIO 20178326 <GO>}

So in terms of the LCSM, it is new and therefore we've looked at it for the half year. We
haven't gone back. One of the things we're going to be spending time is looking at it
from a go-forward perspective in terms of what it is. It is very, very new, but also we think
it is potentially -- it's a bespoke arrangement that we have with the HKIA. And once the
new group-wide supervisory standards come out, we'll get a better sense of what that's
going to be in the future. And as we said at the half year, we expect that to happen
sometime during the course of next year.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mike Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

But, Johnny, I think the way to think of it is, it's an extremely well aligned look at fungible
capital from the local regulators point of view. It's cumulative look at our regulatory
requirements across jurisdictions at reasonable capitalization. So again if -- it's sort of -it's a good first look at a true fungibility of capital on a portfolio like ours. So we don't have
audited historics on it. It's clearly a lens we've used in the past. You want to go debt to
leverage?

A - Mark FitzPatrick

{BIO 20178326 <GO>}

And then in terms of the elements around the US piece and how that's bought in, it's
effectively a 100% of the RBC basis, it is how that's bought in terms of the calculation as
we set out in the half-year account. And then from the elements around the debt to
equity ratio or the debt lever element, one of the things that we keep a close eye on is
the element around the leverage we have. 26% is where we are very comfortable with.
We haven't indicated an upper limit in terms of we would or would not be prepared to go,
it's something that we keep under close review and if that position was changed
materially, we'd be able to -- we'd notify the market.

A - Mike Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

And then just to go back to the cap ratio, we're continuing to use our economic capital
and our cash flow stream models internally as they're obviously developed to incredibly
high standards. The number of resumes you worked under that it's not a single lens look
at how we deploy capital or how we define dividend level or fungibility of capital. And
again we think we see convergence on the regulatory arising between US, European, and
Page 14 of 20



Company N ame: Prudential PL C

Asian regulators of how they look at quality of capital, capital level strain, et cetera, and

We now have a question from Andrew Crean from Autonomous Research. Your line is
now open.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Good afternoon, all. Two questions, if I can. Firstly, on your plan to increase the cash
remittances from the US, could you help us the tool with forecast and that will provide
some targets because at the moment, the only information we get on statutory capital is
one slide in the appendix once a year, which provides a statutory operating profit, which is
reconcilable to nothing. It's impossible from the outside for us to be able to substantiate
the increased cash remittances. Second, as I think you'll be aware from your shareholders
feedback, the main issue on the stock appears to be whether to keep Asia and the US
together or to separate and have the US. Could you say why you're not separating the US
at this time? And what the synergistic benefits between the two companies, which you
have talked about in the past, what are they and how powerful are they?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mike Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

So, Andrew, I might give you the same answer, I think at the half year on the targets.
We're not going to provide targets on US. And I appreciate the challenge externally that
creates, but the answer to that is, no, there won't be a target.
On the US synergy piece, there's quite a few. I mean, the international business has
approximate 80% of its earnings in dollars with the combination that goes to the
reporting currency, different risks to that. There's diversification benefit across the two.
There's cash flow that goes to supporting our ratings, its capability. We don't have a
market in Asia that is looking at for the most part retirement products and capability in
that space. Recognize different issues in the US business, on that valuation, we have a
very different business and some of those firms had in the US. And we'll continue to do
things that allow shareholders to better understand the value of that business or -- but
we're not going to get into specifics as I said earlier, what those are, but those would be
just some of the synergies.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Could we -- could I come back on the first question? If you're not going to give targets,
can you please give us more disclosure so that we can actually forecast the dividend of
the US business?

Company N ame: Prudential PL C

Yeah, we can look at that. We appreciate the -- that in the absence of other information,
cash and the ability to model cash is a key metric for the market. So we'll continue to
increase disclosure. That's a fair challenge.

We now have a question from Abid Hussain from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.

Q - Abid Hussain

{BIO 20229932 <GO>}

Hi. Just one question for me, please. Actually just coming back to some of the earlier
questions on, I just wondered if you can clarify how much discretionary surplus capital that
you have across the Group? I don't think the LCSM provides the true reflection of where
you are. So I just wondered, can you give us an indication of where the discretion surplus
capital is sitting and how much it is? And I guess the second part of that question is,
what's your ability and what's your firepower for kind of growth within Asia?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mike Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Yeah. So, I mean, let's start with where we are no longer which under Solvency II basis
we're clearly one of the best capitalized firms under an ill fitting regime. So our intent to
this is not a capital arbitrage, we release capital by shifting jurisdictions. As I said earlier,
our view on risk capital allocation hasn't changed and a lot of our internal tools haven't
changed. And this is true across a number of capital regimes that we manage the
business over decades. So this is intended to be a very strong company financially.
Do you want to talk about the specific numbers to give him a word of it? [ph]

A - Mark FitzPatrick

{BIO 20178326 <GO>}

So in terms of the surplus in terms of the half year that we have in terms of total insurance
and asset management, if you look at the half year accounts in terms of the EEV section in
Note 9, you'll see the continuing operations number GBP5.2 billion for personal insurance
and asset management, and then you've got in other types of GBP3.1 billion and Asia
makes up just GBP2.9 billion, just under GBP3 billion of that.

Q - Abid Hussain

{BIO 20229932 <GO>}

Is that all? I mean, how much of that is actually fungible uncertainty available to use?

A - Mike Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

The quality of capital is a good one, but that's under, I think, even in the most strict
regimes, it's a multiple of sources. It's a multiple of measurements. I think it'd take us
more than a couple of minutes there to give you a line by line on that, but if you think
about it, it is by the most stringent Western Standards moving to a more regime -- not
Page 16 of 20

regimes.

We now have a question from Nick Holmes from Societe Generale. Your line is now open.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thank you very much. Just one question. Can you tell us the net impact on RBC
of the NAIC reform and giving up the permitted practice because you changed your view
on both of these items, haven't you? And I wondered if you could give us a bit more detail
on what the net impact of the two is. Thank you.

A - Mark FitzPatrick

{BIO 20178326 <GO>}

Thanks, Nick. So we don't give RBC as you know for year, or until the full year. The
permitted practice historically renews in October, first week of October. So with the new
regime coming, being it's the only one of its type, I think it's much good housekeeping as
it was anything else. And the intent was to give you directional, not the specific basis
points on the impact of those because the calculation is not simply on the permitted
practice. So the big change in the period of time since that historic discussions of this
would be the movements in rates effectively.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mike Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

I would add that one, we haven't changed our view. Rates have changed in the market, so
the impact relative to the calculation changes and we've given I think just in guidance that
we expect to be in that range of 400 to 450 and we still expect that that guidance to
hold from where we sit right now for the end of the year.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Okay. So you're just looking at the year-end position. If you're guiding on the negative
effect on the RBC ratio from NAIC reform next year, is that still the same? The changes in
NAIC calculation?

A - Mark FitzPatrick

{BIO 20178326 <GO>}

No, no, no, we're looking -- when I talk about 400 to 450 we're talking about in the new
regime, which I think was the guidance that Chad gave last year in Singapore was that
we're -- we were prepared to be in that range of planning for that. And certainly low rates
has made that a bit more challenging, but we still expect to be within that range. And
obviously where rates are will depend where we fall in that, but I think we're talking
exactly about the new regime.

A - Mike Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

So Nick the new information would be rate and equity movement and a better
understanding of the models as everyone -- as we're moving forward with more

information there. So we're trying to give you a current look, I don't think it's a
contradiction of our -- and everything doesn't help [ph] the same we would have different
information for you, be higher.

FINAL

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Okay. I'm sorry to lay the point slightly, but just could you -- I mean, the influence of what
you're saying seems to be net-net, there is no particular change. Is that your guidance?

A - Mike Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Again, not going to give you to a specific RBC target or number or indication of where we
are today, we don't do that on intervals, what we're telling you is the combination of the
new regime and the strength of the firm, we'll put it in the range that we forecasted even
with the changes we've discussed. And that was the consistent with both -- even though
things have changed. So it's a --

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

And giving up the permitted practice?

A - Mike Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Giving up the permitted practice, which, again, as we said would've renewed in
October and given it's the only one of its type in the states with as much hygiene as not -that's a conversation with us (inaudible) And its impact on the new regime may or may not
have been helpful and it wasn't a conversation...

A - Mark FitzPatrick

{BIO 20178326 <GO>}

(inaudible) those permitted practices do with how the swaps are treated and it's a much
lower portion of our book, our hedge book now than it was when it was put in place. And
the new regime is much less sensitive to rates, particularly short-term fluctuations in rates.
And so it's less of an impact whether it's favorable or negative based on any particular
rate or market environment, it's just less impactful. So we are going forward without it and
in the new regime.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

And the number of GBP570 million that you gave is the permitted practice contribution. Is
that correct?
