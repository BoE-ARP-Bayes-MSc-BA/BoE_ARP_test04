Good day, and welcome to the Chubb Limited Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference
Call. Today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)
For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer,

{BIO 6404488 <GO>}

Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Chubb's June 30th, 2019 second
quarter earnings conference call.
Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to
company performance and growth opportunities, pricing and business mix, and economic
and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may
differ materially. See our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement,
which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com, for more information on
factors that could affect these matters.

FINAL

We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the
most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings
press release and financial supplement.
Now, it's my pleasure to introduce our speakers this morning. First we have Evan
Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief
Financial Officer. We'll then take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions
are several members of our management team.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Evan.

Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had a very good second quarter,
highlighted by excellent underwriting and strong premium revenue growth globally and
constant dollars that is benefiting from favorable underwriting conditions and our various
growth initiatives. In fact, the positive pricing and underwriting environment continued to
improve through the quarter and spread to more classes and segments of business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Core operating income was $1.2 billion or $2.60 per share, down 3% due to modestly
higher year-on-year cat losses. Book and tangible book value per share were up 3.2% and
4.7% respectively in the quarter, and they are now up 7.7% and nearly 12% for the year, a
combination of income and the mark derived from falling interest rates.
Our combined ratio of 90.1% included 3.8 points of cat losses and 2.6 points of favorable
prior period reserve development. So on a current accident year basis, excluding cat, the
combined ratio was 88.9%. Phil will have more to say about investment income, book
value, cats and prior period development.
Turning to growth, P&C premium revenue in the quarter in constant dollars was quite
strong. Net premiums written grew 6% with foreign exchange having a negative impact of
1.8 percentage points. The pricing environment continued to firm through the quarter, and
we took advantage of some of the best pricing we've seen in years. The rate of increase
of prices accelerated, while at the same time, it spread to more classes of business and
more classes of risk.
Rates continued to firm in the US for major accounts in E&S specialty to the middle
market. We continued to observe favorable conditions in London wholesale market and in
Australia, with early signs firming conditions are spreading to the UK company market and
certain classes of risk on the Continental Europe and in Southeast Asia. Overall, while
rates are moving, they are firming broadly to varying degrees in most all short and long
tail classes. Accompanying price increases, terms and conditions are tightening in certain
classes. In my judgment, given some of the market dislocation we have observed,
including a reset of risk appetite on the part of some, this firming trend is sustainable and
will likely continue to accelerate and spread. It is income and loss reserve driven, not
capital driven.

Overall prices increased in North America commercial on a written basis by about 7% in
the quarter versus a loss cost trend in aggregate of just under 4.5%. Renewal price
change includes both rate and exposure, and rate was up 6.3 points and exposure 0.5
point. Pricing improved throughout the quarter in many property and casualty related
areas, including general casualty, both primary and excess, D&O and professional lines. As
more business comes into our underwriting appetite and price range and other carriers
take corrective actions, we are benefiting from a flight to quality. All things being equal,
many buyers prefer Chubb.
New business in our North America commercial lines was up over 11% in the quarter with
major accounts in specialty up nearly 15%. Retention of our customers remained strong
across all of our North America commercial and personal P&C businesses with renewal
retention as measured by premium of 93.5%. In major accounts in specialty commercial,
excluding agriculture, premiums were up 7%, with major up 5.5% and Westchester E&S up
over 9%. Renewal price change for major accounts was 8.5% with risk management
pricing up 6.3%, excess casualty up almost 10% and property up 18.5%. Public D&O rates
increased 11%. In our Westchester business, renewal pricing was up over 9.5%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to our middle market and small commercial business. Premiums overall were up
over 4.5%, renewal retention in our middle market business was 92%. Middle market
pricing was up over 4.5%, and if you exclude workers' comp, it was up nearly 5%. Again,
this is the best we've seen in a number of years. Middle market pricing for primary
casualty was up 4.5%, property 6.5%, excess umbrella up over 6%, and public D&O rates
were up 18%.
In our North America Personal Lines business net premiums in the quarter were down 2%,
but adjusting for the expanded reinsurance that we have discussed in the past and an
accounting change that impacted growth prior year, net premiums written were up about
2.5%. Retention remained strong at 96%. And for homeowners, pricing was up nearly 10%
in the quarter.
Turning to our international business, growth accelerated in our Overseas General
Insurance operation with net written premiums in constant dollar up 9%. FX then had a
negative impact of almost 6 points. Net premiums for our London market wholesale
business were up over 24%, while our retail division was up 7.5% with growth led by Latin
America up almost 11% and Asia up about 9%. In our London wholesale business, we
continued to see a reduction in capacity and rates firming across multiple lines of
business. We are also seeing a significant increase in submissions to Chubb, as brokers
worry about the continuity of markets and as they look to us as a preferred carrier of
choice. Overall rates in our London open market business were up over 9%. Property was
up 23.5%, marine cargo almost 7.5%, aviation was up 12% and onshore energy was up
15%. D&O rates in the London wholesale market were up 20%.
Our life insurance business had a strong quarter and half year with a contribution to
earnings of $76 million year-to-date. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump and Juan
Andrade can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and
pricing trends.

In closing, this was a good quarter for Chubb. We have momentum from a firming market,
flight to quality in our various global growth initiatives. We're achieving rate, which is
supporting margins and helping ameliorated exposures we observe on the loss side. In
sum, we have some wind on our sails and we're taking advantage of it. Our organization is
focused, energized and hungry.

FINAL

With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil.

Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

Thank you, Evan. Our balance sheet and overall financial position remain quite strong. We
have $107 billion portfolio of cash and high quality investments that is well rated and liquid,
and we are generating substantial capital and significant positive cash flow. Cash flow in
the quarter was $1.4 billion.

Bloomberg Transcript

Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $720 million to
shareholders, including $344 million in dividends and $376 million in share repurchases.
Year-to-date, through yesterday, we have repurchased over $800 million in shares at an
average price of $140 per share. In June, we paid off $500 million of debt that matured
and issued $1.3 billion of 8 and 12 year debt in the European market. The net proceeds will
be used to repay our $1.3 billion senior debt at maturity in November 2020. The debt was
issued at an average rate of 1.14%.
We grew tangible book value per share by 4.7% in the quarter and 11.9% year-to-date.
Since the close of the Chubb acquisition in 2016, tangible book value per share has fully
recovered from the initial 29% dilution, even excluding the favorable impact of unrealized
gains. Our annualized core operating ROE in the quarter was 9.3% and our annualized
core operating return on tangible equity was 15.2%.
As a reminder, Chubb records a change in the fair value mark on its private equity funds
as realized gains. So therefore, it is not included in core operating income. Other
companies record the impact of the mark as part of their investment income. This quarter,
we had after-tax realized gains up $237 million, which would increase our core operating
EPS by $0.51 and our annualized core operating ROE to 11.1%.
Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $902 million pretax, which was higher
than our estimated range and benefited from a one-off accrual adjustment of $9 million
and increased corporate bond for all activities. During the quarter, interest rates continued
to decline as financial markets anticipated a shift in Fed policy towards monetary easing.
This favorably impacted our portfolio of mark-to-market, resulting in an after-tax
unrealized gain of $1 billion. Although market yields have declined significantly in recent
months, we will remain conservative in our investment strategy and do not contemplate
any significant shift in asset allocation.
Our investment income going forward will continue to benefit from growth in our invested
assets and will be impacted by the level of market interest rates. Despite the negative

FINAL

impact of lower rates, we expect net investment income to grow moderately due to our
growth in invested assets and strong cash flow. We now expect our quarterly adjusted net
investment income run rate to be in the range of $890 million to $900 million going
forward.
Adjusted interest expense was $145 million pretax in the quarter. Factoring in the debt
that matured and the new Euro debt issued in June, we expect our quarterly adjusted
interest expense to remain the same for the balance of the year. Pretax catastrophe
losses for the quarter were $275 million, principally from US weather-related events. We
had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $188 million pretax or $152
million after-tax. This included $48 million of pretax adverse development on prior year
catastrophe losses, principally brought for Hurricane Irma and Typhoon Jebi, primarily in
our assumed reinsurance operation, and $25 million pretax adverse development related
to our runoff, non-A&E casualty exposures. The remaining favorable development of $261
million is split approximately 90% from long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2015
and prior, and 10% from short-tail lines.

Bloomberg Transcript

Foreign currency movement adversely impacted core operating income by $23 million in
the quarter. On a constant dollar basis, net loss reserves increased $831 million, reflecting
catastrophe losses in the quarter and the seasonal increase in our crop reserve, offset by
favorable prior period development. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 87%. Our core
operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.3%, which is in line with our annual
expected range of 14% to 16%. Through 6 months, our core operating effective tax rate
was 15%.
I'll turn the call back to Karen.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions)
And we'll take our first question from Mike Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Q - Mike Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning, everybody. First question on -- Evan, on your comments of
what's driving the rate activity and, I believe, you said something like it's income and
reserve driven, not capital driven. So I guess, I wonder if you can expand upon -- that kind
of implies there's going to be some timing of reserve issues and maybe what you've
seen and why you mentioned reserve driven?

FINAL

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Well, just simply, the rate has not kept pace with loss cost trend, and that puts pressure
on income and it puts pressure ultimately on reserves. You are either -- I think that it just
imply, it says what it implies. The balance sheets over time have less redundancy in them,
and for some, are adequate, for others -- and become negative for others. And you have
a loss cost environment that in many ways in the headlines is stable, but you have areas of
casualty and catastrophes and other areas within the business where there is volatility and
there is trend pressure, and so my comments meant to imply all of that. What I was saying
to you is, income and balance sheet not capital driven that there is a dearth of capital.
There is plenty of capital around and -- but it is more disciplined at this moment and it
comes to -- it's deployed when the rate and terms are more adequate.

Q - Mike Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Okay, no, thank you. That's helpful. I guess, if I could turn specifically to North America
commercial lines, where, I guess, depending on what you use for 2Q '18 with your
comments from last year, the structure settlement term had some impact there. So the
core loss ratio deteriorated either by 70 bps or 170 bps depending on how you adjust for
that. Obviously [ph], that looks like kind of one of the highest core loss ratios for this
segment in a while. We heard Trevor just talking about non-cat weather. I'm not sure if any
of that came into play here for that segment for you or what else drove the uptick. And
maybe has your view of loss trends in that segment changed since last quarter?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yeah. Let's look at North America commercial P&C, let's look it at on a current accident
year ex-cat. Last year ran an 87.4% combined ratio. This year it ran an 87.9% combined
ratio. I mean, simply outstanding, world-class and in the 80s. So let's have that
perspective. We wrote the same volume of LPTs this year that we did last year, and so no
impact from that. It was simply rate and trend naturally, not non-cat, weather or any of
that, just simply rate and trend, something I've been saying for many quarters. Thanks for
the question.

Q - Mike Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

All right. Thank you.

We'll take our next question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. My first question, Evan, is also -- just going back, I guess, to some of
your comments to the previous question on just what you're seeing with loss trend. Are
you guys seeing any changes in the tort environment? And I know there's a lot of different
Page 6 of 15



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2019-07-24

classes that blends together, but that 4.5% of trend that you said in the book for North
America commercial, can you give us some perspective on how that would compare? And
maybe it's not number, is it more qualitatively, to what you've seen in some recent
quarters?

FINAL

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Sure. Elyse, in the aggregate, in the round, the loss cost trend is stable. We haven't seen a
change in it. As you rightfully note though, within that, it varies by class of business and
area of business. We've talked for a number of quarters for quite some time now about
professional lines, D&O in particular, and I won't repeat or go into what we've talked
about, but -- simply about the increase in frequency, and in some areas, severity in that.
You know in the tort environment, generally, there has been less of an increase of
frequency, but there have been headlines of increase in severity, in jury awards, cases,
and you see it from commercial auto to products liability that is chemical related. And then
the trend from -- of tort from #MeToo and molestation and the specter in the future of
the reviver statutes which is unknowable at the time. So there is -- and then, the Australian
market behaves a certain way in tort and the London market, the UK, where D&O had
deteriorated. So you have -- it varies by area and by class of business. Comp on the other
hand behave very well. General liability behaves in a steady way, reasonably steady. So I
hope that helps you.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Yeah. That's helpful. And then, you said kind of talking through the core margin within
North America commercial that the delta between this Q2 and last Q2 is really just due to
rate versus trend. You seem, in your comments this quarter and also last quarter, pretty
bullish on pricing and the fact that you would think it would continue. So do you think we're
reaching the point where -- obviously, it takes a while to earn in the rate. But if you keep
getting this rate and accelerates, do you think as we get into 2020, you can think about
that being an environment where there will be some core margin improvement?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

We're in the risk business, so I can project the numerator reasonably well to you. I can't
project and prognosticate the denominator -- the denominator I can project. I can't quite
project the numerator the same way to you because we are in a risk business. And so,
look, rate exceeding trend is a simple statement. It's an ameliorating factor, and that's a
good thing. We'll see what its impact is on margin in the future.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. And then one last quick numbers question. You guys mentioned you
added a little bit to your Jebi loss in the quarter. What are you guys pegging that as for
insured loss for the overall industry right now?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

We'll take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Thank you, good morning. Going back to North America commercial, so Evan, you're
talking about world-class margins there and loss trends that are stable. I guess, do you
need more rate in that segment today? Or is this maybe an opportunity to try and take
market share while others are still pushing for rate?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

It varies by class of business. There is no general statement. Some classes are adequately
priced, some classes need rate and terms and condition changes, and some classes
need substantial rate. And so it varies. It's -- there is not a simple box for that. But as I
think you can see, our new business is up. Our renewal retention is high. We're in a more
favorable underwriting environment. And where it makes sense to us, and we've got a lot
of data and a lot of experience, we're leaning right into it.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. And then, I guess, if I shift to the investment portfolio. So it sounds like -apart from the comments that you're not really looking for any change in direction here
even with the change in monetary policy, one thing I did notice was an increase in duration
sequentially. Is that a strategic move? Or was that just kind of normal quarterly noise or
movement?

A - Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

It was simply technical. At the end of last year, we had decreased the duration because
we weren't getting paid to take duration risk. And over the course of this year, it's drifted
up slightly. But to the extent this would -- half a point or half a year or 4 years, we don't
think there's any material impact on our investment income.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Okay. So you're not necessarily looking to extend duration here?

We will take our next question from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Thanks, good morning. So clearly, terms and conditions rate have accelerated and
improved throughout the year. Evan, would you say on the other side that, that loss trend
today is -- it's a more challenging environment than it was 6 months ago?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No. I'd say it's -- if I compare 6 months ago to today, it's stable.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Fair enough. And then, I guess, I'll be the annoying one to ask about the crop, but just
curious what the thought process was? And how you're thinking about the planting
season? It didn't look like you put up a loss fig in agriculture. I'm not sure if you did, but
just interested in your thoughts there.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Sure. Let me make just a couple of comments about that and It's not annoying. I would be
surprised if one of you didn't ask about. First of all, we did put up the loss ratio about 2.5
points this quarter. So -- but what you have to recognize, it's on a low earned premium
base at this time of year. And it is not signaling at this point what you should imagine for
third quarter or for fourth quarter at all. Given the wet weather conditions this spring and
the potential impact on prevented planting or delayed planting along with the volatility in
commodity prices, impact by trade and other factors, it's natural.
The questions are raised about what kind of year we're anticipating for crop? So in a
word, it's unknowable. Our models under various scenarios point to a roughly average
year. However, the actual tally of prevented planting claims, the summer growing season
conditions and -- therefore, the result and quality of the crop, commodity prices and then
the fall harvest weather conditions are all to play out. All of that's in front of us. So we
simply raised our loss ratio modestly in the second quarter as a naturally conservative
action with very little bit that we could say. But it's unknown. If you know, then I'll tell you

Page 9 of 15

what, but come on over here, we're going to make a lot of money in hedging in
commodities.

(Operator Instructions) We'll take our next question from Paul Newsome with Sandler
O'Neill. Please go ahead.

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

Good morning, I want to ask if I make my own assumption about where we are from a
pricing versus loss cost spread, is there anything in either the North America commercial
or the overseas business mix and business exchange that would affect that sort of easy -that simple calculation for me?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I'm -- you have to explain. I'm not really sure what you're asking me, Paul?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

So what I'm asking is the natural business mix, all things being equal, going to be for a
business that has lower or higher combined ratios because I think we're all making an
assumption of whether or not Chubb hit a point where the earnings or the price increases
are above claim cost inflation that gives us an estimate of when we think we're going to
see an inflection in margins. But that calculation assumes basically that the business mix is
the same in the various segments.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

The business mix within the segments is reasonably steady. There's not -- this is a big
book of business. So there is not big shifts taking place. There's always -- every quarter it
changes. It's jittery. But in the round, it's -- the mix is quite steady.

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

Okay. That's great. And then -- I'm sorry, I'm going to beat on crop a little bit. But is there
a chance that given the delay in the -- potential delay in the harvest, we can see a change
in the premium recognition from mainly in third to more in the fourth?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No. It's formulaic, so no.

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

Okay, thank you.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes, thanks. A couple here for you. First, I'm just curious, in the overseas area, Evan,
reserve release is going to really slow on a year-over-year basis. Was there any kind of
one-timers there that was going on?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No. There was not.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay. And then the growth you're seeing, no one-timers. Got you. And the growth you're
seeing in overseas, where is it coming from? Is that some of the distribution relationships
you have, other things going on?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Juan Carlos Andrade

{BIO 16371272 <GO>}

Brian, this is Juan Andrade. The growth is actually pretty broad-based. As Evan said in his
opening remarks, we certainly are seeing pretty good growth coming out of our London
wholesale market operation as we see the market continuing to firm and we see
contraction in capacity there. But underlying all of that and particularly for our retail
businesses is really our strategies continuing to gain traction, and I'm talking about our
strategies in the small commercial, the middle market, accident and health, Personal Lines
on a global basis. The distribution agreements are certainly doing well. We're getting
good traction on all of that. So I would say it's really a combination of our organic
strategies in addition to the rate that we're continuing to see now.

We'll take our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Thank you and good morning. Given the ongoing shifts we're seeing and tightening in the
commercial property, casualty and insurance market, Evan, I'm wondering if in this
environment, it might shift your thinking on mergers and acquisitions at all?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No. Steady. And it doesn't shift with the times that way. So we know -- I have been very
consistent in -- when asked this for many years now. We are builders, and we're a
company of builders. And we have a strategy to grow our company organically.

FINAL

Acquisitions complement that strategy. They help to advance it or improve upon it in any - and the strategy is product, segment of customer, distribution and territory oriented.
And when we identify the right target or partner and financials and we judge it to advance
our strategy in a positive way and will be accretive to our shareholders, their capital, then
we are -- we know our minds, and we will pull that trigger.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

That's helpful. Thank you. Just to follow up on that, with the potential for acquisitions to
complement organic growth, does that imply you're more focused on bolt-on acquisitions
as opposed to something larger or transformational?

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, good morning And I was hoping you could talk about what you're seeing in
reinsurance. We're hearing a lot of commentary that's very positive, especially on the
catastrophe side, didn't see tremendous amount of growth in Global Reinsurance this
quarter.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yes. The reinsurance market is, I think, modestly tightening. I think, for the most part,
reinsurers are riding on the backs of primary writers. And if they feel pressure in their own
income or balance sheet statements, then they are more taking action by the seasons
they select and they are banking on seasons to get better rates and terms that ultimately
will feed into their results. It's more unusual than we've seen in the past. Typically, we
would have seen a change in market pricing cycles, more reinsurance led. That hadn't
happened. And I think in many cases, reinsurers are -- their results are inferior to that of
insurers results. And other than Chubb, I'm surprised they don't take more action in their
underwriting positions on reinsurance and -- that they don't drive higher pricing, better
terms for themselves. We'll -- I can't prognosticate the future, but so far I see it's relatively
modest, the changes in terms and conditions and pricing in the reinsurance market.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. That's very helpful. And second, Chubb came out with a fairly strong statement on
climate change in the context of which entities you're willing to underwrite? Has that
changed the, I guess, loss trend assumptions for property risk?

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Good morning. Thanks Evan, in the past you've commented on the impact of the tariffs
and trade wars that seem to be evolving from quarter-to-quarter. And I wanted to give
you an opportunity to give us an update on how you think the current environment has
affected your business? And what we should be thinking about in our calculus about the
results going forward?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yes. I don't -- we grew our overseas business by 9% in the quarter, and you see it's
broad-based. So I don't see a linkage between tariffs and the health of Chubb's business.
And our business is more idiosyncratic. We are active in local markets around the world
where you're impacted by their local economic plus their trade and their trade-related
economic expansion. So yes, both. Look, when it comes to -- I'm not in favor of tariffs as a
strategy. And I'm not in favor of putting the walls up and bringing your supply chains home.
This is a globalized world in terms of trade and world led by a vision -- America's vision of
global trade. I continue to stand behind that, and I think that's the best path to peace and
prosperity for the citizens of our nation.
And so, I hope that we will engage more in reaching conclusions to trade agreements
than imposing further tariffs. Obviously, to the degree that tariffs and other actions, other
protectionist actions taken slow down economic growth around the world, this country is
not immune and the insurance industry is not immune because we grow -- we're
exposure driven, not about premium. Premium is a proxy for exposure, and we grow
based on growth of exposure globally when economic activity grows or contracts
exposure.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Speaking about industries, one of the themes that has emerged for, I guess, a
couple of years now is pricing -- price increases in commercial auto. And I'm trying to
reconcile the desire by the insurance market to raise prices on the trucking industry. With
the news, it seems like every other week we're hearing about troubles in the trucking
industry, whether it's LME or Timmerman Starlite. And so I'm curious what your
perspective is on the balance between rate and fiscal survival of an industry?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

Well, we're not responsible for the fiscal survivor of any industry except our own. And I
know from my perspective, I'm a fiduciary of shareholder capital that expects a
reasonable return if we deploy that capital towards the trucking industry to take insurance
risk. I can tell you that Chubb writes a fair amount of trucking-related long, medium and
short-haul exposure. We work with clients who do -- who are embracing modern
technology and -- that exists today and they've got strong balance sheets to lower their
loss costs, to reduce their exposures, to police driver behavior. And that results in
amelioration of loss cost rises and therefore, the premiums we charge. It's a pretty
rational circle of life there. And for those who simply operate in a less professional
manner and can't police their loss cost will be -- to buy insurance is going to -- the price is
going to be reflected. That's it.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Right. I'm not trying to suggest that you have financial responsibility for the trucking
industry. I just realized that everyone wants to raise prices on long-haul trucking, etc. And
yet, it seems like a lot of the long-haul truckers are having a lot of headwinds and their
survival is in question. So there is a balance to be had I suppose between charging higher
prices and actually not being able to have a customer insured at all.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yes. But if it was -- and I understand what you're saying. If it was to raise prices to earn
unreasonable margins or to earn any margin -- I mean, right now, the trucking business is
not -- that's never been an easy business and to make any money in trucking. So is it
better if you can't make any money to just say then I won't insure it at all. They are
uninsurable, they can't buy insurance now, you go out of business instantly versus you're
going to work with those who can work with themselves and help to reduce loss costs and
ameliorate price. And so I tell you there is not a one size fits all in trucking. There are
those who are quite professional and we work with them, and they have far more modest
price increases than, say, those who don't have the wherewithal or capability or desire to
embrace technologies that will help to ameliorate that rise in their loss cost. It's the best I
can do for you.

Q - Greg Peters
