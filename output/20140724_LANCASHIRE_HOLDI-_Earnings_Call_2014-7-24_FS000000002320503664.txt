MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Hello and welcome to the Lancashire Holdings Q2 2014 Results Call. For the first half of
this call, all participants will be on a listen-only mode, so there is no need to mute your
individual lines. And afterwards, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Just to remind
you, the call is being recorded.
I'll now hand over to our host, Alex Maloney.

Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Today, we have on the call, Elaine Whelan, our
CFO; Paul Gregory, our CUO; we have Darren Redhead, CEO of Kinesis; Peter Scales,
CEO of Cathedral and Denise O'Donoghue, who is our Chief Investment Officer.
I'm delighted to say we grew fully converted book value per share by 2.4% for the second
quarter with a healthy combined ratio of 74.6%.
In addition to the impact of Richard's retirement package on RoE, this quarter has seen a
number of moving parts across different areas of our underwriting business. And I believe

Page 1 of 19



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity

this result demonstrates the underlying quality of our core portfolio in a market which is
one of the most difficult in our history.

FINAL

We're working hard to maintain our position in a market which has changed rapidly, and
this has led us to change tactics accordingly. We have been very active in the second
quarter optimizing our portfolio to ensure we only write business where the risk and
reward dynamics are acceptable.
The silver lining in a falling market is the cost of reinsurance when we are the client, and
we now purchase more reinsurance than any other firm in our history.
We've always said that we will write the most exposure in a hard market and the least in a
soft market, and this remains true. We have reduced our PMLs significantly from our peak
in April 2012, with a 30% reduction in Gulf wind and a 20% reduction in Cal quake. Our risk
PMLs have also reduced considerably over the same period.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are comfortable with volatility, but we only accept volatility when we're getting paid
for it. We can accept more potential volatility when conditions improve. We are working
closely with our colleagues at Cathedral who continue to produce consistent results, as
they have done for a number of years.
Obviously, at the time of writing, we are still digesting the terrible period for the aviation
industry, but somber as it is, these events create opportunities for us. We are already
well-positioned in aviation reinsurance, and this is augmented by our new team of aviators
joining the Syndicate 3010 to write aviation war.
Our industry is changing rapidly and those who can change with it will have nothing to fear.
But good companies will adjust to the future, and our history shows we have no fear of
adapting, but we will stick to our core principle of underwriting comes first.
And now, I pass over to Paul Gregory.

Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Thanks, Alex. As Alex has already alluded to, there's almost an unprecedented level of
competition in nearly all our business lines at present. Traditional reinsurance and
retrocessional capacity is being displayed by alternative capital and trying to find a way
into our core primary insurance market.
Fortunately, our insurance clients post (03:23) a high value on our leadership skills, our
experience, and above all, our pragmatic and seasoned transparent history. By accepting
the complex offshore energy or marine loss, clients want to know that the accounts party
has a real understanding of their business and will seek to adjust claims fairly following the
intent, as well as the letter of the contract.

FINAL

We've had a real demonstration of that loyalty in this quarter since we've gotten Lloyd's
approval to be underwriting terrorism and energy business in Syndicate 3010. We've had
tremendous support from some of our longstanding clients and brokers, who've not only
renewed their shares with Lancashire, but also given new additional shares to Cathedral.
As a result, we're already well ahead of where we expected to be on the energy line.
The major milestones for the quarter were the Japanese and Florida catastrophe
renewals at 1/4 and 1/6 (04:12), respectively. There's not anything I can tell you that's any
different from what we've â€“ what you've heard already.
Consolidation in Japan reduced opportunities, alternative capacity (04:24) shares in
Florida where price is the main driver, and pricing was down by anything between 10% and
30%.
With reduced risk levels in Japan, (04:34) for the use of additional reinsurance, and our
small exposure to Florida high line (04:38) got smaller. In New Zealand, we also reduced
the exposures as the proposals pricing finally started to come under pressure following
the tragic earthquake in 2011.

Bloomberg Transcript

The energy portfolio has thrived as we've maintained our preeminent position on
Deepwater Gulf of Mexico wind products, and as noted, received great support from our
clients for the new capacity at Syndicate 3010.
For marine, the cargo and hull lines, although most of the businesses are adequately
priced, we did not renew some business where the price was set over the ambitious
reduction targets.
On terrorism, our submission levels continue to rise, allowing us to select the optimum
portfolio for our risk appetite. Pricing here is cheap, and we make no bones about that.
The risk selection is key, and the daily call continues to support that process.
For aviation, the satellite portfolio experienced a launch loss. But I should point out, we
allowed the current levels of losses in our loss peak (05:35). Pricing is stable, and further
losses will be needed to go behind any significant upwards rate movement.
For AV52, rates remain under pressure, and on the Cathedral aviation reinsurance
portfolio, income is at a relatively low level as writing continues to struggle. Although we
were able to make substantial savings on the outward purchases.
As Alex has mentioned, our new aviation team's arrival at Syndicate 3010 will allow us to
access any possible opportunity that may arise in the aviation war market as a result of
the recent run of losses that, that market has experienced.
We're very pleased to say that Lloyd's have already given us business plan approval for
these new aviation classes effective the 1st of August.

At Kinesis, you would've (06:18) seen that we made immediate draw of around $50
million for renewal opportunities. So we are very happy with the progress made to date.

FINAL

Darren and his team will be marketing heavily once we get into September, and we'll have
a much better picture of the potential for 2016 (06:31) at the end of next quarter.
There are a couple of areas where some explanation of this quarter's numbers may help.
Political and sovereign bound premiums are down substantially compared to the same
quarter last year. But if you look at submission numbers, they're, in fact, slightly up.
The (06:49) these lines (06:50) entirely depending on the specific project financing that's
been agreed between governments or their agencies and lenders. And this process can
take longer than anticipated. We have a substantial number of deals in the pipeline, so
there's no significant long-term shift here.
Second, there was an increase in both AV52 and satellite, which drove an increase in the
overall aviation sub-clause at Lancashire. On satellite, as with political and sovereign, there
is no real renewable book for launches and timetables are subject to change. So the book
has lumpy quarters and this is one of them. Again, no long-term trend.

Bloomberg Transcript

And AV52 is in a number of U.S. airlines by an excess coverage in the private market in
advance of an anticipated decision by the U.S. government to stop providing the
coverage. This is a new source of income for the AV52 market, and to date, three major
U.S. airlines purchased from the commercial market.
The other big story has been the outwards reinsurance and retrocession led by
Lancashire and Cathedral who've been able to improve terms and coverage on renewals,
and provide substantial and well-priced new capacity. As well as the gearing reduction in
pricing on the core portfolio, we've been able to buy additional limits for our risk and
catastrophe programs with some wide coverage and keen pricing.
The bulk of our risk and core catastrophe placements remain with long-standing
traditional capital relationships, but we have accessed alternative markets where there
are compelling opportunities, especially on the cat side. We expect to continue to find
excellent opportunities on the outwards to mitigate the pressure on the inwards portfolio
in the current market cycle.
Again, we will stick to the strategy of keeping net risk levels lower during a soft market. As
Alex has referred to, we have reduced both our cat and non-cat PMLs, which is exactly
what we should be doing in today's market.
So that's the underwriting picture for this quarter. It is hard work, but given the strength of
our leadership capability, our significant line sizes, the strength of our client and broker
relationships, and the quality of our underline portfolio, we're well equipped to handle this
stage of the cycle. And it is a cycle, and there will be future opportunities that Lancashire,
Cathedral and Kinesis will be well positioned to take.

I'll now hand over to Elaine.

FINAL

Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Thanks, Paul. Hi, everyone. Our results are in the website as usual. We produced an RoE
for the quarter of 2.4% with 0.7% of that coming from Cathedral. Acquisition adjustments
reduced RoE by 0.1% again this quarter. Before acquisition adjustments, Cathedral has
now contributed 1.3% to the (09:24) RoE of 6.4% for the half year. As been said, the
majority of the increase in premium this quarter comes from Cathedral. It picks up $82
million from this quarter.
Our (09:37) asset was a little bit behind the Q2 last year mostly due to rate reductions.
But that was more than offset by new premiums written in the energy and terrorism lines
that Cathedral now writes.
To Lancashire's own book, we're actually a bit ahead of last year. Our property captive
was relatively stable with the entities coming from our energy Gulf of Mexico book. So
there's still a number of contracts written on a multiyear basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

Of the $70.5 million of energy Gulf of Mexico premiums written this quarter, $64.5 million
of that is related to multiyear deals. About 20% of that will earn this year, with most of the
rest earning out over the next two years.
Otherwise, as Paul mentioned, our political and sovereign risk is down compared to the
second quarter last year primarily due to long-term contracts written last year that are not
yet due to renew.
For the rest of the year, for Lancashire's own book, I expect a slight reduction in Q3 and
Q4 premiums. The (10:30) for Cathedral will be expected to further growth in the energy
and terrorism lines.
On ceded premium, Lancashire continues to buy additional reinsurance opportunistically,
with that additional spend pretty much replacing other programs from last year that
weren't renewed.
Most of the increased ceded premiums for the quarter comes from Cathedral as they
purchased a new energy and terrorism cover to protect those new business lines.
It was another fairly quiet quarter in terms of cat loss events with nothing major to speak
of. Our net loss ratio of 34.9% was a good result. We had some sole (11:04) risk losses in
the current market year and a bit of a mixed bag in older years.
Last quarter, we did adverse (11:10) development on a 2013 action year energy claim. This
quarter, we were pleased to reduce that, a result from adverse development on a 2012
energy claim.

FINAL

We also decided to increase our reserve (11:22) in relation to one particular marine loss
(11:25) or net loss. This also gives a little more on Costa Concordia (11:29), but the increase
is fairly small at $3.8 million for the quarter. Other business and claims were pretty
insignificant, and the reserve for previous large events was fairly stable overall.
Our accident year loss ratio was 39.4 %. On investment strategies' result, we're charging
60 (11:46) basis points for the quarter as we benefited from further spread narrowing in
the quarter. We've continue to allocate some more funds to our hedge fund portfolio and
now have $99.5 million invested in that. That's working well for us and we'll allocate a little
more later on this year.
Our hedge fund strategy is a low volatility one and gives us a nice diversification for the
rest of the portfolio under interest rate risk, and we just also picked up a bit more income
from that.
The hedge fund portfolio have returned 1.1% as of June 30. On KCM, our capital deployed
to date will add about $6.2 million under (12:23) this year. Just a reminder, there are
earnings fees in line with the underlying risk profile's portfolio (12:31). So the bulk of it will
be earned over the year's hurricane season.

Bloomberg Transcript

Profit commissions could be around $9.6 million, depending on loss activity. But we won't
receive any of those until Q1 2015 at the earliest. $3.8 million of our other income is this
quarter's share of the underwriting fees. The remainder of our other income is managing
agency fees and profit commissions from Cathedral.
Our G&A includes $6.6 million of Cathedral costs, the incremental impact of Richard's
contractual retirement package, and we also continue to amortize our finite life intangible
assets.
The further $2.5 million G&A on that this quarter, and we have about another $1.5 million
coming through in Q3. It will be fully amortized by the end of the third quarter. The
deferred tax liability that relates to this tangible asset will also be fully released next
quarter. $1.5 million of the tax credit you see in our income statement this quarter relates
to the release of a deferred tax liability on the intangible.
In addition to Richard's salary and benefits entitlement, his (13:32) of a dividend equivalent
have accrued to be more substantial. That amounted to cost to shareholders equity of
$9.8 million. The total impact of Richard's retirement package is, therefore, $11.6 million,
which reduced our RoE by 0.7%. Richard also exercises warrants, and that reduced our
RoE for the quarter by 0.6%.
As for last quarter, around $4 million of the our financing costs related to cost of our debt
and (14:00) facilities (14:01), with the balance due to the mark-to-market on our interest
rate swap on Lancashire's subordinated debt.

FINAL

Lastly, on capital, we're not seeing much change in the market. If anything, we're a little
more pessimistic on pricing, so we'll manage our risk levels over that and continue to
service core clients. If that continues, if there's no change in the market, then we'll be
returning substantially all, if not all, of our earnings for the year. It's too early to call our
outlook for Jan 1, but we certainly don't anticipate needing more caps than we need for
this year from where we stand right now.
With that, I'll hand over to the operator for questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. . Okay. Our first question comes from Maciej of Morgan Stanley. Go ahead,
your line is open.

Q - Maciej K. Wasilewicz

{BIO 16462204 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, it's Maciej from Morgan Stanley. So I've got two questions, if I may. The first question is
just on your satellite losses. I know you had one last year as well. I know â€“ I think if I
remember correctly, the seasonal business line that you've been writing for that long, I'm
just wondering whether or not â€“ is there any second thoughts about that business line at
all or whether you think you've got an edge in that business still and you've just been a
little bit unlucky? Or maybe if you can just comment on whether or not maybe the overall
possibility of that line is actually good, but I just can't see it in the figures?
And the second question is more about the aviation market. I understand there's been a
lot of losses in the market recently, and that should lead to an improvement in the
conditions and rates in that market.
I'm just wondering how much you think that, that market can truly dislocate in the kind of
environment that we're in where, basically, there's a lot of hunger for margins. And if the
inherent risk of aviation losses hasn't actually changed, do you think you actually get
dislocation in that market to pay back the recent losses or not? If you can comment on
those two, please?

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Okay, Maciej. Paul Gregory will answer the satellite losses, and then Peter Scales is best
positioned for the aviation question.

A - Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Maciej, hi. You're right, we have only been writing satellite line of business relatively
recently, about two years now. We do â€“ when we started writing the clause, we did tend
to expect one launch loss a year, and in fact, that's exactly how it's played out. We're
comfortable with the book as it spans in the portfolio. We have â€“ obviously, everything we
write, we constantly review in terms of its profitability. But as it stands today, we're happy

Page 7 of 19



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2014-07-24

with the portfolio as it stands and the rates that we're getting. Obviously, we would prefer
for these losses to move rates upwards. They do remain stable. The way it stands, we're
comfortable with where we are.

FINAL

A - Peter David Scales

{BIO 2108933 <GO>}

The aviation market, you may have seen some of its tailwind as well. It comes in several
parts, a slightly more complex issues. The backdrop is the airline market, which is a
substantial portfolio, about 250% of capacity. Well, the risk inherently has been very
competitive over many, many years in many entry points. On the side of that market,
there is, obviously, the (17:41) and the reinsurance market, which has been more
disciplined over a period of time, of which we're a major lead in it.
There, also, our new hires are probably the preeminent lead in the aviation war market,
which involves insuring the physical airplane rather than the people on it in the event of a
malicious act. They deviated to two products, of which Lancashire remains to lead, which
is basically the third party element of a malicious act affecting some of the onset property
with said airline. That â€“ there's a whole bunch of moving parts. The problem with the war
thing, it's going to give you huge metrics. These are all very soft numbers because of lot
of things haven't been turned off yet, but if we should suggest that on the war areas, the
market premiums are, let say, Â£60 million for easy reference for market premiums.

Bloomberg Transcript

We think the war losses so far this year, dreadfully, it probably may pan out as $600
million, $700 million. Malaysia 2, probably $110 million; Malaysia 1, $50 million; and
Mozambique, $40 million; and Karachi Airport, $25 million.
And you can see the sums on that. Historically, when there's an accident in the war
market, which hasn't happened for about a decade, prices tend to react reasonably
violently, and it's a very, very specialist area.
A lot of it is control either by broker line switch, which are basically giving you NOIs, or
other market leaders, which there are very few and we probably have the preeminent
ones who will stop writing lines down as of 1/8. How that will actually pan out or react, we
don't really know because there's no renewal market.
Business to be renewed are from some small G8 (19:30) pieces for the airline market
tends to renew at 1/9, 1/10, 1/11. So perhaps on the next call, we'll terminally get around to
have a much clearer picture on the way things are going on that.
From the aviation reinsurance market standpoint, we are in a pretty good position. We
clearly have losses on the two Malaysian losses. I thought they'd both managed calling our
attention. We (19:55) loss of cover and have a lot of residual cover left. And again, we
would be in a position to do something after a period of managing a period of very like
lines experienced over the last few years.
As for the central core where all our specialist clusters play around that, on the airline
market, the economics even before going into this year were pretty thin, I would suggest,
Page 8 of 19

FINAL

although it's one of the more capital-efficient classes.
And it's interesting to see whether there's a resolve in the market to move the thing
forward. But a look at the simple economics of what the exposures clearly are and the
cost to fix (20:32) clearly are, the time to experience are (20:36) here. And what's likely to
happen to retentions and reinsurance costs, the economics of it would need at least
some passing thought by the management. But I think it probably, relatively is a next
quarter question when you'll see people have to make some decisions, and you'll get
some clarity by the yearend, and we've been through a major renewal cycle (20:58).

Q - Maciej K. Wasilewicz

{BIO 16462204 <GO>}

Thanks a lot.

Operator
Thank you. Okay. Our next question comes from Tom Dorner, Citigroup. Go ahead, sir.
Your line is open.

Q - Thomas M. Dorner

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, there. Yeah, I've got a few questions. The first is one on the increased reinsurance
purchases that you've made. I just wondered how much lower can you take the PMLs. I
know you say in the Cathedral portfolio, it's always brought a lot of reinsurance. But for
the old Lancashire book, like how lower can you take the PMLs before it becomes
economic to do that?
The second question is on the increase in the hedge fund allocation. You may have
mentioned this at Q1, but I remember the policy dabbled in equities and then sort of
moved out of that asset class, and then moved into emerging market debt and have
moved back out. So I just wonder whether this doesn't â€“ the increase in hedge fund
allocation doesn't somewhat undermine some of the risk reduction you're doing on the
underwriting side.
And then the final question I had is on capital return, and specifically, I think you might have
mentioned in the past that you would consider buying back stock if devaluation fell to
something like 1.3 times book. I just wanted to make sure, is that still the case? And if
that's the case, what sort of â€“ what book value you're actually using to judge that against?
Thanks.

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Okay. Tom, I will start with the reinsurance question, we'll move on to Elaine for the hedge
fund. Just for clarity, we are not going to dabble anymore in the investment portfolio. We'll
actually have a real strategy and capital aligned with those. So on the reinsurance front,
we have seen very, very attractive growth in the market. We have seen pricing for certain
parts of our portfolio at historic lows or historically low since Lancashire's inception. And
that leads us to, obviously, see that as a good try to buy more reinsurance.

Page 9 of 19

FINAL

So if you looked at how much reinsurance we bought today, it's the biggest amount in our
history whether that's on the cat side or on the risk side. So we will -- all that reinsurance is
cancellable at the 1st of January. So in all honesty, if the wind season goes clean, we will
probably cancel the reinsurance and start again, and hope to improve those terms.
How far can we take our PMLs down? I think there is always going to be a limit to how far
we can go down because a line will tell me that there is a minimum capital requirement
we have to hold to keep the writing agencies happy, et cetera, et cetera. So yes, there is
a limit. I don't think we're quite on that limit yet.
But in this market, it makes perfect sense to us just to have less exposure on our books.
And if you look at our industry, we believe that the people that have made it through the
top cycles have effectively taken a lot of their risk of their own balance sheet and given
this to someone else. And obviously, you can do that.
You can either come off of business or you can buy more reinsurance. We are currently
buying more reinsurance. But you just got to be realistic about the market you're in. Now
is not a time to be taking bigger net positions, dumping reinsurance cover. Now is the
time to be buying more reinsurance cover and bringing your exposures down.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

I'm not sure why I always get the (24:23) and in terms of â€“ let me start with the cash
return. We do have â€“ honestly, there's awards (24:31) that we need deal with, and we also
have an equity stock trading shares. So -- and I think if our share prices are around (24:38)
level, then we would be quite happy to buy back at that level to make sure that we build
that back up to deal with awards. And there's also the warrants overhang, so that's more
related to the debt with last year issues rather than treasury stock given the size of the
holdings in there.
And as far as the hedge funds go, it really isn't dabbling and we're much more
comfortable with the volatility in the market. At the moment, it's reduced from where it
was. And it's going to take in the equities at a much more volatile time. And the hedge
fund allocations should give us a little bit more income, but it's also the (25:14) part of our
risk management strategy in terms of hedging the rest of our portfolio and the interest
rate risk that â€“ as most of our peers will be facing at the moment.

Q - Thomas M. Dorner
Okay. Thanks.

Operator
Okay. Our next question comes from Olivia Brindle of Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, ma'am.

FINAL

Hi, there. I've got three questions. And firstly, on the accident year loss ratio, and you said
that's just over 39%, which is a bit higher actually, are there any adjustments that we
should making to that? Or if not, does that reflect a trend? How should we think about
that number looking forward?
Secondly, on the top line, Elaine, you mentioned that you'd expect just 3Q and 4Q, maybe
a modest decline in premiums, I guess, at the growth level. And given all the different
movements you've had on the reinsurance buying side, just wondering if you could help
us to work out how to think about the net growth ratio. Are there any particular changes
we should be factoring in on that side?
And then finally, on the expense ratio, I think even if you take out some of the
remuneration costs that you mentioned, it still looks a little bit high, including on the
acquisition cost side of things. Again, just wondering if there is anything we should be
extrapolating on that front. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Okay, sure. You're talking about the lumpy quarters. We do get lumpy quarters, it's the
nature of our business and 39% is probably a little bit higher than average (26:43) losses
on that. And I think if you look at the year-to-date ratio, it's 34%, and that might even be a
little bit in the (26:49) side. There's going to be more reasonable place for your
forecasting, and it's just a reflection of where we are in the market cycle. And in terms of
third and fourth quarter premium, you've heard about the pricing, I think, at property cat.
Premium will come down a little bit. You've also heard about political risk as lumpy, and I
think compared to last year, we had quite a big chunk in there for the second half of the
year. So that may come off of it. Maybe the (27:15) changes that I would see in our overall
bid.
In terms of our full year premium earnings, I don't think it ever did as far as this. And
where we were last year, there's obviously the Cathedral business coming through as well
that will â€“ just got up a little bit. So I think if you justice (27:31) for those two lines of
business, you're probably going to get something that's fairly sensible. And in terms of
the expense ratio, the amortization charge that we have is a big part of that. And that it
isn't everything (27:47) that there are also costs in there for TCM (27:51) and I think (27:54)
before Cathedral, the underwriting income and the profit commission potential, but
Darren is also pretty expensive to have around. So we have to pay for him and some legal
fees.
And also going to say there is a certainly different structure from what was in our vehicles
before. We pick up all the costs for the vehicle and charge back at appropriate (28:13)
cover that. So you will see higher (28:17) coming through from that for this offset and more
than offset by (28:18).

Q - Olivia S. Brindle

{BIO 17273762 <GO>}

Okay. So just to clarify on two of those things, so 34% accident year is probably where you
are, run rate, more or less at this point in the cycle? And then just on that experts

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. As most of my questions have been asked, I just wanted to ask in terms of sort of new
business. And specifically, you have the new team coming on board. I just wonder where
you are with discussions with any other people and whether there are opportunities in the
market in terms of new hires. And maybe, secondly, also, you said that Lloyd's has
approved the business plan for the new lines. I just wonder if you have any early view in
terms of their view towards your capital requirement going into 2015, when -- now that
the business will be better vetted down together. Thank you.

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Right. Ben, I'll just make a general statement and then I'll hand over to Pete. We are
always open to business for new underwriting things. It's hard to find top quality people,
which is why we were so delighted to get the aviation war guys. So we're always open to
new things. But in this market, unless we can find the absolute leaders in any class of
business, we won't even entertain it because the market is difficult pretty much across
every line of business. The very best people will make you money in this stage of the
cycle, so we're interested in those, but to have any grand plans or strategic views on
entering lines of business just because you knew too well, because you've got huge
expenses or your â€“ you guys have control in this market is crazy.
So, yes, we're always open to â€“ for business where we do have people. I'm not going to
add though whether that's Cathedral, Kineses or Lancashire. Quite a lot, we have â€“ if you
think about those guys we took from Atrium that really, the only reason we got them was
because Atrium is an entity 30:53. So we benefited from M&A and we expect to see
more of that in the market.
So I'll hand over to Pete now.

A - Peter David Scales

{BIO 2108933 <GO>}

Where we're at the new teams coming to pieces, there's (31:06) the aviation war piece,
which we spoken about to get in a positive manner. We also have a second team who are
Page 12 of 19

the market lead of legal premiums. And the helicopters and GA (31:17) market who live in
Lloyd's who, going forward, will produce a bigger income that (31:22) than the aviation war
line, which we will take to our balance sheet because the aviation war guys will also
operate a consociate, followed by other Lloyd's markets, which will put up effectively 60%
or 70% piece of the line going forward. And both those areas are tremendously excited,
that they're actually very excited to be here. They worked very hard. They're two team
leaders above from their garden. So I'm not going to let (31:48) out, but the two definitely
has done fantastic work in getting through the Lloyd's approval process.
So far as the capital setting goals, which goes hand-in-hand with the supplied multiple
business plans, i.e. one further shank in 2014 and one for 2015 (32:07). As far as the
capital at the moment is we â€“ Lloyd's aren't really interested in a capital charge because
we have some ongoing solvency credits that look on our funds at Lloyd's, and they are
happy to effectively take that to go forward and doing assessment on the 2015.
We haven't had our 2015 funds at Lloyd's confirmed on our business plans, so that drops
another month of so down the line. However, because Lloyd's' franchise board do
recognize these guys (32:37) those preeminent market leads in a dislocate and typical,
very much London market Lloyd's business, they've been keen to, as long as we've been
through the proper hooks, help get people back in the market because the marketplace
has been lacking some leadership in the way to take the thing forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

And there is a value in people they saw of quality. So going forward, again, is probably an
intercourse question. But we're more stabilized, we would have been through the
planning process and signed up by Lloyd's on the capital side.
But within that, it's quite hard to tell whereas Lloyd's is a black box environment. We â€“ the
Syndicate levels will calculate our own capital. And that would be approved under Lloyd's
guidelines, and then that would make lobby into the corporate member where there's
some sort of diversification between the class of business within it. And that's not a
calculation that is visible to us when get it.
So we suspect we will get a reason to go banging for a buck in terms of any additional
capital versus additional business coming in. But even though they are serious market
leaders in areas where there's been a bit of a dislocated, moving forward, it's very much
a greenfield side they need to build out and going. And that would take probably a year
or 18 months to get the books back up to where we want more to do then, all depending
on where the markets is. But at least we are in a position where we have the market lead,
the books are very clean, it's getting back to the market, and we have now (34:08)
position.

Okay. Our next question comes from Joanna Parsons of Westhouse Securities. Go ahead.
Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Joanna T. Parsons

{BIO 1558226 <GO>}

Thank you. Actually, most of my questions have also been asked. But perhaps, I could just
touch a little bit on the energy loss deteriorations that you've had in the previous quarter,
just what's causing those? Is it a trend that we should expect to see on a regular basis?

A - Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Hi, Joanna. It's Paul here.

Q - Joanna T. Parsons

{BIO 1558226 <GO>}

Hi.

A - Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

As we've spoken about before, energy losses can be complete. Up until recently, we
haven't had a huge amount of deterioration. We have had a couple in a row, albeit the
one we announced last quarter, as Elaine mentioned, has improved quite significantly this
quarter. It's not a trend that we would expect to continue, but it is a very complex area of
insurance, and the claims that we see can take a little while to manifest sometimes. So
whilst it's disappointing to get one, it is the nature of what we do. We haven't had a huge
amount in our history. We just had a couple in a row.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Yeah. And I think I would answer that. It was quite a bit of moving a range within (35:32)
years ago, and overall, for the quarter, is still favorable. And overall, these are balances
and remains good, remains strong.

Q - Joanna T. Parsons

{BIO 1558226 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Okay. Our next question comes from Chris Hitchings of KBW. Go ahead. Sir, your line is
open.

Q - Chris D. Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

Thanks very much. Chris Hitchings here. A couple of things, a couple of questions. One, it
may be that I'm just stupid or to old not to give up, but the -- can you just tell me how
much of the cost of Mr. Brindle's departure fell through the PML account and how much
went through the equity in dollar terms?

Page 14 of 19



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2014-07-24

Secondly, what is the position with Mr. Brindle on the non-compete clause? I â€“ when is he
particularly able to set up?

FINAL

Thirdly, just can -- I know it's very early days, but can you give us some help as to what we
ought to have in forecast for the third quarter event so far, the acquisition ones? Just give
us some help orders of magnitude. I 'm finding it rather confusing at the moment. Thanks
very much.

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Right. Chris, Elaine will do one and three, and I'll do two. Let's start.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Sure. Actually, (37:01) it's probably easier to just explain the numbers in that period. And
just our (37:07) cost of $1.8 million is there.

Q - Chris D. Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

Yup.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

(37:12) statement charge and that goes into other operating expenses.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Chris D. Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

Yup.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

The RSS cost of $8.2 million and the dividend equivalents that relate to them are $1.6
million. They both go through shareholders equity.

Q - Chris D. Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

So $8.2 million and $1.6 million are both shareholders equity?

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Yes. And the 1.8 (37:27) is income statement. And there goes the numbers combined in
(37:31) for the quarter.

Q - Chris D. Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

The last number that's in there is essentially the (37:06) charge, an acceleration of IFRS-2
charges. So although it goes to the income statement and the equity comp line is there, it
Page 15 of 19



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2014-07-24

goes to the other side, it goes to their shareholders equity. So it's utterly neutral.

Q - Chris D. Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

FINAL

Fine. Sorry, but there is debit to profit loss account?

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Yes, yes.

Q - Chris D. Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

And a credit, too. No â€“ so there really was -- so what's the actual negative impact on the
PML account? It's 1.8 (38:02) plus this accounting charge?

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

It is. The negative in the PML is 5.3, the negative RoE is around (38:08).

Q - Chris D. Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

Okay. That's fine. Thanks very much indeed. Okay. And the 3Q cats or competition Mr.
Brindle?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Yeah. Yes, sure, Chris. (38:23) on a sense, this contract fee, we cannot do anything
between now and the end of the year. Technically, he should start his new company on
the 2nd of January. I think that may happen, it may not. I would be surprised in this market,
I think. So, yeah, Richard's got a fantastic brand name. I am sure he could get capital. But in
this market, how do you get the business, how do you get the right underwriters. I think it
could be very, very difficult.
Yeah, I mean that he could start up on the 2nd of January. I'll be honest to you. From my
point of view, we have to compete with so many people everyday anyway. It's just not
another personnel to compete with. And very relaxed about that, and I'm very relaxed
about the key people we have. Yeah, he could definitely start the 2nd of January to win
this market.

Q - Chris D. Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

Okay. And the 3Q cats?

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Sorry. I'm just going to mute your line, Chris, whilst the answer's being given. There's a bit
of background noise that's cutting away (39:46).

Q - Chris D. Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

FINAL

Sure. Thanks.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Yes. I guess just to repeat that, the short story is we're not (39:51) at this stage.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

I think we can help just a little bit. If you are worried about the big airplanes, Chris, both
the Malaysian airlines already meant the same thing, liability. One on the second, maybe.
(40:08) a third, who knows. We don't know about that. The â€“ both the numbers were so
much what we would have the last time, which is on a 100% Cathedral basis will be that
$5.8 million bucks net before you could enter the program. But maxi share of that is only
58%. They also â€“ on a how much cover do we have basis, we renew our program (40:34)
16% saving at 1/7. And so it drops across two different programs as well. So there's tons of
cover. We still haven't priced the future. The only other piece we have in aviation airline
world will be on the range sharing side, we have a small amount of war (40:53). And
again, there isn't much clarity on what's happened at Tripoli and quite where that falls in
the range sharing side of that as now, it's closing the contract to 24 hours. And there will
be the usual shenanigans of how many events that was. And frankly, you're a brave man
to go and have a look right now to see which (41:14). So we'll come back to you on that,
but again, none of this is, as Elaine says, is anything to really worry about. And it's probably
manageable in the conversations we have.

Q - Chris D. Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

Thank you.

Okay. So far, we have one further question. That's from Will Castle (sic) [Hardcastle]
(41:43) of the Bank of America. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.

Q - William Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Hey there, guys. Will Hardcastle. Just a quick one. Could you just mention again what you
said today on the finance cost, the deferred tax (41:56)?

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Sorry, Will. I find it really hard to hear you there. Could you say that again for us, please?
Maybe speak up (42:03).

Page 17 of 19



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity

Yeah. If you could just repeat what you said on the finance cost and the deferred tax,
please? I â€“ my phone broke up at that point.

FINAL

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Yeah. On the finance cost, our debt and (42:15) running at low cost are going to be about
$4 million subject to interest rates, obviously. But it's $4 million each quarter. So that
(42:24) ongoing cost.

Q - William Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Yup.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

And the rest of it is mark-to-mark on the interest rates swaps that we have in the line
because they're subordinated debt. So you get some volatility off of that. But again,
underlying trend is (42:37).

Q - William Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Okay. And you mentioned something on the deferred tax. Obviously, you got no tax gain.
Can you say it was the next year or last year â€“ next quarter or the last quarter you said it's
happened?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

That's right. The deferred tax liability that relates to the intangible assets has a finite life
that we amortize out. That was done by the end of next quarter so â€“ and it should make
our tax numbers look a bit more sensible.

Q - William Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

That's great. Thanks.

Operator
Okay. Okay. So there's no further questions coming through, I'll hand back to our speakers
for the closing comments.
