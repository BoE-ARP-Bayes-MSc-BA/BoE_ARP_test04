{BIO 1516226 <GO>}

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We're here today to provide you with some details
of our full year results for 2015. We are pleased to report a solid set of numbers for our
ﬁrst full year results after listing. Revenues for the full year are just above €30.7 billion,
growing at about 8%. EBIT has grown 27% to €880 million, and net proﬁt has more than
doubled to €552 million also as a result on a change in tax rate as Luigi will explain to you
later.
As we announced, the Board has approved a dividend payout of 80% of net proﬁt, which
translates into €0.34 per share and a total amount of €444 million of cash distribution.
And as you know, this approval of the Board will be submitted to our AGM in May for ﬁnal
approval.
I think it's important to emphasize, in addition to numbers, that – as I said, we've looked at
a robust set of numbers. The quality of the earnings is consistent with the overall
proposition we brought to the market when we listed Poste Italiane. You may remember
that we positioned the company as a proﬁtable cash-generative service infrastructure with
speciﬁc drivers of value for each of the businesses we operate, particularly for transaction
banking and asset gathering to emphasize the superior returns.
You see that in 2015, the return on equity on that part of the business moved north to 30%
from 24% the year before. As you remember, we're not in the lending business and
therefore we don't have credit risk. In insurance (02:06) and asset management, we

FINAL

identiﬁed growth of the driver value. And if you look at how gross written premium has
moved, we had a growth of 17% in 2015 over 2014.
And last but not least, the traditional post and Parcel services are characterized in terms of
driving value, the combination of turnaround in Mail and growth in Parcels. And we
reported here a couple of highlights; operating cost on that side of the company have
decreased by just above 4% versus 2014, and the volume in Parcels has continued to grow
to 12% in the year.
So EBIT €880 million, proﬁtable service infrastructure €444 million of cash distributed,
cash proﬁtable and cash generative infrastructure. So we see this – this, as you know, is
the second time we report our results to the market as a further step in conﬁrming our
commitment to the execution of the plan that we presented to you last year.
Luigi will now take you through the details of the number, and I will come back for some
closing remarks.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Francesco, and good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Let me start with an
overview of our key numbers before entering the details of each speciﬁc business unit.
And I am chart number four.
Consolidated revenues and proﬁts increased respectively by about 8% and 27% in the
period. This is mainly due to the following. When it comes to ﬁnancial services, operating
proﬁt increased by 21% from €766 million to €930 million. This increase is mainly
attributable to lower net recharges from the Mail and Parcel business units of about €270
million, higher capital gains realized from the active management of BancoPosta's asset
portfolio of about €40 million. All of this has been partially compensated by lower
transaction fees and lower returns from current account deposits.
Insurance services revenues increased by approximately 14% from €18.8 billion to €21.4
billion, and operating proﬁt maintained a robust 17% growth year-on-year mainly due to
the ongoing positive performance of life gross written premium. Mail and Parcels
revenues were €3.9 billion, down 4% on 2014. This expected decline mainly relates to a
reduction of traditional postal volumes, which I will better detail later on in the following
chart.
Before moving into each speciﬁc business unit, let me comment chart number ﬁve. Let's
look at our client asset breakdown. Total volumes increased by more than 3%, bringing
total asset to €476 billion versus €462 billion in 2014. The mix remains substantially stable
and well balanced with a clear (05:29) postal savings collection. Despite recent
turbulence in the Italian banking industry, the strengths and reliability of our brand,
coupled with simple and safe products in line with the typical proﬁle of our client base,
continue to deliver an increasing asset base and proﬁtability for the growth.

FINAL

Let's now move into speciﬁc business unit results on chart number six. Starting with our
ﬁnancial service revenues evolution on slide number six, revenues have grown in two
areas that are essential to our strategy: payment cards mainly due to the increase of
Postepay cards; distribution fees of consumer-lending products mainly due to a better
performance on personal loans and other personal ﬁnancing products.
There are instead three diﬀerent drivers behind each of the segment that have registered
some decline in revenues. On return in current accounts, it was our decision not to have
any gains realize in Q4 as we did not see need or opportunity to reshape our portfolio.
On postal savings, it is due to the one-oﬀ adjustment that we booked in Q4 2014 when
the new agreement with Cassa Depositi e Prestiti was signed. And ﬁnally, Transaction Fees
have declined as a result of lower volume in tax payments.

Bloomberg Transcript

In more detail – and I'm on chart number seven – the measure of key points here are the
following. First, return on current accounts deposits. Lower revenues are mainly due to an
overall portfolio returns reduction of about 27 basis points. Higher capital gains mitigated
the eﬀects of the interest rates decline. Second, fees from postal savings, as mentioned in
the previous slide, the slight decline in revenues is due to the one-oﬀ adjustment that we
booked in Q4 2014 with the new CDP agreement.
Third, fees from transaction banking revenues decrease is mainly attributable to volume
reduction of the F24 tax form. Fourth, distribution fees, as indicated in this slide, we
recorded a better performance on personal loans and other personal ﬁnancing products.
This is mainly due to higher upfront fees as a consequence of oﬀer simpliﬁcation, as well
as a more long-term strategic approach to partnerships. And ﬁfth, payment card fees
mainly due to the outstanding performance of the new Postepay Evolution cards, which
has reached 2 million cards issued today.
Let's now move to slide number eight. On active portfolio management, let me point out
the following major items. An increase in average deposits of BancoPosta accounts
moving to €45.2 billion from €44 billion in 2014, up almost 3%. The unrealized capital
gains amount to €5.4 billion vis-à-vis €4.5 billion of the previous year. This is mainly due to
the favorable Italian spread reduction over the periods.
Let's now move to BancoPosta regulatory framework and capital position. And I am on
chart number nine. Inasmuch as BancoPosta capital adequacy, let me stress the three
major key points indicated in the chart. First, BancoPosta regulatory framework is fully
aligned to European standards. Second, full year 2015 Tier 1 ratio reached 15.5%,
substantially doubling the minimum regulatory requirements. Third, as already stated by
the CEO, full year proﬁtability recorded a solid 30% to return on equity versus 24% in the
previous year. All of these, coupled with the a zero lending risk proﬁle, makes BancoPosta
a unique, superior returns fee-based revenues player in the Italian ﬁnancial industry.
Let's now move to insurance services on slide number 10. Gross written premium
increased by 80%, driven not only by the ongoing increase of our life gross premium
collection, conﬁrming Poste Vita as the number one life insurance in the Italian market, but
also by the improvement of our P&C operations. Inasmuch as our investment portfolio

Page 3 of 21

Company Ticker: PST IM Equity
Date: 2016-03-22

FINAL

breakdown is concerned, let me highlight the remarkable increase of investment in
alternative products, which moved from 4% in 2014 to 11% in 2015, conﬁrming our
diversiﬁcation strategy towards a more adequate risk-to-return proﬁle. This is fully in line
with our capital requirements.
Let's now move to slide number 11. Starting from the January 1, 2016, the Solvency II ratio
has been adopted by the insurance business. Our Solvency II model is based on the
standard formula, are proved externally and covers 100% of the Poste Vita business. As
you can see, Poste Vita has a signiﬁcant beneﬁt in terms of capital, moving from the
Solvency I to Solvency II. Our Solvency II ratio at the end of 2015 is 405%, strongly
improving versus Solvency I, which was set at 113%. Under the Solvency II ratio, Poste Vita
beneﬁts from a simultaneous increase in available capital and a reduction in the required
capital.

Bloomberg Transcript

The most signiﬁcant factors in the diﬀerence between the two regimes are: ﬁrst, the
increase of the available margin, mainly due to the inclusion of future proﬁts as an
element of Tier 1; two, reduction of the required capital that is explained by high loss
absorption capacity of our liabilities due to the low levels of minimum guarantees that
characterize Poste Vita products; third, low ﬁnancial risk characterizing the Poste Vita
investment portfolio.
Speciﬁcally, the old funds increased from €4 billion to €6.8 billion and simultaneously
decreased the solvency capital required from €3.6 billion to €1.7 billion. The excess capital
will provide not only Poste Vita with more cash for further growth in higher yielding assets,
but also to the parent company with cash to sustain an adequate dividend policy. Finally,
in this chart, you can see represented some relevant estimated sensitivities of our
coverage ratio.
Let's now move to slide number 12 on the Mail and Parcels unit. On volumes, let me
highlight here. On the one end, traditional Mail volumes fell 9% year-on-year, slowing
down the negative trend versus the 13% decline recorded in 2014. On the other end,
Parcel volumes increased by 12.4% year-on-year conﬁrming the positive momentum,
mainly driven by the growing e-commerce penetration in Italy.
Let me remind you that on October 1, the new universal service regulation was
introduced. These rules imply a new and more ﬂexible pricing structure based on a J+4
regulated products and on a J+1 free price priority products, as well as a new distribution
scheme based on alternative day delivery, which will be applied to 25% of Italian
municipalities once at regime.
The new regulatory framework will enable us to better cope with the new delivery needs
of our customers and to accelerate the implementation of our turnaround product. More
speciﬁcally, the 5.4% decrease in Mail revenues, vis-à-vis a 9% reduction in volumes,
demonstrate that the new regulation is able to support the company in its turnaround
path.

FINAL

First, let me remind you that intra-segment revenues decreased by approximately 6% in a
– sorry, I'm on chart number 13. As I said, the intra-segment revenues decreased
approximately 6% mainly due to the implementation of the new internal pricing scheme
related to the recharge of the network costs to the ﬁnancial services business units. We
have already commented on market revenues and the impact of the new regulatory
framework.
Now, I would like to lead your attention through the outcome of our relevant managerial
action aimed at reducing our operating costs. Speciﬁcally, Mail and Parcel operating costs
have been further reduced by about €380 million over the period, mainly as a result of
lower labor costs, which have been cut by about €90 million. This is the outcome with the
ongoing restructuring program mainly based on operating cost reduction, which I can
conﬁrm is in line with our plan. On top of that, we are also executing on other operating
cost reduction amounted to €290 million vis-à-vis 2014.

Bloomberg Transcript

But let's have a better look on group operating cost on slide number 14. On a
consolidated basis, particularly focusing on our cost structure, overall, we have cut group
operating cost by about 2.5% mainly as a result of our actual labor cost, which I will
comment in the following slides. As per other costs, they have been cut by about €60
million over the period as an initial impact of new relevant managerial action, whose
eﬀects will be optimized during the course of 2016 and onwards.
Moving to slide number 15, labor costs are down 1.3% versus previous year. As I already
said, savings are mainly related to Mail and Parcel and are the results of the
implementation of our restructuring program based on the execution of an ongoing early
retirement incentive scheme. Furthermore, as for 2016, we envisage to continue to pursue
further reduction labor costs versus 2015, even if this might be partially oﬀset by the
renegotiation of the national labor contracts.
Let's now run through our proﬁt and loss evolution, before the EBIT line on slide number
16. Net income for the period equal €552 million, including accrual of €316 million to
support the previously mentioned early retirement incentive scheme program, recording
an increase of about 160% from €212 reported in 2014 ﬁnancial statements.
On top of the already commented positive EBIT evolution from 2014 to 2015, this positive
performance is related to net ﬁnancial income equal to €53 million. This is mainly related
to the nice returns from Poste Vita free capital and taxes for a total consideration of €381
million, corresponding to a tax rate of about 41% in strong reduction versus the previous
year, when it was equal to 70%, mainly due to a new tax regulation on IRAP related to the
deductibility of personnel costs from the taxable basis.
Let's spend a few words about our CapEx on chart number 17. The optimization of the
whole investment program for the period is part of the restructuring program. More
speciﬁcally, the majority of the investment program is mainly related to information
technology and digital platforms. The balance is related to some selected upgrade of
facilities, construction data center buildings and post-logistic operations.

FINAL

On top of that, relevant action have been targeted towards an upgrade of our post oﬃce
mainly through the introduction of free Wi-Fi and an innovative queue management
system. And even if this is not strictly related to CapEx, let me stress that the qualiﬁed staﬀ
training program for more than 2.3 million hours cumulated in the year has been
executed during the course of 2015. Please bear also in mind that the amount of €210
million related to the acquisition of 10% stake in Anima is not included in the ﬁgures.
Looking at cash generation on slide number 18. The positive operational performance,
which is a result of the delivery of eﬃciency improvements and CapEx optimization, allows
the company to generate cash for about €611 million before working capital variation.
Higher CapEx here includes a €20 million amount paid for the acquisition of 100% of SDS
by Poste Vita to support our strategic growth in PNC operations.
Let me stress once again that 2015 CapEx does not include the acquisition of 10% stake in
Anima. Of course, we expect future cash ﬂow dynamics to be inﬂuenced by the timing of
expected group's personnel terminations. The cash will be available to support our
reward and dividend policies, which, as previously stated by our CEO, will continue to be
based on a minimum 80% payout over the net consolidated proﬁts of 2016.

Bloomberg Transcript

Finally, let's focus on the industrial net ﬁnancial position on slide number 19. As per the
positive evolution of our industrial net ﬁnancial position, let me underline here that this
very good outcome is mainly related to the cash in of the relevant chunk of past due
receivable from Public Administration and Ministry of Finance.
Speciﬁcally, out of the total amount of €2.4 billion as of the end of September 2015,
during the last quarter of the last year, we cashed in about €1.6 billion, out of which €1
billion of receivables are related to past universal savings compensation, as well as €550
million are related to other receivables. We expect about €800 million to be cashed in
during this year, thus normalizing our working capital valuation year-on-year, with a
positive impact on the expected evolution of our cash generation.
Thank you for your attention and let me hand over to the CEO, Francesco Caio, for some
closing remarks.

Francesco Caio

{BIO 1516226 <GO>}

Thank you, Luigi. Very good. As you've seen, these set of results is now due (22:08)
evidence of our commitment to execution, and it provides us with a solid foundation for
the journey ahead. If I look at how the New Year started, the ﬁrst part of 2016 conﬁrms
direction of travel. We've seen net inﬂow of funds towards postal savings and current
accounts. We continued to see growth in insurance, and we have launched ﬁrst new asset
management products.
And in the traditional part of our business, we have began the deployment of the new
delivery process for ultimate day delivery in some regions, which as you know, will give us
an opportunity to continue on streamlining our operations. And in that regard, we expect

FINAL

about 35% of the voluntary pre-retirements that we plan for the year, as signing – and
signed by at the end of the ﬁrst quarter.
Now, as we look ahead, obviously, the evolution of quarterly earnings would be function
of the timing of how we manage our portfolio and the booking of technical reserves in
insurance. But for 2016, we continue to focus on the execution of the plan and are
conﬁrming tonight that our objective is to sustain and reach a dividend of a minimum
80% of net earnings.
So, that was what we wanted to share with you. And I think it's now time for you to ask
questions.

{BIO 19160880 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. The ﬁrst question is coming from Alberto Villa, Intermonte.
Please, Alberto, go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Alberto Villa

{BIO 16005221 <GO>}

Hi. Good evening, and congratulation for the results. I have a few questions, if I may. The
ﬁrst one is on the one-oﬀ cost you charged on 2015 for the restructuring plan, if you can
give us a ﬁgure on that. And on the total number of employees that has gone down slight
in 2015. Can we have an indication of what we can expect entering 2016 and 2017 in terms
of total head count?
The second question is, you are conﬁrming the dividend policy of 80% of net proﬁt. I just
wondering if you can give us a sort of an indication of what you are expecting in terms of
EBIT and net proﬁt for the year, if you just can give us indication if you expect an increase?
And the third question is on the expected evolution in terms of net inﬂows this year. You
did very well in terms of life policies, for example, in terms of net inﬂows in 2015. I was
wondering if you can sustain this kind of growth going forward, given that the segregated
fund returns are obviously impacted by the very low interest rates environment. So, if you
maybe are considering a signiﬁcant change in mix towards unit linked.
And ﬁnally, my last question is if you can give us an update on the unrealized capital gains
you have at the end of the year.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

Okay. Shall I take – okay, let's start from your ﬁrst question about how much we have
accrued in term of restructuring cost for future pre-retirement program. The impact on

Page 7 of 21



Company Name: Poste Italiane SpA
Company Ticker: PST IM Equity
Date: 2016-03-22

FINAL

2015 has been equal to €316 million, basically a little bit below what we have accrued last
year. Substantially in line – wait, that's right.
Second, when it comes to the number of employees that let the company during the
course of 2015, we have a couple of number to take into consideration. The ﬁrst one is
related to the real exits, and we are talking about 3,000 plus people. But since the
reorganization is ongoing, so it's not fully implemented but is part, as Francesco said, of
our transformation program. We have hired temporary workers to support this major
change.
Having said that, the next average number of monthly reduction during the course of
2015 has been in the range of 1,000. It is very important to appreciate that the exit that I
mentioned are going to impact also the future cost of personnel once the transformation
program and the reorganization will be fully implemented. Of course, it's a matter of time,
and it will take a little bit of that.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are – when it comes to your third question, we are not going to provide any guidance
with regards to 2016 results. As of today, we have conﬁrmed the sustainability of our 80%
dividend policy. And I think the robust cash ﬂow that we have generated during the
course of 2015 and that what we expect to generate, of course, also during the course of
this year, will deﬁnitely support a reward and dividend policy, as Francesco already said.
When it comes to the sustainability of the mix in the insurance business, and in particular,
of the gross premium on life insurance type of product, well, I think, according to what we
see in the ﬁrst part of this year, we see that the trend continues to be very, very positive
and sustainable, because as you understood from – as you have seen on my presentation
when it comes to the chart-related to the Solvency II ratio, we have margin in terms of
capital available. But also, if we look the way we are managing the assets of our
customers, 75% of that is still related to govies. And when it comes to these govies, the
performance and the return expected on this investment is similar to what we have seen
for BancoPosta. And therefore, we have margin to sustain further growth, and in the
meantime, to address portion of our investments to more risky products with IR return
(29:30) given also the level of capital structure that we have. So, I think it's going to be
sustainable, of course.
We said that we are going to work in the distribution also in the sales of other products. In
particular, when we talk about the unit-linked products, this is something that we're
working on. The ﬁrst outcome in 2016 are therefore encouraging. We will be more
speciﬁc on the ﬁrst quarter. But I think when it comes to this part of the business, I would
say that the transformation also here is starting to take place.
Reduction of – in proﬁtability on – if I understand correctly, on the active portfolio
management. While it is not a mystery, we said many time that we are invested in Italian
govies. The expected on-average return that we have today in our portfolio is 4.4% versus
4.6% of last year. But I would like to address your attention on the level of unrealized
gains. This is a calculation performed at the end of last year.

Next is coming from Gianluca Ferrari, Mediobanca.

Q - Gianluca Ferrari

{BIO 15042989 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. Good evening. I have some questions as well. The ﬁrst one is on your Solvency II
number. I was wondering if you can update us on your application for internal model? I
was also curious to know if there's any risk weight applied on Italian (32:18)? And if so, if
you can share with us how much is the risk weight? And lastly, on life, if you have
calculated the embedded value in the fees (32:27) of your life portfolio?
My second question is fees on the 41% tax rate. I was wondering if you are having beneﬁts
in 2016 or 2017 from lower IRAPs. So, if you can give a guidance on tax rate going
forward?

Bloomberg Transcript

The last question is on the new unit linked. You mentioned before. I was wondering if you
can tell us which kind of management fees are going to pay clients, and the net margin
for you after having paid the third party fund managers? Thank you.

A - Francesco Caio

{BIO 1516226 <GO>}

Let me start from the third one. We're not disclosing these set of numbers, but it's also
important for you to understand that for the next few quarters, we would like to see some
movement, but the bulk of our revenues and our asset gathering will continue to be
centered, as you know, around the traditional portfolio of instruments we carry. This is just
to qualify, we are encouraged by what we see. We start from a very low base, and we will
see that growing, hopefully, quarter-by-quarter, but it's not going to be making a material
diﬀerence to our economics at least for 2016. Luigi?

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

Well, a few words about the tax rates in the following years. When it comes to the positive
impact of the change in the IRAP area, this is going to be conﬁrmed in 2016, i.e. that we
had a positive impact 2015 versus 2014, but that will continue to be conﬁrmed like that. Of
course, we will take advantage also in the change of the corporate taxes, which will be
applied starting from 2017. And we do expect a 3% decline which should be fully
applicable to our proﬁt before taxes.
I think Francesco covered a little bit the other question that you had. When it comes to the
Solvency II, what I can tell you is that we are applying the standard formula, therefore, this
is deﬁnitely public, I think. So, this is part of the external set of rules ﬁxed by the authority,
Page 10 of 21

Company Ticker: PST IM Equity
Date: 2016-03-22

FINAL

by the regulator. We don't provide disclosure when it comes to the embedded value. We
have done for – during the IPO, but we are not repeating that.
Of course, if we look at what I said in terms of capital robustness of the company, we are
moving forward and better than originally planned. I mean, the margin that we have is
quite substantial. We are talking about €5 billion diﬀerence when it comes to the solvency
II application. So, this is going to support us also in addressing, as I said before, our
investment in more risky type of assets, providing us with more return.
We don't disclose the level of commission that we retain. We are talking about, of course,
market commission when it comes to the unit-linked type of products that we sell to our
customer, but we don't disclose that now.

Next question is coming from Michael van Wegen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael van Wegen

{BIO 6435238 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi. Good evening. Mike van Wegen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. A couple of
things I wanted to run by you. First of all, maybe a clariﬁcation. The €800 million MEF
payment in 2016, can you conﬁrm that all of that is related to past due receivables?
Secondly, the mail volumes have held up, I think, relatively well given the price increases
you've put through. Can you talk a little bit about what you've seen year-to-date, whether
that trend is changing, and whether most of the contracts are now reﬂecting the price
increase, or still a signiﬁcant part needs to be done?
Then on ﬁnancial services, I know that you said earlier you wouldn't be providing
guidance. But is there anything you can say about the level of capital gains harvesting that
you aim for, if such a thing exists for 2016?
And then lastly, on the insurance side, can you, ﬁrst of all, explain what kind of assets
you're buying in the, what you call, alternative assets, what yield it provide and what
percentage of your book you want to grow that to?
And then secondly, the Solvency II ratio, 405%, obviously, is an incredible number, I think,
in many respects. Because if you look at slide 11 and you look at the volatility that is seen in
that number, if spreads or interest rates move – ﬁrst of all, can you clarify that interest rate
increase of 100 basis points, is that risk free? And if so, why does it have a negative impact

on your Solvency II ratio? And with such a volatility, what's the right level of capital to
have? Thank you.

Let me start perhaps with the Mail capital observation, on your questions on revenue
evolution of Mail. Just to remind you, the new pricing scheme got into action, really, the
last few weeks of 2015. So, Q1 is really the right observation window for the eﬀect. What
we could say tonight is that probably speaking, we see a neutral to believe (38:35)
modestly positive impact of this pricing.
Last year, the diﬀerence that you've seen between decline in volume and decline in
revenues has been a result of an activity we've done on mix and on quality. We would
expect that to continue for this year and aﬀord to contain the reduction in revenue for
Mail about the single-digit that we kind of were talking about starting from last year.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

All right. Let me start from – with your ﬁrst question about the €800 million past due
receivable. We are talking about past due receivables. So, those are related to the bulk of
receivable that we had at the end of 2014 and which was equal to €3.4 billion and now is
down to €800 million. And we do expect to cash in that portion of assets of receivable by
the end of 2016. So, I think we have seen deﬁnitely quite eﬀective work done by the
Ministry of Finance...

The treasury.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

... the Treasury, all together by the Public Administration. And I think it's one of the
positive of this privatization. When it comes to the ﬁnancial services level of capital gain.
Let me recall what we said during also the IPO process, and why we are reporting here a
number which is the unrealized gains, which I think is going to be very relevant for you to
understand what could be the future evolution.
We are deﬁnitely fully aware that, of course, in a zero-rate interest scenario, we expect that
the return on these govies is going to be reduced during the course of the next four
years, ﬁve years. But we have the advantage that our portfolio assets is in a position to
generate also a capital gain for a total consideration of €5.4 billion, given the current zerorate interest scenario. Which means, in other words that we expect from the management
of this portfolio about €2 million, on average, per annum.
And in light of the results that I have just reported previously, I think we feel conﬁdent this
is going to be repeated this year as well. The only possibility is that you're going to see an
expected rebound of the interest rate -more than the interest rate, I would say, the
spreads in a short timeframe, because we have also hedged a portion of our portfolio
losses in order to face any potential rebound of the interest rate. And therefore, about
Page 12 of 21



Company Name: Poste Italiane SpA

Date: 2016-03-22

30% of our total portfolio asset is today swapped into variables started from diﬀerent
dates. So, I think that we'd feel conﬁdent. And after the most recent decision adopted by
the Central Bank, this is an even stronger than it was a few weeks ago.

FINAL

A - Francesco Caio

{BIO 1516226 <GO>}

And in fact, if you look at the duration of portfolio, a year ago and today, we moved one
year on, and duration is still the same. And the annualized capital gain seems the same.
So, what Luigi is saying in terms of the monetary policy implemented by Frankfurt, this is
actually providing us more breathing space and more visibility going forward around that
€2 billion mark that we've identiﬁed as the income associated the management of that
portfolio.

When it comes to the authority of assets, I mean, we are talking about diﬀerent type of
assets which have diﬀerent level of capital absorption. Just to provide you with an
example, what we are talking about is a possibility of investing in infrastructure type of
fund, which provides high yield compared to the one that we can ﬁnd in the bond
markets but are related to regulated business, for instance, with a level risk in line with our
policy.
So, there will be a more and more increase of equity, but not in a substantial way.
Because, of course, the mix that you see today is 75% govies, 11% bonds, and the
remaining alternative assets will – could change but not so dramatically. What we could
see is an increase in terms of one digit in the alternative funds, because in the meantime,
likely now, our level of reserve is moving up. And therefore, we can increase the amount
of money invested. But the answer is more equity products with more absorption of
capital. And that's why we feel conﬁdent in providing our customer with robust returns in
terms of regularization of the policy, because we have the margin that I mentioned on
chart number 11.
Well, when it comes to the risk related to the Italian evolution, when we talk about
government spreads, for instance, up to 100 basis points, as you can see, the impact on
coverage ratio is going to be higher than a pure simple change in the rate of interest. So,
the reality is that the factor – you see factored in the GAAP spread change, the risk – the
country risk – let me put it in this way. We are more sensible to a change in the spreads in
the country risk, rather than a pure change in the interest rate. That's the fundamental
truth, because we are deﬁnitely exposed to – for about 75% to Italian government bonds.
But this is particular not only on Poste Vita but also Poste as a whole.

A - Francesco Caio

{BIO 1516226 <GO>}

And you may remember that there is a bunch of unrealized capital gains in the – taken for
reserves to Poste Vita as well. And as you can imagine, this is also the size of the capital
gains, which is around €11 billion is a function of how the spread moves, hence, you see
the sensitivity you see with the spread moving up, the amount of reserves coming down in
that regard.

Thank you. Maybe one clariﬁcation, if I can, on this. So, when I look at these sensitivities,
should I perhaps interpretate the minus 91 points for interest rates up 100 basis points,
split by minus 115 points for government spread, and then plus 24 points for risk free, or is
that completely separate from – what I'm trying to understand is, is the interest rate up, is
that risk-free up or is that overall-yields up?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Giovanni Razzoli

{BIO 7269718 <GO>}

Good evening to everybody. I have a couple of questions. The ﬁrst one is on the
performance of the postal collection. If I'm not mistaken in the Q4, the postal saving
books were up by €2.8 billion compared with the 9 months. You are reporting €18.7 billion
compared with the €15.9 billion out of September. So, you had basically €2.8 billion of
increase on a quarter-on-quarter basis, which I presume reﬂects the increasing risk
aversion of the savers at year-end. I was wondering whether this understanding is correct,
and whether you can give us a feeling about these – the performance of this asset class in
January and the February whether you have acceleration of this collection.
And regarded to this again, I had seen that the other deposits of the BancoPosta were
basically ﬂat on a quarter-on-quarter basis to €39.5 billion. I was wondering – well, it's
actually the postal savings books that we have to look at as the kind of the main
beneﬁciaries of the increase in risk aversion of the savers, if any? So, that's my ﬁrst
question. The second one is, if you can give us an idea of what were the trading proﬁts
realized in the Q4 by BancoPosta?
And lastly, a clariﬁcation on the new pricing scheme that you have already mentioned that
was in place as of October, but we should see per your comments, the main eﬀects as in
the Q1. If I'm not mistaken, the IPO ﬁling, you quantiﬁed into €130 million of additional
revenue, the potential positive impact of this new pricing scheme. But based on your
comment, my understanding is that you may probably be likely more conservative. Is my
understanding correct, or is this €130 million as a full year impact assumption? Thank you.

FINAL

Well, let me start by the postal savings frame. First of all, we have to consider that when
we compare year-end versus year-end, we are also to incorporate the interest capitalized,
in particular, in the saving bonds that we have in our books. If we want to look at the ﬂow,
what we have to say that during the course on the pure ﬂow – so without taking into
account the impact over the interest, we have seen a decline during the course of 2015
twice.
Beginning of this year, we have seen deﬁnitely a change in the trend because we have
seen customers looking for safe and guaranteed products like the postal saving side
because by law they are guaranteed by the Italian government. So the trend in the ﬁrst
two or three months, it looks good.
If we look at the performance of the postal savings revenues year-on-year – I think it is,
again, relevant to remind that in 2014, in particular in the last quarter of 2014, the group
signed a new agreement with CDP, which started to take place retroactive on the January
1, whilst all the impact has been recorded in the fourth quarter.
So the performance of the fourth quarter with regards to the revenues related to the
postal savings does not look good because in the fourth quarter of 2014, we have booked
a shorter one-oﬀ item related to the agreement ﬁnalized in October of 2014. So if we strip
this out, the performance year-on-year are substantially lighter, there's a slight decline of
the revenues versus last year because of the volumes, ones that we have seen, instead,
increasing in the ﬁrst month of this year.

On the pricing.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

On the pricing...

A - Francesco Caio

{BIO 1516226 <GO>}

I think the pricing – just to remind everybody, the pricing adjustment comes in a two-fold
kind of format. We were starting with just one product, the J+1 priced at €0.80 before the
change in pricing. And then we move to two sets of products, J+4 at €0.95 and J+1 to
€2.80. And therefore, the dynamics we are observing, as you can imagine, is a
fundamental shift to J+4. That gave us also some ﬂexibility on the way we deploy the
delivery system.
But overall, the pricing – and on the regulated side of our shop, to have a bit of a positive
income rather than conservative – not conservative, I would go back to what I was saying
before. This is part of a bunch of initiatives that are aimed at retaining and containing the
revenue decline into the single digits that continues to be one of the key underlying
assumptions, I would say, objectives of this management to provide the right revenue
context for the three- to four-year turnaround that we continue to work against.

I think there was also one question about BancoPosta bank account performance. We
have seen an increase in the bank accounts, on average, of BancoPosta. And let me
remind you that the more we see an increase there, the more we can invest this money
into govies according to the existing law and therefore, we can exploit there also through
the increase of this amount of money.
In 2015, we have seen an increase versus last year. This is substantially due to the increase
of volumes and some interest, a very marginal debt we have seen during the course of
the...

Bloomberg Transcript

But I think I would add, too, a couple of points, Luigi. One, you may remember that our
overall proposition to the marketplace is that our founding values are trust and proximity.
Obviously, at the time of turmoil and fear in the market, we tend to be playing the role of
safe harbor for returning families and we've seen the beneﬁts of that at the very end of
last year and beginning of this year. As the store moves out, we will have to go back to
this more normal kind of proactive competitive standing, but it was, as I was saying a
moment ago, a good start of the year.
The second thing is that we also have some positive impacts and implication of the
deployment of what Luigi was saying to you before of the €2 million Postepay Evolution.
Postepay Evolution is a pre-charged debit card with transaction capability because there it
has, at all intents and purposes, a current account. A plastic current account that people
can come in our shops, buy for 10 years (53:53), put in their pockets and begin to
operate.
This is driving further amount of money versus (54:01) coming into our bank and therefore
providing further volume to invest. So these are overall positive trends we've seen. The
ﬁrst one, perhaps larger in volume but perhaps more transient in nature, because when
the market goes back we go back. The second one, more of a steady growth that we,
frankly, are banking on to continue to increase the deposit in our current accounts
balance.

Yes.

FINAL

Q - Giovanni Razzoli

{BIO 7269718 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

Well, I mean, I think I can only repeat what I said before. We think today that we are in a
safe position to count on revenues of about €2 billion, which is the outcome of the
expected return on the govies that we are invested in, and on the expected capital gains
that we have embedded in our portfolio, which at the end of 2015 was equal to €5.4
billion. And I conﬁrm to you that if we look at that as of today, we are basically there.
And we are also extending our duration of about six months. So, I think we are in a
position to guarantee a four, ﬁve year's visibility with regards to the remuneration of this
portfolio with a stability of €2 billion. Of course, again, this is very much depending on the
evolution of the interest rate.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Francesco Caio

{BIO 1516226 <GO>}

And the €2 billion, so that everybody is up to speed, the two components: the yield of the
portfolio and the capital gains. Last year, if I remember correctly was something like €1.6
billion and €400 million. The €1.6 billion tends to be obviously steadier through the year,
so €400 million or €500 million or €300 million depending on the opportunity we have
of the spread comes in batches. And we drive for the year end and we tend to be more
opportunistic on a quarterly-by-quarterly basis. So we book them when we book them.
So, this is the nature of the two components of those €2 billion or probably plus or minus.

A - Luigi Ferraris

Yes, hello. Good evening, and congratulations on the results. I have a couple of questions
on the – quick questions – very quick questions actually on the numbers, and then to more
topical. Just on the numbers, in terms of early retirement incentives, can you conﬁrm it
was 316 (56:49) for last year if I got that correctly?

FINAL

Yes.
Thank you. Then on page 13 on the cost side, so can you just remind us what is that
signiﬁcant drop in the cost from €235 million to €32 million, which is in other costs? So it
seems to be quite substantial, if you can just remind us of that? And also, just on the Mail
side, if you could give us – well, either the percentage growth of revenues in Parcels or
just the absolute amount of revenues in Parcels?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then I have more two more, say, topical questions. So one is on the Parcel side. So
you did 12% volume growth, do you think you are, say, growing, say, faster than the
market overall? And do you think that growth is still sustainable? Do you see competitors
reacting to your becoming more eﬃcient? And then the other topical question would be
about real estate. Is there any update? Anything that we should be aware of for the
upcoming months? Thank you very much.
Let me start on the Parcels side. The dynamics you're seeing is – we do not have yet full
visibility of what other operators are recording. We need to have some data. I think it's
important for you to have and to know that the volume growth is also an impact or a result
of our foray in e-commerce that tends to be in the smaller end of the market and
therefore, there is pricing pressure. So we're still working on balancing the cost base and
the revenue progression. We are encouraged by the growth we see. We have further
indication of our ability to compete. But as you know, pricing pressure is still very strong in
that segment.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

The question was related to the operating cost structure. If we look at the total bulk of the
cost that we have over here, we have deﬁnitely the cost of personnel and the cost of
goods sold that are under control, then we have the other cost here we are in the
segment related to Mail and Parcel. So we have to consider also the inter-segment costs.
But when we talk about other cost and we talk about a decline also in some valuation of
assets that we had to adopt in terms of value in particular in 2014, and we have some
write-oﬀ that we have done last year, plus we have had some G&A in the other cost.

Q - Francesco Caio

{BIO 1516226 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

Sorry. When it comes to real estate, well, as you have seen in our industrial ﬁnancial
position, we are back to cash. We are back to cash for €300 million, and we do expect to
further improve this cash position during the course of the current year. So we are not in a
hurry to value our portfolio of real estate. We are, if I may, working in order to optimize, as
Page 18 of 21



Company Name: Poste Italiane SpA
Company Ticker: PST IM Equity
Date: 2016-03-22

we said a few months ago, the cost and the square meters that we use, which is one of the
key condition to ﬁnalize on a successful basis also the valuation of the real estate assets.

FINAL

So that is part of our plan. It's something that we are going to do. The timing is
depending not only on market condition but also on the real cash need that we might
have.

The second question is regarding the level of guarantee on the back book of Poste Vita. If
I remember correctly, it was 1.2% at the end of last year. And given the new business at
zero guarantee, I was wondering how much this average guarantee has come down in
2015. And, ﬁnally, I have a question on the CET1 of BancoPosta. It was 16.4% in 1H, and I
was wondering why there has been a 90 basis point decline at the end of 2015? Thank
you very much.

A - Francesco Caio

{BIO 1516226 <GO>}

Thank you. On the asset gathering, we are very happy with our cooperation with Anima
and our position at 10% in their equity. As you remember, our transaction last year gave us
an opportunity to get into the syndicates with Banco Popolare, so we feel very
comfortable with that partnership at the moment, and we have no particular plans.
The focus now is really or making sure that that partnership can be fully leveraged by
distribution capabilities, and we are working closely with Anima to continue a very
thorough training program to ensure that a growing number of oﬃces are fully equipped
to provide the most transparent explanation to our customers when they ask us for help in
creating yield in the zero interest world, which is, if you wish, the market and if I may say,
social value in accompanying the Italian families towards the kind of a new category of
investments.

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

Yes. When it comes to the expected return in the insurance business, 1.2% was in 2015
and we conﬁrmed that 0% this year. We are starting from July of 2015, of course, sorry. So
we are slightly moving down of about 20 basis points, something like that. But all in all,
we conﬁrm what we said.
When it comes to the slight changes we were referring to in the Tier 1 ratio of BancoPosta,
yes, we had a slight decline, but this is mainly due to operational risk. Nothing structural.
So it also depends on the fact that when you run this calculation in the middle of the year
on a full year basis, you might have some slight diﬀerences.
