Presentation
Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this call on Sampo Group's January-March 2018
results. I'm Jarmo Salonen, Head of Investor Relations at Sampo and with me at this call I
have our Group CEO and President, Kari Stadigh; Group CFO, Peter Johansson and
Deputy Head of P&C Insurance, Ricard Wennerklint. We will start with Kari's presentation
on the developments in Q1 and before that let me just remind you that you can follow this
call live on our website, sampo.com/results where a recorded version will later will be
available. Now I'll hand over to Kari. Kari, please?

Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Thank you, Jarmo, and welcome to the conference call on my behalf as well. Sampo
Group's proﬁt before taxes for the ﬁrst quarter amounted to EUR445 million which is
slightly above the corresponding quarter for the previous year. Especially the
underwriting result in our P&C operations was very strong, with a combined ratio of 86.5%
in If, and 83.7% in Topdanmark; both best ever ﬁrst quarter results.
In If, it is also noteworthy that the number of clients is growing in all geographies and
there is a healthy premium growth in all business areas as well. Overall, I have to say that
our P&C operations are performing better than ever, on plan or above. In Mandatum Life,

the main thing to note is the deal with Danske Bank, which will be included in our Q2
numbers.
Danske Bank will pay us 197 million as an agreed compensation for the waiver by us all our
put option under the option agreement from 2007, and for entering into a new long-term
co-operation agreement. The new co-operation agreement entitles Danske Bank to
higher commissions based on both new sales and the existing portfolio compared to the
previous agreement.
Danske Bank is entitled to extend the validity of the co-operation agreement up to 15
years. This is a win-win agreement for both parties as it puts an end and cleans up the
legacy from 2007 and at the same time, secures a valuable bank distribution channel from
Mandatum Life and a market leading product supplier for Danske.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the ﬁrst quarter, we suﬀered from the weak returns in the investment market and the
weakening Swedish kroner. We are however, well positioned actually better than any of
our Nordic peers for rising interest rates, or a steepening yield curve. This comment is
based on our strong buﬀers, industry low discount rates, short duration in our ﬁxed
income portfolio and the fact that we consolidate bank shareholding into our numbers.
Nordic banks and how they are valued by the market is my ﬁnal topic. Yes, markets are
always right, but at this moment, the earnings potential for an investor into Nordic banks
is asymmetrical. With a dividend yield in the case of Nordea of 8%, we have a clear
downside protection. Today, the market has discounted future credit losses from the
Swedish mortgage market, an unsuccessful IT project, not delivering on their cost-cutting
measures, more capital requirements under SSM and no increase in dividends among
others.
It's a long list of bad news, however, it will not play out like this. There will not be any
credit losses from the Swedish mortgage markets.
Only very few top end developers will suﬀer, but not the main part of the market. This
goes also the same way for many of the other topics, and as the market gets more
conﬁdence and information on their doubts, we are going to see a re-rating of the Nordic
banks, and especially of Nordea. I am conﬁdent over clearly better outcome on the
valuation and we have the patience to wait and see it out.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, good afternoon. Matti Ahokas from Danske here. Question on the solvency side, ﬁrst
of all, the If partial internal model, which you don't report anymore, you could have [ph]
report the economic capital, is this the same thing or is there some kind of
methodological change that this economic capital ﬁgure for If Solvency is not comparable
to the partial internal model, you reported previously. And then also continuing on the
solvency side, the Group's solvency margin fell quite a lot quarter on quarter.
It's at the same level as the beginning of 2016, do you see this like 145%, 146% level as
some kind of a bottom threshold or could you see the solvency margin going down
further from these levels? Thanks.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Matti, on the internal model, it's -- actually we have a partial internal model for If
(inaudible) so the Swedish operation with the branches in Norway, Denmark and Finland.
So outside of the model is If holding and also If Life, which is very small operation and the
partial internal model is only on the underwriting. So we use the standard formula in -- on
investments.
But it's a reasonable proxy to look at our economic capital model what the Group
numbers would be. On the solvency side, the biggest change on group solvency is the
treatment of Nordea, because up until end of last year, we had to report Basel I rules
based on a ﬂoor which was very high actually. So Nordea had a REA at year-end, which
was EUR25 billion and the Basel ﬂoor on top of that was EUR76 billion. And then so
altogether REA was EUR202 billion.
So the minimum requirement was 8% of that and now the minimum requirement is 14.3%
of the EUR123 billion of REA. So that increased the capital requirement for Nordea,
EUR240 million. Most likely it will be the same when they re-domicile to Finland on
Sampo's numbers. Then, the other increase on minimum requirements comes from
Nordea's [ph] investment that increased roughly, roughly EUR80 million on the PLC
capital requirement. So we now have a buﬀer of EUR3.4 billion, but if this is with no
diversiﬁcation beneﬁts and it is with very little outstanding hybrid capital. If you look at the
ﬁxed income material presentation, there you can see that we actually internally have a
very high diversiﬁcation beneﬁt which we follow internally. So there, the buﬀer would be
EUR5.5 billion.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Is there a level that you feel comfortable on the reported ﬁgures? Is this kind of a level you
don't want to go below or how should we interpret that?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

We will go lower because this does not include Saxo investment.

I think that we have clearly overcapitalized with more than 3 billion, so if it moves a few
hundred million here or there, it's not on my radar screen.

FINAL

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great. If I ﬁnally make -- continue on that, is there some kind of target buﬀer on top of the
100% you would see as kind of reasonable or does it vary with the markets and
opportunities?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Historically, we had a 120% in a sense, minimum, but now it's probably more useful to
look at the absolute Euros.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great, thanks.

We will take our next question from a caller. Please go ahead.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant

Bloomberg Transcript

I had three questions. The ﬁrst one is the income from your new equity stakes. Where do I
see them or when will I see them? How much will they contribute?
And the second is, if you're so conﬁdent of re-rating [ph] for the Nordax banks, why did
you buy more shares in Nordea or other banks, I guess?
And the third question is what's -- in terms of, if I think of the group as some of the parts,
you kind of alluded to the fact that you think the banking operation is mis-priced by the
market, but how conﬁdent are you? Because you said this pretty much the same thing in
September that you felt, you know, the prospects in Nordea were very good, and I guess
the market hasn't quite seen it that way, since where does your conﬁdence come from?
Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Well, I think that I'm quite bullish, and I can really not say much more than what -- what I
said that. I see a clear, or let me say so that you saw Nordea issue a subordinated paper at
3.5% return, and then you see a share trading at 1.1 times book at and having an 8%
dividend yield. So something is wrong here in how the bond market prices the asset and
how the equity market prices the asset, and in situation like this, I am so old, so I have
seen this so many times.
So I think that both numbers are wrong. I think that equity like risk in bonds will be valued
diﬀerently and actually, I think that the 3.5% yield already today is closer to 4. And then on
the equity, I think that the market is always right. I'm not saying that the market is wrong. I

FINAL

have only seen these type of isometric or learning [ph] situations so many times that when
the market gets more conﬁdence and starts to tick-oﬀ of the box, their doubts or worries,
then the market will front run the news and we will see a re-rate thing.
So that's why I'm quite conﬁdent. I don't know the timing. If I knew the timing, I would
probably resign from here and just buy the shares, but I don't know the timing. So I just
see in front of me a re-rating of the banks and especially Nordea. Why don't we buy
more? We can't buy more. We would love to buy more, but we can't buy more as a
company, maybe we have to consider whether we could do that individually, but that
doesn't help our shareholders.
So we can't buy more because we don't want to become a US bank holding company,
which would be the outcome if we bought as much as our appetite would be. I think that
the market has now discounted all potential bad news into the share prices. And
especially, I think that the Swedish mortgage market is misunderstood by the investment
community, and there I think that we will see a development that there are -- there is not
going to be any credit losses from Swedish mortgages.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the other issues, I think that more clarity will come when the IP rollout, when the bank
can give us more evidence that the rollout is successful. On the cost, they have a
guidance, and the market sees that they follow the guidance and so on. Your ﬁrst
question was, how and when will we see something from the 3 investments we have done
in the parent company.
I think that the ﬁrst, which will be visible is Nordax where we own 36 and XX percent, that
there we will see a one-line consolidation.
Saxo Bank has not yet closed, so we have to come back to that when it closes, and next
we will only see the valuation change in our fair value reserve until we exit it, which will
take several years. So that's the answer on those.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Okay, thank you very much.

Operator
We'll move on to our next question. Caller, please go ahead.

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

Hi, Wajahat Rizvi from Deutsche Bank. I have two quick questions please, one is on
Nordea capital requirement increase. Is there anything you can do to actually reverse that
increase over time? Any changes to model or any discussion with the regulator, which
could reduce that capital requirement again in the future?

Page 5 of 16



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2018-05-09

And then secondly you talk a bit about Nordax, looking at their public disclosures, it looks
like they make around SEK550 million.

FINAL

Is -- will that be sort of a straight consolidation of 36%, your share coming to your account
or any other guidance you would give on Nordax, please? Thank you.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Or Nordax it would be -- is that the pre-tax number you're referring to, so it would be the
net proﬁt, we'll take 36% of the net proﬁt in one line consolidation. On the capital -- yeah,
on the capital side, so we -- we report the capital requirement goes under (inaudible)
directive, and there is nothing we can do about that.
The Swedish regulator has a Pillar I minimum which is 14.3% that means Tier 1 and plus
Tier 2 capital. So it doesn't include the Pillar II requirements.
When Nordea re-domiciled to Finland, it most likely -- this is my guess, Nordea hasn't
communicated anything on this one, but most likely it will stay at 14.3%, because if I look
at the OP Group which is of a large -- large mutual bank here in Finland, they -- they're
under ECB. So they have a 14.3% minimum capital requirement.
And this is something we can do nothing about.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thanks, Jonny Urwin here from UBS. Quick question on the underlying loss ratio
development, there is a bit of deterioration in the quarter and I know it bounces around
quite a lot the underlying loss ratio and you're reluctant to sort of draw any trends, so I
just wondered if you could tell us what you think pricing is doing versus claims inﬂation, at
the moment in each of your key P&C markets, that will be great. Thanks.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

That's actually a fairly easy question, because price changes in general are in line with
claims inﬂation regardless actually if what market you look at or which business area.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

I mean, is there any areas of rising claims inﬂation and so --

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

FINAL

Not really worth mentioning from a group perspective or that I think will have had an
eﬀect on group combined ratios. We have discussed claims inﬂation in Norway
particularly in the motor business for some time, higher now than a year or 18 months
ago, but it's really no business area or no product line that have had an eﬀect on the
group results when it comes to claims inﬂation.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant

Bloomberg Transcript

Good afternoon. (inaudible). Couple of questions left. Just on the Life business, we seem
to have gone from a quarterly run rate of about 50 million up to about 70 this quarter, just
wondering if that's something we should expect going forward? I don't think you
changed the discount rate in this quarter. So on the assumption that you don't change
going forward is 70 the new 50?
And sticking with the Life business, I think it'll be fair to say that the agreement with -- or
the distribution agreement with Danske has been at times disappointing, in terms of the
amount of volume that they have been able to drive through their branches, what
changes have you made to ensure that that will be more successful, other than just have
commissions of course, but what gives you conﬁdence that that will be a more successful
agreement going forward?
And ﬁnally, I noticed that the -- obviously the higher reserve release in Q1 in P&C and I
appreciate that these things can be volatile on a quarter-on-quarter basis, I wonder
Ricard, if you could just remind me of your reserving principles in the P&C business, in
terms of trying to assess what reserving buﬀer there might be, because I suspect it's
meaningful.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I don't think you can draw a conclusion of any run rate in Mandatum Life, we showed now
a result of 70, if Danske deal closes as it should in Q2, I think that the underlying run rate
will be lower if we already have 200 million on top there, so but we are not talking big
diﬀerences, I myself have been assuming above 50 is the bottom and somewhere above
50, but how high it will of course depend also on the investment markets.
On the sales volume with Danske, we have no guarantee that how they will perform. I
think they are strongly incentivized now to perform in their sales here, because they pay
upfront for a long-term sales agreement, so that should be positive, but we don't know

Page 7 of 16



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2018-05-09

how they prioritize Life sales compared to their other products in the distribution shared
channel, it's always a question.

FINAL

From a proﬁt perspective, I think it's important that our expectations that the relationship
will produce roughly 20 million of annual pre-tax proﬁts and then we must remember that
if the portfolio transfer had taken place, there would have been the synergies of about 5
million.
So now in this situation, the payback for taking this deal instead of the old deal is
favorable for us, monetary wise immediately with a pre-tax P [ph] of 4 to 5. However, it's a
strategic relationship and therefore it's a win-win for both parties. So Danske has now the
best product portfolio as an oﬀering from a life insurance company in Finland and we
have the only remaining free bank distributor exclusively working for us.
So it's a win-win deal. Volumes are to be seen.

A - Ricard Wennerklint

Bloomberg Transcript

And on the reserving we haven't changed our methodology. We continue to be
conservative. And so to the extent that there are any margins in the reserves, they are at
the same level level end of the quarter, as they were in the beginning of the quarter.
But you're right, prior year gains were higher in the ﬁrst quarter than what we have sort of
normally seen or guided even in a low inﬂation environment. That's to some extent sort of
neutralized a bit the fact that the ﬁrst quarter had a more normal winter compared to ﬁrst
quarter last year, for instance. So you don't really see it in the bottom line number. We see
a 1% improvement compared to last year and for me, that's roughly where we were in the
quarter one, 1% better than last year.
So I think that's roughly, what I have to say on reserves.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
And just on the reserving, was this speciﬁc and case estimates that were revised, there
was just a general speak of the reserves, the card in the quarter.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

It was actually about you know the individual case reserves and just a eﬀect of continue to
see low inﬂation. So was no particular line of business or products, bear in mind of course
that most of our reserves are with a long tail business, so you would expect more from
motor and worker's comp or liability compared to the short-tail business. But nothing
really in particular.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
And when you say 1% better than last year, that's just your assessment broadly for where
the market is now compared to last year, is that fair to say?

Company Name: Sampo Oyj

Date: 2018-05-09

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Well, that's my assessment of where we are compared to one year ago and as you can
see, we also guide 1% lower end of ﬁrst quarter this year compared to end of ﬁrst quarter
last year.

FINAL

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Okay, interesting. Thank you.

Operator
We'll move on to our next question. Caller, please go ahead.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Good afternoon, everyone. I've got three questions, please. The ﬁrst one is really just to
clarify your comment on the 1-point improvement you're saying -- you've seen in the ﬁrst
quarter. So is that basically, are you saying that the 3 points increase in the combined ratio
when we adjust for reserve leases and losses is all down to weather and therefore,
underlying it better? That's my ﬁrst question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, I just -- my question is on the Mandatum and the 200 million pre-tax gain you're
due to receive by continuing your distribution agreement with Danske. I was wondering
whether you had any plans on how you would deploy the proceed?
And ﬁnally, just in terms of the capital as the solvency II capital models for If, the gap
between the economic or partial internal model and the standard formula is quite wide
now. So I was wondering whether you plan to resubmit your partial internal model for
approval at some stage in the future? Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Okay, let's start with the 1% -- my comment was only to say that we are reporting 1% lower
combined ratio than last year. We have guided 1% lower for the full year. There are ups
and downs in this and the big diﬀerence now compared to last year if you look at sort of
general environment is that we've had a normal winter this year we didn't have that last
year. So, that's a --

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Okay, understood. Alright.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

That's the worsening, but of course, then, on the positive side of this quarter, we have had
a higher prior year gains than what we've normally have had.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Page 9 of 16



Company Name: Sampo Oyj

Okay, on Mandatum Life, we haven't made any decisions, how to deploy the proceeds.
Partly, it will be returned to the parent through an extra dividend, but we haven't made
any decisions on that.

A - Kari Stadigh

On the model side, --

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Okay, understood.

move our --

A - Kari Stadigh

Okay, no thank you.

Operator
Our next question, caller, please go ahead.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Per Gronborg from SEB. My ﬁrst question, I'll return to the Danske Bank
deal. Just a clariﬁcation on the original deal you had 75 billion in goodwill that would be
oﬀset in the gain. Will that still be oﬀset, or will you keep that good will on your balance
sheet?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

We will keep the goodwill on the balance sheet, yeah, so it doesn't change now.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. Perfect, the EUR20 million you originally talked about is a reduction in proﬁt from
Mandatum from the deal disappearing. Now Danske have got better terms, how much of
those 20 million are you expecting to get back or to keep [ph] on your P&L?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I think that we are at least in the beginning, we are expecting this business to generate a
gross proﬁt for us of 20 million.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

So it's unchanged. The positive change in number is more a round up ﬁgure.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay, perfect. Question on your running yield, you addressed your running yield in
without taking into account the currency hedges, you have previously addressed the
impact of currency hedges, can you update on what your running yield would be
including currency hedges in If and Mandatum?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No, we are not really thinking of the currency hedges. Our running yields are more or less
the same now in Mandatum, it's -- last year it was 2.4, now, it's 2.6, in If it's at the same
level, 1.5 as the year before. So currencies ﬂuctuate, they come and go, and we don't have
a number -- net [ph] of currency hedges on top of that.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Well, is this correct that a lot of part of those investments are in US dollar and I assume,
you don't have a open [ph] exposure to US dollar?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Part of them are in US dollar and we have a small open position also in US dollars at this
moment.

Good afternoon. Thank you. This is Vinit from Mediobanca. I just was curious, in the press

you just referring to the exchange rates or were you referring to motor markets or could
you just clarify on that, that will be very helpful. Thank you very much.

No, the reference is to the capital markets, not to the actual operations of -- of any of our

I mean, it's remarkable because in Life it was one of their highest quarterly results have
ever -- hello?

No, no I think I said what I had --

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yeah, okay. No, no I was curious because in Life, we've seen one of a very high, I mean
obviously, equity market gains ﬂowing in Life, probably -- yes, it was a tough-ish
environment, but you're referring to the investment market only --

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Yes, Vinit not the mark-to-market returns. They were not particularly high.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I think you're mixing up mark-to-market and AFS results here. Mark-to-market returns in
Mandatum was slightly negative on the investments.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. And can I just follow up on the underlying -- apologies for the the P&C underlying
loss ratio? I mean last year I think in 1Q it was somewhat -- the, my understanding that
there is the 1-point good weather fortune in that number. That still leaves a gap of 2 points
between that adjusted level and today's normalized winter water level.
Is there anything else you would like to point out to explain that gap or is it just volatility
or random ﬂuctuation that we should understand? Thank you.

FINAL

Well, as far as I can remember, I don't think we did any normalization in the beginning of
last year and we haven't tried to do it this year. There are a number of things you can of
course argue that you can normalize for in insurance, weather being one of them, large
claims being another, and of course prior year gains.
I tried to make an indication earlier that I think that the reported combined ratio for this
year being 1% lower than last year is a good indication of where we feel the sort of the -the performance of the business is. If you want to go into detail in the numbers, you can -you will of course see that this ﬁrst quarter was more of a normal winter quarter in the
Nordic season.
Last year it was a very, very good winter from an insurance perspective. So that's the
diﬀerence. But all in all, if I would try to do the normalization game, I would put us roughly
a 1% better than we were in the ﬁrst quarter of last year.

We'll move on to our next question. Caller, please go ahead.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Thank you very much for the second opportunity. So going back to capital allocation. On
the market -- at the moment at least is clearly rewarding the insurance business better
than the banking business. Does that -- and I know you're saying the bank [ph] will
bounce back, but longer term you still had (inaudible) you're still in my point of view an
insurance company. And what, how much of that $3 billion buﬀer could we see deployed
in insurance deals potentially? I think in Baltics, I don't know, there might be other stuﬀ.
Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I don't think that we are that much in an M&A mood right now. I don't see any -- in a way
we are a proxy for all of you into the Nordic ﬁnancial sector, and our latest investments
have been in payment infrastructure, trading platforms and consumer credits and that
means that we have seen them as more favorable. I have no plans, I haven't heard of any
internal plans to expand our exposure in the Baltics. So I think that we have a very strong
position in the Baltics, we don't need anymore business there.
On the buﬀer, we have always wanted to be overcapitalized and especially that capital
could be used in a downturn to take on more at more attractive valuations at this moment
we are not going to use the 3 billion for anything exciting. We want to stay strongly
capitalized in this environment.

We will take our next question. Caller, please go ahead.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Alright, this is Oliver [ph] from Bernstein. I wondered if you could just provide an update
on the competitive environment in your main P&C market, and in particular, are there any
areas where you've noticed any increases or decreases in the intensity of competition
you're facing. And then also I'd be really interested in more of your thoughts on the
Swedish mortgage market, and what makes you so conﬁdent that I think that it's only the
top-end developers that you think will face losses?

A - Kari Stadigh

Well, I'm so old again, that I have seen real crisis and that was early '90s and then it -- then
we had a real crisis, that is layman-wise, not anything compared to that and even then we
couldn't get that -- there were no real mortgage losses of any magnitude. I think that in
Sweden, the demographics are such that there is a real big need of new housing, I think,
up almost 40,000 people moving to Stockholm every year.
The GDP is growing, interest rates are low, certainly you will see asset bubbles and
especially top end developers might have gotten a little bit or in a big way carried away,
but loan to values in Nordic banks are such that we are not going to see any credit losses
on (inaudible) from those. The normal mortgages that for instance the main banks have
given out, they are very, very prudent, so it's not an area of worry for me.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Okay.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

On the P&C, the competitive environment in Q1 was actually -- was a very calm quarter,
especially one, ﬁnd one area where it was maybe a bit more hit than the normal it was the
commercial market, they sort of the largest segment of the commercial market, where we
have seen some increased competition and we have talked about it earlier, that that's the
segment that we think are coming up to premium increases slightly higher than claims
inﬂation, generally speaking, but other than that it was a very calm quarter.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Okay. Thank you.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Hello, good afternoon, everyone. Just a quick question on Topdanmark for Peter. If you
could explain us the accounting diﬀerences between Topdanmark in the loan [ph] and in
your accounts, and how much of this is structural, what the structural diﬀerence will be
over time? And sorry if this has already been asked, but just to make sure I understand
this correctly, thank you.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Okay, thanks. Yeah, this is unfortunate that we had to change partly their numbers to be in
line with If's way of accounts or the auditors didn't give away on this one, but -- so
basically Q1 going forward, you will see that Q1 will normally be higher, because majority
of Topdanmark's premiums come in the ﬁrst quarter, they say that around 50% .
And so this will even out during the year. So at the end of, when we report the full-year
numbers, then basically, we have the same numbers than Topdanmark. So the coming
quarters will be again, marginally lower.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Okay. That's very clear. Thank you.
