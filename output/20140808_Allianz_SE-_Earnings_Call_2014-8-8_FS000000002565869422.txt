MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Dieter Wemmer
Q2 Highlights
Opening Remarks
• Before I dive into the financial of the quarter, let me start with our business highlights page and a short view in
the engine room of the company which drives the results
• I think that we are making good progress on product innovations on the Property and Casualty side, as well as
Life and Health
• I think in P&C, it’s about really driving much more modular products for the retail segment, as well as
digitalizing the success of the products

Life and Health
• Life and Health, I think when you see the high growth numbers in the segment, it is coming from the fact that we
have broadened the answer to the challenge in the Life market
• I think the traditional answer that in these times, you can only do unit-linked and risk products to create capital
light product was extended by our hybrid products and, in particular in Germany and U.S., they are driving a lot
of successful growth

Assets Investments
• Asset Management, Allianz Global Investors had great inflows, highest inflow in their short history since they
are working under this brand
• Investments, we continue to prop up our real assets investments by the proactive investments because active
investment process is in these times of low yields really the game
• Transactions, that is just an update
• The UnipolSai acquisition has now its first closing, 725 agencies out of 729 agencies actually signed a contract
with us
• So it is moving on as planned

Belgium and Netherlands
• And on one hand, to improve our scale in Belgium and Netherlands, we merged already the management
responsibilities there some 18 months ago, and now we have actually also added the first cross-border of the
P&C entities, which is not only enhancing the management but also helping the capital requirement under
Solvency II
• And in Branding, I think we are expanding our branded football and rugby stadiums by adding a stadium in
Vienna that is now in a build phase and the name Allianz will be then on the new stadium from 2016 on

Revenue and Operating Profit
• So all these activities and that was just a short selection of Q2
• What did it do to our numbers? We are really enjoying double-digit revenue and profit growth in Q2
• Revenues up 10%, mainly driven by Life, and I will show you in more detail later
• Operating profit, even 17% up
• Next to P&C, actually, Life was the substantial outperformer of the quarter
• Asset Management, weaker than last year, but as expected for the year
• And also the Corporate segment supported with outperformance that we ended up the quarter with €2.8B, almost
€300mm about our pro rata outlook of €2.5B

Net Income and Dividend
• The great progress in operating profit translates then also into a 10% net income improvement
• Here, the growth is smaller than in operating profit because we substantially had less realized gains than a year
ago
• So how did the balance sheet develop? Actually pretty much parallel, almost hitting also the double-digit growth
in equity, where – since our payout of €2.4B dividends during May actually stopped us from actually having also
here more than 10% growth
• But the development of shareholders’ equity and our top line and risk-taking was very much parallel
• You can see that the Solvency figures in both measurements almost didn’t move

Economic Solvency
• And on our economic Solvency, we are still including the sovereign credit risk, so unchanged measurement
compared to Q1 when we would exclude the sovereign credit risk as some of our peers doing, we would have
shown a 220% ratio instead of the 205%
• The dividend accrual continues to be at 40% payout ratio and we are not changing the accrual until we had our
announcement as promised in December
• And then we will see how it is changing
• And whether it is changing, we are not giving any firm guidance here
• And I think after the Capital Markets Day, nobody actually should also expect that we would say today anything
different

P&C Segment
• P&C segment
• I’m explaining here the overall numbers
• I will then dive into the individual country numbers a little bit later on this new page we have introduced in the
presentation
• Overall, 0.9% net growth on the top line
• FX still a negative impact
• Without FX we would have seen 2.6% growth of which volume effect is 3%, and pricing is minus 0.4%
• The pricing was very positively in Germany
• It continues also to be positive in France
• The U.S. also see still a pricing of about 3%, and Central and Eastern – now starting with the negative, that is
Central and Eastern Europe, AGCS has still seen weakening, in particular, in marine and aviation
• However, with the tragic events around the Malaysian Airlines and then also the other two airline crash we
have seen in the recent weeks, that could be the triggering points that we will see going forward, positive rate
developments in aviation

Loss Ratio
• The biggest negative number is Italy
• It’s minus 7% in Q2 compared to a year ago, but it is not yet creating actually a lot of pressure on the profit
line because when we now turn to the next page, our – or maybe I’ll manage completing it here, the Italian
story, our accident year loss ratio actually in Italy is still better than a year ago because severity as well as
frequency are down on a Q2-over-Q2 comparison
• So therefore, the price decreases, it’s nothing to complain about

Market Share Growth
• Is minus 2.2% negative growth in Italy, good or bad? Well, we expect that the market at half year was at minus
4.5%, so we are still growing market share in Italy

• When we now go to the overall profitability, and I have to admit that the combined ratio story is a little bit more
complicated than in previous quarters, because we have to sort out some effects
• So let’s take the simple reading, combined ratio 1.4% improvement, but when you look at cat losses down
from 5.3% to 1.6%, that would mean an improvement of 3.7%
• When you now subtract the run-off ratio which is 2.3% lighter than a year ago, you end up into the decimal point
with the improvement of the combined ratio

Run Rate
• And in the insurance, there’s always a however, so therefore, I have to continue with the however
• We have a 1.1% worsening of our large losses
• So the little bit higher large losses are actually masking that our underlying attritional loss ratio improved by this
110BPS, which I think is pretty much what our indication was during previous quarters that we still have a very
good run rate improvement overall
• So is the run-off ratio of 3.4% disappointing? I will give you a little bit more insight into this in a moment, but
let me first look at the operating results by OE and country
• So the biggest positive swing is Germany, of course, which had a lot of cat losses a year ago and the
improvements which we had the opportunity to present to you in our July 2013 Capital Markets Day, I think we
have all outperformed any of the set targets

France
• France is also a – it’s a little bit down in operating profit but actually combined ratio in Q2 was influenced by the
storm, Ela, which hits half Germany, half France, roughly
• Italy is mainly less run-off result or it’s actually all – less run-off results in the previous year, and AGCS has a
really good combined ratio despite that it had actually to bear all the additional large losses in Q2
• And I will then come to the next page where we are showing a slightly different view and angle of the overall
portfolio

Portfolio
• We have split our portfolio into three groups
• The one who are performed in the first six months because I think combined ratio looking at single quarters only
is not really making solid statements, longer periods offer better insights
• So below 95% is the first group
• Between 95% and 100% is the second
• And then also there is still not an empty box above 100%, but I will come to this one

Credit Insurance
• Let’s start with the best group, that is 63% of our portfolio with an average combined ratio of 88%

• Big contributors are Germany, Italy, AGCS, and of course, also the credit insurance, but there was not more room
in the column, so I could only pick the best suite
• And Germany had really, in H1 year, a 91% combined ratio
• And actually, they did not benefit too much from the low cat events
• Q2 was pretty much consuming the normal cat losses
• But what is really great here is the growth

Internal Growth and Loss Ratio
• We have 6% internal growth and over the half year 3.3%, clearly outperformed expectation
• And our target for the year was at 26% expense ratio, and we are with 25.6%, clearly ahead of this one
• Italy, I mentioned already that despite lower rates, accident year loss ratio including motor is still improving
• And AGCS I think has another a very good quarter or half year of good loss ratios

Capital Markets Day
• So second group, 30% of the portfolio with an average of 97%
• U.K., you have just seen at the Capital Markets Day half year almost 10% growth
• Actually in Q2, we had 15.5% growth standalone
• France, almost made it to the below 95% combined ratio group but also the other half of the cat loss in Q2
stopped them to moving there
• But I’m confident that they have good opportunities to move to the below 95%-class
• And AWP, as we also presented at the Capital Markets Day, that is of course the OE, which is strongest,
focused on growth and also delivering it

Runoff Results
• The class, which I would like to have completely emptied by now, we have still three companies in the above
100% category
• And as I’ve said before, let me start with the runoff results
• We are showing for the whole segment 3.4% positive runoff and the three companies who are listed here are
actually consuming 1 percentage point out of it
• That means without reserve increases in Russia, U.S. and Brazil, we would have shown a 4.4% runoff results
for the year – for the quarter, sorry
• And these two effects more large losses and the negative runoff of these three countries are certainly a breakdown
on an excellent combined ratio, so you can also say a potential upside for the future

Fireman’s Fund
• So what is wrong with the three places? Well, Fireman’s Fund is a true disappointment because the target of
making a little underwriting profit this year is completely out of reach

• We have three effects – there was already the bad start and Q1 with weather-related losses
• The weather-related losses continued in Q2
• We were hit by two large settlements of individual large claims really from the past, some 10 years to 15 years
old, and certainly we have revised our accident year loss ratio assumption for the commercial business and this
together with – well, actually the negative reserve fund offer the two large claims I mentioned already

Russia
• Russia, the change in the rights to litigate a motor claim that was some – almost two years ago, the law changed
in Russia
• And in particular, the areas far outside Moscow and St. Petersburg are making heavy use of this option to sue the
insurance company after a little car accident
• And this has made the market, I think for all motor players, very unattractive
• And in particular, I feel that the foreign insurers in Russia are getting the more difficult part in this game
• And that’s why you’ll see a withdrawal of foreign retail insurance in Russia to some extent
• And we will also reduce our branch network substantially
• And we have already started to reduce the branch network, and we’ll focus on the large cities only

Health Segment
• Brazil continues what I explained already in Q1
• The IT platform issues have not been fully resolved and have been aided by a lack of pricing in the Health
segment where the inflation has outgrown our pricing assumptions so that we have now to deal with two issues,
get the IT platform fully aligned with what a Brazilian broker wants to see in processes
• And secondly, get the re-pricing of the group health portfolio done
• But we have worked out a very detailed action plan already, and I think we are very positive that we can solve
this problem ourselves without any help

P&C Operating Investment Results
• P&C operating investment results is holding up very well
• I think also the reinvestment rate is even slightly higher than last year
• That affects from one hand the U.S. but also some emerging markets, and also a stronger shift to corporate
bonds
• And we have started again, some months ago, to buy Spanish government bonds, which we had spent for quite
some time

• Now, the Life segment
• Strong growth as indicated
• Germany, very successful with our new hybrid products but also with some standard single premium products
and group benefit schemes, leading to 20% or 21% growth in revenues and 40% in new business premium
• And Germany, our leading Life company, is then also representing the average of the segment, which shows
that everybody else continues to grow strongly
• In Germany, we are certainly grabbing market share
• Please remember that on a business-in-force basis, our market share is probably 17%, or by now maybe 18%
of the market, where in new business, I would not be surprised that we would go close to 30% in market share
this year

Italy
• Italy, continued success of, on one hand, the unit-linked, although the growth, after the strong sales volume
last year, could not be repeated but we kept the high volume unchanged
• And then we had non-unit-linked business growth, mainly sold through UniCredito, our partner in Italy

Fixed-Indexed Annuity Business
• The biggest sales success is our fixed-indexed annuity business
• We have actually – when you look at the internal growth figure, that means in U.S. dollar terms, we doubled our
revenues in the U.S. and our new business volume grew 86%
• So – both are very strong numbers and that is one fixed-indexed annuity product, which is exclusively using one
Barclays index, which is a dynamic combination between S&P 500 and Barclays Aggregate
• And that sells very well and it’s also a product which is not only good for the customer but also giving us a
3.8% profit margin, which I will show you in a minute
• Besides the big balance sheet, we should also not forget that actually Asia Pacific and Switzerland are also on a
good growth in new business
• Also, our German Health business is back on track in growth, and also Central and Eastern Europe

New Business Margin and Volume
• Before we go to the new business margin and volume, let’s first talk about the operating profits. €984mm
quarterly operating profit, almost €1B, actually has never been reached before
• So how did we do this in this difficult market? The big jump is in the investment margin
• It’s a plus of €330mm
• And to be very fair, I think this result is about €120mm of positive one-offs
• And what I would actually do is when you compare second quarter 2014 to second quarter 2013, so it’s a good
€300mm improvement
• I’m memorizing these numbers, very simple

• The whole difference I cut into three pieces
• The first third was a negative one-offs from last year, mainly losses – foreign currency losses on foreign currency
investments
• The second third is really underlying profit improvement, and the last third are the positive one-offs of the quarter

Germany and U.S
• So what are the positive one-offs of the quarter? So around €120mm half-and-half between Germany and U.S
• Germany benefited strongly from its interest rate derivatives which are of course, were really increasing
substantially with the bund going down in Q2 substantially
• Then the other point is we had some additional harvesting in Germany, but not on equities
• We sold some old real estate buildings, as part of our normal renewal of our real estate portfolio
• And in the U.S., there are – there it’s mainly a positive hedge results which are the driver for the one-offs

Risk Margin
• You can also see here in this information that actually our risk margin went down by €78mm that it’s two-halves
of it, one, is a change in the German law, which we discussed also at the Capital Markets Day, which did cost us
including the catch-up for Q1, some €40mm
• That means, for the whole year, you have roughly to calculate that our technical margin compared to previous
year’s is €90mm lower
• This has been compensated by more investment margin as we are changing the policyholder/shareholder split
on the investment margin in Germany and that is also a sustainable change
• So in total, our German customers are getting the same amount as before, only the source of profit is shifting
slightly between mortality and investment margin

New Business
• So now our value of new business
• The value of new business is €380mm
• It’s a substantial increase over previous year, so driven of course by 40% higher volume, but also by nice
improvement in the new business margin, which shows that our new product generation and it is not only
unit-linked and risk business, are really addressing customer needs and are creating really sellable products

Net Inflow and Operating Profit
• We had in the quarter, which I did not mention before, around €4.2B, €4.3B of net inflows, which shows that a
substantial investments from the customers is going to our balance sheet
• And also, this substantial volume of new business, of course, did cost something – I should have mentioned it –
so the operating profit of the new business of the quarter was a negative of a bit more than €60mm
• That means, probably without the substantial increase in new business volume, we would have ended up as
€1B, instead of the €984mm

Investment Margin
• So the investment margin, I think I have almost already explained that the combination of the negative and
positive one-offs and base improvements that our new business margin moved up from 17BPS to 25BPS
• So we have given so far as a guidance that’s a normal level at 75BPS for the year
• I probably would increase it now closer in the direction of 80BPS.
• What is also important to notice is actually the growth in our aggregate policy reserves
• There is, on one hand, accrued interest rates, which is growing nice but on the other hand also to a substantial
net inflows, so that actually is the basis on which we earn our investment margin is around 5% higher than in
previous year and 5% more base times a slightly higher investment margin results then also into a positive
shift of our overall outlook for the Life segment

AUM Development
• Now, let’s come to the Asset Management category
• And I think it is pretty much delivering what we believe in the beginning of the year and what we’ve set with our
outlook for 2014
• We see a good performance based on the AUM development
• Sure, it’s driven by positive market developments
• Outflows at PIMCO continued, €20B in Q2
• Certainly still too much; however, less than in Q1
• And Allianz Global Investors, actually it’s showing really good positive net inflows
• Overall, our assets under management compared to the beginning of the year are up €40B on the third-party
volume and substantially more including our Group assets
• And actually our Group assets are benefiting here really from a good performance of our asset managers, and we
are very happy with the returns because that is certainly also a driver that we can speak more positively about the
investment margin in our Life segment

Euro-Dollar Exchange Rate
• The revenues in Asset Management based on the outflows of the last four quarters and all the developments
we have already discussed, they are 9.4% down in euro terms
• Still the weaker dollar consumed more because on a dollar basis, reduction would only be 5.8%
• So looking at the euro-dollar exchange rate – actually, the pressure from the dollar should go a little bit away
and I would expect a more positive contribution from the exchange rate going forward that would also take
away the negative
• Which is so pronounced with the double movement of the underlying and the dollar, so that we have then
only to deal with the underlying
• And with the underlying, I think we are dealing well
• PIMCO’s performance has recovered measured as outperformance on the funds

• The 12-months’ performance is at 83%
• The three-year performance, 89%
• So that means short- and long-term measurements show really strong numbers
• And also the recovery here should help us to turn around the outflow or inflow picture going forward

Operating Profit
• When we look at the operating profits, as I’ve said before, operating profit is a target
• We are quite happy with the €90mm operating profit of Allianz Global Investors, in particular as it includes the
€23mm one-off on non-income taxes
• That means without the negative one-off, we would have clearly beaten the €100mm mark for the quarter
• And that is a very strong performance for an asset manager of this size

PIMCO
• So PIMCO continues to deliver €600mm
• And actually, when you look at the operating profit, the €600mm is higher than what we have seen in Q1
delivered by PIMCO
• So overall, I think operating profit is as expected but it is not repeating the double-digit growth what we all got so
nicely used to

Corporate Segment
• Now, finishing the presentation with the short look at the Corporate segment, there are actually three or four
changes which influenced the €50mm additional profit or less losses, to be more precise
• We have less admin costs, actually €24mm at the Holding & Treasury segment
• We made €23mm more investment income based on the cash we collected from all the countries
• I presented you the cash flows and the excess capital repatriation program a few weeks ago at the Capital Markets
Day
• A negative was that actually our centralized IT unit has charged out €70mm less to all the countries but I think
that is just a delay between months

Banking Segment
• The Banking segment slightly improved
• That is more the absence of expenses due to the closure of Allianz Bank
• So we have closed this negative operating profit contribution
• And I think all the banks are delivering now a small positive profit and it is, I think, now back to normal
• So how are we then now translating the 17%-plus in operating profits to the net income number? Our
non-operating items in total are minus €39mm

• So close to the zero line
• The realized gains are about half of what they were a year ago, so that means the results this year has less volatile
positive one-offs than a year ago

Property and Casualty Segment
• The €243mm this year is actually – I think it’s a good €30mm from equity realization, €33mm, and the rest is
fixed income area that is mainly in the P&C segments playing the yield curve, whereas the €33mm in equities is
probably slightly below what you would expect long-term from the equity portfolio we keep in our Property and
Casualty segment
• All the other numbers are pretty much normal, very low write-downs, and the income tax is still at our expected
range, around the 32%, 33%, so nothing very special

Summary
And with this one, let me just summarize
I think you’ll see a great growth in revenues, operating profits clearly beating our own outlook, and shareholders’ net
income hence also substantially up, and that all was achieved with the strong capital and balance sheet growth with
Solvency ratios at expected and reliable high level
Our outlook overall, the €10B +/- €500mn, we still think it is adequate to keep it unchanged
• However, we believe that we can reach the upper end of the range, which should not surprise you

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
<Q - Paul C. De'Ath>: And a couple of questions, please. Firstly on the P&C business, you’ve obviously gone into a
quite a lot of details on the areas where you’ve strengthened reserves. I just wanted to check on that. How large are the
reserves strengthening in each of those three areas? And the second part of that question I guess is on Russia. You said
that you’re kind of scaling back the operations there. What’s your view on that I guess longer term? Would you ever
think of just pulling out entirely like some of your peers have? That’s the first question.
Second question is on the Life side. And just a quick question on the duration of your liabilities. The duration seems to
have gone up a reasonable amount in the quarter sort of over Q1. And I’m just wondering if there’s any reasoning
behind that or if there’s any more detail you can give on that, that would be great. Thanks.
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: Okay. Thank you very much, Paul. I think the Life duration, that is a – I think this creates a
question and answer, what’s the duration, of course is dependent on the interest rate level. That means when interest
rates are where they are and we have mainly – our long duration comes from Europe, so therefore, it has to be
lengthened with lower swap curve.
On P&C, well, I think when you look at the combined ratios of the three entities and I said that in total, 1%, that means
€100mm is spread over the three entities. I think you can almost do the math yourself and I think that – we are usually
not giving run-off results on this detailed level. It was only more for confirming that the positive run-off of all the large
and successful OEs is running at a very good level that we had. Last year, the total absence of negative run-offs, but
this year we are showing it and I believe we should be fully transparent when we have soft spots in our portfolio, then
we should talk about the soft spots.
Russia. I think a complete pull out is not in our strategic direction. I think it is – really the issue is here, that in the
countryside, the interaction between courts, lawyers and the customers are for us too in-transparent. Therefore, we
prefer to stick to the areas where we better understand what is going to happen.

And also, of course, Russia is under the caveat that we have now also evaluate whether the European and U.S. sanction
will, to some extent, limits the Corporate business that is, as we speak, probably unpredictable. But long-term, I think
the situation is probably improving again and then also Russia is an important market for us for the large customers and
our international customers which are all doing business in Russia.
<Q - Jon M. Hocking>: I’ve got three questions, please. I wondered if you could give a little bit of color on PIMCO.
You seem to be very confident that the performance is improving. I wondered if you could give us some color in terms
of how you’re seeing flows with retail vs. institutional and what’s the commentary you’re receiving from institutional
intermediaries is whether they’re worried about performance and governance of PIMCO. That’s the first question.
Second question. I wondered – you mentioned large losses, and you’ve specifically talked about Fireman’s Fund, but I
wonder, are there any other trends in large losses either by a country or a line of business? Second question.
And then thirdly on Solvency II, you mentioned getting your economic capital numbers that you’ve included sovereign
asset charges. What are your discussions with BaFin? Do you think this is going to be something which is going to be a
fundamental part of Solvency II or do you think there’s a chance you’re going to reverse this from your final Solvency
II calculations? Thank you.
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: Okay. Jon, just a second. You were so fast at speaking, so I was writing down your questions
that I’m not forgetting any. PIMCO actually is a – the biggest outflow number comes from retail and that is very visible
when you look at our mix.
We had a year ago 35% of the business – or the money was retail money, and now we are down to 33%. So that
2-percentage-point shift shows that retail is still most of the outflows. Of course, there is also some institutional
outflows, but I think institutional is less driven by PIMCO. It’s much more when institutional investors decide that they
do something completely different with their money. And there are two reasons a corporation could use the money for
operating expansion and if they do a total shift in asset classes, if somebody wants Japanese real estate, certainly we
cannot offer this from our two asset managers. So therefore, there is also sometimes that investors change completely
their investment strategy.
But overall, I think that the discussions with institutional investors are still quite positive. And actually, Allianz is the
largest institutional investor in PIMCO with close to €300B. And I can tell you, our investment margin in the Life
business would not look stable and good when they would do a bad job.
<Q - Jon M. Hocking>: [indiscernible] (45:03).
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: That is simple. And we are not – we are also – PIMCO is running fiduciary obligations
towards their customers and we do the same. And our Life managers could not stay with the PIMCO funds when it
would be under pressure in the performance, and we have to play it here very much arm’s length. And I can tell you,
we are quite happy with the development.
<Q - Jon M. Hocking>: You’re comfortable that it’s not just the institutional clients are reacting a little slowly to the
historic performance issues in the last few quarters?
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: Well, that I cannot exclude it, because I’m not speaking to every institutional investors. So –
but I think in the end, it is about the true performance of an asset manager, and the institutional investors are usually
much more rational when doing their investment decision.
I think a retail customer is not the only one influencing the decision. There is also always an advisor in between, and
usually switching funds from one firm to another, it’s for the advisor, usually a good job.
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: I forgot the large losses, sorry. Sorry, Jon. The large losses is – that is pretty, pretty easy. I
don’t think that there is any trend. We had at AGCS two big losses. One was – well, actually, two are – both are related
to the oil industry. One in Far East Russia and one in another place. So that are the two big individual losses. And I
would take this as business as usual.

And on Solvency II, your question on the sovereign bonds, I assume that there is more a trend in the EU that sovereign
risk would be included. So I think the whole overall judgment goes more in trend to include it and not to exclude it.
<Q - Farooq Hanif>: First one, just on what you mean by the sovereign charge. Is this the same as the 10-basis point
deduction from swaps or is it a specific charge for spread risk in government bonds? Just want to understand exactly
how it’s working. That’s question one.
Secondly, in light of your still strong economic capital position, can you talk about some of the asset allocation shifts
you would be making to counteract below yield environment? And related to that, can we therefore expect the actually
realized gains in harvesting as part of the operational results in Life could be something that we continue to see for a
while in your numbers? Thank you.
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: Farooq, yes. I think a stable harvesting is certainly what we want to achieve and I can maybe
give it in more detail on the P&C segment, because there the calculation is easier as we don’t need to split it with the
policy holder. We have roughly €6B at the moment in equities in P&C and of course, I’m not talking about it whether
we would increase it or decrease it, because that would potentially influence the markets.
So €6B should allow us to create €180mm to €200mm a year on realized gains only in this segment, and when you see
that we had included this quarter only €33mm, so that is certainly below a long-term average line. So that part I would
see continue. And I think on the bond portfolios, as long as the steepness of the interest rate curve is not changing, I see
also a continuing of our realized gains from the debt portfolio.
Our other investments, that will take more long-term, because what we are expending currently in real estate, we are
not planning to turn these buildings around in the short-term, that are more longer-term developments. And the
infrastructure investments and our investments in wind parks, that is mainly held to maturity of illiquid assets that is
just supporting our base investment income, which I think is also holding up nicely.
<Q - Farooq Hanif>: Can I just interject very quickly on that? I mean are you assuming that this is going to use up
economic capital, or was it economic capital-neutral in everything you’re doing?
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: We have allocated more economic capital over the last quarters. On the other hand also, our
overall risk management has actually also freed up economic capital. For example, when you’re lengthening your asset
duration and you reduce your gap, then you free up economic capital and this freed up capital, we have then reinvested
in more risk taking.
So therefore, lengthening of the portfolio is, on one hand, consuming those capital; on the other hand, freeing up. So
therefore, it’s probably allowing us to create more spreads without using up capital. And your sovereign risk charge,
no, I think on sovereign bonds what we have included in our calculation is going full distance. That means spreads,
defaults, migration risk, all included like a corporate bonds.
<Q - Andrew J. Ritchie>: Just one question, following up on the last question. I’m slightly confused on the new – on
the reinvestment strategy in P&C. It sounds like you’re encouraging us to think that you are going to continue with
high levels of realized gains on bonds. Surely, that will accelerate the running yield at the time. I’m not sure how that
generates economic value. So what exactly are you doing on the reinvestment side in P&C and why – when you said
you’re playing with your – the yield curve, are you seeking to buy longer duration, sell short, or just – I’m confused. To
clarify that would be helpful.
Secondly, in your introductory remarks, you used the phrase not yet in reference to Italian P&C profitability as in it had
not yet deteriorated. Are you expecting that this year? Do you have any view on whether frequency and severity starts
to normalize a bit, or whether we’ll start to see more of an impact of lower rates coming through, lower pricing coming
through?
And then final question, in the U.S., you talked about you had changed accident year loss picks, as well as prior-year
reserve issues. I mean, that often is an indicator that you might start to look at reserves in general again. So is there
going to be more reserve review of Fireman’s Fund in H2? Thanks.

<A - Dieter Wemmer>: Okay. Starting with P&C, I hope it was not too confusing, but actually, when you have a bond
which still has a 3% coupon and that was a 10-year bond and it is now approaching the last two, three years, the total
return you make in the last two years of a bond is, well, is 0.3%, 0.4% or something like this because the...
<Q - Andrew J. Ritchie>: Because of the pull to par?
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: Yeah, but still, you are not earning anything anymore in the last two years. Therefore, it
would be completely wrong to wait the last two years of a maturing bond. You better turn it around and reinvest it in a
longer-term bond. That is pretty much because you are economically keeping the money for 40BPS, 50BPS in the last
two years.
<Q - Andrew J. Ritchie>: Okay.
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: So why would you do this? Because you can – that is when you go again seven years, eight
years, you are still getting more than 40BPS, 50BPS. Sure, that is a total value and market value consideration. It is not
the consideration only of running yield. But I think you should also see that in total, we can also, with the strategy,
afford to create the realized gains because our running yield in P&C stayed pretty much up.
<Q - Andrew J. Ritchie>: What are you – you’re reinvesting longer duration though than you have been.
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: Yeah. Yeah, well, I think you have a bond which matures in 2016 and you sell it now because
the last two years, you are earning – you have a decline in market value vs. the coupon. So the net-net out of the two is
40BPS. And instead of cashing in the 40BPS the last two years, you are now reinvested still at 2.5% or 3%. And that is
the additional value you are creating by this activity.
<Q - Andrew J. Ritchie>: Okay. I might revert...
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: Are you doing something different with your own portfolio?
<Q - Andrew J. Ritchie>: I mean you’re reinvesting at lower rates. So...
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: Yes. But the total value you get out of both is still – if you add both sides of the equation, you
get more than keeping it.
<Q - Andrew J. Ritchie>: Okay. I’ll revert offline on this one.
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: Yeah. Yeah. I think you need investment advice.
<Q - Andrew J. Ritchie>: I mean I guess I was interested what are you reinvesting in, in the P&C? I mean, obviously,
you’re not investing in German bunds at this point, or at least that’s not [indiscernible] (56:37)
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: No. German bunds are actually at the moment blacklisted not because we are [indiscernible]
(56:43) country but with 1% return for 10 years, we are absolutely not happy with the 1%. We are certainly more
reinvesting into corporates than before. We are also – we have opened up again a little bit our investment into Spanish
government bonds, so which also helps our average, and that is I think the main change on the P&C side. And we have,
over the last two years, increased slowly, but also supported by market, is equity allocation.
<Q - Andrew J. Ritchie>: Okay.
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: So Italy. The word not yet – and maybe I need English training – instead was only referring to
the fact when people are seeing, renewal rates are 7% down, that actually our accident year loss ratio is still improving.
And I am not linking the severity and frequency improvement to the Italian economy. I think it is still our continued
selection in the Asian channel. So certainly...
<Q - Andrew J. Ritchie>: So it’s structural, not a cyclical?
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: Yeah. And – but I think we have to be very careful. Certainly, the Unipol portfolio will not
come in at the same average combined ratio as our current Italian portfolio and that is – if you look at the pricing of the

transaction, then Unipol would have done a very bad deal when they would sell a 80% combined ratio business at such
a price. So therefore, there will be a mix, certainly a higher combined ratio in Italy at year-end, but we will disclose
completely what is old portfolio, what is new portfolio, and what are the mix effects.
And in the U.S., certainly U.S. reserves have to be reviewed very carefully every year, but when we would have today
any indication for increased reserve needs then we would have booked it. If it is different in a few months, then we’ll
let you know.
<Q - Andrew J. Ritchie>: So – but you’ve increased, to be clear, the current accident year loss picks, is that right?
You said I think...
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: Yes, we increased. I think the underwriting improvements which were planned were not
achieved in this way and therefore, we took a more conservative step.
<Q - Michael I. Huttner>: I hope you can hear me. I’m on my mobile. Two questions please. On the Russia and
Brazil and the U.S., you said €100mm roughly is the reserve amount and I worked out – I’m really good at math here.
So, I’m joking. That the total underwriting loss for those three countries was around €200mm. I think the slide figure is
about €195mm. So it implies there is also €95mm in terms of a – still above 100% combined ratio for those three
countries.
Can you talk a little bit more because reserve additions plus actual claims, I know you mentioned to Andy Ritchie that,
yeah, the U.S. is [indiscernible] (01:00:26) it seems weird. Normally, it’s either one or the other. Here, we see both, and
I’m just wondering a little bit what is happening and what we could expect for the next quarter here.
And on the other thing, you mentioned on the dividend, December, I thought the decision would depend on the
Solvency II and that could be November. But I heard you say – and I may be wrong – December, and I just wondered if
you could just comment on that. Thank you.
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: You are giving me all a hard time today. So I thought that we had such great results. Starting
with the P&C, yes, it is true that the run rate of the three is above €100mm also on an accident year combined ratio.
And in the U.S., we had the weather-related impact and then the, what I said the change in loss picks for the accident
year, so both are resulting in a combined ratio above €100mm. If you look at the half year or Q2 combined ratio for
Russia, it’s €160mm if I’m not mistaken, €165mm precisely.
So that is also – it is absolutely not making money. And in Russia, the retail third-party liability premiums for motor
are defined by the government, so you cannot change your pricing. If you could change your pricing, the Russian
market would be easy. I should have mentioned this that this is a fixed tariff. So therefore in the end, the only thing
what you can do is close the shop and don’t write new business until the pricing and the losses are in balance. So I
think that is the more important point.
In terms of the dividend, we said always, yes, somewhere at year-end, we will tell you what will be the new number for
the year. I think we have all understood your expectations. You have all seen that we have a range of options and I
think we come together at year-end to Solvency II numbers, probably at some point stabilizing. That is, beside
Solvency II, we are also a systemic important company. There are also some capital requirements coming from this
calculation. So we have to take a decision here at some point and see how we can work through it.
<Q - Michael I. Huttner>: Brilliant, that’s very helpful. And sorry, I wasn’t trying to give you a hard time, they’re the
only bits [indiscernible] (01:03:31).
<Q - Thomas Seidl>: A number of questions here. On the P&C side, the rate changes have come down again this
quarter. I think we are now at a level where this is below expected inflation. Is it fair to assume that the P&C segment
hence has reached a certain peak in terms of the performance here?
Secondly, on the Life side, you mentioned these enormous growth rates. I wonder as a CFO, don’t you get nervous
when you see such enormous growth rate in a mature market, and what makes you comfortable that Allianz is not

suffering what is called the winner’s curse here?
And thirdly, on Yap■ Kredi. There is a quite substantial drop in volume on the non-Life side, I wonder would you buy
Yap■ Kredi at the same money that you bought it for, and hence should we expect some goodwill impairment, I think
it’s €220mm on Yap■ Kredi?
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: I’m happy to start with Yap■ Kredi. I think we are far away from a goodwill impairment.
Certainly, the Turkish P&C market was always very sensitive to underwriting profits and remember that over the long
run, Allianz and Yap■ Kredi were always a winner in this underwriting game. And when the market is, in some areas,
too soft, then we have just to be careful this writing new business and I think the profitability is more important.
But what has really made up for it is a substantially higher investment income which is, I think, we calculated the
transaction with a 6% yield and Turkey is, I think, in the double-digit area for – even for short-term money.
On the Life side, yes, certainly, in the German markets it’s a flight to quality. I think, in Germany, all our products are
priced very sensible. I think we are only promising what we can really deliver over the long run. I can tell you that that
the regulators and as part of the systemic process, they are all over us with long-term scenarios and calculations so that
means that our knowledge of scenarios and long-term risk is substantially higher than it was in the past. So we are also
learning with these processes but the learning is very positive in the sense that we are maybe even more confident on
our Life business than we were before.
And look at our reinvestment yield which is very stable y-over-y. And the risk we are taking, I think we are still
comfortable from a risk management point of view. The other big growth driver is actually U.S. There, we are selling,
in principle, one product that is one fixed-indexed annuity special product. I think we have done all our testing. We
have looked at it. Nobody got very nervous over this product. So as long as we can sell it at this large volumes and
actually the scale effect is very positive.
I did not mention this that the U.S. improvement in new business margin is driven on one hand by the pricing and the
market impact, on the other hand, but also by the volume impact. We are clearly now – instead of having an expense
overrun, we have an expense under-run which of course helps the new business margin.
The P&C rate changes, yes, they have peaked on average in the portfolio, where Italy is probably the biggest
contributor at the moment. I think that will also come down at some point in Italy. And I think that – when I look at the
aviation market, that would be, for me, the area where probably the first positive rate changes will take place this year.
Aviation is an interesting line of business. We are, I think, overall, probably the largest or at least one of the market
leaders. The rates went down since they peaked after World Trade Center event. So we have seen a slight decline in
aviation rates for more than 10 years by now. And I think 2014 is certainly a triggering event with – not only with the
tragic events around Malaysian Airlines, also with the other crashes we have seen in the last month that aviation rates
are probably going up.
So it is a mixture. I think we can drive our profitability. And I think the biggest improvement area is, for me, actually
the three highlighted countries where you are rightfully asking me a lot of question around. But actually, what was
more – the idea is that we are actively managing our overall portfolio, and we are not shying away from the soft spots
and share with you what we are going to do.
<Q - William S. Hawkins>: I’m not having a go at you but coming back to Fireman’s Fund. Can you just clarify a bit
more what you mean in the slide by accelerated improvement plans? I mean, you’ve given us some information, but my
feeling at the end of Q1 was that you were very clear that there was a cost overrun problem in the U.S. and that was
what was being addressed. You haven’t really mentioned cost this time when you’ve been talking about the U.S. And
so it seems like much deeper problems have emerged. So I mean, in that context, can you just tell us what you mean by
accelerated improvement plan?
And then secondly, again, the aviation losses in Q3. Is there any figure or sort of range that you could give us for what
those might mean for Allianz? Thank you.

<A - Dieter Wemmer>: Yes. William, I’m happy to start this aviation loss of third quarter. This tragic situation in
Eastern Ukraine where the plane was probably shot down, we are only covering half when it was a normal accident.
When it was an act of war, we are not a member of the consortium who are leading the war coverage. So then we
would only participate in the liability case and you can put a range about it, but it’s an average large loss, and nothing
very spectacular to see in due course. I don’t know, maybe between €20mm and €30mm. And actually the other
aviation losses we have a very, very tiny participation and that would not even make it to a mid-size loss.
<Q - William S. Hawkins>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: So Fireman’s Fund, well, accelerated improvements and management action means to me to
look at all levels and do whatever you can do. Therefore, expenses are not excluded.
<Q - William S. Hawkins>: But just to be clear again. I mean you’ve answered this question – well, you’ve had this
question a couple of times but this is now no longer an issue of just expenses. We are back in underwriting the reserve
and problems as well.
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: The reserve – maybe I have not explained this well. The reserve increases were linked to two
large losses. So it’s not that an actuary looked at it, no. The lawyers settled two large losses and the lawyers did not
look at the actuarial papers before. And therefore, we are now paying more than what we had in the case with us.
<Q - William S. Hawkins>: Okay. So I think you – again, in comment to another question, you’re not shifting to a
view where there may be a systemic problem with the reserves in Fireman’s Fund?
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: No. I think we had a review in Q2 asbestoses and environmental, so that has been reviewed
and also revised. That is P&L neutral because we are keeping a high asbestoses reserve at the center and that is an
expected development in the U.S. And that part is therefore neutral for Fireman’s Fund.
<Q - Nick Holmes>: Two questions. First, is with U.S. Life. Wondered, can you tell us more about the risks with the
fixed-indexed annuity products, in particular how worried are you that you’re putting on a lot of interest rate risk?
Because I think that is the principal risk with the product. And indeed, I mean, you’re selling the product because
basically you expect rates to rise.
And the second question, just looking at some P&C in the expense ratio, there’s been a bit of improvement in Q2. And
I just wondered if you could remind us how much further improvement you think is possible? Thank you.
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: The last question was improvement on what? Sorry.
<Q - Nick Holmes>: Sorry. The P&C expense ratio, there was a bit of improvements in Q2. I just wondered if you
could give us a bit more background about some scope for improvement in P&C expenses, is a general question.
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: Well, I think the 30BPS we probably carry through, through the rest of the year that were not
one-offs. I did not mention that our net earned premium actually grew 3% in Q2 vs. 1% on the gross top line, and that
is the reinsurance program, which we explained where we are changing our reinsurance purchases. So that we have a
slightly better growth on the earned premium vs. the overall premium, that’s absolutely correct.
Fixed-indexed annuity products are not taking interest rate risk. Fixed-indexed annuity products are not – the deferred
annuity component is absolutely cash flow matched. Then there is this equity option or the option linked to the
underlying fund that we are dynamically hedging. And actually, there are – and when you look at the whole space of
fixed-indexed annuity players in the U.S., that are the five, six companies, there is – we had last year the private equity
guys who entered our two carriers market and they’re also the players which are competing with us for a long time.
I think we are the market leader. We had 16% market share over the last five years on average. I would say, we are
probably, with Q2 number, substantially higher in market share, that is my guess. And there are two options in the
markets. Some players are buying with each tranche of new business a fixed hedge in the market and not touching the
hedge at all, over time. We are a bit more sophisticated in our hedging program that we won a dynamic hedge. And
actually, also, using a little bit the – actually, the offsetting co-relation between our VA book and the fixed-indexed

annuity book which allows us to be a little bit more efficient on the hedging. So therefore, we are not taking any
interest rate risk with this business.
<Q - Nick Holmes>: On the...
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: Only when the interest rates are higher, the pricing of the product on the day of sale is easier.
When you have zero interest rate and it is hard to split zero percent between customer and shareholder, so that makes
the pricing of course more difficult. And additionally, when hedging would become more expensive due to higher
volatility or other market factors, we have actually a variable expense charge in the product. That means, on a three
months basis, we could adjust our expense charge going forward to catch up with potential other costs in the hedging
program.
So I think that is a straightforward product. And as I explained, our fixed-indexed annuity products, the equity option
we have to hedge is a mix of S&P 500 and Barclays Aggregate, there is also almost no base risk in hedging these two
indices, because that are the most common indices you can think of. So therefore I’m pretty comfortable with the
current product generation.
<Q - Nick Holmes>: Thank you for that. That’s very interesting. Perhaps, I can slightly rephrase the question, which is
with that fixed-indexed annuity book, what would your view of the impact of rising or falling rates, interest rates in
America be?
I mean, would it be if rates do rise, would you see that as positive, presumably your margins could expand? Whereas if
rates were to fall, would you think that you are completely hedged forever on this book?
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: Hedged in the sense of the business in-force, yes. If we talk about future new sales volume,
that has of course a sensitivity towards the interest rate market. Although, I think that this current index, which goes
between S&P 500 and the Barclays Aggregate, I think that has a lot of elasticity even if U.S. rates would continue to
fall.
If interest rates going up, I think then the pricing of the new business volume is anyway easier and the attractiveness for
the customers comes very well. And worst-case, our new business margin goes slightly backwards from the 3.8% and
that is still then a very profitable book, which generates profitability which enhances our overall segment profitability.
So underlying y-over-y, I think the new business volume of the last 12 months has probably created some €50mm is
clearly – €50 million-plus in operating profits. And what you have to consider on a fixed-indexed annuity policy, the
customer pays in the cash and we are investing the cash in a matched asset portfolio, and the hedging is only done for
paying out this embedded equity option which gives a little upside for the customer but it is not changing risk profile
for us as a shareholder.
<Q - Nick Holmes>: Understood. And sorry, just one final question which is given the volumes you’re writing, do you
have a sort of limit on the volume that you see going forward because, I mean, if you continue to grow at this pace, you
will turn into a U.S. life company?
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: Well, look. Prudential also gets all the volume from the U.S. and is still seen as an Asian life
company. So I’m pretty happy to inherit the P/E of Pru.
<Q - Nick Holmes>: No, that’s a very good answer. But is there a sort of limit that you’ve got or are you happy to just
carry on growing at this sort of level?
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: I think we carry on growing with this product. We have still a limit on our VA volume and we
are not lifting our limit on the VA volume.
<Q - Atanasio Pantarrotas>: Three quick questions, I hope. First one on the reinvestment yields in P&C, you
mentioned that there was 2.5% in H1. However, I guess, now is a considerably lower given that the narrowing spread
also, for example, Spanish government’s yield for three years, four years maturities below 1%. Second question – so if
you can provide what could be now the reinvestment yield in P&C.

Second question again on the sovereign charge in Solvency II, according to you, is there any chance that only the
cross-border investment would be penalized in term of capital or you consider that every bond investments also saw –
also if a company invest in its domestic government bond markets would be penalized?
Final question on your acquisition on the Unipol portfolio, I know that it’s a work-in-progress, but what is your target
in term of combined ratio, at least your target range of combined ratio for the portfolio acquired? Thanks.
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: Yeah. I think we will not disclose the target combined ratio for the Unipol acquisition. I think
that would be – certainly, we have a business plan but actually, we are not disclosing business plans to this detailed
level. Sorry, Atanasio, you have to understand this.
<Q - Atanasio Pantarrotas>: Okay.
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: The reinvestment yields today compared to Q2 numbers, I think you probably have to expect
that it is 10BPS, 20BPS lower. The sovereign risk topic, that is a widely discussed topic among all the European
insurance groups as well as the regulator among each other, and there are various scenarios floating around. There is
the question should it be excluded completely, should there be a mix solution where only cross-border sovereign bonds
are being treated like corporate bonds, but the whole market buyers would allow to consider it still as risk-free, or the
full treatment as corporate bonds.
All variations are in the room, and the only statement I have made is there is a higher likelihood that there will be some
form of risk charged for the corporate bonds – for the sovereign bonds whether it will go to the 100% of the corporate
bond or some middle ground that that could be – but I think that it’s at the moment changing in so [indiscernible]
(01:25:30) time that it’s almost not worthwhile to speculate.
<Q - Atanasio Pantarrotas>: Okay. And your model is built according to make a capital charge also on the domestic
bonds or only on the cross-border investments?
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: In our own calculation, full distance.
<Q - Andy D. Broadfield>: A couple of questions, please. I will come very briefly back to that Solvency II question.
You mentioned – I think when you first introduced it into the model at the beginning of the year a comment, which
referred to the fact that financial services should all be treated the same and that the introduction of this into the banks
would be quite a considerable charge for them and that that would create some considerable level of disorder and that,
therefore, that was something that the regulators need to think about. Just wondering what your updated view is on that
because it seems to me that you’ve taken a slightly more – a slightly harder view assuming that there will be a charge.
That’s question number one.
Number two, if for a Friday afternoon you allow me to dream for a moment, the German P&C business has been a
long-term work-in-progress and it’s really starting delivering or really not starting delivering, it is delivering. How
much further do you think this can go, because I get the sense that the momentum has only really started building,
we’re only a year or two into that momentum, in fact, in terms of delivery, yet it’s already delivering great results and
great growth. So what do you aspirationally think you can do in Germany?
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: I think I will – let me start with Germany and the delivery of the P&C result. It is true they are
outperforming the targets and it is really a great success of the management team which is at the moment also very
happy with what they have achieved. And they should be really very proud about it. Our – fairly, I would say,
optimistic uplift of that we go to the upper end of the range in our outlook. I think it’s certainly based also on the fact
that that we trust very much into the German delivery. So now to lift the numbers for 2015, I’m giving new public
targets I think that the half-year results might not be exactly the right place to do this. And therefore, we should do this
when it is the appropriate time.
Andy, on this level playing field topic, I think that it’s really close to my heart, and I have really to look at the
sovereign risk charge here in two ways. On one hand, I have to put into our model what we are, in the end, are being
forced to include as the reg – our regulator tells us without the sovereign risk charge, your model has no chance for
approval, then it would be hard to fight it. On

The other hand, I will not stop saying that the level playing field amongst the insurance industry and also between
insurers and bankers is a must. And if regulators are currently falling short of it or potentially are falling short of it, then
we will certainly continue to highlight it at every opportunity.
<Q - Andy D. Broadfield>: I’m a bit disappointed with your German answer. I might ask it again, I’m just hoping you
might change your answer, which you…
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: I enjoy the 91% combined ratio of H1, and take it as booked and planted.
<Q - Vinit Malhotra>: Just one very quick follow-up. You know, in India we talk so much about the U.S. EIA
product. I just also noticed that there is a 50BPS compression in margin between Q1 and Q2, is it just because of the
falling, slight fall in U.S. treasury yields in the quarter, or is there some caution being built because of this explosive
growth in the product? That’s the first question.
Second question, in PIMCO, we’ve seen already some calming out in the total return fund outflows in July, but equally,
the emerging market bonds and the high-yield bonds are not doing too well. Could you just comment on, is July – is it
really getting a little better, if you could just add on that?
And lastly, just a very quick one, is there any – are you already noticing or taking or discussing about the rule changes
in India? Because if the FDI rules and the market value rules are there, then it could be a reasonably sizeable decision
to make. So I just wanted to follow up. Thank you.
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: In India, I think we have – when the rules are really changing, then we have all options to take
up also our higher share in the business. But I think that is also negotiation with our joint venture partner. And I think
we would prefer, actually, also here to negotiate first with our joint venture partner and then when the negotiation is
completed, then we would announce it. But certainly we would be very positive and the rules are changing. So let’s
cross fingers that it is really happening.
July changes in the financial market, I don’t see too many impacts on our results. I wouldn’t see any special
write-downs at the moment. So therefore, I couldn’t see what you are seeing at the moment.
The new business margin in the U.S. actually includes two effects. You are right. It is 30BPS lower than in Q1. What
we are doing in the U.S. also in the calculation of the new business margin, we are updating the interest rate curve
every two weeks. So therefore, our Q2 number is, at the end of Q2, already up-to-date with the latest interest rates. So
therefore, you get more or less the impact of the average interest rate of the quarter, and that is – was in Q2
substantially lower than in Q1.
And I think the impact of the interest rate change is probably more than the 30BPS because the high sales volume was a
positive. So therefore, the interest rate impact is probably your 50BPS as you have mentioned. And then 30BPS is then
the baseline impact, where 20BPS is being reversed by the volume.
<Q - Vinit Malhotra>: Okay.
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: Good points. Yeah.
<Q - Vinit Malhotra>: Thank you. I just mentioned because the FIAs margin was 4.3% became 3.8% for just the FI.
But that’s fine. Thank you very much for clarification. Thank you.
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: Yeah, yeah.
<Q - Michael I. Huttner>: On the pricings, I just checked. So the pricing, going forward – you know that lovely table
in the appendix – is down – sorry, it’s up. And it is up 1.1%, I think, and it goes up 1.4% at the half-year – at Q1. Are
we – from your comments, I’m taking we’re actually now equal to the run rate of claims inflation. Is that about right?
And then just to follow-up on the three countries which are undergoing a turnaround, could we already see a material
change in Q2 – in Q3? In other words, this €100mm reserving or €200mm total underwriting loss, could it maybe be
halved in the current quarter? Thank you.

<A - Dieter Wemmer>: I think that of the three countries, certainly Brazil I think we will see an improvement
month-over-month. Russia, I think we have probably taken the major part of the full-year loss. Maybe not yet all of it.
That depends on how the day-to-day development is. But certainly, more than 50%. Therefore, H2 is certainly
different. And Fireman’s Fund, of course, depends pretty much on how the wind blows in Q3. Therefore, I cannot say
that Q2 result is different from H1 year results.
<Q - Michael I. Huttner>: I understand.
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: And surprising, look, I think inflation is in Europe at the moment not a topic. The ECB is even
recommending that all German employers should double the salaries of the employees to get more inflation into the
country. You’ll see where inflation is dense in Europe. I personally think that is a desperate move of our central
bankers when they are already coming with such proposals.
<Q - Michael Haid>: Two questions. First on German Life insurance, could you provide some more color on the
breakdown of the new business margin of the traditional Life product [indiscernible] (01:36:30) and of the new product
Perspektive and Index Select?
Second question, price effects in P&C Insurance. I would like to reconcile two slides, the slide nine, negative price
impact of minus 0.4% and slide 62 where you show a positive price impact of 1.1%. How is the delta explained?
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: I think slide 62 is the strict price effect on renewals and not on the total. I think that price
effects are probably not exactly calculated to the last decimal point, so there is something, some rounding differences
between.
Between the traditional business and Perspektive, the new business margin on Perspektive might be a little bit lower
but not a lot. I think the new business margin is not completely measuring the lower capital requirements the product
needs because new business margin calculation are not aligned with Solvency II thinking completely.
And therefore, the new business margin gives you only a half of the story. And in particular, in times when investment
portfolios are shifting clearly to credit risk, I think the new business margin is a little bit falling short as the
measurement in this respect. And I think we need, under the Solvency II world, more comprehensive measurements in
the long run than new business margin.
<Q - Michael Haid>: And if you had the choice of selling still a traditional Life product, and I know that Allianz label
is very cost-efficient, let’s put it that this way, and sell one Perspektive product. You would still go for the traditional
product?
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: No. I think…
<Q - Michael Haid>: As a company.
<A - Dieter Wemmer>: As a company, we encourage for both sides, for the customer end as the non-traditional
product. Because the capital consumed by the non-traditional product is substantially lower, which allows us to take
more investment risk. So therefore, it is a great trait for both sides.
In the end, we are paying the customer for the Perspektive a 30BPS more return. So we are paying at the moment 4.5%
total return to a Perspektive customer to a traditional customer 4.2%. And the 30BPS are justified because we are
taking more investment risk. And to sell products in this low-yield environment with 60 years guarantee that is bad for
the company and bad for the customer.
So it is a win-win situation, and I think the people who are still skeptical about the win-win situation, should spend
more time with our product designers in Stuttgart.

Closing Remarks
And some have already packed their suitcases and off to the airport as I heard shuffling in the background
So I wish you really a great summer vacation for the one of you who were not yet off. August is usually vacation time
And Bavaria is here close to Italy
• We all take August off as the school kids in Bavaria as well
And I wish you a great summer and hope to speak to you soon after the summer
And I know what I have to deliver in H2
• That is another good quarter in November
And then a good story on the capital management.
