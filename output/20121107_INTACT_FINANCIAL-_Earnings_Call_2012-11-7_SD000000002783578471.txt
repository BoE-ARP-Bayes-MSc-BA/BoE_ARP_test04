Here with me today are Charles Brindamour, Chief Executive Oﬃcer; Mark Tullis, Chief
Financial Oﬃcer; Martin Beaulieu, Senior Vice President, Personal Lines; and Alain
Lessard, Senior Vice President, Commercial Lines.

FINAL

We will start with formal remarks from Charles and Mark, followed by a Q&A session.
Martin and Alain will also be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session.
With that, I will ask Charles to begin his remarks.

Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Thanks, Dennis. This morning we announced a Third Quarter net operating income of
CAD122 million or CAD0.89 per share, despite incurring more than CAD1.00 a share in
net losses from weather-related events. The CAD1.02 in losses from weather is comprised
of CAD0.97 for July and August within our preannounced range of CAD0.85 to CAD1.00.
Overall, we reported a combined ratio of 95.9% as a very strong performance from our
commercial lines businesses and solid underlying results in personal lines somewhat
oﬀset these weather-related losses.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our 47% top line growth reﬂects the strong retention we've maintained on the AXA
Canada portfolio and one month of premiums from our recent JEVCO acquisition. We
continue to experience retention in the AXA book that is comparable to that of the Intact
portfolio.
Our underwriting performance and steady investment income resulted in an operating
ROE of 16.4%, while book value per share was up 10% from a year earlier.
Our outlook for the industry remains unchanged from a top-line perspective as recent
industry results have played out largely as we anticipated. Going forward, we continue to
expect mid single-digit overall growth for the industry and for personal property to be the
primary driver of rate increases, reﬂecting the ongoing trend of severe weather patterns.
The low interest rate environment should support our outlook and will likely lead to ﬁrmer
conditions over time.
We expect an improvement in the industry combined ratio to be partially oﬀset by a
reduction in the level of investment income. The resulting industry ROE is likely to
improve from 6% in 2011 to the upper single digits in 2012. We believe we'll continue to
outperform the industry's ROE by more than 500 basis points in the periods to come.
Turning to Ontario auto, we continue to see the beneﬁts of the reforms in our claims
actions. Although the industry made some headway in reducing its mediation backlog,
now down 5% from January, a meaningful backlog remains leading to uncertainty around
the ultimate impact of these reports.

FINAL

The Ontario regulator, FSCO, is proactive and is now in a position to substantially increase
its capacity to handle mediations and arbitration. This should contribute to greater clarity
throughout 2013. We expect our own mediation backlog, down 30% since the start of the
year, to decrease at a faster pace than the industry in the coming months.
The industry's loss ratio in Ontario auto, the ﬁrst half of 2012 improved by close to 10
points over 2011, largely reﬂecting the beneﬁts of the reforms. Though improved, this still
reﬂects a combined ratio of approximately 100%, indicating that a number of industry
players continue to be in a loss position.
The recently-announced political changes in Ontario and the prorogation of the
legislature creates uncertainty as to the timing of upcoming changes such as that of the
deﬁnition of catastrophic impairment and other proposed measures from the anti-fraud
task force.
I mentioned previously that these changes would inﬂuence the rate environment for 2013.
Given the uncertainty around these changes and the improvement in the industry's
results, we can expect industry premiums in Ontario to be up in the low single-digit range
in 2013.

Bloomberg Transcript

In personal property, beneﬁts from past actions to improve results were more than oﬀset
by the elevated level of weather-related losses, resulting in a combined ratio of 119.8% in
the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our combined ratio is now 102.8% in personal
property.
We believe that our actions over the past few years did, indeed, bring about 15 points of
improvement for which they were intended. More recently, however, the impact from
catastrophes has been higher than in the past, resulting in reported combined ratios that
are higher than what is acceptable to us. Although we've experienced elevated losses
from severe weather across the country, the situation has been most evident in Alberta.
We've talked about an expected run rate of Cats between CAD30 million and CAD40
million per quarter net of reinsurance in the past. Our approach to personal property now
assumes that Cats will fall in the upper end of this range on an ongoing basis. As such, we
will implement a number of actions and product changes, realizing that rate increases
alone will not mitigate against losses from future catastrophe events.
We are committed to operating our personal property business at a combined ratio of
95% or lower. Should cats remain at the levels observed in the past couple of years, it will
take up to 24 months for our actions to fully impact the bottom line.
Pricing conditions in commercial lines remain soft, especially on new business. But we
maintain our focus. As a matter of fact, our retention remains strong. And we are
experiencing low single-digit rate increases on renewals across the country for the third
year in a row now.

FINAL

Turning to our integration of AXA Canada, we are completing the renewal processing for
personal lines and commercial lines. Specialty lines conversion is now underway and will
proceed over the next 12 months. As such, I am very comfortable saying that our
integration is on track. And I want to thank all our people from coast to coast for the hard
work in ensuring that both our customers and brokers continue to receive top-notch
service.
The addition of JEVCO enables us to strengthen our oﬀer to brokers and customers by
broadening our product oﬀering into areas where we were underrepresented, primarily
recreational vehicles, commercial and specialty lines. And non-standard auto insurance.
In planning for the JEVCO integration, a key principle was to ensure that there will be no
disruption to the AXA integration nor to the high level of service we currently provide to
brokers and customers.
As you know, we closed the JEVCO transaction in early September. And as of late last
week, we begin renewing the JEVCO business on our own platform with eﬀective dates of
January 2013.

Bloomberg Transcript

In conclusion, the resilience of our operating results was again illustrated as we recorded
an operating ROE of 16.4%, despite severe weather. Given the quality of our operational
platforms, the ﬂexibility provided by our ﬁnancial position and the additions of AXA
Canada and JEVCO, we strongly believe we'll continue to outperform the industry and
strengthen our position in the Canadian market.
With that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Mr. Tullis.

Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles.
This morning we announced operating income of CAD0.89 per share, a strong result on
the heels of the severe Calgary hailstorm. Despite elevated weather-related losses, an
exceptional performance from our commercial lines business led to a combined ratio of
95.9%.
Our operating return on equity improved more than 2 points to 16.4%.
Slide eight and nine show results by line of business. In personal auto, premium growth
was 36% year over year, reﬂecting the addition of AXA Canada and one month of JEVCO.
As AXA had a larger proportion of lower-premium Quebec business, our unit growth was
stronger than the premium growth. At 94.9%, our combined ratio was 8.5 points higher
than last year's exceptional 86.4%, driven by a CAD39 million increase in Cat losses, less
favorable prior-year claims development. And a CAD9 million increase in non-Cat
weather-related losses.

FINAL

In personal property, the Calgary hail storm contributed to an overall level of Cat losses of
CAD81 million, resulting in an underwriting loss of CAD73 million and a combined ratio of
119.8% for the quarter, 102.8% year-to-date.
Because of the unacceptable recent results, we have established actions to be
implemented in the ﬁrst half of 2013 aimed at mitigating our exposure to catastrophic
events. These actions are necessary steps to ensure that our property business operates
consistently below a 95% combined ratio, even if topline growth is hindered in the near
term.
AXA's contribution was, once again, most evident in our commercial lines business with
premium growth at 78%. Commercial underwriting results were unusually strong with
commercial auto at 77% and commercial P&C almost 19 points improved year over year to
81.4%. Results in commercial P&C tend to be volatile on a quarterly basis. And this
particular quarter had several items in the right direction with elevated levels of favorable
prior-year development, fewer cat losses and a lower-than-average level of large losses.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our year-to-date general expense ratio was 10.3% compared to 11% in 2011. And the
decrease is due both to AXA-related expense synergies, as well as the AXA business mix.
This quarter the ratio was 9.1%, lower than the year-to-date ﬁgure due to the normal
seasonality as well as timing.
On the investment side, net investment income of CAD92 million in the Third Quarter was
up 24% from a year ago due to the additional investments related to AXA Canada and
one month of income from JEVCO, which contributed CAD2 million of income for the
month on assets of approximately CAD1 billion. Declining yields continue to impact
investment income. And aside from adding a full three months of contribution from
JEVCO, we expect this trend to continue in the coming quarters.
Our ﬁnancial position remains solid at the end of Q3 with a MCT of 201% and CAD598
million in excess capital, while our book value per share was up 10% from a year ago.
On the ﬁnancing side, we successfully issued an additional CAD50 million of mediumterm notes in response to strong investor demand. As a result of the conversion of the
subscription receipts related to JEVCO into common shares, our debt-to-capital ratio is
now 19.5%, slightly below our target of 20%.
The integration of AXA Canada continues to be on track. We remain comfortable with our
target of CAD100 million in after-tax synergies and are on plan with a CAD45 million run
rate thus far in 2012. We expect a CAD50 million run rate by the end of the year as
occupancy savings and internalization of claims functions take hold. We are also on track
with respect to restructuring and integration expenses.
The JEVCO transaction closed in early September. And as Charles mentioned, we've
already begun renewing business on Intact systems. We expect the deal to be slightly
accretive to net operating income per share in 2013.

Page 5 of 19



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

Date: 2012-11-07

FINAL

Annual synergies amounting to CAD15 million after-tax are expected from a combination
of external lost adjustment expense reductions, shared services savings, reinsurance and
systems-related cost savings. We expect our run rate to be close to this level by the end of
2014.
In summary, we're pleased with the signiﬁcant progress we have made to date on the
AXA integration and look forward to similar success with the integration of the JEVCO
business. We believe our solid ﬁnancial position and disciplined approach to the business
provide a strong foundation for continued growth.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Dennis.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Andre Hardy, RBC Capital Markets.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andre Hardy
Two questions, the ﬁrst is a quick one. The weather more in Ontario than anywhere else
related to Sandy last week, what impact would that have had on the Company?
But my second question is a little more big picture and more important, I think. It's clear if
you look at the quarter, that commercial lines did better than normal. And personal lines
in home insurance did worse than normal. It's not clear from your commentary what you
think about auto outside of potential for reserve releases. When you look at your
proﬁtability on an accident-year basis today in auto, are you satisﬁed with that. And are
you trying to grow the top line as opposed to improve the combined ratio speciﬁc to auto
insurance?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Andre, let me handle the Sandy question. We expect the impact to be fairly minimal on
our results. As you know, we have a Cat threshold of CAD7.5 million. It may qualify as a
Cat. But it wouldn't be much more than that.

A - Dennis Westfall

{BIO 15155973 <GO>}

Alain, do you want to comment on automobile insurance?

A - Alain Lessard

FINAL

And automobile insurance, we are positive about the perspective of that product. There is
-- we're adequately priced in all provinces. We have a stability in all provinces. Ontario still
has a bit of uncertainty due to the backlog and mediations and a few cases that have
passed into the court system that are weakening the Cat deﬁnition. But overall, we are
very positive about automobile.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think that is right, Andre. You see 94.9% combined ratio on that line of business for the
quarter and 93% year-to-date. There is in the quarter about 6 points of Cats in the
combined ratio. So I feel pretty good about the performance of automobile insurance.
And we're certainly in a growth mindset in that line of business and every jurisdiction in
Canada at this stage.

Q - Andre Hardy
That's very clear. Thank you.

Operator
Doug Young, TD Securities.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Ontario auto, as well. Charles, you mentioned you are pretty conﬁdent you can lower your
mediation backlog faster than the industry. I'm just curious what you are doing diﬀerent
than the industry to do so.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well if I just comment on the past nine months, I think that, as I've mentioned in my
remarks, the industry's backlog is down 5; ours is down 30. At one of the main reasons
why our backlog is down to a greater extent is that we have been, I think as far as FSCO is
concerned. And it's been their comments to us, we have been way more aggressive than
our peers in embracing some of the changes that they've brought to the process such as
electronic schedulings of mediations and those sorts of things.
So that is deﬁnitely an area that has made a big diﬀerence for us and just being very
proactive at dealing with the backlog and trying to settle before we end up in mediation.
So that's the ﬁrst historic context.
Then prospectively, when I look at the pattern of FSCO scheduling mediations in the
coming months, my sense in talking with FSCO is that we'll have a greater proportion of
scheduled mediation than our peers, just by the nature of how we're positioned in terms
of average date of these claims.

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

Okay. Then just on Ontario auto as well, back to something Andre was mentioning, your
current year combined ratio in auto did, by my calculations, deteriorate 2 points in the
quarter. And I'm just wondering, is there something abnormal in there, or is there
anything concerning?

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think there's a number of things there and nothing much concerning, Doug. I think that
there's a few -- a couple of points of prior development less than last year. But that being
said, there's 2.5 points of prior-year development in automobile insurance, roughly,
ballpark. So less prior-year development. But still a decent level of prior-year
development.
There is in our view, year on year in that line of business, non-Cat weather-type eﬀect,
causing about CAD9 million worth of worst performance in automobile insurance. So
nothing that I'm concerned about, Doug, on that front.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

There's nothing by province that is drastically diﬀerent? Obviously this is a combined
number. But I'm talking Alberta relative to Ontario or what -- there's nothing in there that
sticks out to you as concerning, then?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well yes, when I look at -- well, not concerning but in terms of explaining the numbers,
when I look at the frequency by province, Doug, we see that our frequency in Ontario and
Quebec in the quarter was down, while our frequency in Alberto was up meaningfully 9%.
And this talks to a certain extent probably of the non-Cat weather impact. But overall
frequency in Alberta is up. And that's not something that over a three-month period you
would necessarily become concerned about.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Then just related to the deﬁnition of catastrophic claims, obviously I think the view was
that that would be settled this fall. I'm going to assume that that is not necessarily the case
any longer. But correct me if I'm wrong. And I know you mentioned it in your comments.
Can you update us in terms of what your expectations are for that particular issue?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes, I guess if we talk theory, the changes to the cat deﬁnition would not require
necessarily legislative action because it can be dealt with through regulation. So in theory,
the notion that the Parliament is prorogued is not necessarily in theory an impediment to
the cat deﬁnition being ruled out.
In practice, the government is in a state of transition at this stage. And so to what extent
will that move forward is where I certainly have a level of uncertainty. And I'm sure what
your perspective would be here.

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

Now, I think we are in a wait-and-see mode at the moment.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

That is it.

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

We have no signs that this is not going to happen. But the timing I think is --.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. But I think we're just being pragmatic in looking at the fact that you have a transition
in government that takes some will and courage to a certain extent even through
regulation. So we are personally not counting on that at this stage when we think about
the Ontario auto market. So that would be very good for Ontarians if that came true.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. And just lastly. And then I will re-queue, OSFI is obviously looking to increase
capital requirements. And I think that's related to earthquake-related risk. But again,
correct me if I'm wrong. And I know you mentioned in your release that you think there
could be a slight negative impact. Can you quantify it at all what that impact might be
from the changes coming in next year. And what changes are you making potentially to
mitigate some of that impact?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Yes. So I think a couple of things. The big thing -- so nothing major in the near term. There
are some issues with regard to changing the factor for the interest sensitivity factor, which
will be graded in over a few years.
But again, that is going to be graded in over two years. We see a couple of points per
quarter, nothing else being the same. I think it's important to point out on all this stuﬀ, we
plan for the changes. And so it's not -- it's hard to say exactly what that change in eﬀect
will have because we will take mitigating factors to oﬀset to some degree.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes and let me comment on the earthquake change that is being contemplated. There is
sort of a draft on the table now that would start to look at what we call PMLs or probable
maximum loss on a national basis as opposed to a local basis, which would eﬀectively
increase requirements either from a reinsurance point of view or from a capital point of
view. And I'd like to make a few points on that.
The ﬁrst point is that we tend to reinsure to a greater extent than our peers to start with.

Page 9 of 19



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2012-11-07

Second of all, we don't think this proposed change makes sense. And therefore, it is
subject of discussions at the moment with us -- so I'm not sure where this thing will end.
But what I know, though, is that when OSFI lands on a framework, it will be implemented
over a period of six or --

FINAL

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

10 years.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

10 years, I think. There you go.
So that is the OSFI story. I would say though, that regardless of that, I've talked about our
earthquake exposure and the fact that we spent way more on reinsurance last year to
increase our reinsurance cover. We are proactively working on the West Coast to reduce
our exposure through pricing and underwriting actions, regardless of where OSFI is
going.
So when you put that in the mix, Doug, I'm not concerned about where the impact that
the OSFI change might have on IFC, though I don't think these changes make complete
sense at this stage. And that's why we're working with them to present a diﬀerent
perspective.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Paul Holden, CIBC.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Two questions. I guess the ﬁrst on commercial lines. Given the low combined ratios you
are getting there, is there the potential to increase your market share both in commercial
auto and commercial P&C, or does pricing on new policies sort of prohibit you from
doing that?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So I will let Alain take this one.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Well ﬁrst, like Mark mentioned, we had a very good quarter on commercial lines. But
pretty much everything went in the right direction being either prior development or
large losses.

Page 10 of 19



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity

FINAL

Basically, when you look at the past quarter, we've seen that those lines are fairly volatile,
okay, moving from quarter to quarter anywhere between 80% to 100%, or in automobile
anywhere 75% to 95%. So overall our view on the proﬁtability of those lines has not
changed because of this current quarter.
That being said, we're pushing the growth as much as we can. But the market currently is
remaining very, very soft. We are able to push some rate increase on renewal. But on new
business, the market is being very soft. In Canada, we're not seeing any of the rate
increase we're seeing south of the border in the US and Canada. We are seeing either
price levels being the same or slightly decreasing also on new business.
So because of that, we're keeping a very focused and disciplined approach to new
business to maintain our proﬁtability margin on these lines of business.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. These are great lines of business. And Alain talks about the quarterly volatility,
absolutely. I think when you look at it year to date, nine months into the year, commercial
auto is running at 81%; commercial P&C is running at 90%. Very healthy performance. The
more we can grow in that market, the better.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now our focus at the moment is clearly completing our integration where we have
acquired substantial block of commercial lines business, in my view, at a very good time in
the market. Our retention has been pretty good. And the upside for us here, postintegration, is to leverage the new product lines.
And so clearly to expand some of these specialty lines, the fact that we have a broader
product than we had before the transaction across our distribution network is how Alain
and the Intact Insurance team will grow their market share in a competitive new business
environment.
I hope you agree with that, Alain.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

One follow-up question to that perhaps then is, given the rate increases we're seeing in
the US and the soft market in Canada, is there -- are there any speciﬁc factors you can
point to between those two markets that explains the diﬀerence? And is it reasonable to
expect that maybe the US is a leading indicator of what might happen in Canada
eventually on the rate front?

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Our understanding of the basic diﬀerence between the Canadian market and the US
market is that the rate increase in the US is currently being driven much more by Worker's
Compensation, which is a private line in most of the states in the US. While here in
Canada, it is nationalized; it is government insurance. So that factor not being present in
Canada has an important impact on the diﬀerence of behavior on both markets.

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

I think just to put things in perspective with regards to the markets, I mean we are -- so
new business in many sectors is really quite competitive.
That being said, the retention, you could comment on the retention, Alain, as well. And
this will give people a sense of the fact that there is a way to do very good business in that
market.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Where basically the retention we have and that's the good thing -- we're experiencing the
same retention on the AXA and the Intact portfolio. And if we look at our retention this
year premium-wise compared to last year, the retention is up by slightly a point or a little
bit around a point in terms of our retention. And we know that the impact on the retention
on our growth is much more important than the new business because it gears directly to
the portfolio and, on top of that retention, our risks that we have underwritten over the
past that we know and for which we have all the information to make the right
underwriting.

Bloomberg Transcript

So focusing on the retention is one way to grow our portfolio right now. And we're quite
pleased with what we're seeing.
The new business, like I mentioned and like Charles mentioned, is very much diﬃcult,
okay? It varies sector by sector. Some of the sectors we're basically doing a little bit better.
But overall there is an appetite in the Canadian market to grow the commercial line
business. And that translates in our competitors being very active and going for new
business.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. So no change from where we were before. We're still trying to get rate increases on
renewals -- third year in a row now of low single-digit rate increase. And this shows to a
certain extent in the strong performance of these two lines of business.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

And ﬁnal question would be related to distribution income. It seems to have become a
little bit harder for us to model since the AXA acquisition. Maybe was thinking that Q2
would be a better run rate number. But now we've seen it come down substantially
quarter over quarter. Maybe you can provide some comments to help us ﬁgure out how
we should forecast that going forward?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Sure. And this is a small line of which there does tend to be a lot of volatility. Included in
here is income from organizations where we don't fully control some of the timing of how
they produce things. It's where we have partial ownership and they produce their own
things. So there tends to be a little volatility on how the income is recognized.

FINAL

I would say if you look at the distribution revenues, the CAD23 million we reported last
quarter, is more indicative of an ongoing run rate. I think you should choose view the
CAD12 million -- a little bit of timing there as there was timing in Q1 when we reported the
CAD32 million. And I would look at the CAD23 million in Q2 as more what the current run
rate is, hopefully growing in the future as we continue to grow our distribution

Just going back to some of the synergies that we talked, I think we had said we had
CAD100 million in after-tax synergies from the AXA deal. You may have mentioned it in
the call. But where are we in terms of how much more incrementally would be realized
from that?

Bloomberg Transcript

Then I thought you mentioned on the call some of the annual synergies you expect from
the JEVCO deal as well.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Sure. So let me take that one. So yes, we are -- and these are after-tax numbers. So we are
looking for CAD100 million of after-tax on AXA. We still have that as a view.
Our view is we will be at CAD50 million at the end of the year. We are at a CAD45 million
run rate currently. The reason for the increase from the CAD45 million to the CAD50
million is two things. One, we will incur some occupancy savings as we move some
people, primarily in Montreal, into the AXA oﬃces at 2020 University. We can get some
occupancy savings there.
The other thing is, on the claim side, we've been internalizing some of the claims
expenses. It takes a while to actually realize the savings because the cases actually have to
turn over to be handled internally. And we expect to receive some savings found that in
Q4, as well.
Then the other CAD50 million of savings will occur throughout next year from a
continuation of that sort of thing but primarily from system savings. Once we have
converted all the business onto the Intact system, we can begin to shut down legal
entities and actually turn oﬀ systems. And that is where we get a big synergistic savings.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay, good.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Sorry. CAD15 million of after-tax savings. Again, we expect to achieve that run rate by the
end of 2014. And again, it's the same sort of process. We have to convert the business
over to our systems and shut oﬀ the systems is where we get a lot of the savings there.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. And we will report on the progress on the CAD15 million next quarter --

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Because, as you know, we closed in late Q3, early September.

FINAL

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

And is there anything you can say about supply chain beneﬁts? I know that when you had
an increase with respect to when you bought AXA, you hand to end up buying some
more reinsurance. In the end, you said, well, okay, that will be probably be oﬀset by
increases in terms of earnings associated with supply chain beneﬁts. What's in the pipe
for that. And how can we -- I suspect as you continue to get bigger, there's got to be
some beneﬁts from supply chain. Is there anyway we can -- how are we supposed to think
about that?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well I think that it's pretty clear that the supply chain beneﬁt that comes from applying our
deals on the new claims or on the AXA claims more than oﬀsets the additional cost of
reinsurance, which was CAD15 million. And I would say that this was toward the end of
Q2. This is true at the end of Q3.

Bloomberg Transcript

Additional upside, of course, comes when you use your full size to negotiate supply chain
arrangements that will take place in the coming years. And my advice to better
understand that is to come at the Investors Day because we'll spend some time precisely
on that topic to give a bit more clarity there and talk about some of the levers that we
intend to pull.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

You've reduced your backlog by around 30% in Ontario. And the backlog has been
reduced across the industry. Has there been any indication on the direction of the
mediation or arbitration whether it would be more favorable to the industry or to the
claimants?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

The bulk of the backlog reduction that has taken place to date was on pre-reform claims.
And therefore, with respect to reforms per se, I expect that in the early part of 2013 we'll
get a better sense from the mediation output there.

And that is true. The bulk of mediations are pre-reform. And in arbitration there have
been none that are post-reform as of yet.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

FINAL

So in the very few, your message thus then is still too early to tell.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well we don't change our view based on what we've seen to date, Mario.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Understand. The second question is, I've never heard you refer to non-Cat weatherrelated losses before. You may have. I just don't recall hearing that. And maybe you can
help me understand, what do you mean by non-Cat weather-related and personal auto?
I'm not suggesting that -- sorry, in personal property -- I'm not suggesting that everything
is weather-related in personal property. But wouldn't the vast majority the weatherrelated?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes, I think we're talking of weather occurrences where the cumulative loss is less than
CAD7.5 million. Like we deﬁne Cat when a natural occurrence exceeds CAD7.5 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

So when there is an event that occurs, we set up a Cat code in our system and we track it.
We don't know until the claims come in, whether the event will actually generate claims
over CAD7.5 million. If it does, we categorize it as a Cat; if it comes in at CAD5 million or
CAD4 million or CAD6 million or whatever, it is not categorized as a Cat. But it is still
associated with an event.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

So the trigger then is it has to be classiﬁed as an event ﬁrst.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Correct.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

An event would be what? Just super-heavy rain storms or hail?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

A hailstorm, that sort of event.

Okay. Then ﬁnally. And forgive me if you've already answered this question, on
integration expenses, they came in a little higher than I would have expected. Can you
give us some outlook for the next couple of quarters and how you expect integration
expenses to play out?

FINAL

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Sure. On the AXA side, we've given guidance that it would come in more or less at the
level of one-year pretax savings. To date, we are proximately CAD129 million. I think we're
looking at coming in at the end of the year in the CAD160 million range, perhaps a little
more in next year. But that is what we're looking at.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Then JEVCO?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

JEVCO, I think you could think in terms of a bit larger envelope than 1 times the savings.
Because some of the things we have to do, like converting systems, are the same, take the
same amount of expense. But we have fewer policies to put them over. So I think you'd
look at it a bit larger as a percentage as the cost savings there.

Q - Mario Mendonca

Q - Bryan Brown

{BIO 16358540 <GO>}

Just a couple of quarters we've seen some of your competitors aggressively cut their rates
in Ontario auto. And I just wanted to know if you saw this as a concern?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Martin, do you want to comment on that?

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

Yes. Well I think you are probably referring speciﬁcally to one player that has reduced
rates by high single digits. That player has done that over a number of quarters. And that
player in itself was reporting better results than the industry for the past three, four years.
So that is not a concern with respect to our competitive potential in the future because
when we look at the industry as a whole, we think that the industry still has to continue to
adjust by 5 to 10 points. That doesn't create a concern for me at this stage.

Q - Bryan Brown

{BIO 16358540 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thanks. And just one last question. In terms of expenses, the commissions and the
general expenses were quite low this quarter. And I just wanted to know your view on
sustainability of the decrease.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Yes. That's a good question. On the general expense side, I think it's a couple of things.
So if you look at our year-to-date general expense ratio, it is in the 10.3% range compared
with 11% last year. And I would consider the diﬀerence between the 10.3% and the 11% to
be sustainable. A little more than half of that due to synergies on account of the AXA
business coming in. Some of it due to business mix with AXA creating diﬀerent general
expense levels.
If you look at the quarter, it came in at 9.1% versus our year-to-date of 10.3%. I would not
consider that sustainable.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think if you look at the last few years, last year through three quarters, our expense ratio
was at 11%. And Q3 it came in at 10.4%. And if you look at 2010, Q3 came in about 50
basis points lower than the full-year expense ratio. So there seems to be a bit of a pattern
where we spend a little bit less maybe in the summer months than we do in the rest of the
year. So I think you saw some of that this year, plus maybe a bit of timing on top of that.
On the commission side, again, I would view the quarter-by-quarter variations. There's
been no change in the commission arrangements. We tend to have timing of CPC or
contingent proﬁt commission. So when we, say, have a really good Q1 because of the
weather, we tend to see a little bit more accrued, when we see a little more weatherrelated events in Q3, maybe a little less accrued there.
So I wouldn't view that as a sustainable thing. It's more of it related to the performance of
the business and maybe a bit of timing.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. Think what is sustainable in the improvement and the expense ratio is the synergies.

Q - Bryan Brown

{BIO 16358540 <GO>}

Okay. Great. That is it for me. Thanks.
