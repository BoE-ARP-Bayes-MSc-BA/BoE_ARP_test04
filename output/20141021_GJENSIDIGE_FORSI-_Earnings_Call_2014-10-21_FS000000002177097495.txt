MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Janne Merethe Flessum

{BIO 19368607 <GO>}

Welcome to this presentation of the third quarter results for Gjensidige. Today, our CEO,
Helge Leiro Baastad will start by commenting the highlights for the quarter before our
Head of Risk and Capital Management, Jostein Amdal, gives you more insight into our
capital position. CFO, Catharina Hellerud, will then follow-up by commenting the results
for the quarter in more detail. And then, we of course, open up for Q&A after them.
Before we start, I want to remind you that the presentation can be downloaded from our
website, gjensidige.no/ir.
Then, I hand over to you, Helge.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Janne. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for listening in. I'm pleased to
present the third quarter ﬁgures with continued solid premium growth and good proﬁt
performance.
If you look at page 2 in the presentation, I will comment on the main ﬁgures for the
quarter. The proﬁt before tax for the quarter was NOK 1.337 billion, and the underwriting

result was NOK 755 million, corresponding to a combined ratio of 85.5% which is a good
result.
First I will give some overall comments to these results. Growth in premiums was 6.9%,
3.2% adjusted for currency and transactions. The experience continued due to underlying
claims development for the motor products. However, it was somewhat weaker for the
property product as a result of a lot of thunder and lightning at start of the quarter. The
property products are volatile and vulnerable to the wind and the weather. Claims
incurred in the quarter were approximately 27% higher than last year and 30% compared
with the last ﬁve years.
The proportion of large losses was higher than last year, but nonetheless lower than we
normally expect with only 3.8 percentage points hit on combined ratio. There was slightly
more large losses in Norway in addition to a cloudburst as you know in Denmark and
Sweden at the end of August. We also see continued good cost control with a cost ratio of
14.5%. I will comment the growth in some more detail.

Bloomberg Transcript

We still experienced good competitiveness and very good proﬁtability. In Private, we saw
a 2.5% point growth in premiums. Adjusted for actuarial (2:52) eﬀects between second
quarter and third quarter, the growth was closer to 3%, which is somewhat lower than we
have seen for some quarters.
As previously communicated, running premium increases are in line with the long-term
claims inﬂation but market-related adjustments in attractive segments mean that the
premium increases are lower than average. This has been the situation throughout 2014.
Therefore, premium increases have a somewhat weaker eﬀect on growth in earned
premiums now than in recent years.
At the same time, we have seen a stabilization of the number of customers over time and
we also saw a more positive development in the number of customers during the third
quarter. We are very pleased that we are able to combine continued growth with good
proﬁtability, a positive customer development, and high customer satisfaction, which are
signs that our work on risk selection and price adjustments in especially attractive
segments is paying oﬀ in a market characterized by tough competition. The loss ratio is
higher for customers who leave us than for customers who stay.
Moving to Commercial, we also see higher level of activity and solid growth of 5.7%
combined with good proﬁtability. Our systematic work of implementing best practice
from Private continues. Nordic also delivered a satisfactory quarter with an underlying
growth of 3.1%, primarily driven by an increase in the number of new Commercial
customers. The work on implementing best practice and utilizing economies of scale
continues.
Finally, on this page, the ﬁnancial result was NOK 552 million, corresponding to a return
on ﬁnancial assets of 1%. And annualized return on equity before tax was 23.8%.

FINAL

Then turning to page 3 in the presentation. As you can see, we announced increased
dividends for 2013. The board decided to distribute excess capital in the form of
increased dividend of NOK 2 billion for the 2013 ﬁnancial year, corresponding to NOK 4
per share. The distribution is in line with the capital strategy that we communicated a year
ago.
Various measures have been made to optimize the balance sheet and capital throughout
2014, which means that at the start of 2015, the group will have a balance sheet and a
capital structure that supports the target of 15% return on equity after tax from 2015.
Measures implemented have been in the sale of Storebrand in the ﬁrst quarter, eliminated
risk relating to deﬁned beneﬁt pension from the balance sheet, excess capital of NOK 3
billion distributed in May. And on 15th of September 2014, a subordinated bond issue was
launched with a nominal value of NOK 1.2 billion on a very competitive term. Coupon of
three months NIBOR is 1.5% points per annum.
The terms of the bond issue are adapted to current and expected future requirements for
the qualifying owned funds Tier 2.

Bloomberg Transcript

The board also decided that the cost ratio target of around 15% for the general insurance
operation will continue by also after 2014. This implies an underlying reduction in the cost
ratio through continuous eﬃciently measures to ﬁnd room for investing into future
technology and skills and secure continued strong competiveness. In addition, the board
yesterday also decided that previously communicated targets for the combined ratio and
return on equity will remain unchanged.
And with that, I leave the word to you, Jostein.

Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Thank you, Helge. On slide 5, you'll recognize presentation of our capital position. We
manage our capital based on these three perspectives, the most binding one meaning
the one that results in the lowest excess capital has been and is expected to be the rating
perspective.
The strategic buﬀer is deﬁned as excess capital in this perspective and it is our
assessment of this buﬀer that results in our total dividend capacity. The size of the buﬀer
was NOK 1 billion at the end of the third quarter. Please bear in mind that we will include
this year's retained proﬁt at year end.
We'll also remind you that our dividend policy is that least 70% of this year's proﬁt should
be paid out as dividends. The changes in the strategic buﬀer from the second quarter are
largely due to the fact that we have deducted the adopted dividend while we have added
the subordinated loan, resulting in a net reduction of NOK 0.8 billion. Underlying this is a
slight increase in the capital requirement due to growth in the balance sheet. Later in the
presentation, I'll talk some more about on the details from the rating perspective.

FINAL

As the name indicates, the interim model is our internal management tool. We're working
to have it approved as a model for calculating the statutory capital requirement once
Solvency II is introduced. And we have a good dialogue with Norwegian FSA about the
preparation of our application. During this process, both the model and the
documentation of it will become more robust and changes to the model before the
application is submitted may occur.
We expect the application to be submitted in the second quarter of 2015. The authorities
will have six months to consider it. If we are required to make changes to the model
during the application process, we will do so. And we therefore believe that the question
is not so much whether but when it will be approved. We have also seen that authorities
have introduced safety valves for the banks in the form of minimum capital requirements
that are well-above their internal models, and that represents some uncertainty factor for
us as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we turn to slide 6, our base case is that we will obtain the approval to use the internal
model to calculate the statutory capital requirement once Solvency II is introduced. We're,
nonetheless, prepared for a situation where this does not necessarily happen from day
one and are also calculating the capital need using the standard formula on a half-yearly
basis.
And the numbers presented here are thus from June 30 and do not include deferred subdebt nor approved dividends. There are two main points that should be emphasized from
the ﬁgures we present here. First, even if the internal model is not approved, our statutory
excess capital will be substantial. And secondly, the rating requirement is expected to be
also in the future more binding than a standard formula. I'll brieﬂy explain to you why the
excess capital is signiﬁcantly higher using the standard formula.
And the main diﬀerences are just for the capital available calculation. The treatment of
subsidiaries diﬀers. S&P excludes all capital invested in subsidiaries that are not general
insurance companies, on the grounds that they're not assumed to have an excess capital.
Under Solvency II, the capital requirement is calculated from the consolidated insurance
balance sheet, including Gjensidige Forsikring as a large insurance company. This means
that we are credited for diversiﬁcation advantages between general insurance and life
insurance.
The Retail Bank (10:49) are included with the cap requirements under the capital
adequacy directive. This means that they also beneﬁt from excess capital in the Retail
Bank and (11:01) at group level. And ﬁnally, the discounting eﬀects are larger in the
standard formula where the swap curve is used than in the S&P model that uses a 10-year
government rate.
If we turn to capital requirements, these are, on average, somewhat higher under the
Solvency II standard formula if you look at it based on each asset class or insurance
product. But on the other hand under Solvency II regulations having a diversiﬁed portfolio
of both diﬀerent insurance products and in terms of asset allocation counts much more.

FINAL

Hence, in total, the capital requirements are not that much diﬀerent between the two
perspectives.
In the calculations presented here, we have assumed that our interpretation of the
regulations as regards natural perils fund and the guarantee provisions will apply. (11:48)
that they will largely account as Tier 2 capital. There are two elements that are not yet
included in the calculation as excess capital in the standard formula that will contribute to
increasing the excess capital further, and these are the deﬁnition of premium provisions
and potential tax eﬀects on the required capital.
So, what are the most important uncertainty factors ahead of the implementation of
Solvency II in Norway? If you look at slide 7, these are listed there. We have already
commented on the FSA's letter of June this year. In our view, the reality underlying both
natural perils fund and the guarantee provisions indicates that they should account as Tier
2 capital under Solvency II. This is a common understanding in the insurance industry in
Norway, and we're making a concerted eﬀort to work with the authorities to get our views
across. And we view that outcome as likely.

Bloomberg Transcript

As of September 30, the natural perils fund and the guarantee provisions amounted to
NOK 2.9 billion, but also the Norwegian FSA proposal is that natural perils funds accounts
to some extent. So, if their view becomes deﬁned contribution, the negative eﬀect on
excess capital would be approximately NOK 2.5 billion. We view these items as part of
Tier 2 capital, so if the FSA's interpretation were to become the ﬁnal outcome, our
capacity for subordinated debt will increase probably at the same amount.
In this letter, the FSA also addressed the valuation of technical reserves for solvency
purposes as opposed to the tax values. At present, these two are the same, but when they
switch to discounted values and risk margin on the technical reserves under Solvency II,
that will no longer be given. More speciﬁcally, we believe that these are the three diﬀerent
valuations: tax, solvency, and IFRS. Our view is that the intention behind the new solvency
regulation was not to increase the tax burden, and that the tax rules must be adapted to
ensure that this is the case. Should the tax values be the same as the values for solvency
purposes under Solvency II, this will result in a substantial increase in the tax burden.
In relation to excess capital measured using the internal model, this would amount to
approximately NOK 0.5 billion as a result of the same change in provision for claims and
NOK 0.7 billion if the security provisions are recognized as income. We do not believe
that such an immediate increase in tax burden is likely to occur.
Provisions for premiums in Solvency II shall be the discounted value of future
disbursements which means that the proﬁt element that is currently embedded in this will
increase the solvency capital instead. On the minus side, there is the capital requirement
relating to the risk that the proﬁtable customers will leave the company before the end of
the contract period, so called lapse risk. Net this result is a positive eﬀect on the capital
position of between NOK 0.5 billion and NOK 1 billion, depending on the underwriting
proﬁt levels.

FINAL

Calculation of capital requirements in Solvency II is a form of stress test. The capital eﬀect
can be calculated after tax. If it's suﬃcient, then likely that the company will be in a tax
position after the stress test has been carried out. With high underwriting proﬁtability,
we've seen that we should be able to meet this criteria which will reduce the capital
requirement (14:58). This can amount to NOK 1 billion to NOK 2 billion, depending on
assumptions used for tax rate on the losses that arises in this stress test.
In summary, it's our assessment that the balance of these uncertainty factors are on the
positive side for the legal capital surplus under Solvency II. This assessment is based on a
strong belief that natural perils fund ends up as admissible capital, and that the balance
sheet of the tax-related issues mentioned there also ends up in the positive. Furthermore,
the uncertainty related to premium provision is more of a computational type than
uncertainty regarding the Solvency II rules itself.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the next two slides, I'll show some more details regarding our capital position in the
rating model since this is the most binding legal capital requirement. Looking ﬁrst at slide
8, you'll see that available capital in the rating model deviates substantially from IFRS
equity. And I'll start with some more details on this. S&P has a more economic approach
much like Solvency II, but as I have already described, there are some large diﬀerences in
the actual numbers.
As of September 30, we have included the subordinated loan and deducted adopted
dividend. As previously mentioned, we do not include the earned proﬁt before the end of
the year, and then minus the proposed dividend. Intangible assets are excluded entirely.
As far as assets are concerned, our market value adjustment after the sale of Storebrand
and the reclassiﬁcation of SR-bank is now only related to bonds recognized at amortized
costs. The market value adjustment of liabilities is based on discounting at a 10-year
government bond rate. And then there's a haircut of 33% for discounting the provision for
claims and 50% for provision for premiums.
Deferred tax liability relate to two items. Tax on properties owned in Oslo Areal ﬁrstly.
Because the properties are also limited liability companies, which are tax exempt in
Norway. This tax will not be paid. The other item is deferred tax on a security provision. In
the IFRS group accounts, the current mandatory security provision is split into two with
73% to equity and 27% as deferred tax liability.
Security provision is a buﬀer without any foreseeable liability in other words a capital
element. And this may be only used against very negative outcomes for the underwriting
result. And S&P has included 6, (17:23) capital in their models. As mentioned, the book
value of subsidiaries that are not general insurance companies is inducted in its entirety
from their qualifying capital.
On the next slide, we have shown our capital requirements and how this is broken down
into the most important capital drivers. You see that the capital requirement for insurance
risk is somewhat higher than the investment risk and that this model includes relatively
little diversiﬁcation advantages. The most important individual risk on the asset side is
equities where SR-Bank is included in the amount of approximately NOK 0.8 billion.

FINAL

In the Norwegian market, there are much unrated papers, even though we can use thirdparty ratings in the rating models, a substantial part of our ﬁxed income instruments are
still unrated. This leaves Gjensidige with a somewhat higher capital requirement for credit
risk compared to foreign companies.
On the insurance side, the capital requirements are particularly high for long-term
products such as occupational injury and liability insurance while the (18:22) for motor and
property insurance are high because they are such big products for us. The property
requirement includes the eﬀect of the natural catastrophes. In summary, our opinion, that
is a reasonably balanced portfolio. The full eﬀect of the diversiﬁcation beneﬁts is,
however, (18:42) through the internal model which is also a tool that will be used as our
active cap management tool.

Bloomberg Transcript

Finally, looking at slide 10, I'll go through our capacity for subordinated debt. The capacity
for qualifying subordinated debt must be tested against both the limitations in Solvency II
and S&P's rules. S&P is relatively simple, hybrid capital with intermediate equity
component as deﬁned by S&P can amount to up to 25% of the qualifying capital. This
assumes that a debt is replacing equity. In addition, however, it will also be the case that
S&P will assume that hybrid capital that is to be included for rating purposes will have to
counter the regulatory context. There is a link to this perspective.
Under Solvency II, the limitation is that Tier 2 capital can amount to up to 50% of the
capital requirement. We assume that the capital requirement will be based on our internal
model. If the model is not approved or if the approval process leads to an increase in the
capital requirement, the capacity for Tier 2 capital will also increase. We also assume that
most of the natural perils fund and the guarantee provisions account as Tier 2 capital
which then reduces the capacity for subordinated loans in Q2 substantially.
Based on how we see the situation today, we have therefore utilized our capacity to raise
subordinated loans that meet the Tier 2 requirements. Through the subordinated loan we
have issued and the dividend now passed, we are where we want to be in terms of how
we made the necessary balance sheet adjustments to be able to deliver on our
communicated ﬁnancial targets.
I'll then leave over to Catharina Hellerud, who will continue with the results for the third
quarter.

Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Thank you, Jostein, and good morning, everyone. As both Helge and Jostein have spent
time on the dividends, ﬁnancial target and the capital position, and I feel quite conﬁdent
that you have already seen the ﬁgures, I will make my section very short this time to save
time for questions.
I would, therefore, only comment page 13 and 19, speciﬁcally. But ﬁrst, overall, we are very
pleased with the underwriting result in the quarter, reﬂecting a combination of solid
premium growth and the continued strong underlying proﬁtability. The proportion of
Page 7 of 24



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2014-10-21

large losses were lower than we expected for the quarter but, nonetheless, considerably
higher than in the corresponding quarter last year and, therefore, the main reason why
the underwriting result is lower in this quarter.

FINAL

Eﬀect on the combined ratio was 3.8 percentage points this quarter. The largest individual
claim in the third quarter was the cloudburst over Copenhagen and the south of Sweden
at the end of August which resulted in claims totaling NOK 78 million.
The run-oﬀ gain in the quarter was NOK 107 million, corresponding to a positive eﬀect of
2.1 percentage points on the combined ratio. The Retail Bank and the Pension and Savings
continue to show good growth with a proﬁt before tax that is approximately 45% higher
than corresponding quarter last year.
Turning to page 13, I will add some comments to what Helge mentioned earlier related to
this quarter's proﬁtability. The combined ratio was a solid 85.5% in the quarter and with a
cost ratio of 14.9% year-to-date. We are conﬁdent we are well-positioned to achieve our
target of a 15% cost ratio this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

The loss ratio was 71%, which is very satisfactory, even though it represents a weakening of
3.3 percentage points in relation to the corresponding quarter in 2013. As mentioned, the
proportion of large losses was higher than in the corresponding quarter last year, which
explains 2 percentage points of the weakening of the loss ratio compared with the
corresponding quarter in 2013.
On the other hand, the run-oﬀ gain was 0.2 percentage points lower than in the
corresponding quarter in 2013. Adjusted for these eﬀects, the underlying loss ratio was
weakened by 1.1 percentage point.
In the motor product area, we have had yet another quarter with low claims frequency.
This has lasted for some time now, but please remember that the frequency situation
within the motor product is aﬀected by seasonality, but can also be volatile, especially in
the winter quarters. And the ﬁrst quarter, this here is a good example and then a mild
winter resulted in low claims frequency even though it was a winter quarter.
Accident and health products continued to produce favorable good results. But as Helge
has already mentioned, the property product were on the weaker side this quarter due to
many weather-related claims. With more ﬁres and more water-related claims, some of it is
normally expected. Finally, I will make some comments to the investment portfolio, which
again contributes with the satisfactory return seen in the light of a challenging interest rate
environment.
The investment portfolio amounted to NOK 55 billion at the end of the quarter, an
increase of approximately NOK 1 billion from the previous quarter. The match portfolio
amounted to NOK 33 billion and it continued to make a stable contribution to the
ﬁnancial results with a return of 0.9 percentage in the quarter. The continued fall in
Norwegian and Danish interest rates throughout the quarter will be challenging for the
return on the match portfolio going forward. The average reinvestment rates on both in

FINAL

the Norwegian held-to-maturity portfolio that traded in the quarter was as slow at 3.3
percentage.
We also see that the eﬀect of the fall in the interest rates in the excess value of the held-tomaturity portfolio which is booked at the entire cost and at the end of the third quarter it
amounted to NOK 1.7 billion. This excess value means that the good return on the
portfolio in our account is falling more slowly than the fall in the interest rate level we
indicated.
And the free portfolio amounted to NOK 22 billion at the end of the quarter and yielded a
return of 1% in the quarter. A weak development for credit resulted in weak return in the
quarter. This applies to high yield and convertible bonds in particular which yielded a
negative return. Both equities delivered a weak result in the quarter. Price activity, on the
other hand, delivered a solid performance in the quarter with a combination of increased
valuation and realized gains.
The property portfolio also saw a strong quarter. There was a small yield fall for the
portfolio as a whole in the quarter from 6.5% to 6.4%, reduced yield requirements
combined with individual adjustments ﬁrst on property, and the development has led to
an increase of NOK 72 million in the value of the portfolio and in the quarter. All in all, this
resulted in an acceptable return in the investment portfolio of 1% in the quarter, although
it is considerably lower than in the corresponding quarter in 2013.

And by this, I leave the word back to Helge for a brief sum up.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Catharina. On the last page, you are already familiar with our most important
priorities. We have, throughout 2014, introduced measures to optimize the capital and
balance sheet structure. And we will end the 2015 with a balance sheet and a capital
structure that supports the goal of 15% return on equity, after tax expense from 2015.
To deliver on these targets, we need, ﬁrst and foremost to concentrate on securing the
numerator going forward. However, we will, of course, secure the denominator through
continued good balance and capital management.
And with that, we open up for questions.

We'll now pause for a moment just to allow everyone to signal. We'll now take our ﬁrst
question from Jakob Brink from ABG Sundal Collier. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Thank you and good morning. I have a few questions regarding the capital. You didn't
really discuss what would – what you thought would be the outcome from S&P regarding
the natural perils pool. As far as I understand that they could decide to go against the
Norwegian FSA or Department of Finance and not include it in total adequacy capital
even though it might be included in regulatory capital. Could you maybe give us some
your thoughts on that?
Secondly, you mentioned that also regarding the SR-1 Bank stake taking up quite a high
capital consumption. And also that you in general have a relatively high capital
consumption in your investment portfolio. Have you got any plans here to reduce that?
And I know you tried to sell SR1 stake earlier in the year but didn't succeed, any progress
here?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then, maybe ﬁnally if I can just add a third question. What is your – I mean, I think you
mentioned that you are now where you want to be with regards to leverage to reach 15%
ROE target. But still, I mean, 25% of the total adequacy capital in S&P is NOK 4.4 billion
subordinated capital, and you only issued NOK 1.2 billion. And even if you might have to
treat the natural perils pool and the currency scheme as two capital, you can still assume
around NOK 1.4 billion extra to two capital in the regulatory framework. And I guess, also
10% co-co, so, what are your thoughts on more leverage? Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

It's Jostein Amdal. I can start on question number one and three and Helge will comment
on the SR-Bank question. As regards Standard & Poor's view on the natural perils fund
and the guarantee provisions, they have taken their own view of these provisions so far.
We have no indication that they'll follow the FSA or the Ministry of Finance either way,
even if they – whether they actually approve of it or not approve of it, and we have not
seen that S&P will change their position. We are, of course, in no position to make a
forecast of what the S&P will mean further on, but this is kind of what we have and what
we know so far.
In terms of sub debt capacity, we need to view that from two perspectives. And the most
binding, as we see, is the Solvency II perspective. If we get the internal model approved,
that will be the basis for the 50% of capital requirement that can be used for Tier 2 in
Solvency II. Of that Tier 2 capacity, in our interpretation of natural perils fund and the
guarantee fund, there is not that much capacity left for subordinated debt. If we are
overruled on the guarantee fund and the natural perils fund, then our capacity for sub
debt will increase, and also, for some reason, the capital requirement should end up
higher than the internal model tells us that it is, then that also increases the sub debt
capacity.

I can just give some comments to the stake in the SR-Bank. What we have said is that we
are planning to sell the stake when the price and timing is correct. We have the capacity
to hold on to the stake, but when the direction is clear, we will sell oﬀ the stake given that
the timing and price is correct.

FINAL

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay. Just coming back to the second question, the one with the sub-debt capacity. I
mean, I guess you can cover 50% of the NOK 10 billion internal model requirement with
non-equity capital. Isn't that correct?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

You can't actually read exactly the internal model capital requirement from our
presentation since we use, when we present the total capital requirement that includes
our internal buﬀer of 20% above the solvency requirement.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Jostein Amdal

And also includes the capital requirement for the non-insurance entities (32:17) directly
from that.

Thank you. We will now take our next question from David Andrich from Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead, your line is open.

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just three on my side. First of all, I
was just wondering with your comments around Norwegian private market, are you
seeing – are you indicating or are you seeing an increase in competition on that leading to
not being able to put through quite as high kind of premium increases as what you have
in the past, hence you're seeing slightly lower premium growth?
My second question is on the Baltic markets. For the last couple of quarters, you've had
negative reserve leases so you've made reserve contributions there. And I was just
wondering when you might see that starting to – I mean, those have actually, I think, been
increasing slightly. When you might see that start to reverse?
And then ﬁnally, I wonder if you could comment quickly on paid-up policies in the
Norwegian pension markets, what you're seeing in terms of capital requirements there

Okay. I can – it's Helge. I can start with some comments on the private market and the
situation in Norway, while Catharina and Jostein can take the two other questions. I
commented the situation related to growth in the Private segment. It's some actuarial
(33:57) eﬀects between second quarter and third quarter, so actually it's around 3%
premium growth in the third quarter, and it's around 4.5% growth in the second quarter.
As earlier communicated, running premium increases are in line with long-term claims
inﬂation. But we do selective adjustments into certain attractive segments, meaning
premium increases are, on average, lower.

Bloomberg Transcript

It hasn't – I actually think that the competition and the situation is more or less the same as
we have seen throughout 2014. And our situation has been the same throughout whole
2014. Premium increases have, therefore, had somewhat weaker eﬀect on growth in
earned premiums lately than in past few years. But what I'll also comment in my
presentation, we have seen the stabilization on number of customers through 2013 into
2014. And throughout third quarter, we saw a positive development in number of
customers.
The main competitors is the same. It's Tryg, Aktiv, and DNB is also ambitious. We have
lately seen Storebrand more active. And as you know, the Norwegian organization (35:10)
Danske Bank. But we also meet the saving banks as before. And the situation is more or
less the same actually. It's high competition. DNB is not more active compared to what we
have seen a year before. Storebrand is more active compared to what we saw one year
ago.

I can comment on the Baltic's. It's correct that we have had a negative reserve release in
this quarter. What we do every quarter is is use the best estimate for the reserves, so we
try every quarter to get the results correct. But as you have seen, we have had some
negative eﬀects in the Baltic's. But it's also important to remember then that when you
look at the Baltic's, the duration on the reserves are on average 0.7 years. So, we don't
expect this to be anything a long-term change or something that aﬀects our results going
forward due to negative trend. This is a very short-term business. And again, we try to do
it correct every quarter.

FINAL

A comment on the paid-up policies. I mean, we're probably not the right company to ask
about these capital requirements. This is not anything in that amount in our balance sheet
at all. I think more general comment, there's obviously two rules including the transitional
rules are softened, you could say, compared to earlier. But the problem, in our opinion, is
more – it's not the capital requirements as such, but it's the longevity, which are
increasing, and the low interest rates. That's the more problem rather than the capital
requirements.

Thank you. We will now take our next question from Matti Ahokas, Danske Bank. Please
go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good morning. Two questions on my side. Sorry as well. Going back to slide number
10, you talked a lot about this capital, but I'd like to revisit the question by Jakob about
how much is the actual capacity increase to sub-debt. Is it the 25% total available capital
S&P requirement and A, should we expect that you do something to increase the subdebt going forward and/or why didn't you do it now? And how should we look at the real
capacity for you guys to increase the leverage in this company?
The second question was on the falling interest rate. I missed a bit Catharina's comments
on the falling interest rate challenge. Could you revisit a bit on where will the impact be
the most? And also, we've seen quite a signiﬁcant turmoil in the high yield bonds in the
fourth quarter in Norway. Should we expect that to have an impact for Gjensidige as well?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Okay. I can start with the sub-debt. Our real capacity is that we need to be within the
requirements both from a rating perspective as soon as we start with A rating and the
regulatory perspective. And since we're close to Solvency II, we're looking at the Solvency
II requirements.
The most binding for us at the moment in terms of capacity for sub-debt is the Solvency II
requirements. And it is the capital requirement from the internal model as soon as that is
approved, where we have 50% of that capital requirement available for Tier 2. And then
of that Tier 2 capital, we assume that natural perils fund are a large part of that and the
guarantee provision will be Tier 2 capital and use the substantial part of the tier 2 capital
bucket. That leaves not more room for sub-debt than what we have already issued.
And then as I mentioned in the presentation, if somehow during the approval process for
the internal model, the capital requirement is increased for some reason, or that there's a
diﬀerent judgment on the natural perils fund or the guarantee provision, that may

Page 13 of 24

increase the capacity for sub debt. But without those two items or those two topics
cleared, we won't do anything more on sub debt.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

FINAL

But if they also are cleared, how much would the capacity be in that case, then?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

That'll be speculative, depending on what the outcome, actually, and stuﬀ. So it's more –
that will be pure speculation.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

And that your question regarding the yields, of course, the lower interest rate aﬀects both
the free portfolio and the match portfolio. But in the free portfolio, there is fair value
adjustment, or the bonds are booked at fair value. But if you look at the match portfolio, a
large part of the bonds are booked at amortized cost, which means that the running yield
is not aﬀecting the current interest rate level. It's – when you see this – call it the majority
portfolio, and the value of NOK 1.7 billion. That is, of course, kind of a buﬀer for the
booked returns going forward, meaning that the booked returns will be much more slow
than what the actual interest rate levels should tell you.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And then the high-yield bonds?

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yeah. The high-yield bonds are in the free portfolio, and they are booked at fair value.

Q - Matti Ahokas

developments in the recent weeks?

FINAL

Yes. Good morning from me as well. I'm afraid I'll have to go back to the discussion on the
sub debt and your capacity on that point. I just would like to check my math and I guess
I'm doing some mistake here. You are showing capital requirements under your internal
model of NOK 10.2 billion and you said before that there's around 20% buﬀer in that
number that we couldn't see. So, I guess the real number ought to be around NOK 8
billion or NOK 8.2 billion odd something.
If that's correct, I guess you should be able to have around NOK 4 billion, 50% of that in
Tier 2 capital requirements, but you have around NOK 2.5 billion of natural peril fund and
guarantee schemes, so there should be another NOK 1.5 billion left for sub debt. And I
guess you have issued NOK 1.2 billion.
Is this the math that we should look at it? So there's really around NOK 300 million or. Is
this what you're referring to when you say that there's no sub debt capacity? And could
you possibly give us the range looking at everything that you know right now for the
future or how should we really look at this matter at this point?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Your reason is quite correct. I won't comment on the speciﬁc numbers, but that's far away.
I don't think we've given guidance on the range going forward.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

And also, we're not giving that.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Okay. Can I ask you something else here in the capital model? If I look at equities, you
have a total charge in the model of NOK 3.4 billion which if I've done the math quick and
dirty, it seems like it's a 60% capital charges on your equities portfolio which is even
higher than what we used to know. I think previously we were talking about 45%, 50%, is
that correct? And if so, does it really make sense to hold equities in a business like this
considering the capital charge that you're having in there?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

When you look at us, yes, you need to include also private equity, SR-Bank, current
equities and so.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Yeah. Yeah.

Page 15 of 24



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA

The average charge from the Norwegian equity is 49%, and for private equity it's 62%.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

62% you said, right? Just to understand, 62%?

FINAL

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

For private equity, that's correct.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

It's in a way you have 13% kind of top charge on top of the ordinary equity charge for
unlisted equities. So, to the question when it makes sense to hold this. We manage our
capital and kind of our asset allocation, our capital management activities based on the
internal model and try to have a balanced portfolio where we utilize those diversiﬁcation
beneﬁts that naturally arise in such a portfolio. And that is our kind of our perspective on
how we manage it, and it's not the S&P cap requirement, it's a requirement of the total
capital on there.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

If I can just ﬁnal – just really a couple of more questions. On a broader perspective I guess
– sorry, the question is also for Catharina and Helge, because my understanding is that
really you're mostly in Private lines in Norway and Commercial lines for SMEs. So – sorry,
again. The rating doesn't really seem to be particularly needed for your insurance
operation. But the answer that you gave us before was that it's mostly needed for the
bank. It just seems to me that the capital that S&P ties up on this model, it's enormous
compared to your own internal model. And I'm struggling a bit to understand why do you
hold on to this or at least why you don't push S&P a little bit more. Perhaps you're doing
it, we just don't know it, on aligning this model closer to your internal model. Is it possible
to get any sort of answer to this?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I'm afraid I have to give you the answer again. But, in terms of why and well what uses you
have for an internal model, even though we are mainly have a higher market share in
Private market and small, medium enterprises, we do also have substantial business that is
in the higher end which is brokered or which is with municipalities. And they have credit
committed, especially if it's broker with a U.S. headquarter that seemed to be focused on
that. So, that for those parts of the business, we do like to have an A rating or at least an A
minus rating.
Also, as you mentioned, the bank has a substantial external funding and the bank's rating
is dependent upon our rating. That means either for the bank itself or for the...

Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Thank you. So, just have three points please. One is I noticed the strategic buﬀer. And
it seems like going to go back to roughly speaking of NOK 1.5 billion level. I just wanted
to know whether – and why I'm asking this question is because I was a bit surprised by the
extra NOK 800 million or so that capital that was returned.
Given that your ROE, anyways, is not below 15% at the moment, what was the need to preempt this and why (47:40) strategic buﬀer is because unless you are going to keep the
strategic buﬀer at NOK 1 billion, I thought it was quite strange to ﬁrst pay down that NOK
800 million and then try to earn it back, keep it as a buﬀer. So, just if you could comment
on the strategic buﬀer and the decision to pay more at a special dividend.
The second thing is on a going-forward basis, I know the ordinary dividend range is
greater than 70%. Could you guide a bit more, is it likely to be closer to 100%, closer to
70%. And why I ask you is because now that a lot of the balance sheet excess has been
shed – has been paid out rather, I just would like to understand the upside to the payout.
And just lastly, if I can just ask, I understand now the sub debt capacity. But it seems to me
that sub debt is more like a hedge towards the FSA and FSA decisions. But virtually, are
you really okay to use that hedge and really leverage up? That's maybe a comment from
Helge as well for that, please. Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

On the size of the strategic buﬀer, we present NOK 1 billion but as we underlined, that
does not include the amount of proﬁts that will be withheld from 2014 accounts. So, it's
kind of not including this year's results at all.

Page 17 of 24

FINAL

And in terms of the size of the strategic buﬀer, we haven't given any speciﬁc guidance on
the minimum and maximum limits there. We have to remind you from third quarter last
year, one of the reasons why we do have a strategic buﬀer. And also, from the third
quarter last year, we presented our dividend policy that the excess capital will be
distributed over time. And it has been natural for us to take out this excess capital in third
quarter.
We will not comment or give any guidance on the actual dividend ratio. That will be up to
the board to decide after the fourth quarter results are ready. And in terms of the last
question?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

We can relate to the dividends. We can repeat what we have said, actually, before. 2013
level is not the anchor for 2014 level. The dividend policy is 70% or more. It should be
high and stable from 2015. And the target assumptions you can take with you is broad in
line with GDP long term, somewhat lower risk appetite investment portfolio after the
Storebrand sale and the corporate tax of 27% and increased capital need in line with
growth. That's the communication around dividend. But, of course, it's like as Jostein said,
it's up to the board to decide the starting point. And the last question was related to
subordinated debt, wasn't it?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Our willingness to use it if kind of the FSA ends up against our expectations. And we are
willing to use sub debt and that is the point of telling you that there is an increased
capacity if we do not get our views across bank debt (51:46).

quite high. Could you elaborate a bit more about this? What is about typically in the third

portfolio? And what speciﬁcally do you refer to when you talk about the acquired
portfolio?

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

When we talk about the acquired portfolio, we talk about the two portfolios that we

FINAL

Those are the two portfolios that we bought last year. And when we buy portfolios, of
course, you have a time perspective on how long time it should take for these portfolios
to be in line with the rest of our portfolio when it comes to proﬁtability.
And when we look at business cases and look at the pricing of these cases, of course, we
need to consider them, how much time we need to integrate this business into our
current business, and what the costs are, and how long time we need. So, this is just to tell
you that, of course, the Nordic segment in 2014, the results in Nordic segment is aﬀected
by new portfolios coming into the segment, and thus we need time to integrate them and
to take oﬀ eﬀect from entering new business in the segment.

Thank you. We will now take our next question from Sami Taipalus, Berenberg. Please go

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First of all on costs, I wanted to ask. I was a little bit
surprised that you stuck with your 15% cost ratio target. And I guess, if we look at this
segmentally, you're quite signiﬁcantly below 15% already in both Private and Commercial.
If we look at the other two segments, I guess part of driving those cost ratios down must
be scale, which I'm assuming that you're hoping to build over the next few years. So, is
there some reason why the current expense levels in Commercial and Private are not
sustainable or are you anticipating some very substantial investments? Or why have you
started with a high-cost ratio?
Then second of all, you mentioned about the new pricing for your best business, and
increasing prices less for these customers and for others maybe. And that that's probably
what's driving premium or I suppose adding premium growth. I was wondering is the
margin unchanged on this business or are you actually willing to give up a little bit of
margin in order to attract these customers?
And ﬁnally, I'm afraid I'm going to have to go back to the discussion about capital. And I
guess, since the A rating appears to be something that you're quite keen on. Could you
just tell us how much of your premiums and proﬁts in the insurance business actually
come from ratings-sensitive business? Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you. I can start and make some comments related to the cost ratio target, and
maybe Catharina, you can feed me out afterwards on the margin in the Private lines
before Jostein take the latter.

FINAL

I will start with saying that we are actually a cost leader in the Nordics today. So, I think we
have a very strong position. As you have seen, we reported 14.5% in third quarter, 14.8%
year-to-date. And we are actually more eﬃcient than – much more eﬃcient than the
international peers.
We do not see any signiﬁcant investment in any large core systems or things like that. But
to be – to secure our competitiveness going forward, we think it's important to continue to
drive the underlying cost ratio further down in Private segment, in the Commercial
segment, and also in the Nordic segment. But we think it's important to give room for
investing into future technology, brand and skills.
And you know, today, 25% of all contacts into Gjensidige is through a smartphone or a
smartblet, smart tablet. And we have to be prepared to rapid changes in customer
behavior, actually. So, this is to secure our future. But we will continue to deliver among
the best cost ratios in the Nordic area. So, if we see a situation with lower cost ratios
around our main peers, we will, of course, follow that.

Q - Per Grønborg
Yes. Good morning. It's Per from Danske. I have a follow up on the question that Matti
asked a bit earlier on the other Nordic business. You addressed the issue that it was
explained by the acquired business. I just wonder a bit, is this some seasonality because
neither in Q1 nor Q2 where you also had these two businesses consolidated, you used
that as an explaining factor for driving up the claims. Is anything special in this quarter
where it drives up the claims signiﬁcantly more than what you saw in the ﬁrst two
quarters?

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yeah, back to the Nordic, no, it's no seasonality in the ﬁgures. And it's still something that
you will see probably at today's ﬁgures. So, it should probably have included at the
comments in the last quarter as well. And so, it's nothing seasonality in these ﬁgures.

Q - Per Grønborg
But if that is the case, they also have a negative impact in the previous two quarters and it
looks like you're seeing a signiﬁcantly worse proﬁtability this quarter in the other Nordics
compared to what you saw the previous two quarters. And the cloudburst only explains a
third of this the deterioration of the combined ratio.

eﬀect that you will see through 2014 year-to-date.

FINAL

Q - Per Grønborg
It's in the eﬀect that you also were included both in the Q1 and the Q2 reported ﬁgures or
is it a full-year eﬀect you are now charging only to the third quarter?

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

No. No. It has been in the – I think the Gouda portfolio was acquired in the fourth – or it
came into our ﬁgures in the fourth quarter last year and the Solid portfolio came in I think
was 1st of February this year. So, the eﬀects have been since Gouda since last year in the
fourth quarter and the Solid portfolio since the 1st of February this year.

Q - Per Grønborg

this quarter compared to what we saw in the previous quarters?

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

There are no speciﬁc comments of it – that we see eﬀect from the both portfolio that we

putting through lower price increases? Is it unchanged or – that was my other question.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah. No. We – what's important actually is that we will continue to calibrate our Private
business in Norway to secure that we can deliver proﬁtable growth, and deliver also
within our ﬁnancial – to meet our ﬁnancial targets. And as I commented initially, we are
very pleased that we can combine premium growth, proﬁtable development, and
increased customer satisfaction. But the communication I gave you is the same
communication we have given you through 2014 with slightly lowered price increases in
average due to our pricing in very attractive segments in Norway.

Q - Sami Taipalus
