Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Storebrand's Third Quarter 2012
Conference Call. My name Trond Finn, Head of Investor Relations at Storebrand. Together
with me, I have Group CEO, Arild Grefstad; Group CFO, Lars Løddesøl; and the --. As we
have notiﬁed a slide presentation will be running on the webcast, available on
www.storebrand.com/ir..
The slide supplements the analyst presentation released this morning. In the presentation
today, Arild Grefstad will give an overall view of the development in Q3 before Lars will
give I think on the operational Storebrand development. -- then will then our overview on
the measures Storebrand are implementing to improve operations and prepared for
Solvency II. After the presentation, the operator will open up for questions. Today to ask
questions, you need to dial into the conference call. I believe the Storebrands' CEO Arild
Grefstad. Arild Grefstad will represent the second quarter results ﬁrst Storebrand group
starting on slide number two.

Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Thank you Trond Finn. Now let me start on slide two on the results. The results for the
quarters shown underlying good development despite a 181 million charge to cover
restructuring costs in accordance with the ongoing cost program. Year-to-date results
report proﬁt sharing and loan losses had grown by 19% compared to the same period last
year. Again excluding a restructuring costs.

On operational side, as communicated in the presentation for the second quarter
Storebrand have a wide range of measures and their implementation to adopt the
business model into Solvency II. And increase the robustness ion the interest rates
environments. And let me quickly mention some examples of implementive measures in
the third quarter. The cost program is launched and new initiatives are being
implemented. The implement price increases for guaranteed products both in Norway
and Sweden. And we introduce new products. And advice customers who will beneﬁt
from it to move guaranteed products, to non-guaranteed products, and expected higher
return. In September the program moved around 500 million in Storebrand expertise to
these non-guranteed products.
A positive equity markets combined with the credit spread contraction have led to a
strong value adjusted return this quarter and year-to-date. In Norway, this has led to a
market value adjustment serve of 2.4 billion and also a booked return of all the
guarantees with an undistributed return of 1.1 billion. These 12 months together are
important for ﬁrst and that can be realized there in the fourth quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

On top of this, we have seen the health maturity reserve in growing by 3.5 billion to 5.3
billion. In Sweden, the conditional bonuses has increased so far this year by 1.2 billion to
8.4 billion. So all together a strong increase in buﬀer capital during the year. Then we
move to slide number three, as a service to the analyst following the company, we have
no have not added column showing the third quarter result excluding the restructuring
cost in connection with ongoing cost program. This makes it possible to look at
underlying results comparable from quarter-to-quarter.
We see at the life insurance bank and a lot of lease insurance segment shows very strong
results improvements this quarter. The only segment thing left with a disappointing
development is the asset management operations. We expect higher results than around
on the 20s on a quarterly basis. We see that income is reduced because of customer
allocation from equities through ﬁxed income. Cost for Norwegian have increased due to
the adoption to new regulatory requirements.
We also see that we have allocated 52 million of the short restructuring cost through asset
management. This is a clear indication that they have a clear target for a substantial cost
reduction within our asset management business.
Then we move to --, and now I'd like to start to jump over the diﬀerent business units.
And, go directly to the Storebrand Group operational reporting on slide number nine.
As you can see the Group result, or with this overview you can see the Group result split
into the diﬀerent components driving the earnings in the company. The result before -sorry the result befor proﬁt sharing and loan losses is increasing even if you include the
provision for the cost program of 181 million. Excluding this charge there is an underlying
growth of 19% year-to-date which is quite strong.
The fee and administration result shows an improvement in the quarter and has increased
by 5% so far this year. The increase is slightly lower than we have indicated previously as a
Page 2 of 18

result of the lower income in the asset management company.

FINAL

However as a result of the what we -- when we look forward at the income projections we
can expect to see continuing growth in the fee and administration income and with the
cost programs implemented, the cost level should go down. So that the fee and
administration result will show a strong results in the year's ahead.
In the quarter, the holding company and company portfolio results are good especially
there has been a very strong return in the company portfolios both in Norway and
Sweden which gives a good result from this business line.
There is also lower cost in the holding company as such. The net proﬁt sharing and loan
losses shows a good result after proﬁt sharing in the Swedish business as a result of
strong recurrence there.

Bloomberg Transcript

Flipping over to the next page, key ﬁgures, we see that the result for proﬁt sharing and
loan losses, the blue element in the graph on the open left hand side shows a satisfactory
development, excluding the one-oﬀ charges. And, the quarter earnings continue to
strengthen in the quarter.
Looking at earnings per share is NOK 0.87 after tax, before amortization. If we were to
include, if we were to deduct the amortization result would be NOK 0.63 per share. The
tax charge that we have used in the quarter is based on the old tax rules, new tax rules
were published on October 8th, and we will spend fourth quarter to implement them in
the tax reporting that we have going forward.
However I would like to emphasize that we have maintained the guiding on a tax charge
of 20% to 25% of the result before amortization. Furthermore, I would also like to
reemphasize that we have 7.7 million in net tax carrying those forward at the beginning of
the year which will make us in order to have a payable tax charge for a number of years to
come.
If we look at the solvency ratio and the solidity capital, solidity capital has strengthened
signiﬁcantly in the quarter with a surplus return with increase in the customer represent
Norway and Sweden and the solvency position has strengthened somewhat despite a
growth in the balance sheet in Norway and Sweden as well as somewhat lower interest
rate level in Sweden. So the portfolio situation have developed favorably during the
quarter.
And I'll give the word back to Odd Arild.
Thank you, Lars. Then we'll move to slide 12 but having Storebrand to work Solvency II. In
comments with our release of the second quarter result, I'll spend some time on the main
levers to transform the business from Solvency I to Solvency II. I will again focus on our
internal measures that are being implemented to improve our competitiveness and
comparability to the Solvency II result.

FINAL

But ﬁrst one minute on the domestic and the AU level. First of all, the work to transform
the Norwegian occupational pension system is still ongoing. This autumn, the banking law
commission is working on conversion rules for existing pension liabilities within deﬁned
beneﬁt into the proposed new hybrid products.
Of course this is a challenging and complex cost but we have no reason to believe that
there will any delays. So, we still expect the new proposal to be out in the market before
year-end. When it comes Solvency II process on the AU level, there has already been
postpones in the process. Because of this delays, we now see that this two process, there
is highly likely and that is Solvency II highly unlikely that the Solvency II will be
implemented on the 1st of January 2014.
It's still not clear. Will, if it will then be 2015 or 2016. But it's quite interesting to read that
what Carlos Montalvo the Executive Director of the European Insurance and Occupational
Pensions Authority, the EIOPA said that some days ago and I read from the paper, Mr.
Montalvo said if we were going for 2015 everything would have to be perfect and only my
wife is perfect, having that he expects Solvency II implementation now to be delayed until
2016.

Bloomberg Transcript

When it comes to Storebrand in our perspective, we feel it's very important for us to keep
up the momentum in the Norwegian legislative policies and regardless of the European
process. It also makes very much business sense for us to fulﬁll our cost programs and
also do the conversion of the business, internal capitalized environment. So we have full
focus on our internal measures towards 2014.
I'll spend the rest of the presentation now on our internal measures moving to slide
number 12. First let's remind ourselves of the ambition. We have a clear target to manage
the transition in the Solvency II without raising new equity capital. And last quarter, we
went through the four and main categories to fulﬁll this ambition. First of all, capital
optimization, these measures aim to take the capital in the group available under coming
Solvency II regulations.
Then we have risk reduction. Main purpose is to adopt asset allocation to the current
prospects of the liabilities. This typically includes increased duration under the used
allocation practices on our product level. Then cost reduction, through a reduced costs,
and increased proﬁtability, increase this available capital with all front ramiﬁcation.
Then on the product side this includes both moving customers to proﬁtable products
under Solvency II. But also changes in product terms and conditions, and prices is
important to increase the capital situation to about Solvency II. And this quarter, we have
worked with this diﬀerent categories and let me give you some examples of what we are
implementing and having implement already.
Let's start on slide 13, on the cost program. Last quarter, we announced the target of
annual cost savings of 400 million. Drove down our cost base in 2014 of 3.5 billion. Focus
in the third quarter has been to identify the levers to reduce cost to reach this target and
as we see on the right hand side, we have identiﬁed 75 diﬀerent measures, 12 of them
Page 4 of 18

Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2012-10-24

already have been implemented, as we show in the graph. We follow this on a monthly
and quarterly basis to make sure that we fulﬁll the total cost savings of 400 million. There
is also a lot of focus on develop new tasks and measures that can make sure that we get
the 400 million and even more going forward.

FINAL

We are also being now clear to take the restructuring costs on the company level, having
up to 181 million in connection with the cost program.
The measures are ranging from a lot of diﬀerent elements. Most important is of course the
mining costs and also cost of sourcing of IP systems and so on. We gave the number of
300 people in the reduction to fulﬁll the 400 million obligation and we have already
during the third quarter have been able to have voluntarily lay out of 80 people,
employees to fulﬁll this cost program.
Going forward, there is a lot of other measures in pipeline and one of the important
measures is to scale up our operations in Storebrand Baltic and this expansion will reduce
the numbers of employees in Norway and Sweden accordingly.

Bloomberg Transcript

There is a complete cost breakdown provided in the appendix of this presentation that
makes it possible for you to fulﬁll our full R&D cost reduction program on a quarterly
basis.
If we then move to slide 14, if the number also possible adjustment in the pricing of the
guaranteed products. These eﬀorts needs to be reviewed in our also in our Solvency II
context. Again in the second quarter we have already introduced the increased prices on
the private sector pension. This quarter we also introduced 20% uplift in the price for
interest rate guarantees and proﬁt from risk. And we also introduced 2% up-front fee for
old, new and guaranteed paid-up policies that is issued from the 1st of March 2013. There
is also diﬀerent measures taking place in SPP on the guaranteed business a 15% increase
in management fees.
And, also doubling on the ﬁxed fee, on the diﬀerent contracts. Altogether this is forceful
measures and it is important for us to increase the proﬁtability in the products and reduce
the total technical needs in the products in themselves.
If we then move to slide number 15, and we see that the reduced cost and increased
prices are two measures to improve the product proﬁtability and strengthen the capital
position under Solvency II. Another measure is to move customers from guaranteed to
non-guaranteed products. The beneﬁt for the customer is robust that they will move into
products with higher expected return. Considerable sales force reports in the quarter
have been focused on moving and across the most to non-guaranteed products and
altogether, we are moved in Storebrand expertise grown a 500 million in this six weeks
altogether.
The next phase of this work is really to make sure that we are able to lift paid-up policies
in Norway from 1st of January 2013 into investment choice type of products.

FINAL

And let's move to slide number 16 to look a bit on this work. First of all, we have the
products now clear for the customers. We use very much of the same products, we do for
the prime contribution products, but we've also introduced them new life cycle product
that is very well adapted into the new paid-up policy products.
We also have the marketing campaign under sales campaign ready to launch and very
much over retail sale forces focused on this policy during 2013. And, operations of our
team in place, make sure us to move working on new contracts and IP solutions for the
electronic conversion are also in place. And, so more details on this is a big operation for
us. We expect this to have an 270,000 workers, 130,000 emails, 220,000 coals and
arrange 42,000 personal meetings during 2013 in this campaign.
I think then moved directly from slide 16 to slide 18 to summarize this up. In total this is a
good quarter, we have strong customer research and good underlying results. And
especially we see a strong development of the high quality earnings during the quarter.
We have a signiﬁcant strengthening of the balance sheet but the capital as I already have
talked about is increased a lot during the quarter and we've ﬂexibility during year-end.
We have also implemented a number of measures to create a more robust Storebrand.
It's cost reductions, it's pricing elements on guaranteed products and it's moving
customers from guaranteed products to non-guaranteed products and we are also ready
and prepared for the battle of moving paid-up policies into paid-up policies with
investment choice from the 1st of January 2013. Thank you.

Yes, hi. Two questions if I may. Firstly on the Solvency II issues as you've discussed. What
do you think this continues delay of Solvency II, how do you view it from your point of

view, is it positive or is it negative and how should one take this into account with the
dividend payout of this year and next year obviously you don't know which solvency
regime to look at then and so it would be very interesting to hear your thoughts regarding
this and especially the dividend payout for this year because last year you said that the
uncertainty regarding Solvency II was one of the reasons why you scrapped the dividend?
And then the next question is on page number four, it's been a very interesting slide by
the way. What is the net impact of all of these and how should one look at this price
increase. Does this mean that the admin result on these diﬀerent product lines goes up by
for example in the deﬁned beneﬁt public sector by 25% or the premiums. It sounds good
but how should one factor this into the model line, and especially the result per product
line? Thanks.

Again, well as I said when it comes to the Solvency II process. We are very much doing in
our balance sheet, and also with our cost programs. What we feel is the right thing to do
with business anyway. And be prepared with the same speed as we done without the
Solvency II would be in place in 2014.
So, this is the right direction for the business anyway, and we have the full speed ahead of
this diﬀerent tasks. When it comes to dividends, they we'll instead remain our ability to of
course to make sure that we have the right capitalization into new regime. And again we
also said that this abnormal situation for us is not to be in the market paying dividends
and there is lot of elements going on now we have the new rules from the Banking Law
Commission coming in the two months, and I think we have to revert to the situation
saying that there is not the natural situation for Storebrand not to pay dividends. And I
don't think Geir would you like to answer part of the pricing issues?

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Sorry, if I just may on the ﬁrst question but do you think it's positive or negative from your
point of view that Solvency II is being delayed?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Quite balance on it on one side I think of course it's positive that the regulatory framework
itself has a longer view that is not a regulatory constraint that makes us on a very early
stage, sure to be have more time before that becomes a reeled boundary on the business
so to say.
On the other side of course it's not good to be have uncertainty, and as the uncertainty
around changes in the regulation on the EU level for a long time now and uncertainty
around future regulation is of course not a good thing in itself. But anyway I think the
totality of it is we view it slightly positive because we all have the time and we also do the
right measures we don't lose to again the speed in that direction to launch the right way
of running the business that is very much aligned with this whole business regime.

Great. Thanks.

FINAL

A - Geir Holmgren

{BIO 17639172 <GO>}

Okay. Think from -- and risk proﬁt margin is on approximately around 550 million on
elevated. Then we have a lot of changes in the balance sheet during 2013 because we
expect transfer outs in the public sector approximately NOK 5 billion to NOK 6 billion
during 2013 as a result of the pricing increase in that sector.
In the private sector, we have the -- you see on new pages from the 1st of March an
increase in the level of the pricing for the interest guarantee, but it's such as the aﬀect
during 2013 because we expect a lot of time to that to convert from DB to DC during the
last year we have seen that on annual basis approximately NOK 5 million to NOK 6 million
have been paid us because of client transferring their pension scheme from DB to DC and
our during this research the clariﬁcation do that in the beginning of the year about 50% of
those charges will probably happen during January or February in 2013.
And then the new fee for the pay is still actually not applied for the payment of these
charges. So selling interest, and we can probably expect increase on the total income
from the fees from product guarantees, interest guarantee and from the proﬁt margin but
I expect close to -- million a year to 200 million but that was very hard number to estimate
and adds lot of uncertainty currently to it.

When it comes to the Swedish business, I think the measures altogether here is a net

thoughts just, but did you give a ﬁgure for how much of the deﬁned beneﬁts fund are you

expected to leave as a result of price increases, I thought I heard you say 5 billion to 6
billion. But, if you could perhaps just conﬁrm that?
And second question is just related to what scope there is to increased pricing in your
products from any other actions as well? And then the my ﬁnal question is just related to
the upcoming Banking Law Commission report. Do you have any indications of what
direction the, thoughts are going on and any sort of update you can give around that?
Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

If I just start to sum it up. I think ﬁrst of all, we've talked about the public sector in the
second quarter and of course what we gave you the price elements there I was very clear
about going whole to more or less from the public sector guaranteed business. And we
expect that to give out in a situation where around 5 billion to 6 billion perhaps result this
year. When it comes as a price issues that is the -- when it comes to the public, the private
sector from that increase of the price of the interest guarantee and also introducing this
fee of on paid-up policies.

Bloomberg Transcript

That is very much inline with what we see other players do in the market. So this is not
increasing in our lines, that's transfers from in DB into DC, but there is of course an
ongoing process that we have set they have already for years that there has been closed
the DB books and start oﬀ DC books in itself.
But this price and announce this also very much what we can expect to see it is all interest
rate level we have in the market and we know right price of the interest rate guarantee
going forward. So I think at this time what Geir said was that if you do have all the
balances going forward and use that numbers from this year, you could expect maybe
200 million in increased results.
But because of the movements in the balance this year, we expect that to be a lower
number mainly because rolled out lower in the public sector but also because of that the
conversion this year on other elements and also the introduction ﬁrst from 1st of March on
the paid-up policies. So it is more likely to be around a 100 million number I think for the
Norwegian business and you have the 30 million on the Swedish business on top of that.
If you look at other price elements of course there is a lot of price elements both in a low
ramp than we have now been running through by much of the guaranteed business but
price adjustment that you do on an annual basis on the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme and/or is
a new price element based on the solvency fee and on the paid-up policies. We have a lot
of tools, of course available that looks -- this is what we now introduced for 2013. Of
course there is a competition also going on here, and we have to look at the competition
in the markets. As a part of all this pricing issues. Then the last question was about...

Banking Law Commission?

Banking Law Commission. Yes. Of course the Banking Law Commission now is working
with a third phase of the work ﬁrst phase was paid-up policies. And we expect more to be
clear now on Friday. Then the second phase was to introduce -- directly before summer.
And we expect them now to be able to be out in the market with a conversion from DB
into the new products by year-end. I would say it's a process with high speed, it would not
be right for us to comment and have any speculation I think about the policies at this
stage but we expect to have the outﬂow from that before Christmas.

Thanks very much and good afternoon, a few questions from me. Just picking up on the
impact of the price increases that you are putting forward. Just to conﬁrm you did
comment that you thought that you were moving inline with the competitors, that was the
ﬁrst thing I wanted to pick up? Secondly on the paid-up policies a 2% up-front fee I just
wonder how signiﬁcant that is given there is hardly any new paid-up contracts at the
moment. I believe and probably even fewer going into the future if the legislation goes
the way you expect? So just trying to get some clarity here and there and as opposed
more generally there seems to be a lot of moving parts on your proﬁts expectations and
you've talked in the past about the business being capable of generating around 3 billion
or so of earnings.
And I just wondered where we are relative to that number are the cost cuts and the price
increases that you're implementing intended to maintain a business that can earn roughly
speaking 3 billion of earnings before tax? So sorry that's a detailed ﬁrst question or set of
questions. The second one is really just drilling down into the investment management
business, this is our business that's been earning of the order of NOK 250 million to NOK
300 million. And clearly we're at a fraction of that level at the moment in terms of run rate
and I just wonder how quickly you're expecting that to bounce back as you're thinking in
terms of the outlook the earnings for that business over the next couple of years are we
going to be of the order of 100 million or is it going go back to the 200 million, 300
million level? Thanks very much.

Thank you. Starting with the price issues, ﬁrst of all yes we have the impression that what
we do in the market, now when it comes to the private sector, and also for the paid-up
policies is very much inline with what we have seen competition and the competitors do
in the markets. When it comes to paid-up policies and there is not a transfer market for
paid-up policies but of course as you have same deﬁned-beneﬁt schemes that are being - lost into deﬁned contribution, that creates new paid-up policies.
And, you also have turned over in the diﬀerent companies that have active paid-up -active deﬁned-beneﬁts so that leads also in a situation that we have new paid-up policies
coming into the balance sheet. So it's quite and I think if you look at the last quarter it was
2 billion in increase or something in paid-up policies so there is an increase in that
portfolio that will be eﬀective with on the result line with the research and instrument
that's the 2% charge that we're seeing here.
When it comes to the guiding I think ﬁrst of all we are planning to have a Capital Markets
Day in March where we have to look at all the diﬀerent parts and pieces again and
especially of course the new rulings from the Banking Law Commission we will have quite
an impact let me give you an example, if we have a movement now from the existing
deﬁned-beneﬁt schemes that moves into more or less partly this hybrid products, then
you will have a lower I expect price range with regard to it. But then again also a lower
capital in the business. So there is changes in the balance sheet and in the result
generation. What we see when we have the line we have drawn from 2012 to 2013, we're
very well inline with estimates on the existing business with the existing segment but of
course new rules and changes in regulation will have to be taken into account in 2014
where the new regulation is active.
You mentioned 3 billion there, and obviously the 2.5 billion core earnings that's goes up
set on the North Capital Markets there and we are progressing towards that in 2014 one
year behind plan as we've previously announced. The other 0.5 billion you take is from
the net proﬁt sharing and loan losses as we are de-risking the business and building
buﬀers with our surplus returns obviously that amount is going to look a little lower and
then although interest with changes in the regulatory framework in 2014 we need to
update the forecast with new regulations.
On your last questions the asset management business. The asset management business
shows a weak earnings development in the second quarter and more so now in the third
quarter some of these issues are related to one-oﬀ charges those are one-oﬀ issues but
on the income side and cost side nevertheless the results are weak. The results will pick
up with booked proﬁt sharing bonuses in the fourth quarter as we used to book that in
the fourth quarter and with the measures that we are now implementing both on the cost
side and on the income side, and on the income side there are a couple of diﬀerent
things happening. One thing is, the fact that we have a quite strong growth in assets
under management that is positive.
The other thing is that when we are now implementing these programs on transferring
business from guaranteed schemes to non-guaranteed schemes, you will see a shift from
Page 11 of 18

investments with low risk and low equities at all into products with a much more long-term

Hi good afternoon. I was wondering if you could maybe comment on how the
developments of the 400 million in savings will come through in 2013. Do you expect
they're coming through materially in the ﬁrst quarter or sooner, and do you think it'll fairly
evenly spread or quite chunky?
Second, I know is that you sold down a signiﬁcant portion of your gifts exposure in terms
of Italy, Ireland, and Spain. And I was wondering if you give some comment on what the
impact of that was in the quarter? And ﬁnally, would you mind giving us some updates on
the longevity provisions that you spoke about in the ﬁrst quarter? Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

On the 400 million, the -- put in place to have a lower cost level from 2014 and you will
get the full impact by 2014. The impact will come gradually and increasingly through to
2013 i.e. you will see not too much in the ﬁrst quarter as success have been more through
the second, third and fourth quarter and you'll see the full aﬀect in 2014. With respect to
the -- exposure was not sold down but they were a number of bonds maturing coming to
maturity. And as we've said all along, we are bidding down the portfolio in a careful
manner and waiting for some of these factors to go into maturity which I have to a lot
extent done this quarter. We'll continue to drift down the portfolio but not force -- at the
bridge.
And on your third question on longevity, the FSA Norway has indicated that they are
going to publish a new mortality table in the fourth quarter. However, we see that the
management for now are looking at mortality tables and longevity in connection with the
new occupational pension schemes and we do not know exactly what is going to happen
whether we are going to get these new mortality tables in the fourth quarter or whether
mortality tables would be to ﬁt into the new occupational pension schemes?

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

I think I'd like to also add to that. That we're able to build an unspeciﬁed reservation in the
last year of 1.5 million towards these potential longevity resulting. And of course with the
buﬀers, we now see in the second quarter about 1.2 billion in the return of about the
guarantee level and also 2.4 million in -- gains. And various and good opportunities to
also do quite a strongly serving at year-end 2012.

Good afternoon I just have a couple of questions. One could you update us on when we
should be expecting the new tax legislation to come into force whether it's going to be in
the fourth quarter or in the next year, I understood it's going until this year? And secondly
in terms of the price increases in the DB book, on your guidance of a 100 odd million in
actual revenues coming through. Do you employee that, although that certainly
employees that you're certainly expecting some of the reserves to just trying for them
paid up. And, I actually thought that Storebrand would want to avoid that at all cost. So
the timing of these price increases probably encourages that to happen.
So, I just wanted to get your thoughts on that why you are potentially putting a price
increases through the book which will encourage that sort of behavior?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Let me start on the second one and lastly I will comment on the package afterward. First
of all the price on the interest rate guarantees very much aligned with the model we have
in place. Reduced interest rates will have a very large impact on that so that is giving
normal price increase. And, that is also what we see from our competitors in the markets.
When we have the transfer out from this portfolio, that is very much from the public sector
and the public sector has now paid-up policies issues there is no paid-up policies for the
Page 13 of 18

Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2012-10-24

public sector products so that is at clear transfer out from us into technicality the more or
less -- in the public sector.

FINAL

So we don't expect the this price elements on deﬁned beneﬁts to encourage for moving
to what's deﬁned contribution and increased paid-up policies that is not our expectation
but there is a turnaround in the portfolio that we still have that aﬀect strong on demand
through deﬁned contribution as such.

A - Geir Holmgren

{BIO 17639172 <GO>}

If I just may add the 2% -- paid-up policies only applies to guaranteed paid-up policies so
if you get the transfer to paid-up policies with investment choice then after that there is no
need to pay 2% up-front fee in this way -- and and some -- are the same as such then -which also could be helpful and on the tax issues White Paper was published of all days
on Sunday January 1st this year. Saying that the tax increases would be valid from January
1st the same day and then there has been some work on making this into a new law. And,
that was published on October 8th.

Bloomberg Transcript

So the law has aﬀect from January 1st this year. But, we have to rebuild our reporting to
the ﬁnal text of the, law which we've not been able to do since the short period since
October 8th so that will happen in the fourth quarter. And, we will have full tax reporting
according to the full tax reporting according to the new rules by year-end. And as I said in
my comment a little bit earlier here. We can maintain the pricing that we will be paying or
that way we will be charged 20% to 25% of result before amortization in tax going forward
and that we will be able to use the tax to carry those forwards that we have for three or
four years before we come into a situation with payable taxes.

Thank you very much. I'd say I sort of -- my line disconnected a couple of times so I am
sorry if I go over ground that's already been covered, hopefully it doesn't involve for that
but if I could ask a few questions. Firstly on the pricing side, could you just -- I know you I
think you have said that others are doing sort of similar price increases, can you just talk

FINAL

about, given that you are doing one parts, is there any reason that you couldn't increase
the price even more than the 2% that you are currently charging?
Second thing on the less impact I know you have given some ﬁgures again I am sorry if I
missed this, maybe a little bit confused but based on the current book if you ignore and
so the future transfers out, are you able to say what the current net impact would be on
the business as you see it today? And then again is there any reason that shouldn't to the
bottom-line. And given that you've announced these price increases now I mean I
appreciate that some of the ones have impact on March next year.
Is there any reason that we shouldn't see the price increases having a similar impact on
capital to the cost savings that you've announced. I know is there any reason or in terms of
the timing but these will ﬂow through to the embedded value can we expect given that
already be announced can we expect some of these to come through at the end of this
year? Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Okay. First question about just the ﬁrst increase in positive resulted from 1st of March
2013. What is important for us is to continue to get down other client in this situation now
and they are actually waiting for the new pension products which will conﬁrm in 2014 we
will not force any client deﬁned-beneﬁt to deﬁned contribution so the level of 2% is
actually trying to balancing the need for increased income from paid-up policies but also
in fact we're having a good dialogue and giving good price to main customers that are
having still DB plans.
On your second question, the price increases if that they are lastingly increasing the
proﬁtability of the products I think that will increase the margins and therefor as a
Solvency II front and the capital and EV et cetera. However if the price increases leads to
change behavior for the clients so that for example the net rate increase which we do
expect from the guaranteed products and which we want from the guaranteed products
then obviously some of the aﬀects will be reduced by an upstream and that's why we are - we need a little bit more time to model this in an appropriate way and get back to you in
the normal MCV reporting in March, and also increasingly giving you Solvency II numbers
as they come forward here.
I think you also asked what would bidding act if you just look that while normally like 2012.
And of course I think as we already have said 20% increase on 560 million that would
have been 110 million in increased result directly on that line, and then on top of that if we
have for the full year let's say a 45 billion increases in paid-up policies, the 2% charge that
will add another 100 million that's why we say that this could have been upto 200 million
implemented for this year. But then again there is a four months period we need to the
use towards our clients before this is parted up and that is 1st of March 2013. And we
expect some conversion to DB where to paid-up policies will happen before that. And
also we have the special situation with public sector volumes that we expect to be run-oﬀ
over two years superior period and around 5 billion to 6 billion by the start of 2013. So
that is complicating the picture some more and that's why we say that we expect this 200
million plus to be more close to a 100 million.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yeah. Sorry two follow-up questions, if I may. Firstly on the Swedish tax rate cut and the
impact on SPP, will that have many impact on SPP next year and obviously on the Group
results as well? And then a more a detailed question on the life insurance the 88 million
restructuring provision and how is that split up between the diﬀerent business lines, i.e.
DB, DC and the paid-ups? Thanks.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

On the ﬁrst question, the Swedish tax rate, tax rates has been lower that's obviously
positive and we have tax optimized the group structure to the old tax regime and we will
obviously make sure that we optimize the Group structure with the new regime. I don't
want to go, we will comeback to you with reporting on that when we get to the fourth
quarter.
With respect to the life, we haven't split oﬀ the 88. Except for one thing we've said that 9
million on the 88 will be taken in products with the proﬁt split and by the way, they are
fully recovered by in the customer returns. So 79 million will get shareholder return. But,
apart from that, we haven't done a further stats?

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Okay. But, if I look at on page 13, the admin result for DB in Q3 is 164 million. So, this is not
the restructuring provision here?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yes. That's correct. That's a restructuring provision as split out in the supplementary
information data with the diﬀerent product lines, as a part of the result. But, I haven't got
the split of that compared to the other elements lying in the same ﬁgure.

Thanks. Just a quick one. The 400 million of cost savings that you're targeting. What
should one expectation is to how much of that will fall down to the bottom-line?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

We expect all of that to fall down to the bottom-line. That is total cost reduction that we
expect to be fully taken out in the bottom-line. Of course a part of this have an impact also
on the income side and that is mainly that how we expect that. Because a part of this is
really taking into account that we lose 20 million assets to investment on the public sector
and that is main element that also have income element in and of course as we said when
we neared on -- looked at least on the second quarter, we saw that this was not a
proﬁtable product, taking into account the capital constrain in the product altogether.
