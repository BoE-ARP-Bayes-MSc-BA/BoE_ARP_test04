Operator
Ladies and gentlemen. Good morning. Welcome to the Half Year 2017 Results Conference
Call and Live Webcast. I'm Sarah, the Chorus Call operator. (Operator Instructions) The
conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) The conference must not be
recorded for publication or broadcast. At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over to
Philipp GmÃ¼r, Group CEO. Please go ahead, sir.

Philipp GmÃ¼r
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome you to our conference call and
the results of the ﬁrst half of 2017. We can look back on busy and successful ﬁrst six
months 2017. Within the next 45 minutes, we would like to give you detailed information
on our business development and the key ﬁnancials of the reporting period.
Following my introduction, our CFO, Paul Norton, will go through the ﬁnancial ﬁgures. I
will then provide you with an update of the implementation of the helvetia 20.20 strategy.
Following the presentation, Paul Norton and I as well as our Chief Investment Oﬃcer,
Ralph Honegger, will be pleased to answer your questions, as always.
Let us turn to Slide #4. On Slide 4, I would like to share with you a brief overview of the
main performance indicators. Paul will give you detailed information on the developments
of these ﬁgures later on. Let us begin with the underlying earnings, which showed an
excellent performance resulting in an increase of 8.4% to CHF 258 million in the ﬁrst half
year of 2017.

The improvement was driven by the nonlife and the life business. In addition to good
technical results, in both business areas, the main driver was a higher investment result
following the pleasing development of the capital markets from January to the end of
June 2017. The business area, Other Activities, beneﬁted from a better technical result
from group reinsurance. However, due to the absence of one-oﬀ tax eﬀects, which were
included in the prior year. And slightly higher costs resulting from budgeted investments
in strategic initiatives, underlying earnings decreased compared to the ﬁrst half year of
2016.
The solid technical performance in the nonlife business is also reﬂected in the net
combined ratio that improved by 0.6percentage points to 91.3%. Worth mentioning is the
pleasing development of the net combined ratio in Europe, which decreased by
2.8percentage points, thanks to the successful portfolio restructuring and the benign
claims environment.

Bloomberg Transcript

Due to the very good progress of the integrations of Nationale Suisse and Basler Austria,
underlying earnings included synergies of CHF 62 million pretax on a half year cost basis.
In the prior half year, CHF 51 million synergies pretax were included in underlying
earnings. The integration of Nationale Suisse and Basler Austria are almost completed.
Group business volume slightly increased by 0.3percentage -- % in original currency to
CHF 5.5 billion. Nonlife business volume grew by currency-adjusted 3%. In the life
business, the modern capital-eﬃcient life products showed very pleasing growth resulting
in an increase of 37% in original currency compared to last year. Nevertheless, due to the
decline of volumes in the group life business -- because of the one-oﬀ eﬀect last year -and the planned reduction in traditional individual life business the total business volume
in life was 1.9% lower on a year-on-year comparison. Thus, we are successful in developing
our business mix according to our strategic plan.
I also want to highlight that the new business margin in the life business rose from 0.5% in
the previous year to 1.2% in the current year. This improvement shows that we are well
underway to successfully turning our new business to its modern, capital-eﬃcient
products.
Finally, annualized return on equity based on underlying earnings increased from 9.4% in
the previous year to 10.2% in the ﬁrst half year 2017.
Let us quickly have a closer look on synergies on Slide 5. As of the end of June 2017,
Helvetia had 579 full-time employee equivalents, fewer than it had has -- has had of 30
June, 2014, when we started synergy tracking.
Of these employees, a net 498 left the company due to the 2 acquisitions and can,
therefore, be counted as net staﬀ synergies. Gross synergies were even higher. But we
have increased personnel to support our strategy and to expand functions that Nationale
Suisse had outsourced, which acted as a counter-eﬀect. Finally, changes in the group
structure, i.e., the sale of Belgian entity of Nationale Suisse and the acquisition of
MoneyPark, resulted in a further net decline of 81 FTEs.

FINAL

The staﬀ reduction corresponds to around CHF 46 million in personnel cost savings on a
half year cost basis. We also had nonpersonnel cost savings of CHF 16 million in the ﬁrst
half of 2017. In particular, synergies were achieved here through a reduction in
redundancies in the areas of IT, logistics, marketing and corporate. Overall, I am happy to
conﬁrm once again that we are making great progress in achieving our synergy target.
Originally, we were setting forth a range of between CHF 105 million to CHF 130 million.
In the meantime, we are conﬁdent to end up slightly above the higher end of that range.
With that, I would like to turn over the presentation to our CFO, Paul Norton, who will now
provide you with the most important information about the key ﬁnancial ﬁgures. Please,
Paul.

Thanks, Philipp. We're on Slide 7. Our underlying earnings for the ﬁrst half of 2017
amounted to CHF 258 million and, therefore, increased 8.4% compared to the previous
year. This increase was driven by both the nonlife and the life business.

Bloomberg Transcript

One general point that I would like to mention is that all segments had positive one-oﬀ tax
eﬀects last year mainly due to the integrations. This year, the tax rates are in line with
normal expectations, which means that all segments had a higher tax charge.
In the nonlife business, underlying earnings amounted to CHF 177 million and was 16.9%
higher compared to the ﬁrst half of 2016. In addition to a better technical result, the
increase was mainly driven by a higher investment result as a consequence of the good
development of the capital markets in the ﬁrst six months. We will have a closer look on
the nonlife proﬁt by sources in a few minutes on Slide 11.
Underlying earnings of the life business were 4.2% higher at CHF 92 million. The increase
was driven by a normalized strong risk result and a higher savings result. I'll provide you
with more details on the proﬁt by sources on Slide 14.
Result from other activities amounted to minus CHF 10 million against minus CHF 1 million
in the ﬁrst half of 2016. The technical result of our group reinsurance beneﬁted from a
better technical performance of the primary insurance lines and improved accordingly.
However, due to the absence of one-oﬀ tax eﬀects, which were included in the prior year
and slightly higher costs resulting from budgeted investments in strategic initiatives,
underlying earnings decreased compared to the ﬁrst half year of 2016.
If we look at the segment results on Slide 18. All segments posted robust results in the ﬁrst
half of 2017. The Switzerland segment once again showed that it is a stable foundation to
the group by reporting a proﬁt of CHF 194 million. The increase was driven by both
business areas: Nonlife and life. In the Swiss nonlife business, underlying earnings
increased compared to the ﬁrst half of 2016 by 19.7%, mainly thanks to a higher
investment result.

FINAL

The technical result was slightly weaker but still on a good level. Also, the life business
showed 4.2% higher results on a half-year-on-half-year comparison. This was due to the
increased operating result -- essentially a higher risk and higher savings result -- as well as
higher gains in investments. Higher expenses for policyholder participation had a
compensating eﬀect. The segment result for Europe, which comprises the (market) units
of Germany, Italy, Spain and Austria, increased by 11.8% to CHF 59 million. Both the
nonlife business and the life business contributed to this proﬁt increase.
Nonlife underlying earnings in Europe increased by 14.5%. The improvement is mainly
driven by a signiﬁcant better technical performance and a slightly higher investment
result. Underlying earnings at the European life business also showed a positive
development and increased by 4.6%. The improvement came from higher gains and
losses from investments and slightly lower expenses for interest-related reserve
strengthening.
A lower savings result and higher expenses of policyholder participation as well as our
taxes -- we had some one-oﬀ tax eﬀects in the European entities last year, had a
compensating eﬀect.

Bloomberg Transcript

Specialty Markets includes the business lines Marine, Engineering and Art in the Specialty
Lines Switzerland/International market unit, the French market unit specializing in marine
reinsurance and the globally active reinsurance.
The segment result for Specialty Markets increased by 2.5%. A better technical
performance and lower nontechnical costs were mitigated by higher taxes. As I
mentioned in the beginning, last year, we had some one-oﬀ eﬀects resulting in lower
taxes and a lower net investment result.
The Corporate segment includes the corporate functions and group reinsurance in
addition to the ﬁnancing companies and the holding company. Its result of minus CHF 9
million decreased against the previous year ﬁgure of minus CHF 1 million, although the
segment showed considerably improved results from group reinsurance, in line with the
direct insurance units. The main reason for decline was that the previous year's result was
aﬀected by positive one-oﬀ tax eﬀects. Furthermore, we had slightly higher cost due to
the budgeted investments in strategic initiatives.
I'll continue with our growth on -- in business volume on Slide 9. In the ﬁrst six months of
2017, Helvetia Group achieved a business volume of CHF 5.5 billion. This equates to a
slight increase of 0.3% over the previous year in original currency. In the nonlife business,
we achieved an increase in premium volume of 3% in original currency, which was driven
by the active reinsurance business.
Life business volume was down by 1.9%. However, this is in line with our strategy as we
move from less proﬁtable and capital-ineﬃcient products to capital-light and more
proﬁtable so-called modern insurance products: investment-linked solutions and
deposits. These increased by a very pleasing 36.9% overall while traditional insurance

FINAL

solutions declined. The business volume in the group life business was down compared
to the ﬁrst half of 2016 because of a positive one-oﬀ eﬀect last year.
Looking at the individual segments, business volume in Switzerland declined by 3%. I'll
return to that on the next slide. In the Europe segment, business volume increased by
4.3% in original currency. Growth was driven by the country markets Austria and Spain.
Both were able to grow the nonlife and the life business. In Germany, business volume
was slightly increased, whilst in Italy, business volume declined. Germany was able to
grow the life business due to the good performance of the modern life products. Nonlife
volume by contrast was impacted by ﬁnal acquisition-related portfolio restructurings. Italy
was confronted with a market-wide declining motor insurance in the nonlife business. In
the life business, the pleasing development of the modern products was not able to oﬀset
decline in volumes of the traditional business.
In the Specialty Markets segment, we also achieved a 13.8% increase in volume over the
ﬁrst half of 2016 (in) regional currency. Growth was driven by active reinsurance resulting
from targeted diversiﬁcation by region and business lines as well as the selected
expansion of existing business relationships. With that, I'll now come to our home market,
Switzerland, on Slide 10.

Bloomberg Transcript

Looking at the Swiss market in more details, nonlife business increased while the life
business was down mainly due to positive one-oﬀ eﬀect in the ﬁrst half of 2016. In nonlife
business, we increased premium volume by 1.5% to just over CHF 1 billion. Growth was
driven by property and accident and health. In the latter branch, we had carried out
portfolio restructurings last year.
Business volume in life business went down by 4.7%, the biggest eﬀect coming from the
group life business. Here, single premiums decreased compared to the ﬁrst half of 2016.
In 2016, growth was impacted by a positive one-oﬀ eﬀect due to a single transfer of
policyholder bonuses into retirement assets, which was booked as premium. Without this
one-oﬀ eﬀect, single premiums would have risen. Regular premiums, which are important
for assessing business performance, increased by CHF 6 million or 0.5%.
Finally, I'd like to highlight that demand for the modern, capital-eﬃcient products sold
through Swisscanto also grew very well. Already more than 40% of existing and 45% of
new customers have policies with Swisscanto. Here, Helvetia only acts as the reinsurer for
death and disability risks. In individual life business, premium volume decreased by 5.4%
to CHF 425 million. Following the successful sale of our tranche product, Helvetia Value
Trend. And good development of the Helvetia Guarantee Plan and Helvetia Payment Plan,
product sales of modern, capital-eﬃcient insurance solutions increased by 8.3%. However,
this increase in modern products could not make up for the planned decline in traditional
insurance solutions.
Now I'd like to take a look at the proﬁt by sources in the nonlife business on Slide 11.
Helvetia again showed a very strong technical performance in the nonlife business in the
ﬁrst half of 2017, which had aﬀected the net technical result being 12% above the prior
year. Looking at the proﬁt by sources, you can see that the gross technical result, meaning

Page 5 of 17



FINAL

Date: 2017-09-04

before reinsurance, increased by 15% thanks to the successful portfolio restructuring in
Switzerland, Italy, Germany and Spain. And the generally benign claims environment in
the ﬁrst six months of this year. However, because of recoveries from reinsurers, mainly of
course from our own internal group reinsurance, this year were lower than the previous
year's result. The net technical result improved by 12%. This was due to changes in our
reinsurance structures between the units and group reinsurance with a diﬀerent nature in
many of the claims, which meant that the lower claims expense could be ceded to
reinsurers than a year ago.
The investment result increased by 50% compared to the ﬁrst half of 2016 and was,
therefore, the main driver of the increase in underlying earnings. The capital market
showed a good performance in the ﬁrst six months of the year. As a consequence, we
achieved higher capital gains investments. Finally, other nontechnical expenses and
income as well as taxes were impacted by positive one-oﬀ eﬀects in the prior year.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'd now like to move to the net combined ratio on Slide 12. The net combined ratio
improved over the ﬁrst half of 2016 by 0.6percentage points to 91.3%. The improvement
was strongly supported by the European segment, which reduced net combined ratio
signiﬁcantly by 2.8percentage points.
As a result of a much better claims development following the portfolio optimizations,
gross claims ratio decreased signiﬁcantly in almost all country markets. These
developments also beneﬁted group reinsurance as the European entities ceded lower
claims expenses to group RI. The net claims ratio improved accordingly. The cost ratio, by
contrast, increased by 1.1percentage points. Realized synergies were oﬀset by higher
commissions, budgeted investments in strategic initiatives and the above-mentioned
changes in reinsurance structure. I'll give you some more details on this on the following
slide.
In Switzerland, the net combined ratio increased to 84.5%. But it's still in a very good
level. The claims ratio went up among other things due to higher large losses due to the
ﬁre in the sports center in Verbier, some NatCat at the end of June. But this is in line with
normal ﬂuctuations.
The cost ratio also rose. And I'll provide you with details on that on the following slide.
Finally, I want to mention that all marquee units achieved combined ratios below 100%.
If we look at Slide 13, the cost ratio. Compared to the half year of 2016, the cost ratio -- the
gross cost ratio went up from 28.1% to 28.9%, although this is entirely due to increases in
net acquisition cost ratio. A large part of the increase is mainly due to the positive impact
of higher volumes being oﬀset by higher commissions, mainly in Switzerland. These
resulted from growth but also from a temporary one-oﬀ eﬀect due to the improvement of
the methodology used in the calculation of the deferred acquisition costs. Synergies from
the integrations led to a 0.4% improvement in the cost ratio. However, budgeted
investments in strategic initiatives accounted for an increase of 0.4%, which oﬀset the
positive impact of the synergies.

FINAL

We go to Slide 14, which shows the life business. The operating result increased by CHF 19
million or 10% against its prior year level. The improvement came from the risk result,
which increased thanks to a normalized claims pattern compared with the prior year and a
better savings results, which beneﬁted from the decrease of the minimum interest
guarantee in the group's -- in the group life business in Switzerland.
Higher gains and losses in investments and interest-related reserve strengthening, which
remained on the same level as last year, were compensated by higher expenses for
policyholder participation and taxes.
I'll now continue with new business margin and embedded value on Slide 15. On this
slide, ﬁrst what I want to highlight, as usual, that the new business margin, which is using
the TEV methodology, not -- the more consistent embedded value methodology, as it lists
improved by 0.7% -- points to 1.2%. This very pleasing development shows the impact by
measures to improve proﬁtability in the life business.

Bloomberg Transcript

The value of the new business written increased from CHF 7 million in the ﬁrst half of the
previous year to CHF 20 million in the ﬁrst half of 2017. Alongside higher new business
volumes and more favorable interest rate assumptions, successful restructuring of our
portfolio's additional products and the focused sale of modern products had the biggest
impact.
The new business volume increased by 9% to CHF 1.6 billion. In Switzerland, the main
driver of the improvement was the Swiss group life business with Swisscanto showing the
highest growth rates in new business. In individual, life modern products also grew
pleasingly. New business volume with traditional products, by contrast, was declining in
line with our strategy.
The European entities also showed strong new-business volumes with modern products,
mainly driven by large contracts in Austria. In all country markets, traditional savings
products are now only oﬀered selectively or in a modernized form, i.e., with noticeably
reduced guarantees or guarantees upon maturity.
Helvetia group's embedded value was CHF 3.6 billion at the end of the ﬁrst half year 2017,
which means an increase of 24% compared to the same reporting period last year. The
main drivers were model changes, a positive economic and operating proﬁt. And a
positive contribution from new business.
Slide 16 deals with our direct yields and guarantees in the life business. The direct yield
and -- in Switzerland and the EU countries declined compared to the ﬁrst half of 2016 as a
result of generally lower interest rates. However, the interest margin improved in
Switzerland from 0.95% in the ﬁrst half year 2016 to 1.11%, to be accurate, in the current
reporting period.
The increase of the interest margin in Switzerland was closely linked to low average
technical interest rates on the liability side. The biggest impact resulted from the
adjustment of the guaranteed interest rate for BVG retirement assets, as of 1st of January,
Page 7 of 17



Company Name: Helvetia Holding AG
Company Ticker: HELN SW Equity
Date: 2017-09-04

2017, from 1.25% to 1% for the mandatory part and a corresponding 25 basis point
adjustment of nonmandatory rates.

FINAL

The average technical interest rate in Switzerland is also lower because we've been
successfully restructuring our portfolio of traditional products. Maturing insurance
contracts with high guaranteed rates are being replaced by lower guaranteed rates.
Additional reserve strengthening also had a positive inﬂuence on the interest margin.
In Europe, the interest margin shows a slight decline from 0.56% in the ﬁrst half of 2016 to
0.53% in the ﬁrst half of this year. As a result of decreasing interest rates and some older
large-volume investments maturing, we see a stronger drop in direct yield compared to
the average interest rate Helvetia has to generate in order to meet its obligations.
On the right-hand side of the slide, there's a graph showing the interest rate buckets on
guarantees on group level. Whereas in the ﬁrst half of 2016, only some 20% of groupwide life reserves had guarantees less or equal to 1%, this year, more than 40% reserves
had average interest rates below that level. Whilst the lowering of the BVG minimum
interest rate in Switzerland played a signiﬁcant role here, it also shows how much we've
done to restructure our portfolio to improve proﬁtability and capital eﬃciency.

Bloomberg Transcript

I would now like to move to the investment performance on Slide 17. The current income
in the ﬁrst half of this 2017 ﬁnancial year was CHF 521 million. And thus at roughly the
same level as last year. Direct yield was an annualized 2.2% and, therefore, more or less
unchanged compared to the prior year.
In addition to current income, realized as well as book gains and losses amounted to CHF
78 million. This ﬁgure was driven by the good performance of equities in the ﬁrst six
months of this year. In total, the investment result recognized in the income statement was
CHF 595 million, CHF 133 million up on the ﬁrst half year of 2016.
Investment performance decreased 1% against 3.3% in the prior year period. Unrealized
gains and losses recognized in equity only slightly decreased due to fact that interest
rates remained relatively stable. In the ﬁrst half of 2016, by contrast, unrealized gains and
losses had increased signiﬁcantly, favored by declining interest rates.
As we hold most of our bonds until maturity, such ﬂuctuations in unrealized gains and
losses can be neglected. Finally, we earned CHF 69 million more in assets backing
investment-linked insurance solutions for our customers.
On Slide 18, you can see the investment result broken down by asset class. 2/3 of the
current income of CHF 521 million came from bonds and mortgages, which contributed
CHF 280 million. And respectively, CHF 44 million in absolute terms. Dividends
accounted for CHF 55 million. And investment property for CHF 124 million. Gains and
losses on investments were CHF 78 million, mainly driven by gains in equities. The minus
CHF 162 million on bonds are resulting from FX eﬀects which are mostly compensated by
derivatives. Derivatives cover currency risks on bonds as well as price movements on
equities.

FINAL

The developments in nonrealized gains in equity was driven by lower gains and losses on
bonds due to the slight increase in interest rates as well as the recovery in share prices.
The unrealized gains in the bond portfolio, as a result, decreased by CHF 206 million.
The lower half of the slide shows the return on new and recurring investments. Around
CHF 3 billion in total were reinvested or newly invested in the ﬁrst half of the 2017 year,
78.9% of which were allocated bonds, primarily U.S. dollar bonds in the corporate sector,
long-term U.S. Treasuries and Eurobonds. We had to contend with higher hedging cost to
cover our foreign currency exposure. But on net debt basis, we earned a yield pickup,
which allowed us to mitigate the negative and very low bond yields in Swiss francs to
some extent. We also expanded the mortgage portfolio in line with our targets.
Finally, 5.3% were allocated to equities. In investment property, the main focus in the ﬁrst
half year was in renovations and maintenance. Direct yields and reinvestments totaled
1.5%.

Bloomberg Transcript

I will ﬁnish my presentation with details on the capital position on Slide 19. I would like to
remind you that we are, as usual, only in a position to report the full year 2016 SST ratio.
Based on that, Helvetia still enjoys a solid capital position. SST ratio then was within the
new target range of 140% to 180%. I understand that certainly you would like more
information regarding exact SST ﬁgures. But given the great state of ﬂux that the SST is in
at the moment, the development of standard models and other initiatives by FINMA, it
would make little sense to give you further details. Once the situation is stabilized and the
formal BÃ¼FL reporting has been introduced, you'll obviously be able to have much
more information around this topic.
Finally, the annualized return on equity based on underlying earnings improved from
9.4% to 10.2%. And on this note, I'll now hand over to Philipp GmÃ¼r again.

Philipp GmÃ¼r
Thank you, Paul, for the details of our ﬁnancial performance in the ﬁrst half of 2017. In a
nutshell, we are happy with the development of our earnings, of our business volume and
of our key ﬁgures, such as the combined ratio and the new business margin.
I would now like to come to the last part of our presentation and give you some more
insights on strategy implementation. We will start on Slide 21. Ladies and gentlemen,
when implementing the helvetia 20.20 strategy, we are putting a special emphasis on 2
aspects: The ﬁrst focus is on our core business, because here we have strong existing
customer relationships. We generate stable revenues. And we operate the business very
proﬁtably.
So one important pillar of our strategy is to strengthen our core business by optimizing
our existing business operations to make them more eﬃcient. At the same time, we aim to
expand our business into adjacent ﬁelds to broaden our revenue base for sustainable
growth. In a nutshell: by strengthening and expanding the current business model, we will
build a stable foundation for the future to meet the changing needs of the customers.

FINAL

In the programs initiated to transform the core business, we want to achieve, ﬁrst, abovemarket organic growth in the proﬁtable private and corporate customer segments;
second, easy and convenient access to all our services and products through diﬀerent
channels, chosen by our customers; third, eﬃciency improvements in operations, e.g.,
automation or faster response times for our customers; as well as, fourth, focused churn
management and cross; and upselling possibilities for Helvetia.
At our Capital Markets Day, we started -- we stated that we will spend CHF 25 million after
tax for the implementation of strategic initiatives in 2017. The majority of these investments
are allocated to these programs, which include projects such as SME eﬀort, CRM or
building up the ecosystem home where MoneyPark is already a ﬁrst strong anchor.

Bloomberg Transcript

To reinforce this, MoneyPark acquired Lausanne-based Deﬀerrard & Lanz in July 2017,
doubling its volume of brokered mortgages. The companies complement each other
perfectly. MoneyPark is primarily present in German-speaking Switzerland and Ticino,
while DL enjoys a strong position in French-speaking Switzerland. The merger will allow
MoneyPark to tap into the strategically important market in French-speaking Switzerland
in a quick and comprehensive manner. Helvetia welcomes this acquisition.
Ladies and gentlemen, strengthening the core business alone does not make a
diﬀerence. We also have a laboratory where we want to drive innovation and explore new
ideas in order to diﬀerentiate ourselves from our competitors. Our approach to innovation
is characterized by a variety of diﬀerent methods, which we are pursuing simultaneously.
These include what we call prototyping of diﬀerent ideas, investments in venture capital,
internal start-ups through a corporate incubator and acquiring speciﬁc skills through M&A
and cooperations.
As a result, we have a portfolio of so-called research and development-type projects,
which we try out through prototypes. Successful ones are rolled out quickly to the
organization. Unsuccessful ones are either modiﬁed or abandoned early. Current
examples we are working on are the Chatbot or Famii, a family assistance app developed
by smile.direct. Some of these will succeed and some will fail. I'm very proud, for
example, that Helvetia is the ﬁrst insurance company in Europe where customers can
renew their contracts via SMS. What is important is that we have the courage, the culture
within the company and the infrastructure to try out new ideas, obviously, within a clearly
controlled overall budget.
At the end of May, the newly launched Helvetia Venture fund made its ﬁrst investment in
baimos technologies GmbH, Munich. Baimos oﬀers award-winning and certiﬁed products
relating to the digital management and authorization of access and locking systems. Also,
in May, we established an innovation lab jointly with the University of St. Gallen. The lab
aims at researching new business models and ecosystems for the insurance sector. The
lab is part of the Institute of Technology Management with a special focus on innovation
management at the University of St. Gallen.
Ladies and gentlemen, as you can see, we are making good progress on the
implementation of our strategy helvetia 20.20. Our implementation approaches enable us

Page 10 of 17

to systematically and simultaneously strengthen and expand our core business while
innovating and testing new business ideas in an agile approach.

FINAL

This brings us to the end of the presentation. My colleagues and I would now be pleased
to answer your questions. Thank you for your attention.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) The ﬁrst question is from Peter Eliot, Kepler Cheuvreux.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I had 3 questions, please. The ﬁrst one was, if I look at the direct yield in Europe, it's down
sort of 27 basis points over the last six months, meaning that the investment spreads has
come in a bit. I was just wondering if you could comment on what's happening there and
whether there's anything sort of funny going on there? And the second thing was on the
runoﬀ gains, which are lower than previous years. And I was wondering if you could give
us anymore granularity there as well, in particular, if any countries had any -- or any parts
of the portfolio has had any strengthening? Then the third thing was we're seeing some
very nice claims improvements in Europe, especially Germany, I guess, where we had sort
of around 6percentage points improvement. I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit
more about that, whether there's anything other than just sort of portfolio cleansing,
whether there's anything else driving that?

A - Philipp GmÃ¼r
Okay. Thanks, Peter. I suggest that the ﬁrst question relating to direct yields will be
answered by Ralph. Question number two will be answered by Paul regarding the one-oﬀ
gains. And I will then answer the third question. Ralph, please.

A - Ralph-Thomas Honegger

{BIO 4932832 <GO>}

Okay. The direct yield in our European entities, as you know, you know the weight of
nonlife-related assets in our European entities is much higher than in Switzerland since we
have much more nonlife portfolio there. And therefore, the duration of the ﬁxed income
portfolio is much shorter. And we just had to reinvest in the ﬁrst half year maybe a little bit
larger sums at obviously lower interest rates. But there's no special eﬀect at all.

A - Philipp GmÃ¼r
Okay. Paul?

A - Paul Norton

{BIO 16145125 <GO>}

Runoﬀ gains. I guess you'd be looking at Slide 30 in the package. I don't think runoﬀ
gains are being particularly lower than previous years. What we have -- one eﬀect we do
have is that any runoﬀ gains this year -- a lot of runoﬀ gains this year were ceded to group

reinsurance, because eﬀectively what they are is recoveries from prior year losses, which
were paid by GRI and, therefore, have to -- they get recovered by GRI.

A - Philipp GmÃ¼r
Okay, with regard to the claims ratio in Germany, we are successfully underway in
speciﬁcally looking at the risks we overtook due to the transaction with Nationale Suisse.
Already the due diligence we saw. And we later on discussed that with you also that we
are probably going down with the volume in Germany, slightly in order to improve our
proﬁtability. And ﬁnally, the claims ratio shows that we are well underway in better pricing
our risks we had overtaken from Nationale Suisse especially. Okay?

The next question is from Jon Urwin from UBS.

Q - Jonathan Peter Phillip Urwin

{BIO 6126952 <GO>}

So just a couple. So ﬁrstly on specialty. There's quite a strong growth, almost 15% in that
unit. It just seems like quite a strange time to be growing so strongly given what we know
about pricing and given what we know about sort of margins contracting. So any
comments there would be great. And secondly, just a follow-up on improvement in the
European combined ratios. It's good to see that coming through. And obviously, there's
portfolio actions and pricing action working through. I mean, how much more can you do
on that portfolio? I mean, where do you see the underlying quality of that book versus
where it could get to? Then, where do you think that European combined ratio could get
to if you put a normal claims load on there? It's obviously a bit benign for this period.

A - Philipp GmÃ¼r
Okay. Let us take Paul to answer the ﬁrst question regarding the Specialty Lines. And I will
then come up with updates to the European combined ratio.

A - Paul Norton

{BIO 16145125 <GO>}

Yes. You raised a very good point. You're talking about the growth in the reinsurance
business. As you probably remember, Jonny, we had a strategy to grow the reinsurance
business, particularly to improve diversiﬁcation. And that strategy is still in place. We're
aware that we are in a soft market in certain areas. But we've been monitoring the strategy
very, very closely. We actually had, just only last week, a very detailed deep dive into that
expansion that's occurred in the last 2 to three years for those responsible. And we are
conﬁdent that where they're writing business and how they're writing business, it's
actually a good business. And they're ﬁnding -- because they're a follower, they're not a
leader, they can ﬁnd pockets of business which are well priced. And they have the
discipline to avoid the mass business which isn't.

A - Philipp GmÃ¼r
With regard to the European combined ratio. I would like you to have a look at the Slide
#29. We think that we are in good shape now with our strengthening the portfolios in the

diﬀerent country markets, especially Germany, Spain and to a certain extent also in Italy.
And it's pretty tough to make a guidance with regard to the combined ratio. If you have a
look at the diﬀerent country markets, I mean, you see that we have very pleasing
combined ratios. And as we say, we want to keep our combined ratio overall at this level.
And we think it's ambitious enough to keep the portfolio in this shape and at the same
time to realize our organic growth ambitions in the diﬀerent country markets given the
competitive environment we have.

The next question is from Guilhem Horvath from Exane.

Q - Guilhem Horvath

{BIO 18460437 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So I've got 3. The ﬁrst one is going back on the investments' realized gains. And I'd like to
understand what within these realized gains can be seen as somehow sustainable going
forward and what you really see as an exceptionally high level of realized gains for H1?
The second one is on synergies. And you reiterated the guidance of slightly more than
CHF 130 million annually. Can you give a bit of an insight in terms of are you expecting to
reach this level by year-end? And maybe -- or so is it going to be CHF 130 million, slightly
above, or is it going to be close to CHF 140 million? Can you give a bit more of detail on
where you expect to be? And third one is on expense ratio and the commission ratio. And
you said it's linked to growth and to temporary one-oﬀ eﬀect. I would like to understand
how higher should we expect the expense ratio to be on a sustainable basis because of
the growth environments going forward?

A - Philipp GmÃ¼r
Okay. Thank you, Guilhem. I ask Paul to answer questions number 2 and 3 regarding the
synergies and the question of the sustainability of our cost ratio. And ﬁnally, Paul -- Ralph
will answer question number one with respect to the realized gains. Paul?

A - Paul Norton

{BIO 16145125 <GO>}

Okay. We do still expect to reach slightly above the CHF 130 million. I don't want to give a
number at the moment. But it's not going to be massively above that. There is some
uncertainty regarding some additional synergies in the Swiss market, where some of
those may come through in 2018 as opposed to 2017. But we still believe we'll achieve the
slightly above CHF 130 million this year. The expense ratio, the tendency is actually
expense ratio in the second half of the year, the acquisition cost ratio, anyway, is slightly
higher than in the ﬁrst half of the year. The impact of the change in methodology -- or
actually an improvement in the data that went into the methodology has increased the
acquisition cost ratio by an amount this half year. And because it's allocated over the 2
half years, we should see a ﬂattening out of that a bit in the second half of the year. We're
talking about maybe half of the increase in the acquisition cost ratio was due to this
change in methodology. And how much of that will ﬂatten out over the second half year,
haven't calculated in detail. So that bid oﬀset. Then coming -- you'll have a slight increase
due to the seasonality. So the long and short of it is, I expect the sustainable acquisition
cost ratio to be slightly below where we are at the moment before we make any further
measures.

A - Ralph-Thomas Honegger

{BIO 4932832 <GO>}

Okay. Looking at realized gains, I mean, in the ﬁrst half year 2017, they were mainly driven
by equity since equity markets performed quite well in the ﬁrst half year. I mean, looking
at the performance in our book, including the derivatives for portfolio insurance, we
almost had 7%, which is a nice performance. But I mean, it's not extraordinarily high. It's
what you probably would expect on a long-term investment. Obviously, I mean this
number might be quite volatile from year-to-year. But I would say, yes, it's in line. And that
was the main driver of realized gains.

Operator
The next question is from Stefan SchÃ¼rmann from Bank Vontobel.

Q - Stefan SchÃ¼rmann
I have 2 questions. First one relating to life insurance. Can you maybe give some color
how much you added to reserves, maybe also from a point of view group and Switzerland
state? And second one, I'm still a bit confused about the whole cost of strategic initiatives.
You, I think, made a guidance of around CHF 25 million net after tax for full year. We have
now 0.4% in the nonlife, cost ratio included, which seems to be above that. Can you really
provide how much you really basically added or needed for the strategic initiative on the
cost side?

A - Philipp GmÃ¼r

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Stefan. I ask Paul to answer those 2 questions, please.

A - Paul Norton

{BIO 16145125 <GO>}

Life insurance added reserves. Have we disclosed that? We have -- we don't disclose in
the half year. You have to wait until the full year.

Q - Stefan SchÃ¼rmann
But can you say maybe more or less than last year or...?

A - Paul Norton

{BIO 16145125 <GO>}

Roughly about the same as last year. Then the cost of the strategies, there's clearly
seasonality involved. You can't just sort of double things up. At the moment, we've given
you the 0.4%. We've also mentioned there's been increase that goes to the corporate
segment. But for the half year, I don't want to disclose any more.

Q - Stefan SchÃ¼rmann
Okay. And basically going forward, it's deﬁnitely a '17 issue that's still going beyond or...

Going beyond. We said in -- we said originally when we set our strategy, we're looking
between CHF 50 million and CHF 70 million net income eﬀect per annum. But obviously,
'17 is really the ﬁrst year of the sort of the ramp-up of these strategic initiatives. And that's
why it cost us much less. But our aim for the following years is somewhere in the region of
CHF 50 million to CHF 70 million.

Operator
The next question is a follow-up from Jon Urwin from UBS.

Q - Jonathan Peter Phillip Urwin

{BIO 6126952 <GO>}

Just going back to the reserve releases quickly. So Paul, you mentioned earlier that they
weren't particularly lower than a usual sort of normal run rate. But they fell by sort of 90
basis points year-on-year. That seems like quite a high number to me. From that, can we
infer that the starting point is quite a big number?

A - Paul Norton

{BIO 16145125 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No. I think the big diﬀerence in the reserves, the runoﬀ result. I don't like the word reserve
release. It's the runoﬀ result compared with the prior years is what I mentioned earlier is
the relationship with the group reinsurance. This year, more of the claims were ceded to
group reinsurance. Eﬀectively, you're getting a payback to group reinsurance for the
claims they paid in the prior years. And therefore, on a net basis, the runoﬀ result
decreased.

Operator
The next question is a follow-up from Guilhem Horvath.

Q - Guilhem Horvath

{BIO 18460437 <GO>}

I've got 2 follow-up questions, please. The ﬁrst one is on the guarantee side. Can you
maybe give us a view on the individual Swiss life business, the same kind of split that you
give on Slide 16 for group life, just to understand how much of guarantee do you have on
this book and what's sort of the average level of guarantees? And the second is the
comments you made on capital and the standard model for group life in Switzerland. Can
you maybe update us on what's your current view on the potential for how your capital
consumption in implementing this system and model going forward? So what's your -what's the update you can give on discussion with FINMA today?

A - Paul Norton

{BIO 16145125 <GO>}

Okay. The Slide 16 is both, in Switzerland -- you've got to combine the individual life and
the group life. We don't separate them out into those 2 components. Now clearly, 2/3 of
our local business is group life. So that gives you indication. The discussions with FINMA, I
mean, how long do we want to talk about that? One of my least favorite topics. It is quite a
diﬃcult situation at the moment. I mean, everybody is -- for those just who maybe don't
know or did but have forgotten, I'll do a recap. I mean, FINMA wants to do 2 things. It
wants to standardize the models. And it started with the BVG business, which is fair
Page 15 of 17

FINAL

enough to some extent, because there were too many individual models around. And the
second thing that they want to do is they want more capital in the group life business, the
BVG business. Their hypothesis is that they'll be rapidly increasing interest rates. And
those rapidly increasing interest rates will lead to policyholders in BVG not renewing.
They'll be seeking new contracts at better returns, better results, eﬀectively, got massive
policy cancellation risk, which leads in turn to liquidating assets, which would be held for
long term at the loss. And there were -- this will eﬀectively infect the individual life
policyholders. So -- and cause a bit of a meltdown there. So what they want to do is to
introduce what they call a runoﬀ model, which eﬀectively covers this risk. So you have to
model not as if you are going concern. But as you are in runoﬀ of the group life business,
BVG business. And what they said is, you can continue to use the going concern model.
But if you want to do that, you have to send in a plan to separate out the group life
business legally. It's not told to you here exactly how that should be done. But the basic
premise was probably a separate balance sheet, separate entity, which is obviously a
huge undertaking to split it all out instead of a separate company with additional costs. So
they've been at very short notice and very high pressure. Everybody's been producing -particularly the test models, the runoﬀ model and the going concern model. And
strangely enough, in most cases, it doesn't show much of a diﬀerence in all 3 models. The
existing model is a runoﬀ model of a new standardized insurance model, which just shows
the perils of trying to model complex business. And most people in the market are sort of
saying, at the moment, it's not doing a great deal to us either way. And we could probably
live with it. But it's clearly not what FINMA are intending. Because if you're coming up with
similar results of the runoﬀ model as you are to the going concern model, obviously,
something's wrong with the basic models. So we expect a round of recalibration. But we
still don't know what FINMA wants in terms of capital. We know what their ultimate view is.
We need some kind of other capital, some kind of legal ring-fencing for the BVG business
because of this rapidly increasing interest rate scenario. But how much capital that will be
is diﬃcult to tell. Clearly, their existing quick and dirty models have backﬁred in some
respect in that -- in their aim. So we're still waiting.

A - Philipp GmÃ¼r
Okay. There will be quite a few discussions with our supervisory authorities during the
coming months. Are there more questions?
