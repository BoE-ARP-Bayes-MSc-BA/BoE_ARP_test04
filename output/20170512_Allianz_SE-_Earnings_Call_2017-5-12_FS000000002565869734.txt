MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Allianz Conference Call on the Financial Results of
First Quarter 2017. For your information, this conference is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Oliver
Schmidt, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

Thank you, Ron. Yeah, good afternoon from my side as well, and welcome to our
conference call about the results of the ﬁrst quarter 2017. I think I can give a brief. We have
released our key numbers already last week. We've seen the Analyst Presentation this
morning and all the details you will now get from Dieter.

Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

So thank you very much, Oliver. And also good afternoon or good morning to everybody
on the call. It's through these (01:02) already old numbers, a week old, but maybe I have

FINAL

still a few interesting details for you and I'm also looking forward to an engaging Q&A
session.
Headlines. Clear €2.9 billion operating proﬁt at a new record level. I think maybe at one
point we will also have a €3 billion operating proﬁt line, but not this quarter. Total
revenues up 2.5%. Shareholders' net income is down. However, we have this
extraordinary high results in last year on blocked rates, which we realized substantial
amount of gains. Our €1.8 billion for Q1 when compare it with the full year results of 2016,
it's more than a quarter, so we are well set for continuing our EPS growth even with the
same number of shares outstanding, which is not happening, as you know.
So let's go into our solvency ratio because that was not announced last week. 212% is our
regulatory reported solvency ratio for end of the quarter. The change to year-end is twofold. On one hand, we have fully deducted the full share buyback amount of €3 billion. I
think as of yesterday, we have executed some €1.2 billion and a little bit, so we are well on
track. But our regulator recommended to us when you start executing and you should not
deduct pro rata, you should take it all. So, €3 billion is 9 points impact. That means
without the share buyback, we would have ended up at 221% that would be for the ﬁrst
time 1 point out of our capital management range from 180% to 220%. So, really a very
strong solvency ratio and I come to the details a little bit later.

Bloomberg Transcript

Also, shareholders' equity 0.9% up to 67.7% and that is also I think a good start into the
year. Some movement and unrealized gains and losses, less gains on in particular the
Mediterranean government bonds and more gains on equity.
I think the sensitivities for your reading and I'm sure (04:18) part of the Q&A anyway so I
shifted now and let's look at our Solvency generation.
We had a really good operating earnings and the operating earnings are by and large
close to our IFRS earnings. For the Corporate segment and Asset Management is literally
the same. For P&C, it's almost the same; you have only this little changes from reserve
discounting in and out. The P&L eﬀects are pretty small of this discounting. And then in
Life, of course, all the DAC movements are out, but you have the new business value
generation and as new business value had a record quarter in Q1, also we have a record
quarter in operating Solvency II earnings.
Market impact is what you expect. Capital management is very much the €3 billion share
buyback program and then the accrual for the 2017 dividend because we are following
strictly the rule that we every quarter accrue pro rata our potential dividend. And that did
lead to a slight – despite the high capital deduction that leads to a slightly decreased
(06:00) own fund calculation. This capital is up to €35.8 billion, the main driver is model
changes. The model changes are – well, that is a combination of both the regulator ask us
to do and the things we wanted to reﬁne. Actually in total, you can say, when you looked
at the model changes created €2.2 billion of additional own funds and €1.1 billion of risk
capital. If you just divide the two ﬁgures, you are getting pretty much to our average
Solvency ratio. That means all the changes we do are reﬁnements and we believe better

FINAL

matching our business logic. However, the regulator is watching out that numbers are not
giving us any additional big beneﬁts.
So now moving to page 9 and diving a little bit deeper into the P&C segment. With close
to 3% revenue growth, I think we had a pretty good start into the year. We expect actually
that it should in some markets even should go up even more. We had 2% organic growth
and 1% from acquisitions from last year that is small Dutch commercial portfolio we
acquired and then the Morocco business we invested in.
So most of the organic growth is actually price. Split is more than 1%, so 1.2% is price and
0.5% is volume increase. But it's very diﬀerent by market, where Germany is really able to
push through price very well and Italy, obviously, the opposite with still a very high proﬁt
margin, we still see an average reduction of motor premiums in the market. And at AGCS,
it is a little bit weaker pricing, but mainly less rising because we really stick to our
underwriting discipline. We have a very positive market with Spain, Latin America,
Australia, and also Allianz Worldwide Partners where we get both price and also volume
running at a very good level, and also Latin America good mixture between price and
volume.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, turning to page 11, the overall proﬁtability of our P&C business. There is certainly at
ﬁrst glance less underwriting proﬁt, and I come to this in a moment, but what is positive is
actually that investment result is keeping up very nicely.
So, let's now look at our combined ratio, 2.3 percentage point worsening. It's, from my
perspective, actually hiding a 40 basis points improvement on the underlying. So how do
I look at this? Well, on one hand, yes, there was a bit more NatCat in Q1 as being
explained here in this little bubble. Then we had more large losses. Large losses is our
long-term average, it's actually 3.1% and we had 4.2% in Q1. And then there here is the
famous Ogden case, I think you have in the meantime seen this with all of our peers and
particularly UK market leaders.
In our case, Ogden cost us in the run-oﬀ ratio 0.8% that means when you take out Ogden
in Q1, our run-oﬀ results would be at 3.6% or a very average run-oﬀ results for our group.
Hence the Ogden is also expecting slightly the current accident (10:52) year, so in Q1, it
has actually cost us 20 base points in our segment number.
And it's not only our UK business, which is paying the Ogden bill, it is also our third-party
reinsurance business, which has via excess of loss contracts in the motor (11:19) line but
also in other casualty lines, there's some Ogden impact and then not to forget also
Ireland is following the Ogden, Holland has also some small impact, although that is for
our segment of course negligible.
Going to page 13, the operating proﬁt and combined ratio by country, the biggest Cat
events were on one hand, funds had a couple of these mid-sized ﬁrms and then Australia
with the strong debut, I think everybody has on his radar, is what the biggest Cat event of
the quarter, turning our Australian operating proﬁt into the negative, the same as Mr.
Ogden turned our UK proﬁt into the negative.

FINAL

What is working well is the continued turnaround in Latin America, ﬁrst positive operating
proﬁts in quite some time and showing that our work starts to show, to bring forth (12:43)
to what we were waiting for such a long time. I think else besides this weather and cap
volatility and some large loss volatility mainly AGCS, but also Germany had some more
large losses from the previous year and also funds a little bit.
Italy, very shining results with the low 80s credit insurance. So, Spain continue to show a
great story of growth and high proﬁtability, pretty much unchanged by quarter-overquarter and Allianz growth by partners at, in the international health business as well as in
the travel insurance programs, good progress on re-underwriting some of the key
relationships.

Bloomberg Transcript

So I think overall, our combined ratio and the volume development, is much on track with
the expectation and when we look on page 15. The investment income actually over
delivering in Q1, so that we have actually no concerns about making our outlook number
or even a little bit more in the P&C segment this year. Of course, the caveat is always the
large catastrophes.
So from this I would directly dive into the Life segment. New business volume nicely up.
The present value of new business premium 3% up and together with the new business
margins, the ﬁrst time above our target of 3% to 3.1% creating in total of yearly new high
for new business value for our group. And when you look at the mix of the business
clearly our capital eﬃcient product stay at a good one sort of it and we see a growing
portion of unit-linked without guarantees, protection and health slightly up. So all three
together further shrinking the traditional guaranteed savings and annuity business, so
very much all pointing to what's the right direction and with this one, I would move to
page 19 and a little bit looking at operating proﬁt.
€1.155 billion is a very high number for the operating proﬁt, which can immediately creates
a question, how sustainable is it, – is investment margin driven by additional harvesting. It
is not, we have certainly as one of the changes is a €95 million swing in the basis risk gain
in our USPA business, but the €95 million consist of a €56 million loss in previous year and
then a good €30 million plus this year, so actually when you want to neutralize, so if you
would deduct €30 million.
And I think there are – we have a one-oﬀ catch up in big adjustments also coming from
our U.S. business of around €50 million. So, if you want to be very conservative, I would
maybe subtract €100 million from the proﬁt in the Life segment, when you compare to a
year ago I think actually what I told you before was the current new business value and
where we are standing. We are on a stable 3% to 4% proﬁt growth together also with the
underlying balance sheet goals in Life, so that is very much conﬁrmed. I would say we
have roughly €50 million more sustainable proﬁt this year than we had a year ago,
ignoring Korea completely that would come as an additional base eﬀect. So, that our
numbers in Life are really going into the direction we would like to see it, and they are
really conﬁrming quarter-over-quarter.

FINAL

Well, who are the main success stories? So I think that is on one hand Germany continues
to grow new business volume, you have seen on page 19, it's a double-digit growth in
new business in Germany, new business value is nicely up. Italy shows a growing new
business value and that is all driven by unit-linked, and clearly our Asia-Paciﬁc region is
really doing very well, and we are producing a very good growth, but also our smaller
countries are doing very nicely in this area.
Volume-wise, the U.S. had a weak start into the year. New business volume was clearly
down, but we have corrected the new business margin and with 3.9% we have achieved
really excellent new business margin. In the ﬁrst quarter, in April and May, sales start to
pick-up and we are pretty sure that we can, over the whole 12 months, just continue the
success story of previous years.

Bloomberg Transcript

Operating proﬁt in the U.S. is it's shining, that it's a ubiquitous (19:26) swing plus the €50
million in debt collection and also – and that is not a positive one-oﬀ, but a year ago, we
had in the U.S. an additional reserving in the long-term care business, which we did not
repeat. So therefore the operating proﬁts in the U.S. was €325 million, that's a very good
start into the year which allows me actually to go to our investment margin. We have
delivered 25 basis points for the ﬁrst quarter. Our guidance for the whole year is 95 basis
points, that means we have 70 basis points to go for the rest of the year. So actually the 25
basis points, maybe 2, 2.5 basis points above what you would expect any way to achieve
95 basis points for the full year, and as the base risk eﬀect from the U.S. and so that is
pretty normal.
I think our net harvesting has a little bit less realized gains than last year, but it has also
substantially less impairments than last year, which explains more the net improvement.
So it is very much – I think a very stable situation. And our unrealized gains in particular in
our equity portfolio and also real estate portfolio have grown in this year and also in the
last three months substantially further. So we are far away from harvesting the pro-rata
share of the growth in unrealized gains.
Asset Management, so I think we have, during this time, the right order of our segment,
that we have clearly kept the best for last. Asset Management segment is beneﬁting from
on one hand a good ﬁnancial market, so we have in total more than €40 billion more
assets under management of which half comes from markets and the other half inﬂows at
PIMCO close to €21 billion of net inﬂows at PIMCO has really a very strong continuation of
what was already looking pretty good in Q4 and Q3 last year. So the trend just continues
and I'm also optimistic for the next quarter to go.
And on page 27, you can actually see that PIMCO keeps its proﬁt margin pretty
unchanged, and hence the whole results (22:53) in a good increase of revenues of 12%
and Allianz Global Investors also beneﬁting from equity market development. Of course,
it's showing a double-digit increase in revenues which gives us for the whole segment an
increase in revenues of 12%, and that allows us then on page 29 to turn this into more
proﬁt and our operating proﬁt in Asset Management has a 24% jump in Q1 2017, which is, I
think, a great recovery of our Asset Management sector and shows that in some areas,
active Asset Management can still compete very well into our today's world.

FINAL

I think I will then just go to the summary. Corporate segment, nothing exciting, a little bit
more proﬁts in the banking segment we have less provisioning for – less loan provisioning
than a year ago and in holding and treasury we show a little bit lower handful expenses,
and also some better hedging results in F/X, since a year ago we had some more losses
there, so that is in the end small movement in the overall scheme, which then is bringing
me to the last page, page 33 of the numbers.
Nice close in operating proﬁt by €250 million, but the realized gains of €400 million down
and hence we have actually a lower income before tax and as the realized gains from last
year were completely tax exempt, you have actually also (25:10) eﬀect on the tax rate and
this 29% we still show a very low tax rates below our 30% target level, because we had
still some tax exempt income and resulting then in a €1.8 billion shareholders net income,
which is a very good start into the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

And let me then summarize, where we stand with respect to our 2018 target on page 35.
Okay. EPS growth is the holding (25:50) for quarter, 4.8%, plus it is continued eﬀect you
will get out of the share buyback. So I think we are very much on track for this year to
repeat, a good EPS growth. Return on equity of the group is at the moment standing at
12.5%. Certainly still a bit limited by our very strong capital base, but as you all know that
it's more of a luxury problem than anything else.
P&C combined ratio, (26:23) 95.6%, clearly above our target, but I think the underlying
improvement shows in the right direction. So I think, we are still on track to make our 94%
by 2018. 10% ROE for our Life businesses, we show in Q1 61%, but Italy and France are
both close to the 10%, when I just add the two countries we are at 85% plus already of the
whole segment. And both have actually too much capital in their balance sheet, so also
easy to correct by just upstreaming the money via dividends.
New business margin at target level and also on the qualitative targets, we are moving
forward. Also, the qualitative targets are not all we measured on a quarterly basis, so
some of them are older information.
So the Net Promoter Score, we have not updated in Q1. So therefore, that is not new
news. But interest rate sensitivity is a little bit higher than at year end. That is a
consequence of the model changes, and I'm waiting for the question to dive there into
the details.
PIMCO's cost income ratio, very much at the target, internal employee satisfaction and
Work Well index close to where we want to be, and I think, we made a good jump in
digitizing our new products and also one got launched this year, half of them are already
satisfying our full digital product deﬁnition.
And with this one, I give actually speaking back to Oliver to manage for the Q&A now.

FINAL

Thank you. We will now take our ﬁrst question from Peter Eliot of Kepler Cheuvreux.
Please, go ahead.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Hi, thanks very much. Dieter, I doesn't want to disappoint you. So, I will start oﬀ with the
question you were expecting. I was just going to ask anyway actually, but, yeah, no, I was
intrigued by the Solvency sensitivity and how the upside, the symmetry has been restored
by modeling changes. And especially, I guess given that you've actually closed the
duration gap in the Life business this quarter as well. So, yeah, I mean, if you could explain
now what's happened then that would be great.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second question on the Asset Management. I mean, great news on both earnings and
ﬂows. In the same way that you very kindly gave us guidance in the Life division, I was
wondering if you could sort of give us the guidance on whether – to what extent do you
think there are any one-oﬀs in that result. I mean, I guess, in particular, the footnotes on
slide 27 regarding the €46 million of other revenues and looking at the ﬁnancial statement
supplements and it looks like those have sort of ﬂowed through largely towards the
bottom line.
And if I can slip in one third one perhaps? You mentioned the business evolution
weighing ever less on the SCR development and obviously zero this quarter. Just
wondering if you think – is that sustainable going forward. And if so, I'm just wondering
whether the guidance you've given for the run rate of underlying capital generation is
even a little bit light, especially the beneﬁt you're getting on the numerator from new
business? And, I guess, a fair amount of that, as you said, is coming from Germany where
you must now have about 40% of the market (31:20). I'm just wondering how sustainable
is that numerator and denominator. Thanks a lot.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Okay. So then let me try to explain the change in interest rate sensitivity. Actually when
one of you could give me a whiteboard and some pens I could easily explain it, but let's
try to put it in words.
Yes, we are – in duration, which is actually more on the own fund side, we are neutral and
we have closed at ﬁrst glance the gap there. So, the increased sensitivity is all coming
from the SCR, so actually the next derivative. And how should I quote it, we have changed
the whole modeling of our German exposure (32:27) that we did already use for the new
business margin and value calculation in Q3 last year, but we couldn't use it yet for the
Solvency II calculation because the approval by the regulator had the stamp January 1. So,
therefore, it is a beginning of the year change and not the year-end change that has to be
included.

Page 7 of 25

So this change is modeling all the cash ﬂows and also from all the new products much
better. And overall, the sensitivity of the interest rate increased on both, on the up as well
as on the down. However, the downside is more protected by the additional funds, our
Allianz Leben subsidiary has, which are under transferability restrictions. That means when
you transfer the Solvency ratio and also the sensitivity from the Life subsidiary in Germany
to the group, the upside goes fully through, the downside is being dampened by the
amounts which got haircut by transferability restriction. So it is a very complex – probably
now you know why I would have preferred to present it on a board in a room and not over
the phone. It's really diﬃcult. But I...

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

(34:03) thank you.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

But I think we do much better and actually also personally my gut feeling of this was that
our upside was understated. So I like the new sensitivity numbers more because I cannot
sleep better.
In Asset Management, yes, we're showing in the footnote a one-oﬀ that was a catch-up
booking on foreign currency exchange translation mainly U.S. dollar to British pound. It is
actually also going through the proﬁt sharing at PIMCO so, therefore, the operating proﬁt
impact is 70% of the number. And, in Q2, we will not have the cost for the incentive
scheme anymore because Q1 2017 is the last booking. So you can also see that this
expense was in Q1, the last one-oﬀ of this number. So I think we are on good track in
Asset Management.
Guidance on Solvency II and quarterly production, I think with our operating earnings
guidance unchanged and strong new business values produced in the quarter, so we
should see a similar positive development there. Of course, there are always some
secondary eﬀects, which are hard to anticipate. Will we also not consume more capital? I
think that is much more diﬃcult because the diversiﬁcation shifts every quarter a little bit
on market parameters and the market parameters we all look at, like interest rates, equity
markets were obviously positive. But you should also not forget that I think mid of April,
also end of March WICCs (36:19) was at a record low, interest rates volatility came in lower.
So, there is also a number of secondary parameters, which supported our development in
Q1 and that number still will go around.
Certainly what I would expect on Solvency II is that with the ﬁnancial market as of today,
Solvency ratio would be looking better. Credit spreads after the French election on French
government bonds came in, I think actually that French government bonds show at the
moment zero spread compared to swap. So that it's certainly pretty positive for our
numbers. Interest rates are slightly higher. Equity markets are further up in the second
quarter and volatility still very low. So anybody who was betting on that WICCs (37:28)
would come back quickly. I think that people are not earning a lot of money or have lost
eﬀorts already.

We will now take our next question from Nick Holmes of Société Générale. Please go
ahead.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

. Hi, there. Thanks very much. Couple of questions. First one is, Dieter, what do you think
we ought to do with the Solvency and Financial Condition Reports? I mean, what do
recommend we focus on if you could give us any guidance there, that will be great.
And the second question is looking at Italian motor, there is lots of mixed views about
what's going on in the market. Wondered if you could tell us your experience. I think you
said pricing is still on the pressure, but you're seeing some signs of stabilization. Thank
you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Nick, for the two questions. Well, with this – because there are two
recommendations. When you print it, you can burn it. When it's digital, you can delete it.
So I must say, yes, there is probably a lot of additional detailed information in it for – if you
want to ﬁnd certain points and I'm sure that you and your colleagues will put a lot of focus
on conditionals and none of the Allianz entities you will ﬁnd any balance sheet
conditionals.
But I think and what I hope is actually that it gives a more comparison across the whole
industry. And what I think is probably another focus area where are the disclosed
Solvency ratios are actually fully aligned with the regulatory ﬁled numbers. I think we are
really trying to be very precise and really only put in our analyst presentation what is also
being ﬁled with the regulator and so far we have not found any deviations. We have done
the following.
We have in total produced 61 reports, 60 legal entities in the EU and one group report.
Out of the 60, of course, there is a lot of very small entities; therefore, we have put on our
website here in the IR section 10 or 12 of the individual legal entity reports. And when
there is any missing company you want to know, Bulgaria or whatever, we will certainly
also be able to provide the link, but then you have to call the Investor Relations
department to get this.
We will in our Inside Allianz Series do a special section and also I think Tom Wilson got
the job to hand you more details through these reports and how to read the various
sections, what is in it and whatnot. And I think our Chief Actuary, Oskar Buchauer, is also

Page 9 of 25

there. So you have all our technical expertise who then after you have some time to read
the reports and if there is a special area of interest then we are very happy to explain it.
So to (41:13)

FINAL

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Dieter, could I just quickly follow up. Am I correct in thinking that you won't give us the
group ratio until the Investor Day in June? And I just wondered if that is correct, why
would you want to do it that way? Because, I mean, we'll all be sort of involved in a
guessing game for the group ratio. I just wondered what your thinking is.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

I don't understand what you mean with group ratio.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

The group Solvency II ratio, the volatility adjuster and items like that. Is it correct that that
was the...

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

What you mean is the impact of the various components.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Yes, exactly.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

I think that is ready. On May 24, we have also to go through our various internal setting
and approval process. Therefore, I don't have it yet fully at hand. But – therefore, I said,
there is no balance sheet conditional.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

The only what we use is the VA and that has some impact on our Life businesses. For the
rest, it is really not important, and for the group, the impact is also minor. But I don't have
the number now at hand. And I think also from a sign-oﬀ procedure you have to
understand that I'm not disclosing it before I went through all formalities here, that would
clearly be not correct.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Okay. That's very clear. Thanks.

FINAL

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, the total number is the 212% we just gave you. And also please keep in mind,
this Financial Condition Report are based on year-end. This is an annual report part, so it
doesn't link back to the Q1 number. Then you have to wait another year. So that is – I am
more in favor of support of the numbers and – yes, the year-end, therefore, I am not so
excited. But maybe if there is some practice in the industry on a peer average, which
could be improved by the whole industry then I am sure you and your colleagues will spot
it and the industry will do better after that.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

We will try. Thank you.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yes. Italian motor, yeah, actually our accident year loss ratio is slightly better than a year
ago. That tells you that all of the rates decreases we were suﬀering and complaining
about during last year did not reduce proﬁtability. So that is a good news. The
consequence of this is that the market might slow down a little bit in rate decrease, but it
will not stop it.

Our next question comes from Thomas Seidl of Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks. Good afternoon. Three questions. First on the regular investment income in
P&C. You normally show like a model like behavior in drop in RI, but not this quarter, it's
pretty stable. You closed dividends as I wonder if this is just a one quarter respite or is this
also what you expect for the year pretty ﬂattish regular RI in P&C. First question.

FINAL

Second, on Life realized gains, I heard your comment obviously, Dieter, but I still think that
a 30-bp quarterly run rate on harvesting, which beneﬁted obviously from lower
impairment, is pretty high, also compared to history. Again, I wonder if this is what you
expect for the full year and was it like last year mainly driven by disposals on bonds, which
was the main thing last year.
Third and last question on Asset Management, another drop in the revenue margin 0.8
basis points mainly driven by Allianz Global Investors where PIMCO is now stable. My
question here is, how high is your conviction that this is now the bottom and how does it
show any development here? Will it stay at the current revenue margin level or is there
some or even strong optimism that it will recover again.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Okay. Thomas, thank you. Let me start with the P&C investment income. We have guided
beginning of the year to a reduction of the annual investment income of some €200
million. And I think with where we stand today, I would say that this number was too
conservative.

Bloomberg Transcript

What I'd say that we are sticking at absolutely is the same level every quarter. Now that is
at the moment a little bit diﬃcult to say there were one small positive one-oﬀ in Q1, and
then Q1, Q2 are always a bit in total distorted because also the dividend income from
equity investment is included there, which is of course in Q3 and Q4 nothing. But I would
say somewhere that we probably end up in the middle between ﬂat and the $200 million
reduction. That means $100 million less than last year is probably the reasonable
assumption.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

And why is this slowing down? Looking at your economic reinvestment year, nothing has
really changed here.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

It is a bit currency mix.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

And now coming to your Life question. Actually when I look at the net harvesting and
correct for the swing in U.S.-based risk, the swing is $95, last year it was a minus, this year
it is a small plus and actually it's net actually down and not up. So, that means our
ongoing realization activity is pretty much unchanged and it is true there is harvesting also
coming from the bonds as we are always using the bond portfolio also to lengthen and
create fresh duration and we are not rating obviously until maturity. We harvest earlier
because the last two years, from a market point of view, these bonds are heavily in the
negative yield. So why would you hold to a bond which only produces on mark-to-market
Page 12 of 25



Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2017-05-12

negative yield for the last two years? Then you start to turn it around and we have really a
better systematic approach also to use this constantly to create new duration.

FINAL

What you could see on the Life side is actually that our reinvestment yield is slightly down
quarter-over-quarter, which is coming from the fact that we took a little bit less credit risk
in ﬁrst quarter 2017 that means we became a bit more conservative on running credit risk.
So your last question was on Asset Management and the drop in margin. So the yearover-year comparison, the big drop came in Q2 from the Rogge acquisition. That is an
averaging eﬀect. The Rogge is institutional bond mandates that means there's a very
small fee margin. So that has created for our total segment has – the Rogge acquisition
has cost us 60 basis points on average in the fee margin. And that is I think explaining
most of the drop. But certainly there is also – well, then I should not forget a very
interesting observation.
Our Korean asset manager, which we tried to sell together with our Life company, the
transaction has not yet closed. It is still with us where the Life company is sold. That means
that actually our former in-house business turns now into third-party business and that
actually reduces, for the third-party business, the average fee by another 20 basis points.
So that is actually already explaining most of it. And so that is ups and down, but also I
don't want to hide that at Allianz Global Investors also the ongoing business see some fee
margin pressure.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

case, do you stay at this level?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Small movements still ahead, but not this big jump Q1 over Q – yeah, well, now you have

Hi there. Thanks. Couple of questions, please. Firstly on the Life business. Obviously, very
strong result in terms of new business value. And you very helpfully made a number of
comments on the full year around what level of future earnings you expect from the new
business value that came in, in (52:39) the full year. And, I mean, if we use the same sort of
multiples on that, would that be reasonable (52:47) over €1.5 billion of future earnings has

been added on in Q1. And, I guess, as an add-on to that, are you making any progress on
your potential enhanced disclosures around the new business. That is question one.

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

And then the second point is just on the P&C business in the UK. Can you just remind me
of your strategy and of your exit direct and kind of going forward, what's the strategy
there (53:24) currently reporting that you might be in discussions with LV, would you see
the UK as a more or less attractive proposition post Ogden? Thanks.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Paul, thank you very much. I think the new business value what we showed last year was
that we are producing out of last year's operating proﬁt of around €5 billion. But I think it
is – if you just want to be not this precise just to use round numbers. If you multiply the
value of new business with three or maybe it's a little bit more than three, you have a
good graph on what operating proﬁt is being added quarter-by-quarter. So we are fully
sticking to this calculation. Sure, you would need to the ﬁnance at the quarter also what
asset mix are we doing with the selective money and how the credit spreads are moving,
but then you get into a full modeling. Therefore, I think the factor three is probably a
pretty good and easy formula.
UK P&C, we have exited the Life business, it's still a (54:52) the motor business. The Life
business, we never entered (54:54) actually that was one of the best strategic decisions. I
think we have a reasonable business in homeowners, we have a reasonable business also
in Motor Fleet, as well as the broker (55:16), and we have this fantastic pet business in
Retail plus a very strong commercial position. We are working on our expense base in UK,
and I think, we are on very good track to get back, at the moment of course, after the
Ogden decision and challenges, are you getting enough rates to make up for the Ogden
impact.
And as a reminder, there is yet – it's mainly Motor, but every other line of business, which
includes bodily injuries, whether it's employer's liability or also third-party liability cases or
whatever, they are all impacted by Ogden, that means, you have now really to go through
every product and say Ogden impact, yes, no, how much is it, how much rate do I need to
make up for it. And then we have to see in which line of business, is the market positively
reacting to it and where is ﬁerce competition actually stopping ahead.
So, that is besides simplifying our internal organization policy, our main eﬀort at the
moment what we do in the UK.

FINAL

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, thanks very much. A quick question on Life, and then on Asset Management. In the
Life business you're changed to fair value accounting for the VA business. I wanted to
understand what impact that had, when you talk about the swing in base risk in Q1, you
mentioned roughly €150 million. Have you gone from negative basis to neutral or from
neutral to positive? And going forward, would we be expecting in the current quarter the
environment from future basis proﬁts? It'd be nice just to understand the volatility of that
line going forward.
Second question on Asset Management, what do you think is going to happen to the cost
income ratio now at PIMCO? Now that's reached the target, and in fact the plans are
coming to an end, what do you think we should take into account? Thank you.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So, thanks so much. I think I'm looking forward that we can see small improvement in the
cost income ratio, but also we will not stick only to the current business, we're also going
to expand into new strategic areas, therefore we are not planning, that the cost income
ratio is now the big driver of higher proﬁt margin. It's more important that we continue to
grow revenues and enjoy the current proﬁt level.
I should have mentioned maybe in the beginning of the presentation, the accounting
change we did. We have only changed a very small part, so the valuable annuity business
and the hedging of the equity guarantees you have implicitly in the product, that part has
not changed at all, so we still have the same base risk as before, because there also
accounting never helps you, because the base risk is just the diﬀerence that you allow
your customers to invest in actively managed funds and your equity hedges are naturally
linked to an index. And the base risk is the diﬀerence between active managed and the
passive index fund, sometimes positive, sometimes negative.
What we have hedged is actually for the minimum retirement beneﬁts, we had the interest
rate risk open and not hedged. The local statutory accounting in the U.S., as well as the
capital formulas under local stats have changed already in end of 2015 or something, so
already more than a year ago. So that means the two changes in the U.S. allowed us
under local stat to do already the interest rate hedging without creating a volatility in the
accounting number, only we did not do the hedging because the IFRS numbers where
would have then just shown the movement of the interest rate hedges.
So now with the change to fair value, we have implemented a hedging on Gen 1, that
means now we have closed this risk position. Is this creating additional operating proﬁt?
Yes, in the long run maybe some small positive because you don't have the losses from
the interest rate exposure. Of course, you could argue when, now the Fed is raising rates
every three months. We have missed an opportunity to gain something which we have
now locked out with, with locking in the current position. So, I see it's from an operating
proﬁt, if you want to be conservative, it is very small positive. I see it as a really de minimis
change.

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

Thank you. Dieter, I may ask you a question on the improvement in the attritional loss
ratio. Could you call out if there's any particular countries where that the contributions'
coming from and could you also maybe make any commentary around where potentially
you're seeing some price – some kind of pricing coming in that you haven't seen last year.
The second question I have is around PIMCO, I saw a headline today that you said that the
trends have continued positively into second quarter 2017, so if you can conﬁrm that and
then ﬁnally, your very strong growth in new business value in Asia Paciﬁc, could you also
highlight speciﬁcally if this is coming from certain countries rather than others? Thank you.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Okay, a very interesting question. Attritional loss ratio that is a very mixed picture.
I think the largest positive contributor, it starts actually with Italy, what I have mentioned
before, then even (01:03:11) France is a small positive. Our Allianz Worldwide Partners is a
small positive; Latin America is a small positive. And I think a little bit negative is or more
neutral is Germany. So overall, I think, this is a very broad base. Worsening we have seen

FINAL

Fantastic. Thank you so much and thanks for such a lovely presentation and great
numbers. And on the buyback, so €1.2 billion in, I guess, just around three months. So,
we've got – my question is, could you actually do another – a second buyback on top of
the €3 billion this year, is there any reason which would stop you doing so, whether
(01:06:23) or I don't know.
And the other one in terms of the proﬁt target of €10.8 billion and I was listening, maybe
half listening, you conﬁrmed the €5.3 billion in non-Life, which seems to becoming a bit
more of an investment income, you kind of indicated, that's why I understood that Life
would be better than your target, because your run rate is incredible and you're not going
to lose the money which you gained some money, which you made in Q2 – Q1?
Asset Management, it sounds like you're on track to beat by €200 million, there's still a lot
of performance fees to come. So it will end up to €11 billion and a bit. And I just wondered
at which – at what stage would you feel conﬁdent enough to kind of review your proﬁt
target? (01:07:09)? And then on the corporate bonds, I must just say, you had some
positive sensitivity to corporate bonds, I just wondered, but if it's – maybe too many
questions? Thank you.

And thank you for dialing in. The share buyback, I think we are executing to really at
maximum speed. We had only before our Shareholder Meeting, that is a legal break
period, which we had to comply with, therefore we only restarted after the Shareholder
Meeting.
Look, the decision to do another share buyback need – share buyback is an overall
strategic consideration. Therefore, you have to understand that I cannot not answer this
question, but certainly I can conﬁrm that the Solvency position and the liquidity would not
stand in the way. So, therefore, we have really a lot of ﬂexibility, whatever we do
strategically.

Whatever happens to the number, whether it's a weak start into the year or a strong start

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yeah, well, certainly on the government bonds, I think our largest investment are French
govies, of course, when you want to look which asset has the best performance in Q2,
then it is deﬁnitely the French government bonds. We have some €40 billion market value
of it. And if I'm not mistaken, the average maturity of it is above 12 years. So that is a high
level achievement. I think in Q2, French govies, that came in 23 or 24 basis point,
multiplies it with 12 years, it will be probably made on this investment, only 2.5% plus in
market value. So that is a pretty decent number, but of course attributed mainly for
hedging in our Life books, the higher market value is not creating now the tremendous
additional shareholder fund, but it is clearly reducing credit spread risk as such.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hello. Thank you very much. Slightly following-up on then Michael's question, Dieter, you
just gave a very clear answer on the operating earnings. Thank you. But I understand
trade (01:11:09) on the Life side, because you are making it quite clear that there is not
much we should strip out to normalize that results. And also, this is my math, suggesting
to what you said, it's – points to you being above the top end of the target range that you
mentioned just a couple of months ago. So, I just want to be clear. Has something
changed that you weren't expecting three months ago, that makes this result so high and
so sustainable. Or should we maybe be tempering our enthusiasm, that whilst there is
Page 19 of 25



Company Name: Allianz SE

Date: 2017-05-12

nothing speciﬁc you can point to, this maybe has been a surprisingly high a quarter? I'm
just a bit confused on it. Thank you.

FINAL

And then second is, really quick. Slide 7, my normal question about the Life operating
capital generation. Are there any variances that you could mention to us, or if we just take
the total minus new business value the enforced run-oﬀ is sustainable.
And then lastly, I hope this is quick, restructuring charges. They were very high this
quarter, because of AGCS. I think in the past you've been doing about €200 million a
year. Are we still happy with that level coming below the line or is the ﬁrst quarter
restructuring charges could be structurally high? Thank you.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No, I think good questions. No, I cannot add anything to the Life operating proﬁt story. I
think the €100 million to get down to sustainable number that is still correct, but also the
volatilities we have they are not as we quote positives. Therefore, you know that we are
tremendously careful people before we hype our result. Yes, we all believe at the moment
that ﬁnancial markets are in a green position, as the asset class is peaking, and that
cannot, of course, change, and then I have to do a lot of explanation why the variance
growth in the asset direction. So I think we are pretty happy to keep the overall outlook
number at the moment to where it is. And you can make your process where you see at
the moment, the pluses and some minuses, probably you will ﬁnd more pluses than
minuses, and I would not reject your conclusion.
The formula, how to see the Solvency II operating earnings development, I think what you
have said, I can only conﬁrm that's absolutely ﬁne.
On the restructuring charges, the reason why we moved it from operating to nonoperating proﬁt, that was not to spoil your strategies, that was really to create more
ﬂexibility and faster reaction (01:14:04). As a lot of our managers are being incentivized on
operating proﬁt before they use, the excuse that they have to wait until next year with the
restructuring because it has to be put into the plans. We have really opened up this line,
and say, if you see an opportunity where you can restructure the business to create
economic value, start Monday and don't wait until next year. That is simple, the internal
message to restructuring. It's a big project that was Allianz Global Investors last year
(01:14:51) has had already a big restructuring. AGCS did a lot of announcements year-end
and are now in full execution of entry book the agreed things than, well, selling of the real
(01:15:08) is of course the ultimate restructuring you can do. And we will also see some as
cases where we need to drive the organization. And that we will certainly do this year. And
I think we have the ﬁnancial resources as well as energy to drive more change through the
organization and we will see many local projects doing so.

FINAL

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I have three questions. First question on thirdparty Asset Management and obviously, PIMCO performs very well. On the other hand
Allianz Global Investors has net outﬂows in the ﬁrst quarter, and I wonder how you see
that especially after we have seen already net outﬂows. In last year, in total of €2.8 billion
at Allianz Global Investors, what are the drivers of this?
Second question, the new business margin in Life and Health, 3.1%. This spends against
your target of – from the renewal agenda to achieve 3.0% by 2018 and should we expect
an increase of this target or do you think the 3.1% is somewhat exceptional at this stage?
And last question on the value of new business. As you said, you provide the, an
interesting insight into the value of new business? How it translates into operating proﬁt?
Obviously, I also do not expect you to give an update every quarter, but just for my
understanding, the more you move from traditional Life products to capital Life products,
the lower this is – this multiplier, which you just mentioned, should be three times. The
lower it should become because the cost of capital are included in the value of new
business, but it's not – it's excluded in the operating proﬁt. Is this eﬀect material, say from
one year to the other, say from 2017 versus 2016?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

All questions are very good and excuse us, the last question, I have not thought about,
but I – when you give me 10 seconds, I hope to ﬁnd an answer for you.
So, let's start with Allianz Global Investors. That net outﬂows are mainly in pure expected
equity and the inﬂows is in our multi asset product. I think we're doing a very strong job in
selling our capabilities in multi asset. It's a very successful product. The active equity, I
think Q1 was exceptionally high quarter, and I think we are looking for a more balanced
result in the next quarter. It's also more U.S. driven than Europe and U.S., we are actually –
we have not such a huge portfolio.
The new business margin, no, we are sticking to the 3% and we clearly want to grow the
business, and prefer volume growth over dividing additional – the new business margin,
of course, there can be obviously quarters where they are a little bit below or even a bit
higher up. When we are able to increase our biometric risk business and our heath
business, certainly it's still going to be there for – even for better new business margin, but
a strategy target will stick at 3%.
The new business development and how it translates into operating proﬁt. Yes, you are
right, unit links doesn't have the risk margin or cost of capital charges. However, you have
in traditional business also the cost of option and guarantees which are not translating
into operating proﬁt at all.

Page 21 of 25

So I still – I have not done the calculation whether the factor of 3% to 3.5% is for unitlinked higher than for the rest, but maybe, actually, unit-linked is probably a bit lower.
However, our capital Life products are still in the general account, and that is our main
growth line.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi there. First question, AGCS, I would see you've applied the (1:20:49) restructuring. I am
more interested in, there was quite a big shrinkage in premium, I think it was down 7% on
an internal basis. Is there a sort of more signiﬁcant repositioning taking place in AGCS,
has there been a further assessment of the tough pricing conditions in commercial lines. It
looks like you just may have been ﬂat or even growing slightly there, and then suddenly
you are shrinking. So, what were you shrinking, what part of the business is U.S. or outside
the U.S.?
Second question on PIMCO. A lot of the ﬂows have been concentrated in one fund, the
very successful Income Fund, and that appears to be the case looking at data into April as
well. That fund has been rated highly, because it's been nimble in the past, and it's been
quite concentrated in illiquid securities, non-agency mortgages, commercial MBS. How
scalable is it? Can it really continue to grow and see the level of inﬂows that you've been
seeing and maintain performance or you can actually start (1:21:52) more relatively
diversifying or hoping to launch a new range of products? Thanks.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you so much. I think actually in the premium income AGCS, there is the
shrunky volatility from our ARC product. Our alternative risk transfer is always doing large
premium deals and that is the main driver for the big move in premium. Otherwise, it
would be closer to zero or slightly down. But we do also substantially analyzing program
in Marine and also in our U.S. MidCorp business, so there we would see a small decline in
volume. I think all what we're doing there is clearly helping to restore the attritional loss
ratio proﬁtability.

FINAL

Yes, PIMCO, you can – it's nice that you still call the Income Fund as a very nimble and
eternal fund (1:23:03). It gains a title of the world's largest actively managed bond fund.
So it's not small anymore. So AUM are at $80 billion. The performance, I think we are also
indicating it in our explanation of all PIMCO products is still high at 92% and also the
Income Fund is a part of outperformance, which of course is attracting more money and
we are doing very nicely there and as I said before April and May are not showing any
changes.

Are you concern (1:23:57) about the concentration of ﬂows into that one strategy?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

No.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Because that's what the data still shows, the Morningstar data for example.

Yeah, that is on one hand too, and the other hand, when you look over the last 24 months,
the inﬂow and outﬂows at PIMCO, the increase in inﬂows is actually not so big, the bigger
shift is in the reduced outﬂows.
So the inﬂow levels were actually always very stable, and that was also the reason why I
am very early about saying I am very conﬁdent that we will see a turnaround at PIMCO's
net ﬂow numbers from the negative to stable, and then to positive that we would go so
quickly to Q1 levels that is of course a part of our expectation. But I think that explains
mainly why we are seeing here, and we have quite a number of also other fund strategies
which have a positive ﬂows, yes the lion's share is the Income Fund.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. Great.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

But we are working to broaden it, and I think we will continue to see it, in particular the
Income Fund has shown very stable ﬂows also in December-January, when the (1:25:37) in
the U.S. about fast growing (1:25:41) space, in the meantime we are lower than we were
actually end of November. So, I think that fund product oﬀers also a stable situation in a
more volatile interest rate market.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Great. Thank you.

Okay. Before we continue, the time is over that we have allocated to this call. So we have
time to take one last question please.

FINAL

Our last question comes from Vinit Malhotra of Mediobanca. Please go ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Hi, there. Good afternoon. Just managed to sneak in. Thank you. Just two very quick ones
hopefully. In the capital eﬃcient products, the operating proﬁt was I noticed aﬀected by
some lower realized gains and less favorable hedging results as on slide 20, I mean this
number was below the recent run rate as well. Given the emphasis in the group on capital
eﬃcient products, does it not concern you that realized gains have caused sort of a lower
proﬁt, any comment would be useful?
And second one is a quick follow-up, just to clarify my understanding, this GMIB
restatement, was it – just to understand, this was negligible in 1Q and also is not material
from your guidance perspective, just want to conﬁrm what I seem to understand but
wasn't sure? Thank you.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Thank you, Vinit. So, I must say, I have obviously done a very bad job to explain the GMIB
product, because we started the wall (1:27:33) hedging in (1:27:34), the proﬁt impact of
this product – of the changed accounting is in indeed de minimis. (1:27:44) by enlarge two
products that is our ﬁxed index annuity business in the U.S. and then German variation of
ﬁxed index annuity, which we sell under this brand name in Germany that's (1:28:05) and
so on.
The operating proﬁt also of – the ﬁxed index annuity business had some realized gains last
year which did not repeat this year, but more important is as we are building the portfolio
in Germany so fast, there are the acquisition losses on day-one are still overshadowing the
proﬁtability of the business. When you look that the new business margin in Germany and
actually of this product is at a very healthy level, you can be reassured that the proﬁtability
of this line has not reduced, it is only diﬀered.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay. All right, thank you, Dieter. Thank you.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Actually, I should add that their product in Germany reached zero operating proﬁt level
for the ﬁrst time. If I remember correctly, in fourth quarter 2016, it was still minus €22
million operating proﬁt.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes, yeah.
