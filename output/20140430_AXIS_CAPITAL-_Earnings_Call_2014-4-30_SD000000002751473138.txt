{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thanks, Rick. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today. Last
night, AXIS reported its First Quarter operating income of $137 million, or $1.24 per diluted
share, an annualized ROE of 10.6%.
We enter the quarter with diluted book value per share of $47.13, an increase of 3% from
year end 2013. And we returned over $200 million in capital to our shareholders through
share repurchases in common share dividend, repurchasing over 3% of our shares
outstanding at the end of last year.
Results are down from last year's exceptional performance. While both quarters had very
low cat activity, this year's quarter was impacted by higher property losses in the

Page 2 of 27

insurance segment, including attritional and mid-size losses in our US property book. In
comparison, last year's First Quarter had very low property loss experience.

FINAL

In addition, as we indicated last quarter, we've maintained appropriately prudent loss
picks for our US D&O insurance business as we restructure that portfolio. We're pleased
to report that we are making good progress on this front, and we expect to see the
benefits of our actions gradually reflected in our future results
Overall, we reported a solid combined ratio of 91.9%. We also continue to make significant
progress in optimizing our risk-adjusted returns through portfolio balance and
diversification, and building new sources of profitable growth. Our accidents and health
unit is continuing to report improved profitability, getting closer to its goal of breakeven,
bringing on significant new business and achieving a better portfolio balance between
insurance and reinsurance.
And while it's still early days, other recent initiatives, such as our third-party capital
management units and weather in commodities market unit, are showing positive
contributions to our profitable growth trajectory. As we've mentioned before, we also
recently reentered the US primary casualty market and are achieving good momentum in
this area.

Bloomberg Transcript

This was our First Quarter of underwriting for our new syndicate at Lloyds. This initiatives
will significantly expand our access to international specialty lines, and we are now seeing
business we had not seen previously. We're also recently brought on a new healthcare
professional liability team.
While the market is generally getting more competitive, there still remain opportunities to
write attractive business in our established lines of business. I will discuss market
conditions in more detail after Joe covers our quarterly results. Joe?

Joseph Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Thank you, Albert. Good morning, everyone. During the First Quarter, we generated solid
results with an annualized operating ROE of 10.6%. In addition, quarterly diluted book
value per common share, a key metric in measuring the value we generate for our
shareholders, increased by $1.33 per share, or almost 3%, in the quarter to a record high
of $47.13.
Our quarterly results benefited from a quiet quarter with respect to natural catastrophe
and weather-related losses, as was the case in the comparative quarter of last year. In
addition, the continued growth in our book of business and net favorable prior-year
reserve development contributed positively to our results.
These positive factors were partially offset by higher insurance property loss ratios
reflecting among other things, an increase in mid-sized and attritional loss activity. In
addition, our results continue to be impacted by higher underlying loss ratios for the

FINAL

professional US insurance D&O business, which we discussed on last quarter's call, and
which continues to earn in 2014.
Moving into the details of the income statement, our First Quarter gross written premiums
were up 4% to $1.8 billion, with growth emanating primarily from our reinsurance segment.
In the reinsurance segment, our top line was up $70 million, or 6%. Our quarter one 2014
gross premiums written were significantly impacted by the level of contracts written on a
multi-year basis, specifically in the property, catastrophe, and motor lines.
After adjusting for the portions of the written premium that relate to future underwriting
years, gross written premiums were comparable to the premiums written in the same
period in 2013. After excluding future-year premiums, increases were noted in motor,
reflecting growth in our European business written on a proportional basis, and agricultural
lines, which reflected timing differences of certain renewals in our continuing initiatives to
grow this line of business.

Bloomberg Transcript

These increases were offset by decreases in our professional, property, and catastrophe
lines, primarily due to higher cedent retentions, treaty restructurings, and non-renewals
due to pricing. In our insurance segment, our top line was up $5 million, or 1%, compared
to the same quarter in 2013, and primarily reflects growth in the liability and credit and
political risk lines.
Our liability lines continue to contribute positively to our top-line growth, primarily due to
new business opportunities in the US wholesale excess casualty markets, which also
benefited from increasing rates, and the continued growth of the US primary casualty
market, which the Company reentered during 2013.
Credit and political risk growth reflects new business written during the quarter. These
were partially offset by decreases in property lines, which were impacted by timing
differences for renewals of certain contracts, and increasingly competitive marketing
conditions and modest decreases in accident and health, driven by the loss of a large
cedent, which was largely offset by new business and increased shares of existing
programs.
Our First Quarter consolidated net premiums written were up 6%, exceeding the growth
rate per gross premiums written. This is similar to what we reported over the previous
three quarters and reflects the changes we made in the reinsurance purchasing program
in our insurance segment.
These changes in our reinsurance buying program included reductions in the quarter
share cession rates for significant parts of our professional lines and liability books, a
reduction in the cost of our property per risk and cat protections, and higher retentions
for both property and marine. Our net premiums earned were up 8% to $946 million for
the quarter with growth in both the insurance and reinsurance segments.
Insurance increased by 12%, primarily driven by professional, accident and health, and
liability business written in recent periods, as well as the positive impact of the reductions

FINAL

in the seated reinsurance programs discussed earlier. Reinsurance growth of 5% primarily
reflects business written in prior periods in the professional lines, growth in the motor
proportional book, and the continued expansion of the agricultural business. This growth
was partially offset by decreases in catastrophe and credit insurity lines.
Our First Quarter 2014 consolidated current accident year loss ratio increased by 5.7
points from 56.4% to 62.1%, compared to the same period of last year, and was driven by
increases in both the insurance and reinsurance segments. Our insurance segment
current accident year loss ratio increased by 9.3 points to 64.8%.
This increase was driven by the following three key drivers. First, an increase in the current
accident year loss ratio in the property lines, which were impacted, among other factors,
by a higher level of mid-sized and attritional losses during the quarter ended March 31,
2014.

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, higher loss ratios in our professional lines relating to certain parts of our D&O
business written in the United States established during the Fourth Quarter of 2013
following recent loss experience. This increase primarily relates to business written during
2013 which continues to be earned during 2014. And thirdly, a change in the mix of
business written by the segment.
Our reinsurance segment current accident year loss ratio increased by 2.5 points to 59.7%
during the First Quarter of 2014, primarily due to a change in the mix of business written
by the segment relative to the comparative quarter of last year. This was partially offset
by a decrease in the level of attritional losses incurred across most lines of business in this
segment.
Turning to loss reserves established in prior years, we continue to benefit from net
favorable loss development which aggregated to a net $43 million this quarter. Short-tail
classes in both segments contributed $29 million of this balance, primarily reflecting
better than expected loss emergence.
During 2013, we began to give way to actuarial methods that reflect our actual experience
for liability reinsurance business, and this resulted in a release of a further $6 million of
favorable development in the First Quarter of the current year. Other notable movements
include net favorable development in the reinsurance professional lines of $6 million, and
in the insurance credit and political risk lines of $4 million.
During the First Quarter of 2014, our acquisition cost ratio increased by 1.6 points quarter
over quarter from 16.6% to 18.2%. And the increase was primarily driven by our
reinsurance segment. The increase in the acquisition cost ratio for the reinsurance
segment was primarily due to variances in accrual or loss sensitive features in underlying
contracts and higher acquisition costs paid on certain lines of business.
Accruals related to loss sensitive features reduced the segment's acquisition cost ratio in
the First Quarter of 2013, however, these features had a lesser impact on the First
Quarter of 2014. The insurance segment noted a modest increase in the acquisition cost
Page 5 of 27

FINAL

ratio, driven by a change in the mix of business and the reduction in commissions earned
due to lower seeded commissions -- excuse me, premiums, lower seeded premiums.
The increase in the general and administrative expenses were primarily due to personnel
related expenses driven by a higher headcount, as well as professional and business
costs related to various growth initiatives across the Company. The increase in the
general and administrative expenses was offset by the growth in net premiums earned,
resulting in a comparable G&A expense ratio relative to the prior-year quarter. Taken
together, these items produced underwriting income of $109 million and a combined ratio
of 91.9% for the quarter.
Net investment income was $83 million for the quarter, down from $114 million in the
Fourth Quarter of 2013, and down from $109 million in the First Quarter of last year. The
most significant driver of the decrease was the contribution to net investment income by
our other investments portfolio.

Bloomberg Transcript

Other investments contributed $17 million during the quarter versus $41 million in the
Fourth Quarter of 2013, and $43 million in the First Quarter of the prior year. The decrease
in net investment income from other investments was primarily due to a decrease in the
income from hedge funds, which benefited from the strong performance of the equity
markets during the Fourth Quarter and the First Quarter of last year.
Income from our fixed maturity portfolios, including cash and short-term investments, was
$74 million for the quarter, compared to last quarter's $78 million and $71 million in the
prior-year quarter. In aggregate, the total return of our cash and investments portfolio for
the quarter was 1.1%.
The positive total returns for the current quarter were due mainly to price improvements
on our fixed maturities portfolio, as a result of falling US and Euro interest rates and
continued spread tightening. We continue to hold a high quality, well diversified portfolio
with cash and investment assets totaling $15.4 billion at March 31, up approximately $0.6
billion from December 31 and $0.9 billion from a year ago. The increase is primarily due to
proceeds from our new senior note issuance, which I will discuss later.
The duration of our fixed maturity portfolio was 3.0 years at March 31, down slightly from
3.2 years at December 31 and 3.1 years at the end of March 2013. Our fixed maturities
weighted average credit rating remains unchanged at AA minus.
Our total capital at March 31, 2014 was $7.3 billion, including $1.5 billion of senior notes and
$600 million of preferred equity, an increase of $500 million from $6.8 billion at
December 31, 2013. The increase is primarily driven by our First Quarter issuance of $250
million of 2.65% senior unsecured notes which are due for repayment in 2019, and the
issuance of $250 million of 5.15% senior unsecured notes which are due in 2045.
The net proceeds from these offerings are expected to be used towards the repayment
of $500 million of our 5.75% senior unsecured notes, which mature on December 1, 2014.
As such, the increase in our debt-to-capital ratios is expected to be temporary.

FINAL

The change in our capital position also reflects the net income generated during the
quarter and the increase in unrealized gains on investments, due to the downward shift in
sovereign yield curves and the tightening of credit spreads during the quarter. These
were almost totally offset by the continuation of the share repurchases under our Board
authorized share repurchase program, as well as the payment of common dividends.
During the quarter, we repurchased 4 million of our common shares for a total cost of
$179 million. As of last night, we had purchased an additional 0.8 million of our common
shares for the month of April for a total year-to-date cost of $260 million. We currently
have $550 million still available under the repurchase authorization limits set by our Board,
and expect to continue to be active in this area throughout the Second Quarter.
Our strategic expansion opportunities continue to progress and we remain optimistic
about our prospects. During the quarter, we commenced the operations of our new
syndicate at Lloyds, AXIS Syndicate 1686, which we believe will provide us with exciting
new opportunities through the access to Lloyds' worldwide licenses and extensive
distribution network.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our new third-party capital initiative, AXIS Ventures, commenced business on January 1,
2014 with the writing of a fully collateralized catastrophe cover. The First Quarter results of
their operations have been included in our consolidated statement of operations. We
expect this vehicle to enter into additional reinsurance transactions throughout the rest of
this year.
We believe that our diversified global franchise and strong balance sheet will continue to
allow us to take advantage of market opportunities as they emerge. With that, I will turn
the call back over to Albert.

Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you, Joe. With respect to market conditions, after three years of attractive pricing
improvements in the industry, we've seen a leveling off of pricing overall. With modest
decreases across some of the property and specialty lines.
However, despite a slowdown in pricing, there remain good fundamentals and
opportunities for profitable growth in many insurance lines of business. Within our
insurance segment, for the overall AXIS insurance rates change for the First Quarter of
2014 was plus 1%, flat with last quarter's plus 1% level but down from the 5% achieved in
the First Quarter of last year.
Rate changes across US lines were generally stronger than changes in international lines,
and rates overall are still at or ahead of loss trends for US business. In our US division,
overall rates continued in a positive direction for the 12th consecutive quarter, and we also
maintained strong renewal retentions across all lines. The overall rate change was plus
4%, down slightly from plus 5% last quarter.

Page 7 of 27

In property, E&S and the middle markets were essentially flat, while the large accounts in
risk managed property experienced modest declines in the low single-digit range. The
weakening of property pricing reflects abundant capacity and a lack of recent cat events.

FINAL

Other US business experienced positive rate change. Casualty continued strong with US
excess casualty up in the range of plus10%. This was one of our stronger growth
businesses in the First Quarter.
In our international division, the overall rate change was down 3% for the quarter, which is
consistent with the rate decline achieved last quarter. But this represents only the Second
Quarter of rate declines after three years of sustained the rate increases.
As usual, there were wide variations in rates depending on the line of business or
geography. Of the 14 separate lines we monitor, 8 were down, 1 was flat, and 5 were up.

Bloomberg Transcript

Lines with rate reductions included global property, with an average 10% rate decline, and
energy with close to 5% decline. These conditions are consistent with the general pricing
cycle, as these lines have experienced strong pricing activity in the last few years and few
major market losses, in addition to new incremental capacity.
Aviation and terrorism are continuing their long decline in the face of low loss activity.
While we've seen a couple of large aviation losses in the last few months, including the
Asiana incident in San Francisco and the recent disappearance of Malaysian flight 370,
there remains substantial overcapacity. And absent further significant loss activity, we do
not expect any noticeable reversal in these trends.
Area strong positive rate movements include marine liability in the Canadian property. In
our professional lines division, the overall rate change was plus 1% for the quarter, equal
to last quarter's rate activity. US and Bermuda business achieved a plus 2% rate change,
while international professional lines rates were flattish in the quarter.
Across almost all products, rate increases on primary layers continue to be meaningful
higher than rates on excess layers. For example, in US financial institution products,
primary D&O achieved double-digit increases while overall primary business averaged
plus 3%, but excess business was down 1%.
Within commercial D&O, we achieved rate increases in excess of 10% on the US primary
book. Excess layers were relatively flat and sight A coverages remain soft, such that the
overall US D&O book averaged rate increases of about 4%. Our E&O lines produced
about a 2% positive rate change on aggregate, the larger commercial E&O accounts are
seeing increases in the low single-digits, but are relatively flat on excess layers.
To conclude, the insurance business still has plenty of opportunities to write attractive
business. But access to the business and risk selection are increasingly an important
differentiator. And AXIS is very well positioned in that regard.

FINAL

Moving onto reinsurance. As you know, our First Quarter is dominated by the significant
January 1 renewal date. Excluding agriculture, approximately 56% of our expiring 2013
reinsurance premium renewed during the quarter.
As we discussed in our February conference call, our January 1 renewal delivered
approximately a 6% increase in premiums on the expiring portfolio. Overall, abundant
capacity, strong balance sheets, and consolidation of programs led to lower reinsurance
pricing across most regions and lines of business. This started on January 1 and continued
through the quarter into the April 1 renewals.
The three key themes so far this year are greater retentions from our stronger cedents,
consolidation and restructuring of programs, and substantial increase in supply coming
from both established players and alternative capital. While I am optimistic that over time
the industry will both develop new products and markets as well as right size its capital, it
appears that in the near term at least there is pressure, as many reinsurers try to protect
their top line and providers of alternative capital attempt to fully deploy their new capacity.

Bloomberg Transcript

We continue to maintain discipline in our underwriting and have pulled back from certain
opportunities when they no longer meet our return requirements. That said, we are
starting from a strong base of profitability and we continue to write and renew business
with acceptable levels of profitability.
Agriculture renewals occur across both the first and Second Quarter. During the First
Quarter, approximately $80 million of crop premiums expired and were up for renewal.
And we wrote about $100 million on renewals in new business. More is being written in
the Second Quarter and we will report final numbers on our next conference call.
Meanwhile, this businesses is proceeding in line with expectations. Primary premiums for
the industry are down year over year, as lower commodity prices are reducing values at
risk. On excess of loss programs, we're seeing reductions of up to 10% on loss-free
accounts.
Most premiums for us in the First Quarter were US MPCI business, and we plan and
expect to balance that with more non-US business over the rest of the year. The US
reinsurance markets experienced rate reductions and increased ceding commissions in
response to significant competition and abundant market capacity.
Clients are consolidating programs and changing structures in order to lower reinsurance
costs. Nevertheless, as I noted, US reinsurance businesses generally been reasonably
attractive, and while margins are compressing, many lines and programs are still
generating adequate margins and meeting hurdle rates.
For US property reinsurance, commercial insurance rates began leveling off at January 1
with increasing downward momentum through April 1. Capacity for prorisk reinsurance is
abundant, but some discipline remains for Gulf Coast and Southeast to win in flood
exposures.

Page 9 of 27

FINAL

For US professional lines, clients are generally retaining more business on their balance
sheets. We're seeing increased competition from new entrants offering smaller lines as
following market. Our position as an established lead market in many of these areas has
helped with many of our longer-term client relationships.
Reinsured are sometimes paying more ceding commissions on professional lines and
liability business. However, this is generally offset by primary rate improvements in the low
to mid-single-digits, in several of these lines. Such that technical profitability is staying
reasonably stable.
Our April 1 Asian renewals were mostly dominated by Japanese property reinsurance
business. Market conditions and rates generally deteriorated faster than expected. Many
clients consolidated their programs and combined previously separate wind and
earthquake XoL covers.
We also observed significant new capacity from both existing and new competition. As a
result, ceding commissions on pro-rata programs increased, wind and flood excess of
loss rates decline 10% to 15%, and earthquake excess of loss rates declined in the midteens. You will recall, of course, that pricing in these lines were much stronger post that
tsunami and earthquake.

Bloomberg Transcript

Despite these difficult market conditions, we believe rates in Asia are generally still
adequate and meet our requirements. AXIS Re Asia-Pacific continues to make strides in
boosting our strategic profile in the Asian market.
Looking forward to the upcoming June 1 and July 1 renewals, which are dominated by US
catastrophe excess of loss renewals, we expect continued softening of rates. We expect
to see reductions in the range of 10% or greater and continued strong showing by
alternative capital providers. Florida is not a large part of our book and we have excellent
relationships, so I expect we will fare better than most.
AXIS is very well positioned to outperform in a transitioning market. As a hybrid insurer
and reinsurer with a wide range of products, strong relationships, superior ratings, and a
global platform, we see a wide variety of opportunities. We are not dependent on any
one line or market and can afford to remain disciplined, and pursue only that business
which we consider to be bought profitable and additive to our portfolio.
While we are seeing some pressure on reinsurance margins, we also get the benefit of
better terms on the reinsurance that we purchase. So we have excellent balance.
Before I close my prepared remarks, I would like to update you on recent management
changes at AXIS. We continue to attract high-quality talent. David Phillips recently joined us
as our new Chief Investment Officer. I have worked with David in the past and am
confident that given his proven track record, he will contribute significantly to the success
of AXIS going forward.

FINAL

In addition, as most of you are aware, we recently announced that retirement of Dennis
Reding as Chief Operating Officer. Jack Gressier has assumed this position, while Peter
Wilson, who was formerly President of US Insurance and has extensive management
experience operating global insurance platforms, will succeed Jack as CEO of AXIS
Insurance.
These management transitions highlight the deep bench of talent at AXIS, and I have
great confidence in the abilities of both Jack and Peter to succeed in their new roles. Of
course, I have to mention that Dennis Reding's contribution to AXIS have been invaluable.
Since Dennis joined us in 2002, he has established our US operations has been an integral
part of our growth. We are fortunate that he will continue to maintain an important
presence at AXIS as a senior adviser and member of our executive committee.
With that, let's open a call for questions. Operator?

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first questions they will come from Amit Kumar, Macquarie.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks and good morning. Did this issue clarifications on the US D&O book. Would it be
possible to quantify that number, what you mentioned in the three key drivers?
And what I was trying to do was also looking at your global triangles and trying to figure
out what the reserve base for the US D&O separately, and what might be the initial loss
pick for that piece? Could you maybe let's help us put this issue to bed and give some,
come with those numbers? Thanks.

A - Joseph Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Let me jump in first, Amit, on the loss ratios for the CMS business. As you recall, in the
Fourth Quarter last year we strengthened our loss reserves for the 2012 and 2013
accident years. We bumped the loss ratios for 2012 to 93%, and we bumped the loss ratio
for 2013 to 90%.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it.

A - Joseph Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Despite the fact we have had excellent experience in the First Quarter of the year, we've
kept the loss ratio for the 2014 year at 89%. So what you have is you have the unearned
premiums from 2013 earning through at those higher loss ratios, and the new business
Page 11 of 27



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2014-04-30

we kept at a higher loss ratio despite the fact that the underlying business was behaved
very, very well in the First Quarter.

FINAL

As a matter of fact, I can jump into just a couple of metrics along those lines. Our
attachment, and this is related to the restructuring of the business, our attachment point
on the business that we discussed on CMS is actually increased about 11% to $20 million.
Average limits have decreased about 7% to $7 million, specifically on the public D&O
business. Our average attachment point has increased 80% to $45 million, the average
limit has actually stayed flat.
Public D&O represents about 34% of our portfolio today versus 51% of the portfolio at the
First Quarter of 2013. And as far as rate changes are concerned, Albert mentioned this,
but I will just say in terms of primary public D&O and primary ancillary lines, our average
increase was 13.4% in Q1.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Okay, got it. And on the last call, when looking at the transcript, you mentioned that the
US D&O premiums at that time were $50 million. Was that for 2013 or what was that $50
million number that was given on the last call?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Joseph Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Yes. That was basically the CMS book of business. The US primary public D&O business
within that.

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Amit, within the US professional lines book, the CMS book is actually a much broader
book. We write both excess policies, fiduciary policies, ancillary lines, a number of
businesses. But the book that really caused us the biggest problem was really the primary
portion of that book, which we said at was approximately $50 million annually, and that
clearly is the book that's given us the most trouble, which we have been working through.
And as you can hear from Joe's statistics, our people have worked hard to make
immediate changes in that portfolio, and I think also interesting is the fact that the
reported losses in the quarter versus expectations were also quite good. But the reality is
we're not going to react very quickly to that from a reserving perspective.
I think we believe the prudent thing to do is to continue to book that business at the
higher loss ratios, make sure that we've got it right, make sure that we've got it
contained. And notwithstanding some early indications, make sure that the trends are
sufficiently powerful that we can then comfortably reduce the ratios. So that's a policy
decision we've made to be prudent in booking this business as were going through this
restructuring of the portfolio.

Got it and that makes perfect sense. The only other question and I will re-queue, were
there any additional uptick in the claims activity? I know we talked about that in the last call.

FINAL

I think what you're saying is that you had been conservative and that's why you see this,
but beyond that, has that book been silent in Q1? Or has there been any other changes in
terms of loss cost trends?

A - Joseph Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

No, Amit, it was very silent in Q1. As a matter fact, we only had one claim over $5 million
and that actually related to prior years. So the straight answer to it is, no, we've had very
little loss activity in the First Quarter.

So what I'm going to do in answering the question, Mike, is just lead you from last year's
accident year loss ratio to this year's accident loss ratio, we talked about it in a script, it
was 9.3 points. Remember again, that we had a very good quarter in the First Quarter of
2013.
But at 55.5, the major changes were two factors. First, as we just covered, the
professional initial expected loss ratio increase was about 3 points of that change.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Joseph Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The property was about 6 points in total, and that's a combination of experience, the
losses that we actually incurred, as well as trying to be a little bit more conservative on the
reserving side for those losses. So that 6 points plus 3 in professional.
There were a couple of other factors, mix impacted it a little bit, with liability and A&H
having a larger portion of earned premium, that ticked it up a little bit. Then we also had
the Malaysian air loss in her aviation book of business, which ticked it up about another
half a point. So that's the components of the increase from Q1 2013 to Q1 2014.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. Thanks, that's really helpful. I'm trying to figure out, I kind of went back and looked
at the last few quarters, and very often mix a been a factor in talking about the change in
the underlying on a year-over-year basis.
And it's been, it's definitely been volatile and I know when more pronounced initiative on
the crops side, with the expense and loss ratio composition different than a lot of the
other business created some noise as well. But I'm just trying to figure out is this a good
snapshot, maybe adjusting partially for some of those items, maybe to get the
normalized large loss load in insurance?
Then in reinsurance, I didn't really see anything specifically cited. Are these close to where
you expect to be running these businesses at least in 2014 until some of the professional
liability catch-up wears off ?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Let me address that. I think that there is going to be just normal volatility, and let's talk
about property. I think on the professional lines, I think as you've got it Michael, we're

Page 14 of 27

FINAL

going to book it high for a while, and as the UPR runs off over the rest of the year, that will
have a smaller impact, but I think you got that piece.
I think on the property, we actually will break it up into four different areas. We've got
smaller attritional, mid-sized attritional, weather related cat, so we really look at in terms
of different versions. And to be fair, in both last year's First Quarter and this year's First
Quarter, there really wasn't any true weather loss or cat loss. So it really relates to the
small attritional and the mid-size attritional.
If you look at the last three years say, the average of small and mid-size attritional is
approximately 45, mid-40s, and the range quarter over quarter has been anywhere from
the low 30s to the mid-50s. And in fact, the highest quarter was 56, it was the First
Quarter 2012, the second highest quarter was this quarter with 54.
In comparison, the First Quarter of last year was a 37, so it really reflects the volatility that
you're going to have with these events. So plus or minus 10% from the average of 45 on
attritional, small attritional and mid-sized, these were really unrelated fire events.
We look very hard for trends and so it's very difficult to find them. So in this case I think
that is just the normal volatility that you would expect to see within these small attritional
losses.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay.

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

This quarter was an unusual quarter in terms of frequency, and the First Quarter of last
year was unusual in terms of favorable. So there's clearly some, I would say probably 3
points plus of just volatility year over year just on those events.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. I know when you set out to make some changes and improve the business, you
talked about reducing volatility, looking for areas of profitable growth. I'm just trying to
looking now backwards, I look at the -- if I compare AXIS to other companies I cover, the
volatility in the underlying from quarter to quarter is probably been more here than almost
anywhere other than maybe the pure reinsurers.
And I'm just trying to understand, where are we in a progression? And is this volatility in
underlying, has it been somewhat surprising to you? Or is it just there's noise every
quarter and when you look at the numbers, you feel comfortable that you are moving
towards the past that you've outlined a couple years back? Thanks.

FINAL

Michael, that's an excellent question and let's take it from the broader perspective that
you're putting in place. There's no question that we wanted to move our book to a less
volatile book and we have made a number of changes to move in that direction, including
bringing on some less volatile business. Admittedly, some of that less volatile business
does have higher combined ratios, but let's put this on the table right now.
From an ROE perspective, these higher combined ratio businesses are highly accretive to
the book of business. Because they require much less capital and provide a more steady
stream of underwriting profitability going forward. And so, we think that is absolutely a
right move.
When I look at volatility, Michael, I look less at the quarterly volatility than I do with the
annual volatility. And every year you go through, especially on the property and the
specialty lines that can be affected by individual risk losses, you can have a situation where
you have all of your losses in one quarter. And yet, end up with the same kind of average
on an annual basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

I can tell you from the analyses of the books that we have built over the last three years,
in all cases, our risk management analyses' distributions and curves all show that the
curves are actually getting less dispersed, therefore, reducing the volatility around each of
those portfolios.
And so, it's that confidence in a more steady profit stream, lower volatility, and lower cat
exposure, that have really allowed us to embark upon an aggressive stock repurchase
program, because we can actually afford to be much more efficient in the use of our
capital, higher premium to surplus leverage, all of which are resulting in a better ROE
longer term.
But in our business, I think we have to accept the various going to quarterly volatility.
Everything that I'm seeing here is generally consistent. The one thing that we have not yet
seen to prove out our strategy is demonstrating to you and the rest of our investors that
over a period of two or three, four cats in the industry, will our percentage of book value
lost to those cats be as high as it was in the past? I'm confident that it will not be.
And so what we’re seeing is the higher attritional loss ratios that you would expect from
the more stable business, but you don't see the expected improvements that we
expected to see. When, in the large cats, we should lose less of our book value than we
have in the past. I hope that's helpful in making you understand where we're going.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

No. That's great, thank you. Just one, on the cat side, that is one area that is also an area
where you have grown the last couple years. And with pricing declines, I would imagine
that exposure is potentially higher now as well than a couple years ago, or is that not
right?

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay.

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

One thing that you might be looking at is the fact that we've grown in the Southeast. And
the reason we've grown in the Southeast is because we were underrepresented in
Florida in particular.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

I see.

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

But if you look at almost all of our exposures, there's always going to be some random
volatility on a quarter-to-quarter basis because you take a look at the portfolio you have
and you move that up or down. And I know that in a couple of lines we showed some
increases in this quarter versus last quarter.
But again, if you go back on an annual basis comparing the end of the First Quarter to the
end of the First Quarter of last year to the end of the First Quarter of the year before,
you'll find that consistency overall as a percentage of our shareholders equity, the
exposures are coming down. The Southeast went up a little bit, again, because we felt
that we were underweight in what is recognized as one of the most attractive markets.
But let me give you another piece of data here. We look at not only our individual PMLs by
loss events, but we model things like what's our aggregate annual cat result over 100 -over a 1 in 250 period? So you take all of the cat events, you model what they would do to
the you as a Company for that year, and you say how much would we lose of our book
value in that model?
In the last three years alone, we have reduced that exposure by over 30%. The modeled
1 in 250 aggregate cat loss has been, and this is aggregate, not just individual PMLs, so
there's actually more balance in the portfolio, and again, we're doing all of this to
generate a more consistently profitable book of business over time.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Thank you. Albert, if you could talk about the third-party capital management business?
What is the plan there, and is that showing up in your numbers at all this quarter? And if
so, where is it?

FINAL

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yes. The plan is, as you know, we've said this, we've just started this last year. We are
starting slow, we want to make sure that we don't create capacity that we can't use. And
so I think what we’re doing is very, very targeted.
We have, you can see in the minority interests of our book that there is both a $50 million
slug of minority equity. And you can also see in our net income that there is a minority
interest, which is basically that share of the underwriting profits that are being ceded to
our partners on the third-party capital side.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are looking at two or three different ways of utilizing third-party capital. One is through
individual transactions, B is through quarter shares of portions of our business, both on
the cat side as well as on AG side. And Jay and Ben and the team are also speaking to a
number of parties about potentially other lines of business that could be of interest to
third-party capital.
So you should expect that over as the year continues, that there will be greater capacity
provided by third parties, and we will be ceding to them various portions of different
books of business in ways that makes sense to them and makes sense to us. Joe, you
wanted to add something?

And next we have a question from Vinay Misquith of Evercore.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Hello. Good morning. The first question I just wanted to get some clarifications on the
mid-sized property loss. So I believe the net impact was 6 points higher this quarter
versus the year-ago quarter.
Page 18 of 27



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2014-04-30

But you said that a year-ago quarter was an abnormally low quarter. How much would you
say this quarter was higher than normal? So would that be about 3 points higher than
normal?

A - Joseph Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. Vinay, I'd say 3 points is good.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. Great. So if I just want to normalize the numbers, it's 3 points, great. The second
point is on the professional liability. You mentioned that the difference was 3 points this
year will versus last year.
Looking at 3 points on the earned premiums in the primary insurance operation, that's
about $12 million. And I believe that the premiums earned, I mean since you said that the
professional lines premiums was about $50 million per year, so that's about $12 million per
quarter.
So seems awfully high, so that's 100% loss ratio? I'm trying to the square these numbers?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We write, actually what we talked about was $50 million was the primary book. We write
about $200 million in the US and we probably write $800 million, $900 million all in on a
gross basis.
And so what we spoke to was the problematic book, but we have been increasing just
given the fact that the loss trends are moving in a direction and pricing and professional
liability is generally been flat for the last couple of years. You have both a normal trend of
pricing increases -- sorry, of loss ratio increases, as well as the corrective action that we're
doing in primary D&O book in the US.
But we are clearly booking the primary D&O book in the US at very, very conservative loss
ratios right now.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure, so the subject premium is not $50 million?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

No. It's not.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

It's more like $200 million?

A - Albert Benchimol

Page 19 of 27



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2014-04-30

That's correct.

FINAL

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. And so just looking forward in the future, I understand that you said this year is
going to be a higher loss ratio for the business. And so you'll probably see the 3 points
higher maybe for the next couple of quarters, but should we expect the full 3 points lower
next year once you've repriced the business, or is that too optimistic?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think we should look at two things. As I am thinking about this right now, obviously, the
comparison is to the two quarters that had the very best ratios last year, so the toughest
comparison is going to be in the first and Second Quarter.
Because we started to raise the ratios in the Third Quarter and, of course, we had to
corrective action in the Fourth Quarter, so you wouldn't see that bump up in the Fourth
Quarter because it's already been taken. So just to give you a sense of the geography of
the comparisons.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second issue is that as we work through the UPR from last year, that's going to be
affecting our results this year. I think we have to be realistic and expect that we are not
going to take the book exactly to where we want it in a single renewal. My guess is that as
we work through this, it will take us probably two renewals to get the book ideally to
where we want it.
So I think that you're going to see progression through 2014 and through 2015 and kind of
the ideal numbers if you would be in 2016, but that you should see progression in terms
of the ratios starting on a comparative business from the Second Quarter of this year.
Because we already booked them higher in the Second Quarter -- I'm sorry, the Third
Quarter of last year, Fourth Quarter of last year.
We're running through the heavier numbers in 2014, and then in 2015, you'll start to see
the improvement through the better quality book that were writing in 2014 into 2015, and
then through a second layer of renewals to really get the book to where we want it,
providing more progress in 2016 from the book that we write a 2015.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure, that's helpful. Then just one last question. You talked a lot about remixing the
portfolio into low volatile business, and I think I'm trying to look at my model and saying,
well, I have the same level of cats in there.
So when you look in terms of budgeting for your cats, what's the normalized cat number
you have for the Company as a whole, or if you want to give it by segment, that's helpful?
Thanks.

I'm sure it would be very helpful but we've never disclosed it before. So obviously, I always
have a hard time disclosing cat loads in this because of the differences in the book of
business. I would say that we are expecting that, as a percentage of premiums, cat losses
would be lower going forward than they have in the past, but we're not prepared at this
point in time to disclose cat losses for each of our books.

And next we have a question from Brian Meredith of UBS.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Hello, Albert, a couple of quick questions here for you. The first one, just with respect to
the comments on your Southeast wind and increasing exposure there. Should we expect
you to continue to balance that portfolio maybe even increase it mid-year renewals?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well there are two things here. One is it really will depend on the conditions and the
opportunities available to us in the mid-year renewals. So I think it's very much a reaction
to will the business available to us optimize our portfolio, or actually you know make it
worse and more peaky?
I don't think that we have any appetite for any significant growth in any of our PMLs, but
would there be a few million dollars up or down based on opportunities? That kind of
volatility would be normal volatility in terms of optimizing each renewal. But we do not
have a strong appetite for any kind of significant increase in any of our PMLs.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. Then my second question on the A&H business, with the near-term outlook for that
given the 5% reduction in gross written in the First Quarter?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Don't make too much of this decrease because as Joe pointed out, there was a
significant quarter share that was non-renewed in the First Quarter. And to their credits,
our A&H team was able to replace a substantial amount of that non-renewal. And I have
no doubt that the very, very successful new business generation that our Company has
had in the past and into the First Quarter will continue through the rest of the year.
So we're still projecting meaningful premium growth through the rest of the year.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay. So there was an unearned premium that went out in the First Quarter that hurt it?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. As you know, when you start the business you end up with relatively lumpy large
contracts. This was a large reinsurance contract, and I have to maybe give a little story
here because I'm actually quite proud of what happened here. This is a perfect example
of how we add value to our clients.
This was a privately held company that had grown perhaps a little too fast, had some
surplus stress. We provided significant advice in terms of the way to renew it. In terms of
the mix of business and so on, and we prepared to offer, and we were able to offer them
a quarter share.
As that business grew, they actually, and improved, they actually offered us a larger
quarter share, which we took. They were successful to the point where they actually grew
and needed some incremental capital, and we made a small investment in that company
to help them grow, to fund that growth.

Bloomberg Transcript

Subsequent to that, they were sold. In fact, the transaction just closed this week or last
week. And the new owners are keeping the book essentially net. And although we are
losing some premium, we are actually going to make a significant gain on the investment
that we made in that company.
So over the short life of our A&H division, they were able to help at least this one
company significantly improve their profitability and outlook. They made underwriting
profits on the reinsurance treaty for a couple of years, and they made a significant capital
gain on the investment that we made in that party.
So it is actually a very successful story for us. And I have no doubt that by the end of the
Second Quarter, the disappearance of that reinsurance treaty will not be noticeable in our
numbers.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. Then, Albert, just one last question here. Are there any parts of your business you
think you can strengthen through M&A right now? Or I mean desire to?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yes, you know it's interesting. I've said this before, we're actually very fortunate in that we
already have a very wide range of products and a very good geography, so we have
absolutely zero need of M&A to achieve our strategic goals.
That said, there may be opportunities where there are opportunities for scale or to
increase in one area or the other, but I can very easily see our strategy as moving forward
and succeeding without an acquisition. Just as I can also easily see an opportunistic
acquisition that makes us perhaps a little bit bigger or a little bit more efficient in one or
the other books. It's purely opportunistic.

And her next question is from Ryan Clark of Janney Capital.

Q - Ryan Clark

{BIO 20622054 <GO>}

Hello, thanks for taking my question, guys, most of them were taken away. Just quickly
with the small A&H transaction, were you guys interested in pursuing that as well, or was
that a price to issue? Or just trying to figure out why that wasn't attractive for you guys to
look at?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well you know, we see a lot of opportunities and they've got to go through a filter. And
they need to make sense to us. And there are always some businesses that seem to
make sense to somebody else more than it does for us.

Bloomberg Transcript

And you know, we were interested in growing, we're interested in making acquisitions to
grow our A&H business, but it's got to be a transaction that make sense to us and
ultimately creates value for you, our shareholders. Sometimes we can do it and we pursue
them, and sometimes it doesn't look as attractive to us and we choose to pass.

Q - Ryan Clark

{BIO 20622054 <GO>}

Okay. Then, again, just from a broader perspective, I would say there's been some news
down on the island of some potential mergers and acquisitions. Just want to get your
thoughts broadly about consolidation in Bermuda? And maybe the potential willingness to
look at potentially dilutive book value deals?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

You know we get paid for growing book value. At the end of the day, that's the only thing
that matters. And growing book value ideally at a very attractive rate with relatively low
volatility.
And as you know, that's been the essence of our strategy for the last two, three years. In
terms of the volatility, although it's always been the core of our strategy to grow book
value.
I think that as a general guideline, acquisitions can have a, quote, a one-year dilutive
impact. As we go through pay fees, sometimes it takes you a year or two to achieve all
the efficiencies, but at the end of the day it's got to make sense on an MPV perspective
from day one.

Page 23 of 27

And there are some acquisitions that might be okay if there dilutive in the first year, if you
can make it up by the second year or so. But a transaction which is long-term dilutive is
really hard to reconcile.

And the next question will be from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you, so much for taking my questions. First, just a follow up on the A&H, and do you
have is the $300 million to $500 million annual premium still the target that you can
achieve your targeted profitability in that business?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. That's right. I think that as we've said before, we think an earned premium basis north
of $300 million is what's required to achieve underwriting profitability. Not because of the
losses or the acquisition expense, but basically to pay for the platforms that generate this
premiums.
So I do believe that an earned premium base in excess of $300 million is that magic level
for underwriting profitability. Then $500 million and so on for achieving your running rate
target ROEs in the mid-teens, that continues to be our view.
Now, the market has changed significantly, especially in the US, in terms of the nature of
the opportunities with the Affordable Care Act and so on and so forth. And we're always
modifying our tactics on the ground, but the $300 million and the $500 million levels that
you've discussed are still good benchmarks.

Great. Then on the investment side, so with the new hire David Phillips, will they be any
change in terms of your asset allocation as well as the investment process?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

No. I think to be fair we should give David an opportunity to review what there is, but you
might expect that we would not have hired a CIO who had philosophies and risk appetites
that were meaningfully different than what we had. So I think that the core of the strategy
is essentially the same.
Will there be changes here or there? I would expect that we would have some new ideas
and some new insights, but I would think that these would be changes at the margins, as

opposed to a fundamental change in our reserve, in our investing processes or risk
appetite.

Lastly, do you have any sort of exposure to the Ukraine situation?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I presume that what you're referring to would be political risk or credit risk?

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

We have a very, very small amount of exposure in terms of our credit and political risk
book in our credit risk solutions. We've reviewed those, we think those are continuing to
perform well. They are key and core to the Ukraine economy, and we don't believe that
we are at any noticeable risk at this point in time.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you, so much.

And the next question will come from Meyer Shields of KBW.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. Two I think unrelated questions. First, when we look at AXIS Ventures, should we
expect that to be a sharing of the historical AXIS book? Or are there lines of business or
accounts that would go there that maybe wouldn't fit as well on AXIS paper?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Both. Jay likes to, Jay Nichols, who is the CEO of our reinsurance division, has an
expression that I adore. And that is that we are the juncture where risk meets capital.
And there are multiple sources of capital that we have. One, is our capital, some of it is
our reinsurance capital, some of it may be third-party capital. We have an outstanding
distribution platform here using both insurance and reinsurance.
And there are a number of risks that we have access to which may be too much for our
own equity. And so it would be very easy to take the benefit of our ability to access that
business and share that business with reinsurers or with third-party capital.

FINAL

There may be third-party capital providers who have a very specific risk appetite with
whom we would be sitting down and we'd say, you know what, this is not business that we
have historically pursued, but if it's business that you're interested, let's see if we can find
some of that for you. So it's really a combination of the two.
It's a partnership between ourselves and our third-party capital providers, and we will
share with them both business that we write on our own and that we have written
historically. But there is a very good possibility that we could sit down with them, identify
lines of business that are attractive to them, and help them access that business.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. Is there any way of teasing out the fees that you collect versus your
ownership share of the actual performance?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Obviously, is not material right now, but over time I think we're going to have to find a way
to provide those kinds of insights to you.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, fantastic. Thanks for a much.
