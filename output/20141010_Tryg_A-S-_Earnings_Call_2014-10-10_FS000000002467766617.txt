MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Lars Møller
Good morning, everyone. This is Lars Møller from Tryg, Head of IR, and welcome to this
presentation of Tryg's Q3 Results. And with me here this morning, I have our CEO, Morten
Hübbe; and our CFO, Tor Lønnum with me.
So Morten, please.

Morten Hübbe
Thank you, Lars. And if we turn to slide three, we're very pleased this quarter to be able to
deliver a return on equity of more than 21% in the quarter where, in fact, investment
income is very close to zero and we've had heavy cloudburst resulting in some 2,500
more claims, DKK 450 million higher weather claims customer the same quarter the year
before, delivering 21% ROE. Under those circumstances, I think it shows a lot about the
robustness our business has come to.
We also show on this slide that technical result is up 3.5%, again, despite the DKK 150
million of cloudbursts with the main positive drivers being eﬃciency measures of DKK 95
million in the quarter, and runoﬀ gains which are some DKK 50 million higher than the
same quarter the previous year.

FINAL

As I said, investment result is some DKK 150 million lower than the same quarter last year,
which, of course, impacts the pre-tax result. Cost ratio is down to 15.1% or 0.4% down,
which I think is a strong improvement. Again, bear in mind that Q3 is seasonality wise the
quarter with the lowest cost ratio of the year. And as you can see, the top line is, for this
quarter, minus 0.8% for Denmark and Norway actually completely ﬂat. And of course,
that's an improved trend compared to the minus 3.4% in the similar quarter last year.
If we turn to slide four, we comment on the cloudbursts in August. But I think it's
important to see the business had less consequence on our result this time around
because of the increased focus on claims prevention measures. We mention again the
strong focus on our new price-diﬀerentiated initiative, and we see that it continues to
reduce the claims ratio of new customers that we bring on board.
We've purchased a small company called Securator this quarter, which will improve
earnings while at the same time strengthen our leading position in extended warranty
business. The eﬃciency program continues to be the main driver of earnings, almost DKK
100 million this quarter. Then we've announced the Capital Markets Day for November 5
this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

On slide ﬁve, we show how the various business areas contribute. You can see both the
quarterly data and the year-to-date data. Year-to-date, we see that Corporate and Sweden
delivered a combined ratio of around 90%, whereas Commercial and Private delivered a
combined ratio of 81%, 82%. But bear in mind, of course, that that includes the positive
one-oﬀ in the second quarter.
If we look at the third quarter, we see that Private lines continue the underlying
improvement of claims. We see in Commercial lines, importantly, a reduction of some 2
percentage points in the cost ratio. This is, as we've announced several times, the area
where we needed to bring down the cost ratio the most, and we're starting to achieve
that.
In Corporate lines, of course, you see a rather large reduction of some 9 percentage
points in the combined ratio year-on-year. But of course, bear in mind that we had a
rather large claim in our bonding business last year. In Sweden, you'll see a slight increase
in the combined ratio, which mainly contains a slightly higher frequency in content claims.
And also a bit higher large claim ratio.
On slide six, we reiterate the eﬃciency program, DKK 95 million this quarter, DKK 65
million from claims and DKK 30 million from costs. It means that we're now some 127
people less so far this year compared to the beginning of the year. And the procurement
program continues to drive the work claims ratio both through Scalepoint and our Craft
network. It means that to-date, we've now realized some DKK 835 million of our total
target of DKK 1 billion.
If we turn to slide eight, we show both how all four business areas contribute to the
technical result of DKK 793 million for the quarter. And we show also the development on

FINAL

top line. As I mentioned, an improved trend from minus 3.4% in the same quarter last year
to minus 0.8% this year.
Clearly, Private and Corporate have now turned slightly positive on the top line, whereas
Commercial has improved from minus 4.7% last year to minus 1.6% this year. And then you
can see that the most signiﬁcant number is in Sweden, with a top line of minus 8.4%. That
actually comprises an underlying organic, slightly positive growth in Sweden, but also that
the Nordea portfolio is running out of the portfolio, which of course has a signiﬁcant
negative impact. We see that actually by now our cross-sales to existing customers in
Sweden, means that we're actually selling slightly more without Nordea than we were
previously with Nordea. So an important trend that we continue to improve earnings and
also see an improved trend in the top line.
And over to you, Tor.

Tor Magne Lønnum

Thanks, Morten. If we continue on slide number nine, and look at the development in
average premiums, you can see that the development in Norway continues to be positive
both in the housing prices and in the motor prices, although slightly lower than what
you've seen in previous quarters.
And the slowing oﬀ in terms of price increases is more – it stems really more from a
portfolio shift in that respect. If you look at the Danish development, you can see that it's a
negative development in terms of house and motor prices, which is a combination of
competitive pressure but also an improved risk in the portfolio i.e., portfolio shift.
And I think it's important to say overall in terms of the premiums that the eﬀects stemming
from, for instance, competitive pressure is mitigated signiﬁcantly by the improved
selection that we see through our new price diﬀerentiated tariﬀs. So all in all, a relatively
good progress in this area.
If we continue to slide number 10 and look at the customer retention, it's an improved
trend in Private, Denmark. It's more or less ﬂattish, slightly negative in Norway, and an
overall improved trend in Commercial, both Denmark and Norway. And I think the overall
feature (08:02) areas that the retention level is stabilizing and actually improving slightly,
which I think is relatively good.
If we look at slide number 11 and continue with Private Sweden, you can see that the
retention levels have actually leveled oﬀ, although at a relatively low level. But as Morten
mentioned, you have seen that the Nordea portfolio has impacted the retention level in
Sweden. But you can now see that it's actually coming slightly back, although from a low
level.
If we move on to slide number 13 and look at the underlying claims ratio, there is an
overall improvement of 2.6 percentage points, which I think is quite healthy, primarily
driven by Corporate this quarter. And I should stress, again, that Corporate will typically
Page 3 of 19

FINAL

ﬂuctuate. So it shouldn't be considered to be a continuous trend in terms of the
Corporate improvement. I would highlight though that we do have a 0.7 percentage point
improvement in Private, which I think is really good.
If we continue to slide number 14 and look at sort of the large items for the quarter,
Morten have mentioned the impact of weather this quarter, and it's a 3.1% impact overall
on the quarter. I think, again, if we look at the claims and compare to the 2011 eﬀect, it's
been signiﬁcantly lower, which I think is good.
I would also highlight here the runoﬀ, which is slightly higher than what you saw the
previous quarter. And I guess it more or less signals that we have a relatively strong and
unfavorable reserve development as I think we have indicated previous quarters as well.
If we move to the next slide, slide number 15, on the cost side, i.e., in addition to the
comments mentioned about the cost ratio, I would also highlight the fact that we do have
a nominal reduction of DKK 40 million in expenses this quarter, which I think, again
underpins the strength and the eﬃciency program. And if you look at sort of the
development in FTEs this quarter, I slided it (10:34) down by 63 FTEs on a comparable
basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we continue on slide number 17 and look at the investment results, that was the area that
was perhaps more disappointing this quarter. It was a zero investment income and down
from DKK 152 million last year. Of course, it was represented by weak performance in high
yield emerging markets. That's done on equity. So overall, sort of negative performance
in some of the asset classes that have yielded good in previous quarter.
I think I'd like to stress again that if you look at the investment income, it is there to
support the overall insurance operation. And as such, I would say that it's after all a
healthy development.
If we look at the capital structure, it's on slide number 18, it's more or less stable
development in terms of the capital buﬀer. It's at 64%, of course impacted by the results
for the quarter, but also the development in terms of the buyback, sorry. Sorry for that.
And I guess it's no news related to the other capital issues for the quarter.
And I guess with that, I hand it back to you, Morten.

Morten Hübbe
And actually, I think we just need to jump back shortly to slide number 15, where we have
a good example I think on the cloudburst side, because clearly, analysis show that we
were likely to see more cloudburst in the future. And I think very importantly, in this
quarter, we've seen that our work with experience from the 2011 cloudburst have actually
improved our ability to manage cloudburst at lower expense.

FINAL

We see for instance Tivoli, the game park in Copenhagen, was actually hit by roughly
double the amount of water compared to 2011. But actually the claims cost was only about
a third of the experience in 2011, and it just shows that when the customer and we
together work very hard to prevent claims from happening through security measures,
wiser containment and storage of valuables, et cetera, et cetera, then we can improve
both the ﬁnancial impact and also the customer experience. And clearly, we should
continue in that direction.
And then I think ﬁnally, before we take your questions, on slide 20, the ﬁnancial targets, I
think where I started out, we're quite pleased to be able to deliver 21%, which aren't on
equity in a quarter where we've had heavy cloudbursts, DKK 150 million more in weather
claims and roughly, a zero investment income that is quite robust, and it shows that our
eﬃciency program is moving us in the right direction.
And the eﬃciency program allows us to both expand our margin, while at the same time,
making sure we also manage some slight market competitive pressure in Denmark. And
important, also, improved trend in our top line while our selection continues to improve
through our price diﬀerentiation.
So we reiterate our targets of the 20% ROE post-tax and the expense ratio below 15% next
year. And with that, I think, we are ready to take your questions. Operator?

Thank you. Our ﬁrst question is coming from Mr. Sami Taipalus from Berenberg. Please go
ahead sir.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Hi. Morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a few things about
your guidance on various diﬀerent items. And I wanted to start with reserve releases
actually. Now, if we look at reserve releases over the last few years, they're consistently
quite fair bit above, I think, where your guidance is 2.5 percentage points to 3 percentage
points on the combined ratio. Do you think this is something that a guidance that you'll
need to revisit or do you think it's valid anymore? It doesn't sound like there was anything
too exceptional in this quarter from what you said basically. And on this note, as well,
could you give us a little bit more detail about what actually drove the high reserve
releases in Q3?
The second bit I wanted to ask about was the NAT/CAT guidance where, I think, looking
at the media, the oﬀers in Q3 seemed to have been quite signiﬁcant or should have been
quite signiﬁcant. But you've actually come in within your kind of normal NAT/CAT budget.
So do you think your guidance here is too conservative? Do you think that it's something
that you need to revisit? And I guess this ties back to what you said about what you've
done on claims prevention as well.

And then ﬁnally, on investment income, we've seen quite signiﬁcant fall in Danish interest
rates over the year, I think about 80 basis points or so. Do you think you need to revisit
the investment income guidance there? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Morten Hübbe
Well, I think, clearly to start out that on the reserve releases side, it's fair to say that in the
previous number of years, we've been above the 2.5%, 3% mark. I think it is to be
expected that there we will be above that mark also in the coming years. And I think to
some extent that we will revisit the guidance on that area, and return to you on that
question. But I think for now, you can assume that the future is more in line with the more
recent history than it's in line with the 2.5%, but we'll revisit that question with you in the
future.
I think on the NAT/CAT side, we are clearly above last year. We're also slightly above the
budget for the quarter. So I think it would clearly be too ambitious or more too optimistic
to lower the NAT/CAT expenses. I think if you look at the demographics and the analytics
with the weather experts, they are pointing towards an increased risk, but I think we need
to continue to work with the claims prevention to avoid having to increase the
expectation. But I think for now, we're comfortable with the expectation where it is. Now I
think over to you, Tor, on the investment side

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yes. I think I'd just add to the question about the reserves that as we did two years ago,
we are in the midst of a review of our reserves this quarter as well by an external actuary.
So we are actually revisiting our reserve position and, I think, of course that means that
we'll have to look at sort of the reserves again when we come to our Capital Markets Day.
In terms of the investment side, I think it's fair to say that yes, you're right, the interest rate
level in Denmark has dropped. And in terms of guidance on the investment side, I think
we will just try to revisit that guidance here before year-end as we traditionally do in terms
of the 2015 guidance. But as you know, it's not really that signiﬁcant, Sami, where as long
as we have sort of the matching portfolio which is really sort of the major driver in terms of
interest rates.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Then just on something that we talked a little while back about which
was you mentioned that you might start disclosing the actual cash that's coming out of the
realized gains and the interest returns and dividends and from your investment portfolio
rather than the mark-to-market movements. Is that something that you're still considering
doing? And when could we maybe see that coming in force?

A - Morten Hübbe
I don't have a clear timeline on it, but yes, it's something that we are considering.

FINAL

And we have our next questions coming from Mr. Håkon Fure from DNB Markets. Please
go ahead, sir.

Q - Håkon R. Fure
Yeah. Good morning, guys. Yeah. Two questions left from me. Firstly, on the very strong
Norwegian combined ratio this quarter, could you provide some more details on what's
driving that? Is it mainly sort of good luck in terms of a few large claims in Norway this
quarter? Is it more a continued benign underlying claims trend?
And secondly, you've been making some smaller acquisitions of companies with small
portfolios in recent quarters. Do you view these as one-oﬀ events or do you see room to
do more similar acquisitions in coming years?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yeah. Good morning, Håkon. I'll start by answering the ﬁrst question. Yes, you're right. It is
a very strong combined ratio in Norway. I think – bear in mind and you've heard me say
this before, that the Q3 result for Norwegian insurance should be really good because
that is, by far, the best quarter. And of course, that seasonality becomes even stronger
when you look at the Norwegian business isolated. So I think the best comment to make
is really that, yes, we did have a benign development in Q3, and, yes, that is to be
expected.
But you're also right in your assumption that it was a low level of large claims impact on
the Norwegian business. But ﬁrst and foremost, that highlights sort of the strong earnings
potential in the Q3 numbers in Norway. And I think it also signals something about the
diversiﬁcation in the business model, because we have the cloudburst impact in
Denmark, and, of course, that shows up here in the geographical numbers. So I wouldn't
sort of highlight it as anything extraordinary. Now, to the small acquisitions, I guess
Morten will...

A - Morten Hübbe
I think on the small acquisitions, Håkon, you can argue that in Q2 we purchased the
renewal right of Codan's Danish agricultural business. That was some 1,600 potential
customers where we do not take over the tail or the portfolio, but we'll take over the
renewal right. And we have obtained some 90% acceptance from those 1,600 customers.
And then, as you mentioned, we've purchased a small company called Securator, which
does mainly a Danish market extended warranty business.
I think clearly that we've shown that we are extremely disciplined when it comes to top
line. We've accepted top line losses, because we believe that that was necessary to drive
the earnings improvement. We will continue to have a very disciplined view on top line
versus bottom line in the future. I think if you look at those two speciﬁc cases in the
Page 7 of 19



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2014-10-10

FINAL

agricultural example, our eﬃciency means that we can run that business with a
signiﬁcantly lower cost ratio than Codan could. And therefore, it is signiﬁcantly more value
creational in our business.
If you look at the Securator purchase, it actually is in an area, extended warranty, where
our Swedish business already has a market-leading position on the Nordic scale. And
when we add Securator to that market-leading position, we've become even clearer
number one with signiﬁcant synergies potential and with a signiﬁcant value creational
potential.
So, I guess, we should signal that could it happen again that we would look at smaller
portfolios? Yes, but we would have a very, very strict attitude to the value creation of that
and be very clear that synergies and ROE impact is a strong value driver, and if not, we
would not look at such cases.

Q - Håkon R. Fure
Thanks. And do you have any set M&A rules?

A - Tor Magne Lønnum

Bloomberg Transcript

Before we get to that, Håkon, I'd just add to Morten's comment that if you look at sort of
the strength of the product appliances insurance, it's actually combining the existing
business with the Securator portfolio, it actually brings our market share above 30% on
the Nordic scale if you look at this area isolated. So, of course, it really enhances our
market position.
Now, in terms of metrics that you asked for, Håkon, I'd just say that if you look at sort of
the Securator portfolio, it's a portfolio more than DKK 200 million in revenues. And the
price that we have paid is less than one year premium. If you look at sort of how it
enhances the earnings, it's a positive contribution after year three – or in year three, i.e. a
positive return on equity of 20% or more.

Q - Håkon R. Fure
Okay. Excellent. Thanks, guys.

Operator
Our next question is coming from Mr. Jakob Brink from ABG. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Thank you. I have two questions, please. First one is just coming back to the run-oﬀ gains.
You mentioned that or basically, it sounds like you might increase that guidance in
connection with the Capital Markets Day.
I just want to know, I mean, has the fact that you over-provisioned sort of 7% on each
claims, is that what has changed or will a potential change to the guidance, is that more
Page 8 of 19



Company Name: Tryg A/S

Date: 2014-10-10

FINAL

led by the fact that you have some buﬀers from old Supreme Court rulings that are no
longer necessary? Or how should we look at the fact that you might change the reserve
guidance or run-oﬀ guidance? That was number one.
The second one is, on page 16, in the report, you mentioned that Danish FSA has
postponed both the expected future proﬁts to be included in capital, but also the
potential to increase subordinated debt until 2016. But also, you mentioned that
potentially there could be some temporary allowance to do that anyway. Does that
include both the expected future proﬁts and subordinated debt? And what is your
conviction level on the potential that there will actually be a new sort of temporary
legislation? Thank you.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yeah. Good morning, Jakob. I think, to the run-oﬀ gains, it's a very valid, very good
question you're raising there in terms of where is actually the gain stemming from. And I
think we haven't altered our reserving practice, i.e., you can't sort of build into the model
that we will see sort of run-oﬀ gains in the area of 5% to 7% into perpetuity.

Bloomberg Transcript

I guess what is really important to understand is that there are really good results coming
out of the older vintages in terms of the portfolio, and that's really what is driving the
beneﬁcial development in terms of run-oﬀ gains. But, as I said, we will, of course, revert to
the reserves and talk a bit more there in terms of guidance. I hope not a bit more.
Now, if we go to the latter question related to the capital, I think it's fairly important to say
that in terms of the question related to how can we handle the new legislation, I don't
really want to say anything about – I don't want to say anything about sort of our
conviction in terms of the FSA, because, as you know, that's really a – that is an exercise
that – which is really diﬃcult, probably more diﬃcult than running a 100-meter against
Usain Bolt.
But I'd say that in terms of the usage of subordinated debt, i.e., gearing in the portfolio, of
course, we do at least have some expectations in terms of that being opened up already
in 2015 and it's something that we expect to address as an issue on the Capital Markets
Day.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Just getting back to the reserve run-oﬀ gains, as you've said, that 7% is still what you're
aiming at. How about interest – sorry – inﬂation, the fact that inﬂation has been coming
down quite signiﬁcantly over the past four years, ﬁve years? And how much you
accounted for that in your reserving policies? Is all of that in the numbers so far or is that
part of the reason why you have excessive run-oﬀ gains?

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
That depends on how you deﬁne inﬂation, because there's no doubt. When I talk about
claims, inﬂation, of course, that means that you include what happens in terms of the – i.e.
the sort of the size of the claimant or in favor of the claimant. So, of course, when you see
Page 9 of 19



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2014-10-10

that we have, through the models, of course, built in expectations about claims inﬂation
based on regulation and also legal rulings. So, I think, of course, that is – if you don't get
the development that you have expected, that is a positive contributor to the reserves.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thanks for that.

Operator
We'll have our next question that's coming from Mr. Gianandrea Roberti from Carnegie.
Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good morning from me as well. I have three questions. If I can start from the
underlying development, I was looking at the percentages of weather and large claims for
the nine months. And I think I'm calculating that these are around – sorry, I have the
numbers here – around DKK 700 million for the nine months versus DKK 787 million,
which I should expect, just taking your full year guidance for these two items and divided
by four times three basically.
So there's a little DKK 87 million, which is around 60 bps better than expected on the nine
months combined ratio. But I have the slight feeling that this year, if I look at underlying
frequencies, particularly in the second quarter and third quarter, has been quite better
than normal. And I'm struggling a bit to capture it just looking at the large and weather
claims, right? So I don't know if you have any comment on this point or if we should really
believe that compared to a normal year it's really just this DKK 87 million that has gone in
your favor. That's my ﬁrst question.
The second question is how you see the top line development going in the next two
years. Are we still supposed to look at a very ﬂattish development in 2015 versus 2014,
and, perhaps, a bit better in 2016?
And the ﬁnal question is regarding the buybacks going to next year. If I remember
correctly, last year, you announced the buyback program in December. I'm just
wondering if your plan is to do the same or you will just wait the end of January when you
report Q4 and just to publish dividend and buybacks. Thanks a lot.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yes. I can try to answer the ﬁrst question, Gianandrea. Good morning. In terms of the
weather, what you did, as far as I understood from the calculation, is that you take sort of
the guidance of the DKK 500 million plus the DKK 550 million divided by 4 and times 3.
But keep in mind that the weather-related impact is not sort of accrued for in four equal
portions. So we do have sort of deviations related to the expected seasonal pattern. So if

Page 10 of 19



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2014-10-10

FINAL

you look at sort of the picture year-to-date in terms of expectations related to weatherrelated and large claims, we are perhaps slightly below expectations year-to-date.
Now, the question related to sort of what does it mean in terms of the underlying, I guess,
what we look at is an underlying improvement as you have indicated. And for the year
thus far, it looks, as you indicate yourself, pretty healthy. And I don't think I'll describe it as
any sort of particular luck in the numbers. If you look at sort of the frequency
development, of course, it's a continued positive development on the cars and then it's a
more mixed picture in terms of house and content.

A - Morten Hübbe
On your second question, on the top line guidance, we expect 2015 to be somewhere
between slightly negative and zero. And then we expect 2016 to be around normal
inﬂation like top line. And clearly, in 2015, we'll still see an impact where particularly
Sweden pulls down the total top line, whereas we see that Denmark and Norway has a
slightly further improved trend.
But also bear in mind that this quarter, being the best top line quarter in two years, has a
bit of help on premium discounts being slightly lower than the similar quarter last year. So
the trend is improving, but we will still struggle, particularly with Sweden in 2015. I think
reverting to something like inﬂation in 2016 is reasonable.

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Two questions from my side. The ﬁrst one is on cost savings and the
second one is on Danish home and content insurance. On the ﬁrst one, you've achieved
an additional an incremental DKK 95 million in savings this quarter again, sort of in line
with your recent run rate.
And so if I do my complex analysis and if you continue at this stage, you'll have achieved
your DKK 1 billion sometime in the ﬁrst quarter next year. So just want to know how we
should think about this going forward as some of your – is there an element of fund
building or some of your initiatives yielding greater results, perhaps you may be
uncovered more cost savings as you go along? That's my ﬁrst question.

Bloomberg Transcript

And the second one is on Denmark and in particular, as I look at the average premium
development in the home insurance on page 9 of your slides, it seems to me that
throughout 2010 and 2011 sort of bad weather, which includes the 2011 cloudburst,
helped justify the increasing premiums in Denmark in particular.
And so with the weather having been consistently milder since then and with, as you
mentioned in your slides, the gross claims cost from the cloudburst being a third of what
they were in 2011, just wanted to sort of get your thoughts on how you see the average
premiums sort of developing (36:46) going forward? I mean, would it be reasonable to
assume that this come under pressure going forward? And thank you.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yeah. Good morning, Daniel. I can start by answering about the cost savings. Yes, we are
very pleased with the development, both in terms of admin expenses and in terms of
procurement gains. So I think it's been really a good and healthy pipeline in terms of
initiatives. And you're right. Some has surprised us positively, but there has also been
areas where we haven't been able to achieve as much as we would like to see.
I guess, in terms of the cost savings, bear in mind that when we set out with the DKK 300
million, we were sort of talking about eﬃciency gains based on a top line that was at least
in balance and perhaps even slightly positive, whereas we have been looking into a
relatively diﬀerent development.
So I think you should sort of add to the thought that in addition to sort of the savings that
has been achieved on the back of the savings program, we have done additional sort of
housekeeping to make sure that the costs are kept down. And that's really why I
highlighted the comment for this quarter alone where we have a DKK 40 million drop in
nominal expenses.
So, I think, yes, there's no doubt that we have seen pockets or areas where we've been
able to achieve more than we had expected. There are areas where we have been
Page 12 of 19

surprised negatively as well. But overall, of course, it has been according to plan and even
more so based on what we had done on that side. And I think on the Danish home
content...

FINAL

A - Morten Hübbe
I think on home in Denmark, this is actually a product which has undergone signiﬁcant
changes so far and is going to undergo signiﬁcant changes also the rest of this year and
next year, because if you go back just four years, our combined ratio on Danish house was
more than 110%. So, actually, no earnings at all. Now, we've achieved the situation through
price increases where we're now actually making clearly positive earnings in the home
product.
If you look at what is going on at the moment, we are actually in the process of doing a
completely new house product. And clearly, that will change the coverages and will
change pricing, et cetera. And we believe that in the coming years, we will continue to
see a trend where we will make improved earnings in house or home in Denmark,
whereas we will probably see slightly reduced earnings in motor in Denmark. So that is
likely to be the trend.

Bloomberg Transcript

How that actually impacts the average premium, I think, will be inﬂuenced by a change on
the product side. So the comparison might be a little bit diﬃcult during this period. But
clearly, weather (40:05) risk plays a bigger and bigger role in the house product. But
expectation are slightly higher in (40:11) house in the coming years.

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Can I just follow-up on the cost savings again? Just in terms of what we
should expect going into the next quarter into 2015, whether the pace of incremental cost
saves are expected to come down, or whether we should expect – perhaps you dropped
it as – (40:40) on additional cost savings in excess of the DKK 1 billion perhaps at the
Capital Markets Day or later on in the year. Thanks.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yeah. It's a nice try, Daniel. I think I'd just say that it's natural that you look at sort of the
eﬃciency program when we come to the Capital Markets Day. And I don't really want to
give any more guidance on that.

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Next question is coming from Mr. Per Grønborg from Danske Markets. Please go ahead,

Company Name: Tryg A/S

Yes. Thank you. It's Per from Danske. Couple of questions from me as well. Last quarter,
you gave us the growth in local currency excluding the Nordea portfolio. I was not able to
ﬁnd this ﬁgure this time. Can you give it, and can you also give us what the impact would
be if you excluded the acquired portfolio from Codan?

FINAL

The second question is on the large client (41:36) industrial part, the renewal season has
started. Can you give any indications of what directions you are seeing currently on rates?
And ﬁnally, a topic that has been touched a number of times before, the prior year gains.
How much of the gains you are harvesting these days is coming from the liability product,
and basically can be referred to the 2004 change in the liability law, the initial material
(42:04) that you did compare to the actual claims experience. That was my three
questions. Thank you.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yeah. Do you want me to start or...

A - Morten Hübbe
Good morning, Per. Just to be clear on the ﬁrst question, Per, was it the group growth
without Nordea or was it the Swedish growth without Nordea?

Q - Per Grønborg

Bloomberg Transcript

The group growth without Nordea.

A - Morten Hübbe
Well, that – if you'll take the group growth, which is minus 0.8% and you disregard
Sweden completely, then you get to 0.0% for the group. And actually, Sweden without
Nordea was slightly positive. So the group growth without Nordea only would be zeropoint-something small, 0.1%, zero-point – something like that, positive.

Q - Per Grønborg
How big is the positive impact from the Codan portfolio?

A - Morten Hübbe
Well, it's actually, to the largest extent, very marginal by now because bear in mind that
we're not taking over the portfolio, we're taking over the renewal rights. So what is going
on is that we've achieved the acceptance of more than 90%, but actually very little of that
has come into force, so in the actual earned premium, very, very little. So nothing worth
mentioning, but it will start improving the earned numbers during the next 12 months.

Q - Per Grønborg
Okay.

FINAL

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
In terms of the question related to the prior year gains, Per, I guess, yes, you're right,
there's no doubt that there is impact by – that there is prior year gains we had from that
change. But on the other hand, you should, of course, note that the run-oﬀ gains are more
or less – not entirely, but more or less equally distributed between Denmark and Norway.
So there are signiﬁcant run-oﬀ gains in the Norwegian portfolio as well. And I think – sorry,
the overall picture is more or less in line with what you have seen the previous quarters,
i.e. that we'll see gains from workers' comp, that we see improvement from motor TPL,
but also to a certain extent as we talked about the liability product.

Q - Per Grønborg
Okay. The renewal season?

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Renewal season, I think it's fair to say that there's no doubt that there's still uncontinued
rate pressure in the market. On the other hand, you can say that not that we are overly
optimistic, but I think we are balanced on the renewal season. It seems to be okay-ish in
terms of the direct side. I guess the broker side is more under pressure as usual, but – how
should I say – not overly optimistic, but not negative neither so.

Q - Per Grønborg

Okay. Perfect. Thank you.

Next question is coming from Mr. Christian Hede from Nordea. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, gents. Most of my questions have been answered. So I just have one
nitty-gritty question on the equity performance and the investment activities this quarter. I
think you've previously guided that you try to benchmark your equity investments against
the MSCI World in Danish kroner, and obviously, that has not been the case this quarter.
So could you give us some more details on what you have done and what you haven't
done in this quarter? Thank you.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yeah. Good morning, Christian. I guess that's – it's a good question. And there might be
some misinterpretation or misunderstanding in that number. There's no doubt that what
we do is that we benchmark against the MSCI World. What we do is that we hedge the
equity exposure 100%. And so our benchmark for the quarter shows a performance of
0.3%, I think, is the correct number. So we have a performance, which is slightly behind
benchmark.

Next question is coming from Mr. Vinit Malhotra from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead,
sir.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Hi. It's Vinit here. Hi. Tor, Good morning. Just one question on Private lines and one on
Commercial, please. So just on Private lines, I noted that you mentioned a 0.7%
improvement in underlying. And obviously, in the report it is attributed to the expense
and claims initiatives, but, Tor, you also mentioned portfolio mix and selection. Is it
possible at all to give an idea of what would be negative on the competition, the oﬀset on
the portfolio as well apart from the claims initiatives? I just wanted to understand that 0.7%
split between portfolio and expense initiative if it is possible. Just some idea would be
useful.

Bloomberg Transcript

And just on the Commercial lines, I noticed several things here. One is that your
Norwegian retention has gone up a lot. Also, there's a mention in the report that the
broker channel is now part of Commercial and not Corporate. So there seems to be a lot
of changes and I remember from previous calls (48:10) mentioned of new products. Could
you just drive the – could you just discuss the momentum that is in this Commercial
business and just for our beneﬁt? Thank you.

A - Morten Hübbe
Yeah. Well, I think on your latter questions, Vinit, I think on the Commercial side (48:34) on
the underlying. Clearly, we're doing a lot of changes in Commercial. First of all, we have
changed the split between Corporate business and Commercial business. So it means
that 80% of the small or medium-sized Corporate customers have actually been moved to
Commercial segment. And that is why Commercial segment now also has a broker
channel as they are the consequence of that change.
So that is one important change. I think you point to a very important area, which is the
retention rate, because, clearly, two of the areas we wanted to improve in Commercial
was, one, the cost ratio, which has dropped 2 percentage points this quarter; two, we
wanted to improve the retention rates. And one of the things we've done so far is that we
have implemented what we call a free renewal date contact, where we actually contact the
Norwegian Commercial customers prior to renewal to make sure that we have a positive
dialogue and expectation and then updates prior to renewal season, instead of doing
nothing and risk that the customer walks away. That is starting to improve and get positive
results.
We are also updating our, you can call it ongoing service concepts to make sure that we
have a more frequent dialogue with these Commercial customers. And then a third point
that we're working on is that we signiﬁcantly want to further improve our selection process
in Commercial, where it's fair to say that we've done signiﬁcant process in Private,
whereas in Commercial lines, we're slightly more behind the progress of Private lines. So I
Page 16 of 19

think important improvements in Commercial along the lines that we have actually been
targeting.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

FINAL

And just to clarify, is this more a Norwegian initiative?

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Good morning. To the question about the Private lines, I think I unintentionally said 0.7%
and it should be 1% in terms of underlying improvement, so sorry about that. I guess, it's
important to say that if you look sort of at the historic numbers that we are reporting,
there's no doubt that the main driver in that respect is the internal eﬃciency program, i.e.,
both the claims procurement and the cost eﬃciency.
When I did make the comment related to the average premium, it's, of course, there are
some portfolio shifts going on. For instance, we see an increased retention level in the
housing products, i.e., that the customer retains more of his sort of risk, but there is also
an element of being able to set the right price for the right customer that I mentioned
during the presentation. But, of course, that is important if you look at future expectations
in terms of earnings more than sort of the recent history that we're looking at here.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes.

A - Morten Hübbe
I should say (51:37) that historically, in Private lines, Tryg has had clearly lower selfretention levels or deductable levels than our peers. So we're likely to see in the next
couple of years that deductable levels or self-retention levels will be slightly higher. And
of course that pulls slightly downwards on the average price. But it's actually a healthy
development both for the customer and us.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Sure. Can I just follow-up quickly on these points, please? Just to get it right, the
competition mush have had some kind of a negative eﬀect and then there was a positive
eﬀect from initiatives and the net is up 1%, right? Is that the way to look at it or competition
was not really impacting and everything we see on the 1% is – so I just want to understand
the negative force as well. And just on the Norwegian Commercial, just want to clarify, this
is not being done in Denmark, only in Norway, this pre-renewals contact, just to clarify
that, please. Thank you very much.

A - Morten Hübbe
So if we take the last one ﬁrst, the pre-renewal contact, we plan to do in both Norway and
Denmark, but we have started the process in Norway.

Page 17 of 19



Company Name: Tryg A/S

Okay.

A - Morten Hübbe

FINAL

And so that is correct. And the split change between Corporate and Commercial, et
cetera, was done in both Denmark and Norway. So hopefully, that's clear.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

And just on...

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yeah. I think to the follow-up question, it may be that we are sort of talking about two
slightly diﬀerent things, because, yes, there's no doubt that if you look at sort of the car
product, there is a portfolio shift. There is competitive pressure in the market. And there
are the smaller cars, for instance, to the portfolio shift that I mentioned earlier.
What is important to understand, of course, is when I talk about the development in terms
of the average prices, it also says something about the future earnings power. And that's
really why I had mentioned sort of the selection process, which really improves the
underlying proﬁtability. And it won't be that visible in terms of the recent quarter alone.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hübbe
I guess, you can argue that we monitor what is the claims ratio of new customers
compared to previously and what is the trend on that, what is the claims ratio of
customers leaving us compared to previously and what's the trend on that. But as only
10%, 11% of the customers are replaced every year, it takes a fair amount of time before
that has any impact on the total portfolio and thereby the total accounting numbers as
you see them. So that is why that trend is not something that is very visible to you.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay. All right. Thank you.
