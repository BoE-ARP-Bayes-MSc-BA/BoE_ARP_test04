{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. Now it's just one month since I last spoke to you about the
plans through to 2014. And as you'd expect, while there's been a lot of activity inside the
Company in that period, the consequences of that are going to find their way into
announcements, not today but over the coming months. So first let me deal with the
interim result.
Operating performance was largely in line with expectations. Of course the main new
news was the write-down of the goodwill in the US following a view of its recoverability. As
I also said last month, there was a desire to hold the dividend and that's what we've done
in the half. So notwithstanding the subdued external environment, a number of our
businesses performed well, including the UK, Canada, Poland and Singapore. And so
that's been good. Others were affected, for example by currency, in particular Europe.

FINAL

Turning to the Company overall, last month we announced the results of our strategic
review of 58 main businesses within the Group. I'll remind you that that concluded that we
had 16 businesses that were non-core to be exited, 15 were standout, and there were 27
that operated around our cost of capital. We also announced our intention to bring our
capital levels up from current levels to a range of 160%, 175% coverage, to reduce the
volatility of capital at the same time, to reduce leverage and to lower our costs by
GBP400m.
As a result we ceased writing bulk purchase annuity transactions. We brought down our
holdings in Delta Lloyd to below 20%. We've completed disposals in Hungary, Czech
Republic and Romania. Our Italian debt holdings have been reduced by EUR2 billion and
we plan further reductions in that when the circumstances permit. The yield is sitting at
5.82 [ph] in the tenure at the moment, so we really need that to drift down a little bit so
that we can do that without an impact on our P&L. So that's our thinking on that.
We also began the process of disposing or running down the non-core businesses. We've
appointed investment banking advisors to 10 that are planned to be sold and are in the
process of reducing capital levels in capital-hungry segments. We're also considering
plans to improve the returns of the 27 medium-return business cells.

Bloomberg Transcript

On expenses, we're nearing the finalization of the delayering of the Group. There were
announcements this week. And when completed should save a significant part of the total
target savings. We've also begun a review of head office, support activities and non-staff
costs across the Group.
As part of instituting individual accountability, each of the Group executives now have
revised performance objectives. And they'll be held accountable for delivering these and
that will form the basis of their variable remuneration. We've also eliminated all
unnecessary committees and meetings to allow people to spend more time on our
business and more time with customers. We've also reduced the distance between the
CEO and the customers, which was quite deep before. And finally we continue to evolve
the Board, which is now down to 11 people. And we expect further movement over the
remainder of this year and into next year.
Anyway, it's my sense that we have got the right agenda. We've got the right people in
place to execute it, although we are needing to appoint a CEO. We are broadly on track
with the program we set out last month. Over and above the actions we've already taken,
you can expect further announcements in the second half and other announcements next
year. And I remain confident that we'll do exactly as we said we would going forward.
Thank you. And now I'll pass you to Pat.

Great. Thanks John. Good morning, everybody. Nice to see you all here again. I did notice
actually we'd got some Team GB chocolates for everybody to enjoy in the bowls, if you
hadn't seen.

FINAL

On the results, as John said, operating results I think broadly in line with expectations. GI a
little bit better than expectations. Life partly impacted by foreign exchange, euro versus
sterling. We booked some additional operating cost in the first half, Solvency II and the
first wave of implementing the Simplify program. We have taken the decision to writedown the goodwill in the US. I'll come back to that obviously in a bit more detail later.
Operating capital generation up about GBP100m, less capital consumed in new business.
New business profitability staying at pretty steady levels, both General Insurance and on
the Life side. And our economic capital and IGD ratios pretty stable versus both what we
told you a month ago and versus the First Quarter.
Looking at the operating profit in a little bit more detail, and we've tried to put a
reconciliation big picture what's going on here. So General Insurance is up. I think probably
given we'd sold the RAC and we had some additional weather costs, that's come through
a bit stronger than generally expectations. And Life, UK good, slightly offset by eurozone
and FX.

Bloomberg Transcript

So big picture, some underlying profit growth generally in the General Insurance area. Last
year we made just under GBP50 million from the RAC, so sold that, that comes out. In
weather, this is just versus last year. So if you look at it against our long-term average,
actually it's slightly above our long-term average, but not much. But it's more than last
year. Last year was quite benign. And that's mainly in the UK, a bit in Ireland. Foreign
exchange, both the euro and the zloty impacting profits. Then the higher restructuring
cost, as I said.
On restructuring cost, you can see GBP186m. Within that you've got about GBP70 million
of Solvency II costs and the remainder being the cost of Simplify, Ireland transformation,
removal of the regions and the first wave of our delayering cost as well. For the full year
I'd expect that number to be a bit more than double the GBP186 million as we get
through to the next phase of the Simplify program.
Looking at the Life side, there's a couple of things here. Firstly is there's now seven
businesses that really make up our Life results. There's three in General Insurance, seven
in Life. And that's Aviva really. Biggest obviously is the UK. UK, Singapore and Poland are
the really high-returning businesses, returns significantly in excess of our cost of capital.
France and Spain, resilient operating profits, about around our cost of capital. And Italy
and Spain below our -- sorry, Italy and Spain -- Italy and the US below our cost of capital.
In terms of the rec [ph] versus last year, modest profit growth in UK, US and Singapore.
And I'll talk more country by country in a moment. Ireland we talked a bit about on July 5,
tough place to do life business at the moment, the economic environment, new business
profitability etc. Mainland Europe is actually reasonably resilient. When you strip out the FX
impact, you're down a couple of percent in those businesses. So what you've seen there
is some lower new business sales but good customer retention, good retention levels,
good in-force business flowing through to pretty resilient operating profits.

FINAL

Just going through that business by business, starting with the UK, our biggest business. A
2% increase in operating profit, GBP469m. A couple of trends going on there. At the start
of the year we had lower -- obviously lower market values from the back half of 2011. So
slightly lower unit-linked values and lower unit-linked income therefore in the first six
months. That was then offset by higher annuity in force. We've grown our annuity business
over time, our earnings flowing from annuities and a lower expense base. So the net of
those three items gives you the 2% profit increase.
Big uplift in operating capital generation. There is a one-time item in there I think I
mentioned at the First Quarter, of around GBP100m. Even if you strip that out, a good
increase in operating capital generation in the UK.
One of the themes that we are going to talk about, and this is linked to pulling out of bulk
purchase annuities, is bigger translation of operating profit to capital generation and then
to internal dividend flows as well, and slightly therefore dialing back annuity business and
slightly dialing up things like the workplace pensions.

Bloomberg Transcript

In France, on a constant currency basis down about 5%, again really reflecting lower
opening reserves in the wealth management business, but pretty resilient profits.
Retentions are good, slightly better than they were at the end of 2011. And again good
operating capital generation, up 16% there as we slightly dial back the more capitalintensive new business and good in-force reserves as well.
A similar story in Spain. New business is down in Spain, but that's mainly the -- something
close to a 50% reduction of our new business with Bankia as we go through the
arbitration process. New business in our other partners is actually down a little, but not too
much. Again, strong customer retention in Spain, therefore your in-force reserves are
pretty solid, flowing through to operating capital generation and operating profit. There
was a little bit of a one-time item last year, so the underlying in Spain is actually pretty flat.
And very much the same story in Italy as well. New business profit -- sorry, new business
volumes down a lot, probably 60% down from a couple of years ago. And that's very
much actions we've taken to dial back those more capital-intensive products. Customer
retention's high though so you can see that at a consistent operating profit level. And with
those lower new business sales, the operating capital generation now for the first time
really flipping to a positive contribution.
The US, profits up slightly. We had a small one-time item last year, but overcome that by
increasing the margin on our in-force business there. You remember in the US product we
can go and re-price the back book each year to a higher spread margin coming through in
the US. On the operating capital generation we had a one-time negative of around
GBP100 million (sic-see presentation slides "GBP98m"), a little over GBP100 million in
2012. And that was the introduction of something called AG33, which is new local stat
reserving basis.
We just put down here actually just a bit of additional information, the returns on the US
are around a 4% return on capital, IFRS capital there. If you did look at it through a local
Page 4 of 24

FINAL

lens, what would you see? It was about an 8% return there.
Poland and Singapore are two terrific businesses. Poland, you remember, we built up over
about 20 years. Really been primarily a pensions-based business. We got to number two
in the market there. With the change in regulation we're now selling more of the life
products. That's worked very well. About three-quarters of our sales are now nonpensions type business and that's good new business profitability. And again, on a
constant currency basis we're flattish on operating profit.
Singapore, a younger business. It's grown strongly over the last two years, particularly in
partnership with DBS there. With the wranglings [ph] you can't really see those average
reserves growing over that period of time, but that coming through and generating
operating profits and now a positive contribution on operating capital generation.

Bloomberg Transcript

So a couple of comments on a big picture from our profit drivers. What we've got on here
is broadly flat income. Unit-linked down a bit, as I said. Spread margin up a bit. And slightly
lower expenses as we've managed that, and that's obviously a theme with our simplify
program that we'll be looking to drive these numbers down going forward. And this is
really reasonably broad-based, but particularly in the UK business again. Underwriting
margin pretty consistent again, pretty broad-based. New business income, slightly lower
volumes, as I talked to, but slightly higher pricing as well. So our new business margin,
valued divided by APE, is up a couple of percent in the first six months.
In terms of investment return, again you see here, unit-linked reserves down 10%. There's
about 5% in the UK, which is pretty much all market values, quite a lot of which has come
back in the first six months. More like 15% in Europe, which is a bit of FX, again a bit of
market value, a little bit of net flows, but mainly market values and FX. Then you can see
offsetting that in the annuity income, if you like, higher volumes in the UK as we've grown
our annuity book, and really a big increase in the spread margin as we continue to push
the US back book for profit. Our return on shareholder assets, obviously that reflects
slightly lower investment income, so investment yields, and slightly lower income from the
reattributed estate.
Turning to General Insurance, as I say, a slightly better than expectations result. Managed
to grow profit, notwithstanding losing GBP50 million from the RAC and higher weather
cost this year versus last year, really coming from our two big businesses, the UK and
Canada, which had a really standout result. Again we've tried to do the rec just to be
moderately helpful there. Weather impact was about GBP40 million in the UK versus,
again versus last year, and other, which is mostly related to Ireland.
Business unit by business unit, if you ignore -- adjust for the impact of selling the RAC, the
UK's up about 17% profit-wise even after those higher weather costs.
What you've got going on there is, again, strong performance on personal lines. All the
personal lines in the mid 90s. Continued growth of personal motor, so we added about
another 185,000 policies in the first six months, up to about 2.4 million in-force policies on
motor now, and again particularly reflecting the success of Quote Me Happy and multicar

insurance. We also saw a nice improvement on commercial lines. If you remember last
year's commercial lines combined was about 105; it's now down to 101. And particular
improvement in commercial motor where we've taken a lot of rating and risk selection
actions.
Canada posted a great result at 90% combined ratio. Operating profit's up nearly 50%
versus last year. A little bit of a reserve release in Canada. But mainly we introduced what
we think are proprietorial [ph] underwriting and pricing techniques in Canada. And that
particularly has seen evidence in our motor and household results in Canada, so a terrific
result there.
Partially offset by the results of our smaller General Insurance businesses. And again
something that we're very focused on, just to improve the results of those smaller
businesses, and that's definitely part of David's program.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the profit drivers for GI, just a couple of things really. Commission ratio slightly higher.
That really is just the impact of pulling out the RAC which had no commissions. And the
claims ratio lower. If you go back two or three years, that was more like 67% a few years
ago, so that's really the evidence of the improvement of the general insurance result over
that time.
Our operating capital generation, a pretty simple story really, up about GBP100 million
versus last year. The in-force generated is very consistent, about GBP1 billion from Life,
about GBP300 million from General Insurance, and we've consumed less cash in new
business. If you remember going back a couple of years, we had about GBP1.5 billion as
our annual run rate for new business capital consumed and we're down to actually a bit
less than GBP400 million now, both less volume to a capital-intensive business and our
overall efficiency percentage improving as well.
Just turning then to the bottom line and really I guess the bit to talk about here is the
goodwill amortization point there, goodwill write-off point. So on the back of going
through the work that we described to you on July 5, the key point that we made in that
was around capital allocation and allocating capital to the most profitable parts of the
business. Obviously that means allocating capital away from other parts of the business,
whether they be things in non-core or whether they be some of the things in improve.
So as you allocate less capital to the future, that means lower profit streams, which means
as you assess goodwill recoverability, that has some different impacts for it. So as we
went through that exercise, there were two adjustments. A very small goodwill
adjustment in Italy and a larger on for the US, where we deemed on the back of that the
goodwill was no longer recoverable and therefore we wrote it down. It is literally no more
or less than that. It is no -- not designed to be a write-down to market value or anything
like that. And I think we've got the US now on the books, David, at net assets of around
about 2.3 billion -- something like 2.3b.
That then obviously is the major movement in the net asset values. You've got profits
flowing through and then the impact of around 30p of the goodwill write-down.

FINAL

Just on capital then, couple of things to pick up. If you pro-forma, if you allow me to proforma the impact of selling down Delta Lloyd, which we did just after the half year, the
ratios improved to 142% or about GBP4.7b. The improvement from the year end is about
half market movements and about half actions we've taken.
On the market movements, I at least was interested in we've got a positive coming
through from there which was different from the direction of travel from a couple of our
competitors. I think the reason for that is we've obviously got a positive impact of slightly
lower spreads, but we're not as impacted by lower interest rates in terms of economic
capital movements.
Second thing in terms of management actions, we said to you that we'd try and take, as
we grow our capital base, that'll come from both disposals, but also a series of, I think I
said, clever things that John Lister will do. So he's done some clever things in the first half;
not enough yet. So these are small credit risk reductions, small amounts of reinsurance,
that kind of thing, obviously as well as the impact of selling down Delta Lloyd. As of today,
that ratio's still about 142%, John, isn't it?
IGD, pretty stable, GBP3.1 billion or 150%. As of today that's about 160%, partly reflecting
the impact of the Delta Lloyd sell-down.

Bloomberg Transcript

On sensitivities, we published our sensitivities to economic capital on July 5. They're
basically unchanged from that date.
The other topic in terms of capital volatility is the volatility in IGD. Obviously Delta Lloyd
now being less than 20% takes out one source of volatility.
The other one just to update on is the now introduction of Regulamento 43, I'm sure
somebody can say that better than me, Regulamento 43, which in Italy removes the
volatility of Italian government bond spreads moving around from Solvency 1. So you do
not count that volatility in your Solvency 1 ratios going forward. So that last year was quite
a big source of volatility for us. Just by way of a reminder, Italy's about, what, GBP720
million of our net assets, so about 6% of our Group net asset value and about 6% of our
Group operating profit.
More broadly on the overall program, John talked to this, we laid out our GBP400 million
cost-saving program. It's pretty much on track. We've announced level five of the seven
layers; we did that this week. And we're on track over the next few weeks and we'd hope
to finish that by about October for level six then seven.
Ireland transformation is on track. And we're putting in place very specific plans for each
of the 58 cells. For 16 of those were deemed non-core. One of them, Delta Lloyd. We
know what happened there. For 10 of them we've got banks appointed to help us exit
those markets. And for the last five there's a variety of actions we're taking. The one most
specifically we can talk about is stop -- we've already stopped writing the larger bulk
purchase annuity deals and we'll look at various other options, both front book and back
book for those other five cells.

FINAL

In summary then, I think operating performance generally pretty much in line with
expectations. GI coming through pretty strongly. Higher restructuring costs as we're
getting on with the Simplify program. Capital strength pretty stable, but obviously this is
an area that we're continuing to focus on over the next months and into the future. And
the environment does remain challenging, but we have a plan and we're on track with the
delivery of it.
So we'll now open it up to Q&A. Right, I think we've got our usual roving mics [ph] in the
audience. Nick, do you want to?

Questions And Answers
Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Nick Holmes, Nomura. A couple of questions. Firstly is on the US. I'm a bit surprised by the
improvement in the annuity margin, especially in the low interest rate environment and
also the strong growth in sales. And I just wondered if you can give us a bit more color
about the competitive environment and whether you think the level of performance is
sustainable.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then turning to the -- turning to Solvency II, wondered if you could give us an update on
the matching adjustment debate, whether you think that satisfactory resolution is likely on
this. There seem to be different views on this.
And also whether your decision not to write the large bulks is connected with your views
on this. Thank you.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes. Good question. Shall I take those? On US annuity market, the, obviously the lower
interest rate environment has quite a big impact generally across the market for all
players in our part of it, which as you remember is equity indexed annuity market.
Generally pricing is moving broadly in concert, so everybody's doing the same type of
actions, whether you're Aviva or Allianz or some of the local players as well.
In terms of volumes, we put through a pricing change earlier in the year. And the way that
happens particularly in that market is there's -- people know you're making -- you post
that you're going to make a pricing change so everybody buys the product before it's
changed, so you get a little bit of a, if you like, a volume surge. Therefore over the course
of the year, the remainder of the year, I would expect annuity volumes to be a bit lower
than they were last year.
In terms of the back book, yes, we're very focused on, whilst maintaining decent levels of
customer retention, just squeezing out a little bit of margin off the back book. And we've
been able to do that successfully without really any change to the retention levels.

FINAL

On Solvency II, obviously they weren't able to reach agreement in the trialogue [ph]
process in July. I think the use of some form of matching adjustment I think is a given in
the program, and that would be astonishing if that was removed.
Part of the debate that was how broad that extends and I think my view is there are some
countries wanted to extend that more broadly across products that have --- where you
can lapse, and there were parts of the trialogue that were uncomfortable with that and
didn't believe that met the principles of Solvency II. And I think that's one of the key
debates to have is do you have a more narrow one that meets UK/Spanish, or do you
have a broader one where you can say these block of cash flows are relatively certain so
you can apply it to those cash flows? And that's one of the key debates. That's one of the
key parts of this impact assessment they'll go through over the next few months.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

And sorry, the last question on BPAs.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

On BPAs? Yes and no. Obviously we're mindful of possible impacts of Solvency II, but I
think the -- I think you've got a pretty good rule for how it's going to impact UK annuities. I
think the debate is generally around the other products and more Continental Europe.
And I think our view was much more dictated by the -- our own economic capital view of it.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

Yes. The return is zero, economic return, so it's no-brainer.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

But I think most companies would say it depends on the case, the ---

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

One company I think would say that.

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

We generated our -- we're working on a weighted average, long-run weighted average
cost of 9% and that's what they generate. There's no excess returns.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

I think as an overarching statement we are looking for a balance of risk income, annuity
income. That's definitely going to form part of our income streams and a balance of
savings-type income, slightly lower capital-intensive. We believe as you do that there are
much better returns in the individual annuities than there are in the big bulk.
Andy, do you want to?

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, hi. Ashik Musaddi from JP Morgan. Just a couple of questions. One, your individual
annuity sales increased significantly quarter on quarter. Can you put some color on pricing
there?
And secondly, the reserves in France, life reserves in France have gone down significantly,
I guess partly due to ForEx. But can you give us some color on the outflows and the
impact of that on that? Thank you.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks. Yes. As you know, we've -- there's two bits of the individual annuity market
we've been successful on, obviously converting our existing pension customers into
annuity customers and historically we've been also successful in wining probably close to
40% of the open market option going there. Our returns on the individual annuities have
been extremely strong, north of 30% and I think that's still true to date, John, isn't it? So
the returns on individual annuities remain extremely strong. What you're balancing there is
just moderating the amount of credit risk and overall capital you want to take on in the
business. But the returns remain strong.

Bloomberg Transcript

Within France, as you say, yes, part of the movement in reserves is really -- is foreign
exchange. The other part then is -- retention in the first half of the year is better than it
was in the last half of 2011. We saw some outflows in the back half of 2011. Our creditor
rate on, particularly on the AFER product now, is competitive. It's not the best, but it's
competitive in the market and that's given us more stable retention levels in the first half.
Andy, do you want to --

Q - Unidentified Participant
Yes. Couple of questions would be good. The first one was on General Insurance
investment income. I think I asked you the same question at the year end and you were
pretty confident that investment income in the GI side wasn't actually coming down. It
doesn't actually seem to have come down so fair play to you. But I'm just wondering
what's going and where it is from now, because I think you said at the year end the
reinvestment rate was something like 3% and your peers -- sorry, 3.5%, and your peers
who said 3% have now reduced that to 2% for new money. So I'm just wondering what's
your view on that component of the earnings stream would be going forward.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes. New money, Clifford, what would you say?

A - Clifford Abrahams

{BIO 7425676 <GO>}

About 3%.

About 3%. We've got bigger assets back in it as well is the other thing. In the UK we've
probably got another GBP700 million or GBP800 million versus a year ago partly, as you
know, as we've grown the motor book. That's slightly longer duration than some of the
other book as well. So it's a combination of those.

FINAL

Oliver, do you want to?

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Oliver Steel, Deutsche Bank. Just a couple of questions. First is, okay, so you've written off
the US Life goodwill, but you haven't really written off anything in Europe and particularly
not in Spain. So I was just wondering about the rationale for that. The simple answer is
obviously that you see no need to do it, but I wonder if you could give us perhaps a little
bit more detail in your thinking on that.
The second question is on restructuring costs. Perhaps you'd just give us a little bit more
detail on how you expect the timing of that to develop beyond this year.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, good question. On the Spain one, yes, you've got a couple of things going on there.
Obviously we have one arrangement that's going through the arbitration process on
Bankia so I probably won't comment a lot more on that individual case. On the other
arrangements, we've got lower sales, not as profound as they are in Bankia; they're mid
teens. The profitability remains strong on that. The IRRs are still mid teens, maybe upper
teens on new business. We're seeing a little bit lower volumes.
So the key -- one of the decisions you make is how long will that last? What are volumes in
the future? If they stayed at today's volumes, is that okay? And the broad answer is it's a
good business. It's very efficient. New business profitability remains good and therefore
the goodwill remains recoverable. That's the broad answer.
On restructuring costs very much what we are trying to do is get as much as possible
done this year. So you've got two bits to that. You've got the simplification program.
There is probably a little bit of that will go into next year David I would say. Much lower
amounts than we are talking about this year. Then similarly Solvency II where again similarly
we need to finish most of that this year, partly for our own sanity and partly to make sure
the costs don't flow much into next year. So I think 2014 you really should expect not much
at all, a little bit into '13 but a lot less than this year.

Yes, one of the things we are not using much discretion here when it comes to goodwill
impairment. We are actually doing what we are required to do and reassess them. And
we've reassessed them all at the half, and we've done what we are required to do
basically. It's as simple as that.

James, do you want to go next?

Q - James Pearce

FINAL

Morning. James Pearce from UBS. A couple of questions. First of all on the disposal
program, can you tell us are you more, less or about as confident as you were a month
ago as to executing the disposals?
Second, can you talk about cash flow from your European businesses? Are you able to get
cash out of those businesses? Are you paying dividends to the parent from them? Are
you being required to put cash in?
Then thirdly in Ireland I notice you blame the deterioration on the weather, but in the
detail it's come through the motor account. What's going on, on the non-life in Ireland?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Okay. Alright, shall I take two and three? Do you want to do number one?

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. There is a month gone by therefore we know more than we did a month ago. And so
our confidence level is higher than it would have been a month ago because we know, we
actually know more. We've got more certainty on what's happening.
Some of the smaller ones we're well on with and hopefully we'll get some
announcements pretty soon on those. The bigger ones we have more information, we
know who the potential buyers are and so again that's progress. So we made more
progress. We know more. The certainty is increasing. The uncertainty is obviously price
and that's what we are working through, and ultimately we'll end up negotiating that.
We're not at that stage yet. We are in some of the smaller ones.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

I'll take the last two then. On Ireland that was more factually noting the weather has been
higher, but the weather has been higher for three out of the last four years in Ireland, so
whether that's a good explanation or not.
There's two things we need to do in Ireland and the team is very focused on. One is
reducing the cost base and we're part of the way through that. So it's certainly not
showing up in the results yet. That's really going to flow through and to start happening in
2013. But we've taken out a lot of expense because our expense ratio's at least 10 points
too high. But it's not just expense. There's some capabilities. There's some things we are
better at risk selection in, in the UK business than we are in Ireland and that's a little bit
manifest in the results as well.
On the dividends, yes, in 2011 our operating capital generation was pretty good in all of
the countries and that allowed us to flow dividends out of all of our major businesses with

Page 12 of 24

Date: 2012-08-09

FINAL

the exception of the ones in the eurozone.
So as you go through, and hopefully a little bit clearer you can see this, operating profits
turning into operating capital generation, that's working pretty well in most businesses.
Operating capital generation turning into dividends, that's worked pretty well in all our
businesses historically. The kind of check you do is, what's the regulatory environment and
what's the macro environment, does that allow you to translate operating capital
generation into dividends? Last year in the second half of 2011 that was more difficult than
the eurozone, candidly, in Italy, Spain and to a certain extent France.
As part of our performance improvement as we go forward we are very focused on
positioning not just those countries but all of them to really translate the operating capital
generation into dividends. So again in UK Life we're looking for actually much higher
dividend flows, and that's part of the reason we are talking about the proportion of
annuities, and certainly bulk purchase, and certainly in France, Spain and over time in Italy
as well. So it was more of an issue in 2011. We're expecting that to be less so as we go
forward.

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I might say something more about disposals. When you think about what is it we're trying
to achieve here, clearly we're running the organization really from a 2014 onwards view,
and trying to get the run rate 2014 and beyond as high as we can get it. That's the
essence of what we are trying to do and that's important.
And in that context clearly the Company is going to get a little smaller. Earnings are going
to go down from the things that we dispose of. But at the same time we've got some
positive forces. We've got a cost reduction program. We've got tighter capital
management within the Group. By that point in time we'll have probably finished with
Solvency II implementation cost because we want to be ready by the end of 2013. So that
will roll off and -- most of it will roll off; some of it will continue. Our expenses are clearly
going to be lower and restructuring costs will have been taken care of. And so there's a
lot of moving parts there, but so we are working back from 2014.
But there are two other priorities here. One is about financial strength and that is in the
short run by far the most important priority. It's the thing that shareholders have said to us
that they want fixed as a primary objective. That's the thing. The second object of course
is to generate enough profits and then cash flows in order to cover the dividend. And I've
partly covered that just in my previous comments.
And so building that capital strength is really fundamental. And clearly this is not a great
market in which to dispose of assets, everybody knows that. On the other hand we are
reasonably confident it's not going to get a lot better anytime soon and so holding on and
waiting isn't really strongly in our minds either. But the trade-off is going to be the price
that we get and any write-off against book or tangible book versus an enormous capital
benefit. Its enormous the capital benefit that we get. Broadly it would take us right into
the beginning of our range, all other things being equal if it all goes to plan.

FINAL

So we're going to have to make some trade-offs at some point in time going forward, but
we understand the logic of what we are dealing with and we understand the priorities of
what the shareholders are telling us that they want us to deal with. And so clearly excess
returns going forward by repositioning the Group, having enough cash flow and cover to
sustain the dividend. But in the very short run its about capital and so we're just getting on
with that.

Hi, thanks. Andy Broadfield from Barclays. Just a bit more clarity on the capital position, on
the economic solvency position. You've given us the walk from yearend to the half, but it's
come down from the last disclosure. I think 145 I think was the number. I don't know if that
was an approximate number when you last disclosed it, but it was 145 at Q1 I think.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andy Broadfield

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

And if you take out Delta Lloyd business you've had about 4, 5percentage points decline
in the quarter. I was wondering whether you can explain a little bit about what the main
drivers were there. I appreciate you won't want to do a whole reconciliation, but is that
just a market movements thing?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes. So we were taking some positive actions in the Second Quarter. But you also saw
spreads went out a little bit generally. Obviously Spanish spreads went out a bit more. So
it's mainly a credit spread impact in the Second Quarter, which a reasonable positive in
the first was slightly negative in the second.

Q - Andy Broadfield

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

Okay. Then the second question is just on Solvency II and the progress there because I
think talking to people involved with the project externally I think it's been a difficult
project. I'm sure it has been for everyone, but it's been an expensive project. Just
wondering whether it's where you thought it was going to be in terms of your internal
systems progress on Solvency II because I appreciate it's hugely complex, what the cost
has been, what it's likely to be and the tail on it? I know you want to get it done by end of
-- I thought these things will have a cost tail that will go on for longer than '14, but that's
the plan. So what are the numbers for that please?

A - Pat Regan

FINAL

Okay. We're broadly where we expected to be. Yes it is complex. There's a lot of things
you have to do. In a dramatic over-simplification, you need to build a super-industrialized
robust model that can calculate things really quickly and in a very efficient manner across
your group using economic capital principals in a much more, as I say, industrialized way.
So there is a systems element to that on both the Life and GI side. That's broadly going
according to plan. We are using the same tools that most of the market are using in terms
of the systems we are using for that.
The second bit then is ingraining deeply the use of economic capital and how you make
decisions across the business. And that then flows into your use test [ph], it flows into
your model application stuff. You can see when we did the July 5, that's very much at the
heart of how we are running the business. So in many ways I actually feel quite good that
we are well positioned, that it's clear to everybody that we are using economic capital and
how we run the business because that's how we presented it.

Bloomberg Transcript

So I think we are broadly on track with those. But the bit I would say is its costing a lot of
money. It's costing probably more money than we thought when we started. There's a
resource shortage in a few areas that is the same for us as it is probably for other
companies, particularly on the actuarial side that means it costs you an arm and a leg for
certain specialist resource. So I'd say we'll probably spend as much again in the second
half as we did in the first half.
From then it is really important in lots of senses that we transition to a BAU mode. So what
we are doing in each of our teams is setting up, here is our model for how we operate
Solvency II just in a normal mode and we're building that into our plans whether you are in
the UK GI or UK Life or whatever. So the bulk of it this year, but second half is probably
going to be similar to the first half.

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

Clearly we've got enough understanding of economic return and capital allocation to our
businesses that we can sharpen that up of course. But it wouldn't cost anything like this
amount of money to do it. So if this was voluntary we wouldn't make this investment
because we can already do what we need to do, perhaps maybe do it a little better.
The other reason we need to get it done by 2013, other than we're required to do it by
2013, is we want to get it out of the way and get on with what we really need to be doing
in the business. And so we really need to get it out the way. And so we're not going to
slow it down. If there is any delay to the program we'll just get it done in 2013 to draw a
line on it.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks Andy. I think it was Gordon next.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Yes, Gordon Aitken from Royal Bank of Canada. So three questions. Firstly, UK pensions is
bigger than any other country in terms of sales. You said your moving more into the fee
Page 15 of 24



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2012-08-09

business. Can you just let us know what percentage of the sales in the first half are
commission paying?

FINAL

And with the RDR up and coming at the end of this year, what should we expect for
volumes in 2013 in pensions?
Secondly, bulks versus individual annuities. Now you seem to love the individual market but
you're obviously pulling out of the bulk market. But this product, you can think of bulks just
as a collection of individual annuities so is this simply come down to price? Is it a case that
consultants are just keeping the pricing a lot tighter in the bulk market than the individual
market?
And finally just staying on bulks, so you're not writing any new bulks but that in itself is not
going to close the solvency gap for you. We've had a few reinsurance transactions
recently with other companies. Is this something you're looking at?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure. On the first one, yes, so we've increased our workplace savings sales, gosh,
probably more than 100% versus 18 months, two years ago. Most of that's in the smaller
scheme end and some of the developments we are trying to do are to make us equally
successful in the more than 5,000 lives at the bigger scheme end.
As you know, the bigger scheme end, we are winning some of those. And so probably
half of our business is the commission-free business in the larger scale and about half of it
is still commission paying. That's really coming from the larger IFAs versus the larger
consultants. Therefore, logically as you go into 2013, would you expect to see that growth
fall away a little bit before we really ramp up towards enrolment? Yes, I think that's a
reasonable assumption.
On bulk purchase annuities, yes, we said we would stay in the very small end of BPAs
because they do behave much more like pricing of individual annuities. But generally
speaking, yes, at the larger end pricing is much thinner because of the dynamics you
described. That's just the market force.
Individual annuities we do think it's not just about the market pricing. It's also about the
ability. We believe our expense base is lower, we believe the assets we can use make us
more effective and also some of the techniques. The team that run that used to work in
the general insurance business and they brought a lot of the pricing techniques across
from that into the individual annuity business in a way that we think is more sophisticated
than most in the market.

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

I think I'm right is saying that the returns on the individual annuities are actually very
attractive generally. The new business is more attractive than the old back books basically.
But it is attractive and so a rational thing for us to do is to do lots of it because it's very
good.

FINAL

But then you get this other problem which is they're very capital hungry and that's an issue
for us. So if we had excess capital we wouldn't -- could be constrained. The bulk is
different because the prices --the returns are lower. And so we would do much more than
we're doing. The problem is we are making this trade-off between capital and return all
the time and in that sense there has to be some subduing of it even though the market
opportunity is there for us.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

I think your last question, would we look at opportunities to look at back book deals? Yes.
You're sitting next to the right man. So yes, we'll look at that and see if there is an
opportunity there for us. Everybody is looking at you now Jason.
Barrie then I'll come to Andrew.

Q - Barrie Cornes

{BIO 2389115 <GO>}

Morning. It's Barrie Cornes at Penmure Gordon. I just want to talk about GI insurance,
particularly the UK. I think your weather losses were a lot less than some of us going for. A
lot of the floods occurred the last three days in June. Have they been put back into July
some of these claims simply because looking at your market share it's much higher in
homeowners than perhaps one of your large competitors who came up with such a large
figure?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes. I'm not going to comment on their numbers or estimates. Ours is a straight up
number. We don't think there's a lot flowing into July at all, do we, Clifford? So I think our
tell of that tale would be we genuinely think we've got better flood mapping and
therefore risk selection than perhaps others have in the market.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

FINAL

Good morning. It's Andrew Crean here from Autonomous. Could I ask three questions?
Could you give a little bit more color on the timing of the expense savings in which lines
that they'll fall into over which years?
Secondly could you explain a bit more about the GBP4.8 billion of internal financing from
the General Insurance business in the UK? Who are you lending to within the Group, what
is the interest cost and what collateral do those businesses require?
Then thirdly, on your definition of required capital on your economic basis is just your
internal capital. Could you say whether the FSA requires additional buffers, and how big
those are?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Great. Thank you, Andrew. On the timing of the expense savings, what we said on that is
we're in execution mode now so a lot of it --- we're booking the restructuring costs, we're
going through the program, we're working through the delayering the regions, so that's
really 2012. Some of that's then into your run rate as you go into 2013, particularly in the
second half of 2013. Then we're really thinking all elements of that will be in the run rate
going into 2014.
On the intra-divisional balance, as you remember, it's, I think we showed in the appendix
last time, it's a balance between two divisions of one legal entity. So it's not a formal loan
arrangement, perhaps as you said. You've got the General Insurance business and you've
got the other half of the same legal entity so there are no collateral arrangements or
anything like that. It's a notional balance within one legal entity.
Other required capital, I think you asked me the same question actually on July 5, and I'll
give you the same answer, which is it is our assessment of required capital. I hope actually
we are putting out as much detail, at least as much as anybody else in the broad
European markets on that, and more than anybody else in the UK market. It's our
assessment of capital. It's based on the 1 in 200 calibration, plus 1 in 10.
As we've constructed our target capital range we've born in mind a lot of things to be
honest. We've added a bit. Just for kicks we've added an extra buffer. We've added an
extra buffer to say what's happens in various scenarios of sovereign debt, what happens
in various scenarios of pension risk, all of those kind of things. So they've all informed
where we've landed in our target capital range. So that's, but that's how I'd characterize it.

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

I think they're broadly consistent. If we reached where we're trying to get to then we'll be
comfortable, the FSA will be comfortable as well. So that's not -- and as they're lower
we're each as uncomfortable as each other. So in a sense there's not a material
difference here.

You might say something about the mix of the expenses because the first question --

FINAL

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes, so we've got, in our GBP400 million we've got about GBP300m# or so that will be
people related and about GBP100 million or so that's non-staff related. I think actually our
early estimates are we've probably got a bit more --- this done our new targets, just to be
clear. But there is probably a little bit more we can go on, on the non-staff certainly as we
really get into the guts of the program. But that's how it -- the split of the GBP400 million
is about GBP300 million people related, about GBP100 million non-people related.

A - John McFarlane

Thanks. It's Colin Simpson from Goldman Sachs. Could I actually ask your take on genderneutral pricing that's coming in at the end of the year or the beginning of next year? This
is -- could be hugely disruptive. And I imagine with all the management change that's
happened in Aviva and people are worried about their jobs, and you have large market
shares, is it fair to say that you could be one of the big losers from gender-neutral pricing?

A - Pat Regan

We've been entirely gender neutral in our management changes. Sure, it affects
everybody in the market in terms of how you look at risk selection and pricing. We've
been thinking about this for some time, Clifford, haven't we, so I don't know whether you
want to grab the microphone and just add.

{BIO 2001261 <GO>}

This is not a problem. There are some countries around the world that had already had
gender-neutral pricing of course. We've got teams of people not just in the UK but in
some of the continental countries as well who've been working on this for some time. And
they've got good plans in place and we're very confident that we'll do very well out of
this. In fact we're looking to be one of the winners. Don't forget we've got this strong
analytic capability which helps us also as we look at rating through a different set of lenses
going forward. So we're in good shape I think.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Thanks Trevor. Andy, then we'll come to Jon.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Great, three questions if I could. The first one is about the breakdown of IFRS operating
profit. Could you possibly break it between core and non-core or at least ongoing and
non-sustainable just to see how the core and improving bit is actually moving over time?

Bloomberg Transcript

Second point is unrealized gains in the IGD. I think John said you might have answered that
question in the July 5 if I asked it so I am definitely going to ask you now. So how much of
the IGD surplus related to unrealized gains in the French business?
And the third question was about following on from Oliver's question. Some companies
include the goodwill in Spain in their IGD surplus. Do you do that? And if you were to write
off the -- you know, okay.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes. No on the last one. There's no goodwill, certainly obviously there's no goodwill
impact from the US either, but there would be none if we reassessed Spain.
I think I told you last time that we weren't going to give country by country IGDs. I'll give
you the same answer on that. I think it's order of magnitude around EUR1 billion that kind
of order of magnitude, so maybe I did give you the answer on that.
I think what we'll do, we -- it's a good question on the core/non-core. What I think we'll do
is we'll -- our intention will be to do that at year end. Just was a little bit quick this time
around to do the split of core versus non-core and how they are trending over time. So
that is something we've a mind to do Andy, but not at the half year. We'll probably pick
that up at the yearend.
Jon?

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Yes, morning. Jon Hocking from Morgan Stanley. I've got three questions please. Can you
remind us of what the cross-border holdings are of Italian and Spanish debt at the end of
Page 20 of 24



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2012-08-09

the first half ? That's the first question.

FINAL

Second question, the revised performance objectives for management, can you talk a
little bit about how that varies compared with existing score card? Then what do you do?
Presumably you can't change this in the middle of the year. How do you make sure
everyone is sort of pointing in the right direction given they might assessed on something
else for the rest of calendar year 2012?
Then the third question. On UK commercial lines, could you give us a little bit of a running
commentary sort of segment by segment where pricing is, where volume is, how you see
rate etc?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Sure. Why don't I -- I'll pick off one and three and then I'll let John talk to the objectives.
On the cross-border, it's still -- our Italian holdings -- Spanish holdings are primarily in
Spain. We've got a tiny bit in France. On Italian holdings in pound terms we've got
somewhere between GBP1 billion and GBP1.5b. It's close to GBP1.5 billion cross-border
and the rest of it is domestic in Italy.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the UK commercial lines the area we've seen the most price increase is in commercial
motor. It's one of the reasons we've been able to pretty significantly improve the
performance of commercial motor by -- from 113 or so down to 101. We've probably seen,
what, about 6% now, something like that in commercial line rates. But property and liability
is still pretty flat.

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

Yes, on objectives, my own philosophy about this is if you ask somebody to do 16 things
you're asking them to do nothing basically because they'll come back and say I did eight
of them brilliantly and I did eight -- I was weak on these eight. Then you have to say well
so what's that then? And so I like three and although people in Aviva seem to live five,
which is a different matter, so we've been negotiating with each individual.
We have changed them all part of the way during the year because if you think of
objectives, even take the financial ones, which we're not changing the structure of those
because they are the obvious ones that you would think that would be in place including
cash generation and so forth, so they're automatically there. However, when you put a
plan together historically we'd have put that plan together starting about now for next
year.
The problem with that is as soon as you produce the document it's a complete waste of
time because time has moved on. By you get to December it's not worth anything. So
we're delaying the start of that to later in the year so that we've got more top-down
starting points reinforced by the bottom up to make sure that -- and then we'll iterate it.
As you go through the year you find that the plan that you had in place actually is
productive marginally, but as time goes on you move further and further away from it as
Page 21 of 24

FINAL

new information comes in. And so it's very important that you have a rebalancing process,
or even on the financial targets during the year. And that's something that David's
negotiating with all the individual businesses at this point in time. So there're even going
to be changes not to the structure of that, but to the targets. Because if somebody's
ahead of plan and they say that they're actually going to meet plan, well you need to say - that's not good enough; you're ahead of plan we are going to lock that in; now what are
you going to do?
So one of the changes we've made is we used to do a half year actual and a full year
forecast. And when you do it that way it kind of looks as if you close the whole company
down in the second half when you strip as to -- you take the difference. So we've stopped
doing that. We're now saying that's the first half; what are you going to do in the second
half, and we'll add it up. And so in other words you can't sandbag the second half
forecast. So that's a change we've made.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then finally on individual objectives what I've done with each individual I've asked them to
draft it, but actually I've made quite significant changes to those drafts. So I've asked
them what if, not just in the next six months, but what are the most important things
beyond the financials that you have to deliver for this Company standing back from it?
And it's different for every single individual and certainly the people who report to the
CEO. So it's different. And so basically I've edited it to the extent, changed it to the extent
these are the three or four or five things that each individual has to do to make this
company successful. They then have to cascade that down.
So we've got all those right. They're all qualitative. They're not necessarily all for just the
second half. Some of them might even be through to 2013, 2014, but we'll measure them
on an ongoing basis. You can be assured that these are the things that they have to do.
We will track it. And whatever they do, clearly it's important that they meet their financial
targets, but don't come back and say you haven't met your three or four or five
objectives. That's what we are going to measure you against.
If you have not met them and a reasonable person would have met them, you've failed.
So if you've not met them and a reasonable person because of circumstances outside
your control couldn't meet them then that's fine; you've done exactly what a reasonable
person would have done. And so there's a sort of judgment on how reasonable the
objectives were and how reasonable the progress are, but nevertheless as objective as
we can make it.
And I've had this conversation internal. Failure, material failure on these objectives and/or
your financial objectives is failure. It does mean you cannot stay in that role. And therefore
somebody else, because a reasonable person would have done better, somebody else
would have done better. And therefore that's what it -- that's why we're moving to this
personal accountability. It's really important. And so it's very focused and when you add it
up you get the right thing for the Group, and there are consequences. If you really do
incredibly well then your variable compensation will be linked to that too. So there is a big
upside as well, as well as the downside.

FINAL

I might just -- I know -- I don't want to bore you with this, but we are changing the nature
of how we evaluate people inside the Group. We have a forced ranking now of a 20/75/5
and we've got a nine-box matrix with up here's performance and along here's potential.
We expect in the top three boxes to have 20% of the people roughly, the bottom two
boxes down here on the bottom line we expect 10% of the people, and 70% spread
around the rest of the matrix.
There is an issue here in that the first time, the first cut of that we ran there are 40% of
people in the top 20%. Isn't that interesting? And so our ranking's not very good because
if we have 40% of people really in those top three boxes we wouldn't be performing the
way we are so that can't be right. And so we will readjust that and force it into that
distribution. So we then now know who are the most valuable people to us, who are the
least valuable people.
We're then going to change the differentiation. We're actually going to pay the most
valuable people more than the middle group and more -- so we're effectively placing a
ceiling on average performers and a floor on the most valuable people in actual pay. That
then gears up into the baseline for their bonus so that's even highly geared, and then
that's geared up into their stock allocation. So the most valuable people will be
differentiated and will end up with the most.

Now bonus is slightly different in that it's about how you did this year and that. So there's a
slightly different process but it still a meritocratic basis. So I don't know if that's all helpful,
but that's how we're running the place.

Yes, Marcus from Oriel Securities. Pat, can you explain the GBP90 million increase in the
DAC amortization charge because against GBP1 billion of operating profit that's quite a
material increase. And I note the point you make on page 12 about spread margins in the
US and one-offs in China, but is this the level we should factor in going forward or is it a
one-off in half one '12?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

It's -- the main dynamic there is it's almost automatic. As you make those higher earnings
in the US, particularly driven by the higher spread margins, you get automatically a higher
DAC charge. So it is one goes with the other. So if you assume what I said earlier, that the
higher spread margins are sustainable, then you'd have that higher DAC as well, yes. The
two go hand in hand.
Alright, terrific. Thank you for coming in everybody. Nice to see you all again. Enjoy the
next couple of days. Last bit of the Olympics to enjoy.
