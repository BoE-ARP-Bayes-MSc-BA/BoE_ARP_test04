{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Thank you, Ian. And good morning everyone. Denis sends his regrets today as he is
unable to join us due to the scoreboard in AGM obligations, so let's begin. SCOR delivers
a strong start to the year 2019. Once again, we've demonstrated our value creation
capability by successfully combining profitable growth, good technical profitability and
strong solvency. SCOR wrote approximately EUR 4 billion of gross written premium in the
first quarter. This represents a 2% increase over Q1, 2018 at constant foreign exchange
rates, or approximately 5.7% at current exchange rates. This strong growth was driven by
both business engines. The growth in P&C is excellent. It stands at 16.1% at current FX on
the back of disciplined renewals. With improved profitability and price increases SCOR
Global P&C continues to expand its franchise in the US, the largest P&C market in the
world where we have a unique position to gain market share. At the April renewal, SCOR
Global P&C grew gross written premium by 9.6% at constant FX to EUR 548 million, while
benefiting from broadly improving market conditions. On the Life side, the growth stands
at negative 1.1% at current FX and this is due to the renewal of a financial solutions deal
less fee income under deposit accounting with no impact on profitability. Had these been
renewed, premium growth would have stood at positive 2.5%.
Overall, SCOR delivers strong profitability in Q1. The P&C net combined ratio stands
strong at 94.6% with a nat cat ratio of 6.5%. The normalized net combined ratio stands at
95.1% in line with the Vision in Action assumptions of 95%, 96%. Life technical margin
reached 7.2%. And finally, SCOR Global Investments delivered a return on invested assets
of 2.8% driven by an income yield of 2.7%. Overall, SCOR's net income for Q1 stands at
EUR 131 million, translating into a return on equity of 9% above the Vision in Action target.
In addition, SCOR's solvency position remains very strong at 219% at the end of Q1 and in
the upper end of the optimal range of the solvency scale. SCOR continues to provide an
attractive remuneration policy to its shareholders with a dividend of EUR 1.75 per share,
which will be proposed at the AGM later on this morning.
Going to Page 6, the SCOR Group has seen strong book value growth over the first
quarter with shareholders' equity increasing by 7.7% to EUR 6.3 billion, supported by the
net income of EUR 131 million recorded in Q1. This corresponds to a book value of EUR
33.64 per share. Financial leverage stands at 25.9%, diminishing by 1.6 percentage points
compared to the position at December 31, 2018 and broadly in line with Vision in Action
assumptions.

Let's move to page 7, SCOR generated operating cash flows of EUR117 million during the
quarter. SCOR Global P&C's cash flows reflect the claim payments from 2018 cat events
and SCOR Global Life provides strong cash flow in line with expectations. Overall, the
total liquidity of the Group is excellent and stands at more than EUR 1.4 billion at the end
of March 2019.

FINAL

Now, let me hand over to Jean-Paul who will give you more details on the P&C results.

{BIO 20770277 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you Mark. So the first quarter 2019 has been characterized by excellent growth and
profitability despite some notable ;oss from 2018 cat events. As Mark said, we grew this
quarter at 12.8% at constant rate of exchange on the back of strong growth in the second
half of 2018 and as well as the good renewal we had at January 1 2019. We expected the
premium growth over the rest of the year to normalize and finish in the upper part of the
5% to 8% range that we had provided with Vision and Action. On profitability, thanks to a
strong underlying performance, our combined ratio is at 94.6%, below our 95% to 96&
target, In spite of the 6.5 points of cat. About two-third of this cat impact comes from
developments of 2018 losses, the largest being the Japanese Typhoons Jebi and Trami,
for a total of 3.8 points of cat. This was -- the new loss system that's come from market
revisions based on information we see from Japanese seasons that we received in Q1,
we estimate the market loss to move from USD 7 billion to about USD 11 billion and this is
due to the unusual number of claims as well as the unusual average payment per claim.
One point to note is that any further development in JV will have very limited impact on
SCOR, as most of the additional losses will be seeded to our retro session on JV. Without
these Japanese cat loss developments, our Q1 combined ratio would have been slightly
below 91%, better than Q1 2018. That 81.1%, the attrition plus commission ratio remains
very robust. It's only 0.8 points below the 2018 Q1 ratio, which had a very low level of
manmade losses, whereas this quarter is more to a normal level. On a normalized basis,
our combined ratio stands at 95.1%, within the lower part of the range of 95% to 96%.
Looking now at the April 1 renewals, we had another successful renewal with gross
reinsurance premium up almost 10%. Overall, the market remains disciplined with the
improving market conditions on loss affected contracts.
In Japan, in particular, we saw price increases of mid '20s for loss affected cat XOL
programs and on earthquake contracts more flat to slightly up. The US contracts, which
represent about 20% of the renewals, we had secured significant primary insurance rate
increases into single-digits to a double-digit figure, depending on the lines of business.
Proportional of reinsurance conditions are improving as well, as the reinsurance benefit
from market improvements. There were very few loss affected US Cat programs up for
renewal in April, so price increases on cat XOL business were in single digit, but we
expect a very different outcome for the June, July renewals with many of the loss
affected programs coming up for renewal.
Building on our client focus strategy, we grew our portfolio by 28% with premium
weighted risk adjustment rate increases for this US portfolio of slightly less than 6%. US
and Japanese cat XOL represent a little less than 30% of the premium up for renewal.

The rest of the renewals were very -- much more muted since most of the programs
were not loss affected. So, the overall premium -weighted risk adjusted price increases
resulted in 1.6% of this renewal.

FINAL

On this, I'll turn over to Paolo for the Life presentation.

Paolo De Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Thank you Jean-Paul. At SCOR Global Life, we had a very good start of the year with our
franchise continuing to expand profitably and globally. From a headline number
perspective, we have recorded gross written premiums of EUR 2.3 billion in Q1 2019, a
slight decrease of 1.1% at current exchange rate or 5% at constant exchange rates
compared to prior year. This variation is largely driven by certain financial solution deals,
which had been renewed as fee business rather than as premiums in Q1, 2019. The impact
of this is very simple. On these deals, we're now recording similar amount of profits, and
no headline premiums.
On Appendix page 26, you will find detailed numbers and I'm happy to address this in the
Q&A Excluding these deals, we have grown by 2.5% at constant exchange rates, driven by
the expansion of the franchise in Asia Pacific Protection, US Financial Solutions and
Longevity. Overall, we consider this premium growth as being in line with the Vision in
Action assumptions of 5% to 6% over the cycle. This translates, for 2019 in an expected
normalized growth rate of 2% to 4%, and each of our business is difficult to contain to
calendar year, so we look at growth over the 3 -year period. Yearly growth rates can
fluctuate due to timing of business occurrence between years. On the profitability side,
the net technical result stands at EUR 152 million. The profitability continues to be strong
and technical result from the in-force portfolio remains well in line with expectations and
the new business underwriting continues to exceed the Group ROE target. Our technical
margin stands at 7.2% for the quarter. The renewal of the financial solution deals as fee
deals is adding 40 basis points to this metric. As mentioned at the beginning of my
presentation, on these deals, we're now recording similar amounts of profit on lower
headline premiums. I will now hand it over to Francois for details on our investment
performance.

Francois de Varenne

{BIO 7447858 <GO>}

Thank you, Paolo. Moving on to Slide 12, SCOR's total investment portfolio reached EUR
27.8 billion at the end of March with an invested asset portfolio of EUR 19.6 billion
compared to EUR 19.1 billion at the end of December 2018. The positioning of the
investment portfolio is in line with this Vision in Action target asset allocation. Liquidity
stands at 6% of the invested assets in line with the target level defined for the strategic
plan. The share of corporate bond in the invested asset portfolio is relatively stable at
48%, close to the maximum of 50% defined for the plan. And the duration of the fixed
income portfolio is stable at 4.3 years.
Our fixed income portfolio remains a very high quality with an average rating of A plus and
highly liquid. Indeed at the end of March, expected financial cash flows from the fixed
income portfolio over the next 2 years stand at EUR 5.8 billion, providing strong financial

flexibility and allowing SCOR to seize the investment opportunities. SCOR Global
investments delivered a strong 2.8% return on invested asset in Q1, which is supported by
a solid income yield of 2.7%, continuously increasing since 2016, highlighting the relevance
of the portfolio re-balancing implemented since the launch of Vision in Action. This income
yield includes 20 basis points of positive one-off during the quarter. Our theoretical
reinvestment yield stands at 2.5% at the end of March, down compared to the end of
December level, reflecting primarily, the global decrease in interest rate and the spread
compression of the other past quarter. Under our current market condition, we expect an
income yield for full year of 2019 at 2.5%. This will translate to an annualized return on
invested assets in the 2.7%-3.0% range for full year 2019.
With this, I will hand it over to Ian, for the conclusion of this presentation.

Jean-Paul Conoscente

{BIO 20770277 <GO>}

(Question And Answer)
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We will now take our first question from Kamran
Hossain of RBC, please go ahead.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Alright, good morning everyone. Just one question on the, I guess, the loss environment
in Q1. Clearly a lot of the headlines were driven by the Jebi and Trami when you combine
it. Could you maybe comment about I guess the man-made loss expense you saw in the
quarter. I mean, it feels with a normalized combined, which has improved a bit quarter on
quarter and feels little below and that some has caused last year, that this might have got
better, but any commentary around that would be very helpful. Thank you.

A - Paolo De Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Yes. The man made losses in the first quarter, there was no outstanding loss, the largest
is a liability claim for EUR12 million. The other losses are losses below EUR 10 million, but
there has been a number of them. So the overall aggregate amounts to -- what we see
on a normal basis, it was slightly below EUR 100 million.

Were going to now move to our next question from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca,
please go ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Hi there. Good morning. So just my one question would be on the -- for Francois, on
the investment income, the 2.7% you rightly just said, has 20 bps of one- off, but if I could
just suggest, I mean there has been several quarters with these one off, how should we
think of -- are these one off truly one offs are they difficult to predict. And is there a
reason why we should be more bullish on the investment income and the ordinary sides
and equally, is -- I noticed realized gains were also quite low. Is there a change from the
past where there was a bit more active strategy versus ordinary income. Can you just
comment on these topics please? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Francois de Varenne

{BIO 7447858 <GO>}

Yes. So, on the income yield and the 20 bps of one-off, during this quarter those one off
are coming mostly from dividends on private equity funds, real estate funds and
infrastructure funds, so it's a positive news. So that's dividend that we expect, but it's
always difficult to predict the timing when the fund give the dividend back to the investor.
So it could be recurring, but it's difficult to predict. So that's why we still normalize the
income yield for the full year 2019 at 2.5%. In terms of program of realization of capital
gain for 2019 you should expect, in the second part of the year some contribution from
the real estate portfolio. We started the sell process of a few mature assets, and that will
be sold by end of the year, so you should expect contribution in Q3 or Q4 this year.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

Alright, thank you.

The next question comes from Vikram Gandhi of Societe Generale.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Hello, hi. Morning everybody. The one question from me would be, can you just give us a
feel on the rate increases for April renewals. I mean would you say the figures in general
to SCOR as well as the industry as somewhat disappointing given the sever loss seen on
the typhoon losses?

FINAL

A - Paolo De Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Yes. So that's really a fragmented market, so it kind of depends on the segment you're
talking about, and the way that segment in everyone's portfolio. So for the Japanese cat
XOL programs, the rate increase, on average, is about 15%, well that's what we're saying
20% to 27%, 28% on the wind exposed layers and flat to slightly up on earthquake
exposed layers. On the rest of the Japanese programs, these are earth quake quota
shares and other lines of business. The rates were flat or slightly up. So the weighted
average of that really depends on the makeup of the portfolio.
For the US, the cat XOL renewals were, I'd say, 2% to 3%, because they were not loss
affected programs. On the other lines of business, it was really primary rates driving the
rate increases with slight improvements on the terms and conditions for reinsurers. And
then for the rest, India for SCOR is a big portfolio, about the same size overall then to
Japan. And there are those two large portfolios, one is property, one is agriculture.
Property, we saw a slight price improvements, for agriculture, we saw slight price
decreases and also large uncertainties around the longevity of this team as it stands
today. So, for those three main markets, we grew in Japan 15%, we grew our portfolio in
the US 20 some-percent, and we shrunk our portfolio in India about 6%. So if you look at
the projections going forward. The June, July renewals are really dominated by the US.
The US overall increases without contribution from the cat XOLs had an average price
increase around 6%. We expect the US cat programs that are loss affected to renew at
double-digit rate increases. So the overall premium weight adjusted for the June, July
renewals should be high single-digit, low double digits overall.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Laurent Rousseau

{BIO 19524847 <GO>}

And maybe if I may add, it's Laurent Rousseau here speaking for the -- on the rate
changes, there is quite a contrast between the large commercial lines and some of the
more standard lines of business on the insurance side and for SCOR Business Solutions,
when we look at and single risk insurance, our rate increase was actually, on average,
close to double digits. And those are led really by energy globally and property in the US
where we see rates really reacting. And that's a function of first claims activity in the past
12 months or so. And second, a real change in risk appetite from some of the very large
leaders in the market, and that displacement is creating some pretty interesting rate
changes on the primary side.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi there. Not to leave him out, I've got a question for Paolo, just on the, I wondered if you
could give us a bit more color on the biometric experience in the book, in the life book in
Page 7 of 14



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2019-04-26

Q1? I'm thinking on an IFRS basis, but also on the S II basis. If there was any kind of change
in assumptions or anything, just general color on the underlying biometric to the mortality
experience particularly in the US? Thanks.

FINAL

A - Paolo De Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Yeah, Biometric experience excluding the US was good, in line with expectations or I will
say, even better in some areas. The US continues to show some challenge on that
benefits comparable to what we have experienced in some other programs. (Technical
difficulty) Sorry there was some noise in the -- just noise in the background, that was, so
echoes was equaled my voice. Experienced largely during this time around for pure
volatility age bracket at the relatively young ages, this was more than offset by measures
that were taken to improve rates in some of the contracts as we've done in the past. So,
you shouldn't expect any big variations either from IFRS 4 or Solvency 2 to probably
slightly positive for the quarter.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Yes, good morning, everybody. My question is on the EUR 200 million one-off from the SE
merger. I would be interested what kept you in deploying it right now and let us wait until
the September especially as obviously your current share price does not -- do not reflect
of what you seem to view as a right price?

A - Paolo De Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Yeah. Frank, as you correctly pointed out, we're waiting for Investors Day on September
because we're unveiling the next strategic plan. So we're looking at this in a more longterm context of seeing where we can deploy capital accretively against our next plan. So I

beneficial to shareholders.

FINAL

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just a brief one, was
there any impact from remodeling of loss exposures at the April renewals because if I
remember correctly, you don't include that in your price change? I mean, I guess I was
particularly thinking of Japan, where there was quite a lot of loss, now it's a well modeled
exposure, but given the amount of the lost, just questioning that. Thank you.

A - Jean-Paul Conoscente

{BIO 20770277 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. So yes, indeed, we revised our approach for Japan. The pricing
approach we use is a combination of experience and exposure, given the experience
change from the 2018. losses, our expected annual loss on average increased about 3%.
So that would be the effect from the remodeling for the Japanese -- the Japanese cat
XOL programs. For the rest of the port there has been no significant remodeling.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Okay. So at the aggregate level, is there any way of giving any stare of how much the
offset would have been against the price increase on 1.6

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paolo De Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Well the -- so, on the cat XOL, the price increase is about 15% currently, and then you
would need to add probably another two points to that to compare it to last year.

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi there, morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, just reading the industry press, it
does sound like things are starting to get better now, especially in Lloyd's and E&S. I
guess just thinking at the mid-year renewals, previously when we've got glimmers of hope
on pricing alternative capitals come in and flooded the market. So what are you seeing
that you think that this time we are actually seeing some sustainable and incremental
improvement or will alternative capital compete away? Thank you .

FINAL

A - Paolo De Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

It's hard to predict what our competitors will do. But that being said, as you said, I think as
price improve on the reinsurance side, it's likely that there'll be new capital coming in
either in our direct form or as support to existing reinsurers. I think one of the positive
benefits we see today is the improvement not just on the reinsurance side, but also on
the insurance itself and there, additional capital really should have less of an effect on our
reinsurance. So we feel as long as the primary market continues to improve, which it does
to start making technical profit again, that would be a positive for everyone involved in the
market.

The next question comes from Thomas Fossard of HSBC

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, everyone. Quick question for you on the P&C read, just wanted to
come back on the evolution of the attritional -- net attritional loss ratio or the -- I mean,
whatever you think is the best and that's a general ratio plus commission ratios. But
looking at the trend Q1 '19 versus Q1 '18 or Q1 '19 versus full year. seems to be that the
attritional loss ratios is deteriorating a bit. Just want to understand why this is the case as
you mentioned that the man-made loss years were pretty -- I would say subdued
compared to last year. And also we should have, I would say the benefit of a slightly
better price increase coming through your numbers. So is this just a matter of composition
of the portfolio or is there any I would say, other effect on the technical margins impacting
the attritional loss ratio that we should have in mind for the upcoming quarters? Thank
you.

A - Paolo De Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Yes. So compared to Q1 2018, it was an unusually low overall quarter from a combined
commission plus attritional. So comparing to Q1 2018, probably gives a view a skew view. If
you view it on a normalized basis, taking you Q1, 2018 on a normalized basis with six
points of cat, that would have been a 93.8% combined ratio, which is below the 95% to
96%. If you go back to the 95%- 96% range, which is our normalized view and you kick out
seven points of cat, you get back to an attritional that is in the range of what we have
today. And so what we've done is, despite the increase of the cat budget from six to
seven from last year to this year, we've kept the attritional loss ratio pretty much the
same, which is a reflection of the price improvements that we see in the primary market
and therefore an overall improvement on the combined ratio.

FINAL

So going forward, we expect the 81.1% which is the sum of the commission and the
attritional loss ratio to be more or less the range of which we can expect going forward
on a normalized basis. And the reason why we do the sum for the low is it will have some
very large contracts that have slight commissions, so as the loss ratio increases, the
commission decreases and vice versa. So just looking at one and the other separately,
gives a -- sometimes a wrong view and it's better to add the two together.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Does that makes sense, thank you. So no, specific change in the portfolio mix explaining, I
mean, any evolution, so we should think about things being stable in the coming quarters

A - Paolo De Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Yes. Assuming a normal man-made loss activity, we would expect the other quarters to be
similar to this one.

The next question comes from Michael Haid of Commerzebank.

Q - Michael Haddad

{BIO 21007634 <GO>}

Good morning. Just a general question on reinsurance pricing and the dynamics of this
pricing, looking at your 1 April renewals, the price increases were significant in loss
affected lines, so plus 15% on Japanese net cat business, which is 10% of the portfolio, of
the renewed portfolio. So the other business was almost flat and I try to interpret this
figures from a more longer -term perspective, it seems to me that the price sensitivity to
this loss occurrence has increased over the past, I don't know 10 years or so. If there are
no losses, we see significant pricing pressure. If we see losses, we see significant price
increases. So my question is, has the sensitivity to this loss occurrence, has increased
overtime as prices become more reactive over the past 10 years maybe due to improved
modeling or increased competition.

I think it's a result of a much more fragmented reinsurance market. It's very difficult today
to impose price increases in a region that has not been affected by losses. I think as
reinsures, we tried to do that in 2018 following the '17 losses, and had a very strong push
back on regions outside of the US in And the Caribbean. And so in 2019, I think reinsures

are taking a much more prudent approach depending on the loss performance of the
treaties and this includes some of the very large global players that had the same
difficulties, as we had. So I think it's a characteristic of the market, as well as, including loss
affected programs that have significant price increases, a number of players that were not
necessarily affected come in and want to get on the bandwagon as well and are willing to
offer slightly lower prices to get part of the benefit. So this is the current market dynamic,
and that explains why with losses that it's still significant, but for the reinsurance industry,
it's still very manageable, that the price shift is still very segmented by just the markets
affected.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Yes, thanks for taking my follow-up question. A question for Paolo on the impact of this
financial solution deals, can you just walk us through on where we find the impact in your
P&L as it's no longer booked as written premiums. So where would be the fee income be
seen and also whether this affect your target range for the margin?

A - Paolo De Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

so you look at page 26 of the appendix. And that gives you a sense of the size of the
changes. So very basically, on your models, you should remove the gross written premium
and the net earned premium as listed on Page 26, and that should give you the right
impact of this change by leaving -- by making no changes to the technical result line.
In terms of, in which line item in the P&L is this recognized, if you look at the DDR, the
disclosures here, it is included in the technical result. In the consolidated income
statement, the fee is included in the line item, other income and expenses while in the
segmental information, it is shown in the line item, revenues associated with financial
reinsurance contracts.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Okay, perfect. And has that an effect on your margin target?

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

What we think right now, when we look at the margin target is, what we have now 7.2%,
around that margin is what we expected -- we expect to have for the remaining of the

year, at least up to when we update our assumptions at the new strategic plan
announcement in September. To remind that the technical margin for us is not a target it's
really an assumption of the underlying Group target, but is not a target in itself.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Good morning, thanks for the chance. Just on the US Casualty piece, the sort of 41%
growth in the US you've mentioned here from new business in US Casualty. Is it a change
because of line repricing? Is there a change, first of all, driven by more positive view of
line repricing. I'm just curious about that growth number. You did mention it was also
driven by the primary rates as well, but just any more commentary on casualty. Thank you.

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Sure. The US premium up for renewal April 1 is fairly small compared to the portfolio, it's
about a EUR 100 million. So to achieve the growth, it doesn't take a lot of additional new
treaties. And this renewal, we grew on to 2 new treaties; one which was a program that
we had been targeting that we finally entered this year. Another one was an existing client
who restructured his program from an excessive loss to a proportional treaty. And
therefore, there was premium increased due to that.
Overall, we remain optimistic on the primary rate increases. The main issue as a reinsurer
is really the commission level and those are starting to come down, probably not as
quickly as we would like or maybe too quickly for the insurance companies, as they would
like, but the trend is positive.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

They are given and US casualties unchanged.

A - Paolo De Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Is unchanged, correct.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes, I'm just trying to guess the larger US Casualty that might not be significant (inaudible).

Thank you very much.

A - Paolo De Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Overall, I think if there's further opportunities in June July, we might see them, but we're
still very cautious. We feel the current trends are good, but we need several years of rate
increases to get back to the level that we need.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay, thank you very much.
