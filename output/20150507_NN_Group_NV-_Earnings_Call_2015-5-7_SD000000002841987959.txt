FINAL

Yes. Good morning. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to this conference call to
discuss NN Group's First Quarter 2015 results. Before we get going on this I'd like to tell
you that we experienced a bit of complications with getting the webcast up and running.
So my advice to you of the analyst panel is to download from the investor section of our
NN Group website the presentation that I will give to you and that Delﬁn Rueda, our CFO,
will give to you so that you can follow the slides that we're going to take you through.
So just go to the website and download it in the investors' section. Obviously, we're trying
to get the webcast up and running as we go. But we decided that it's better to start the
call now, not to take more of your time unnecessarily.
With that, I suggest that I start. I'm joined here by Delﬁn Rueda, our Chief Financial
Oﬃcer. And by Doug Caldwell, our Chief Risk Oﬃcer. So let me now turn to the ﬁrst page,
that's page number 3, about the Q1 highlights of our numbers today.
NN Group is reporting another strong set of results for the First Quarter of 2015. The
operating result of the ongoing business was EUR304m, up 3% on the First Quarter of
2014, which, by the way, was also a strong quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

The higher result was supported by further cost reductions in the Netherlands. In the First
Quarter of this year we achieved further cost savings of EUR22m, bringing the cumulative
cost savings to EUR164 million compared with 2013.
The net result for the First Quarter of this year improved to EUR485m, which included a
capital gain on an equity investment. This compares with a net loss of EUR215 million in
the First Quarter of 2014, which included a large one-oﬀ charge for the employee pension
agreement in the Netherlands.
The net operating return on equity of the ongoing business of NN Group was 8.7% for the
First Quarter of 2015, reﬂecting a higher equity base compared with the same period in
2014.
Our strong capital position has improved further, with the IGD ratio at the end of the First
Quarter up, at 335%.
All in all a good start of the year. However, we are fully aware that there are areas of the
business that we need to further improve.
For example, the combined ratio of our non-life business in the Netherlands is currently
above 100%. So we need to continue with our initiatives to improve the proﬁtability of this
segment.

FINAL

Our envisaged growth in insurance Europe is being held back by headwinds in the region
and we are therefore changing our business mix in this segment so that our products are
better geared to the current environment.
We have set ourselves clear targets for all our operating segments and as a management
team we remain focused on achieving these. So let's progress to slide number 4. Let me
recap on the ﬁnancial targets for NN Group as a whole which we set at the time of the IPO
last year.
Firstly, we aim to reduce administrative expenses in Netherlands' units by a total of
EUR200 million by the end of 2016. In additional to the EUR142 million reduction (in 2014),
an additional EUR22 million of expense reductions were achieved in the First Quarter of
this year, bringing the total cost savings to date to EUR164m. So we're well on track.
Secondly, we aim to realize an annual growth rate of the operating result before tax of the
ongoing business of 5% to 7% on average in the medium term. The operating result
before tax of the ongoing business for the First Quarter of 2015, of EUR304m, represents
a 3% increase compared with the same quarter last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

This number can be quite volatile on a quarterly basis. But once we have more quarters
behind us we will be able to show average annual growth rates that can be measured
against our medium-term target.
Lastly, we aim to increase the net operating return on equity of the ongoing business in
the medium term, measured against the pro-forma 7.1% for 2013. The net operating return
on equity of the ongoing business in the First Quarter of 2015 was 8.7%.
Overall we're making good progress towards delivering on these targets. But please bear
in mind that these targets will be measured over the medium term.
Aligned with these three targets we expect over time to generate free cash available to
shareholders in a range around the net operating result of the ongoing businesses. Delﬁn
Rueda will discuss the free cash ﬂow generation later on in this presentation.
On the next slide, slide number 5, I want to highlight a couple of important developments
so far in 2015.
We have embarked on a large project to rebrand our businesses from ING to be NN or
Nationale-Nederlanden brand. A large part of the operational and legal entity rebranding
has already been completed.
This is being supported by various local marketing campaigns as well as NN's global
running sponsorship. These activities are aimed at enhancing brand awareness.

FINAL

As already announced, we expect to incur total rebranding expenses of EUR135 million
over the next two years, of which EUR20 million has been incurred in the First Quarter of
2015 and reported as a special item.
ING sold down an additional 52 million NN Group shares in February this year, reducing
its stake to just under 55%. NN Group participated in this transaction by repurchasing 8.3
million shares for a total amount of EUR200m, thereby, eﬀectively returning this capital to
our shareholders in line with our equity story.
In our Fourth Quarter earnings release we disclosed our estimated Solvency II capital
ratio. As the next step in our preparations for Solvency II we now intend to apply for the
usage of a partial internal model for NN Group and the insurance entities in the
Netherlands.

Bloomberg Transcript

The European Court of Justice issued its ruling last week on a principal legal question
with respect to information provision requirements related to unit-linked products. The
European Court aﬃrmed the position of Nationale-Nederlanden that the information
requirements prescribed by the European directive may be extended by additional
information requirements included in national law, provided that these requirements are
necessary for the policy to -- holder to understand the essential characteristics of the
commitment and provided that they are clear, accurate and foreseeable.
Nationale-Nederlanden is of the opinion that general principles of Dutch law such as
reasonableness and fairness that are used as a legal basis in Dutch proceedings, do not
meet these criteria and that additional information requirements cannot be imposed
retroactively.
While we believe that this ruling is an important step in providing clarity on an important
legal aspects in this matter, it is ultimately up to the Dutch courts to take the European
Court's ruling into account in individual Dutch legal proceedings.
We maintain our view that the ﬁnancial consequences may be substantial for NN Group.
However, these consequences cannot be reliably estimated or quantiﬁed at this time.
So let's move to slide number 6 of the presentation. Slide six shows the key metrics that
demonstrate our strong capital position.
The Solvency I capital ratio of our biggest unit, NN life, has increased to 296% at the end
of the First Quarter of this year, mainly driven by the tightening of credit spreads, buoyant
equity markets and changes in the level and the shape of the interest rate curve.
Our holding company, cash capital, remained essentially stable at EUR1.4b. And in terms
of ﬁnancial leverage our ﬁxed-cost cover ratio -- coverage ratio went up to 11.8 times and
the leverage ratio reduced to 22.1%. Delﬁn will take you through the development of
these metrics later on in the presentation.

As I already mentioned, the IGD ratio increased to 335% at the end of the First Quarter of
this year. This was mainly driven by positive revaluations and the net result for the quarter.
But also reﬂects the EUR200 million share buyback in February of this year.

FINAL

With that I would like to pass the microphone to our Chief Financial Oﬃcer, Delﬁn Rueda,
who will take you through the ﬁnancial details of the First Quarter 2015 results. Delﬁn?

Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Thank you, Lard. Good morning to everyone. Let me start with the consolidated results.
NN Group posted an operating result of the ongoing business, which, as you know,
excludes the Japan closed block variable annuity business in Japan of EUR304 million in
the First Quarter of 2015, up just over 3% on the same quarter in 2014.
This was supported by further spend reductions in the Netherlands as well as lower debt
funding cost. I will address these two points on later slides.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the right-hand graph you can see that the net result for the First Quarter improved to
EUR485 million versus a loss of EUR215 million in the First Quarter last year. There are two
main items driving this increase, both aﬀecting non-operating result.
Firstly, the current quarter includes a gain on the sale of a large public entity investment in
the Netherlands following a public oﬀering. And in the other hand in the First Quarter of
2014 we had EUR541 million negative impact caused by the agreement to make our
closed deﬁned beneﬁt pension plan in the Netherlands ﬁnancially independent.
Before going through the individual operating segments let's ﬁrst take a look, next slide,
at the progress we are making on reducing expenses in the Netherlands.
One of our ﬁnancial targets is to achieve an absolute reduction of the administrative
expenses in Netherlands life, Netherlands non-life and at the corporate and holding
entities of EUR200 million by 2016. And we are measuring this against the 2013 cost base.
By targeting an absolute reduction this means that we also have to compensate for cost
increases, such as inﬂation and regulatory cost. So far we have realized total cost savings,
as Lard has explained, of EUR164m, of which EUR142 million already in 2014. And an
additional EUR22 million in the First Quarter of 2015.
In 2014 the majority of the cost savings were realized in non-life and in the corporate
holding segments. As you can see in the chart, the majority of the expenses reductions in
the First Quarter this year were achieved in Netherlands life.
I would like to highlight that this was driven by a relatively low level of project cost. We
have ﬂagged before that, given the nature of the initiatives at Netherlands life, the related

Page 5 of 25

cost savings will be back-end loaded more towards 2016.

FINAL

Let me turn now to the individual segments, starting, as usual, with Netherlands life, on
Slide 10. The operating results of Netherlands life amounted to EUR152 million in the First
Quarter of 2015. While this result is broadly stable compared with the same quarter last
year, there are a number of positive and negative developments that I want to highlight.
Fees and premium-based revenues remain under pressure mainly because of the runoﬀ
of individual life closed book. This is a structural trend that I have already ﬂagged in
previous quarters. The technical margin was negatively impacted primarily by a EUR20
million increase to the unit-link guarantee provision this quarter following a decrease in
interest rates.
On the other hand the investment margin increased, supported by a large private equity
dividend. The strategy of increase in our allocation to higher-yielding assets, as well as the
higher invested volumes, also helped to oﬀset the lower investment yields. As you can
see in the far-right chart, the investment spread increased to 112 basis points in the First
Quarter of this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

I will now turn to Slide 11 for the results of Netherlands non-life. The operating result for
Netherlands non-life was EUR24 million for the First Quarter of 2015, up slightly on the
same quarter last year. The results of disability & accident and the results of property &
casualty, being the two businesses within non-life, move in opposite directions. So let me
deal with them separately.
The operating result in disability & accident increased to EUR28 million as the current
quarter beneﬁted from an IBNR update amounting to EUR9m. The combined ratio, as a
result, improved accordingly to 92.6%.
The operating result in property & casualty, on the other hand, decreased to a loss of
EUR5m, mainly due to large claims in ﬁre for an amount of EUR12m. However, the result
on the motor portfolio is improving thanks to the management actions we are taking.
The combined ratio of property & casualty in the First Quarter deteriorated to 106.5%. For
non-life as a whole the combined ratio remained ﬂat, at 100.2%.
Moving into insurance Europe, in Page 12, the operating result was lower due to the
impact of the pension reforms in Poland and also because investment income in the First
Quarter of last year beneﬁted from an early redemption of an RMBS.
These negative pressures were partly oﬀset by higher traditional life insurance premiums
and higher performance fees. The lower operating income, combined with higher project
expenses, is reﬂected in a higher cost/income ratio.
New sales were broadly stable in the First Quarter if you exclude currency impacts.
However, we are seeing encouraging growth in the sales of life protection products,
Page 6 of 25

Date: 2015-05-07

which is an area in which we are focusing across the region.

FINAL

Moving now to Japan life, on Slide 13, Japan life reported an operating result of EUR72
million for the First Quarter of 2015, up more than 4% on the First Quarter of 2014
excluding currency eﬀects.
The First Quarter always reﬂects seasonally-high sales and this, in turn, is visible in
premium income and the operating result. The higher operating result compared with the
First Quarter last year was largely driven by an increase in fees and premium-based
revenues as a result of larger in-force volumes.
Administrative expenses were also down, mainly due to a one-oﬀ pension liability release.
New sales were broadly at the same level compared with the same quarter in 2014.
I will turn now to Slide 14 and the investment management segment. Total assets under
management increased to EUR203 billion at the end of the First Quarter this year, driven
by a strong market performance.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our strategy at investment management is geared to attracting third-party mandates and
in the First Quarter this year we saw net inﬂows in this business of EUR1.3b. There was a
net outﬂow in the property and other aﬃliates business combined to give a net -- a total
net outﬂow of assets under management of EUR0.5 billion this quarter.
The operating result for the investment management segment decreased to EUR36
million in the First Quarter of 2015 compared with the same period last year. However,
please bear in mind that last year's result beneﬁted from a total of EUR10 million in nonrecurring items.
While the higher assets under management led to an increase in fee income,
administrative expenses also went up as we continue to invest in the business.
The segment other, which comprises the holding company, the reinsurance business and
NN Bank, is set out in Slide 15. The total operating result of the segment other improved
from a loss of EUR31 million in the First Quarter of 2014 to a loss of EUR20 million in the
First Quarter of 2015. Let me go through the various elements impacting these results.
There are two main items impacting the holding company result. Firstly, funding costs
were down on last year as we used the proceeds of the undated subordinated debt
issued in July 2014 to redeem hybrid debt.
As I have highlighted before, these undated subordinated notes are classiﬁed as equity
under IFRS and so the interest is not recognized in the proﬁt and loss account. But is taken
through equity.

Page 7 of 25



Company Name: NN Group NV

Date: 2015-05-07

Secondly, investment income was up compared with last year, reﬂecting the interest
income received on the two subordinated loans provided by NN Group to NN life in the
ﬁrst half of 2014.

FINAL

At the reinsurance business the operating result was down because the First Quarter of
2014 included a strong result related to a speciﬁc reinsurance contract which we do not
expect to recur.
Finally, the result of NN Bank went down slightly. The bank continues to grow strongly in
both mortgages and customer savings, which was reﬂected in a higher interest result. To
support this growth the bank is incurring higher administrative expenses.
I will now move to cover our last segment, Japan closed block VA. Japan closed block VA
reported a result before tax of EUR16 million in the First Quarter of 2015, compared with a
loss of EUR36 million in the First Quarter of 2014, which included a EUR51 million negative
impact of various modeling reﬁnements.
The portfolio continues to run oﬀ and the lower number of policies is reﬂected in lower
fees and premium-based revenues. The increase in surrenders means that the processing
costs are up.

Bloomberg Transcript

At the same time we are incurring higher project cost to prepare for the expected large
volumes of maturities. The net amount at risk decreased to EUR98 million at the end of
the First Quarter, primarily driven by equity markets' appreciation.
With this I complete the results of our operating segments. On the following slides I
would like to take you through our cash generation and ﬁnancial leverage position.
On Slide 17 let me start by repeating our deﬁnition of free cash ﬂow at the holding
company, which is the change in the cash capital position at the holding company over
the relevant period, excluding any capital transaction with shareholders and debt holders.
In the First Quarter of 2015 free cash ﬂow at the holding was EUR229m, which is the sum
of the three elements within the box in the chart. As you can see, these were mainly driven
by a dividend of EUR350 million from NN life.
As Lard already mentioned, we participated in ING's sell-down of NN Group's shares in
February 2015 for an amount of EUR200m, showing in the chart as capital ﬂow to
shareholders. On balance, the cash capital position at the holding company remained
more or less stable during the First Quarter of 2015, at over EUR1.4b.
Turning to Slide 18, I want to talk you through our ﬁnancial leverage position. NN Group
successfully issued its ﬁrst senior debt in March this year. The EUR600 million of senior
unsecured notes which we placed with investors carry a ﬁxed annual coupon of 1% and
have a maturity of seven years.

Page 8 of 25



Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity
Date: 2015-05-07

We used the proceeds to repay EUR400 million of senior debt to ING. The remaining
EUR200 million was passed onto NN Bank in the form of operational leverage. Our
ﬁnancial leverage position has, therefore, remained stable at EUR3.7b.

FINAL

As you can see, both our ﬁnancial leverage ratio and ﬁxed-cost coverage ratio have
improved again this quarter. This was largely driven by the First Quarter results.
And with that I will pass you back to Lard for his ﬁnal remarks.

Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

I would like to round oﬀ on page number 20 -- slide number 20, by saying that we are
pleased to report another strong set of results for the First Quarter of 2015. The better
operating result was largely driven by the continued progress that we are making to
reduce expenses in the Netherlands. And our capital position remains strong.
I'm pleased with our achievements so far. But let's not forget that the environment in
which we operate continues to be challenging both in terms of low rates and regulatory
pressure. We are therefore fully aware that we have to remain focused on cost discipline
and capital management.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are committed to delivering on our strategic targets. But we will never lose sight of
our main objective, which is to provide excellent service and products to our customers.
And with that I would like to complete the presentation and open the call for your
questions. We are ready for you. So operator, back to you.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Cor Kluis, Rabobank.

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

Good morning. Cor Kluis, Rabobank. I've got a few questions, ﬁrst of all, on solvency. The
NN life solvency increased quite strongly, I think, 36percentage points. You mentioned
this due credit spreads, equity and interest rates. Can you explain the composition of the
36% rise of solvency ratio spread out, percentage wise, over these three items?
And linked to that, Solvency II ratio, you've not given an update at this moment. That was
200% standard model before the share buyback and before the Q1 earnings. Can you
give an idea what the Solvency II ratio standard model is today approximately?
And another question is about capital. You injected EUR65 million cash from the holding
into subsidiaries. In which subsidiary have you injected capital, why was that required and
Page 9 of 25

is there more to come?

FINAL

And my last question is about free cash ﬂow generation in general. Last year your free
cash ﬂow was EUR450m. Q1 is already much -- on a recurring basis much better.
Can you give an idea what kind of free cash ﬂow you're going for this year, because it's
clearly still below par? Can we think about EUR700m, those kind of levels, for 2015? That
were my questions.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Cor, thank you very much for your questions -- your four questions. I'm handing over to
Delﬁn to answer them for you.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Cor, a lot of forward-looking questions or expectations going forward. Let me start on the
ﬁrst on solvency.

Bloomberg Transcript

I will not provide a speciﬁc percentage for each of the diﬀerent elements. But I can
conﬁrm that the credit spreads is by far the largest contributor to the improvement in the
Solvency I ratio of NN life, followed by the improvement in the revaluation of our equity
positions. And, to a lower extent, due to the interest rates -- the decrease in interest rates.
In terms of Solvency II we, indeed, gave the guidance at the end of last year that the
standard formula Solvency II ratio was in the range around 200%. We have not provided
any speciﬁc calculations this time, because we felt that there was not the requirement to
provide any diﬀerent guidance. But you can take some comfort on the fact that the main
drivers improving the Solvency I ratio also have a positive impact on Solvency II.
In terms of the capital injections, the EUR65 million is split into -- EUR35 million was
invested in Turkey, the unit where we are -- who is a startup. And EUR30 million was in
terms of subordinated loans to NN Bank. And in terms of would that continue to be for
the future, yes, in limited amounts. As you have seen, that might be the case in the
quarters to come.
In terms of the free cash ﬂow generation I concur that the First Quarter has been a strong
quarter. Keep in mind also that the Second Quarter tends to have larger dividends
particularly coming from insurance Europe. So so far, we expect 2015 to be a good year in
terms of free cash ﬂow generation.

Q - David Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi. Good morning. It's David Andrich from Morgan Stanley. Thank you for taking my
questions. I had two questions on capital.
First of all, in terms of the -- in light of the recent ﬁnancial stability overview published by
the DNB, I guess I was wondering if you could give a bit of indication about how much
beneﬁt your Solvency II ratio at Q4 received from the UFRs of the 200% -- how many
percentage points were you getting from the UFR impact coming through?
Then, secondly, I was just wondering if you could give a bit more color in terms of any
recent developments in the Solvency II discussions particularly around you guys ﬁnalizing
your submission of your internal model -- or partial internal model. Thank you.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

So the ﬁrst question is Delﬁn and then the second one on the -- I'm going to hand over to
Doug. You can also do both, Doug, if you want to. Yes.

A - Doug Caldwell

{BIO 17900909 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, I think -- on the ﬁrst question I think we don't -- there's a lot of moving parts to the
Solvency II ratio. So we're not prepared to start picking out various pieces of it and putting
it together. So I would not expect speciﬁc guidance on that.
In terms of the Solvency II discussions and the partial internal model, as we said, we will
plan to apply for that. I'd say the -- what are some of the uncertainties? I think the internal
model approval process is clearly an uncertainty.
It's the ﬁrst time insurance companies are going through this process with the regulators.
And while we've had good discussions this will continue throughout the year.
There's still discussions on tax treatment. There's still discussions on how certain debts -debt treatment and just ongoing interpretations. There continue to be need for regulators
and companies to interpret the rules. And that continues to take place.
So certainly the uncertainties are lower than they were a year ago. But there's still plenty
that remain as we try to move this thing through to the end of the year and be ready for
solvency II on January 1, 2016.

Q - David Andrich

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi. Thanks very much. Sorry, my ﬁrst question sounds a bit like David's. But just back on
Solvency II, Doug. Presumably it's a statement that's blindingly obvious that the reason
you're going for partial approval is that your ultimate ratio should end up higher than the
standard formula number you've published. I just want to conﬁrm that is the case, or if
there's just more of a process issue behind what you're doing.
Then secondly, whilst you can't give us the detail, can you just conﬁrm again the areas
where you're planning to go for the internal model versus the standard? I'm assuming
Dutch life is a big part of it. But if you could just let us know where you're happy with
standard and where you want to use internal.
Then on the non-life combined ratio are you generally still happy that you're trending
towards the targets you set at the time of the IPO and, therefore, being north of 100% is
just more bad luck in the First Quarter? Or are you getting a bit more hesitant on your
ability to deliver headline underwriting improvement? Thanks.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So William, let me take the non-life question ﬁrst. This is Lard. Then I'll hand over to Doug
on your earlier two questions.
So on the non-life one what we're seeing is that our -- let's say, our disability & accident
business line, actually, if you look at the combined ratio there it now stands at roughly
93%. So you can see that over the last years we have performed an improvement program
which is a combination of product changes, re-pricing of the book and, let's say, expense
reductions to get the expense ratio down.
And you can see that that program -- the implementation of that program has delivered a
marked improvement of that business line, although I do need to mention that for this
quarter there is a EUR9 million IBNR reserve release in the Group income protection
business line that helps to get the 93%. But you can see over the quarters that has really
fundamentally improved.
If you look at the motor business line, which I ﬂagged earlier -- in earlier quarters as the -an area that we want to improve as well, you can see that we were able to see some
results of our eﬀorts there which is moving the combined ratio from 11% to 105%, which is
also an improvement. So that's another business line where we're really driving the
improvement program through.
Then ﬁnally you have the ﬁre business line, where indeed we were confronted with a
couple of big claims in ﬁre -- in the ﬁre area. And we had some storms in the beginning of
the year that has aﬀected the ﬁre business line as well. So that combination of everything
is now ending up at a ﬂat 100%, roughly, combined ratio versus last year.
But what I'm trying to say here is that we are committed to driving our combined ratio to
our target level of 97% by the end of 2018. And a lot is happening to do that. But indeed
Page 12 of 25



Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity
Date: 2015-05-07

we were confronted with some, as you call it, bad-luck situations.

FINAL

On the other hand, it is our job as a non-life company to do these kinds of things and
that's why we're around. So -- and with that I would like to hand over to Doug on your ﬁrst
two questions, William.

A - Doug Caldwell

{BIO 17900909 <GO>}

Yes, on the PIM I think there's -- the real magic of the PIM is ultimately the internal model
part is just to align your risk management and your capital management in that sense and
in that sense simplify the management of the business.
As I noted before, we can't really give any ﬁnal conﬁrmation or indication of the -- of a
ratio under the PIM until we've ﬁnished the process, which will be toward the end of this
year.
In terms of the where we're applying -- or where we're considering to apply for an internal
model as part of the partial, we can say more on that. In general we are looking to have a
fairly complete internal model for the Dutch businesses, including ING Re. And to use the
standard model for the international businesses. We think that's the best way to go
forward at this time.

Q - William Hawkins

And sorry, the international business, that includes Japan as well, yes?

A - Doug Caldwell

{BIO 17900909 <GO>}

Q - Matthias De Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Two questions, one on cash ﬂow and one on capital, please. The ﬁrst
one is on the -- yes, the Dutch business. You're close to 300% solvency. Just wondering
whether this will -- this should allow for further up streams of capital to the holding
company in 2015?
And also on the Japanese VA business I notice that the IFRS reserves are down 50% and I
think that these reserves are a sort of proxy for the capital requirement. So just wondering
whether you could release some additional capital from ING Re tied up to these reserves.
And if you could quantify this would be also be helpful.

Then on the capital just wondering whether you could provide your view on whether or
not there is any distributable excess capital at the holding company level at this point in
time?

FINAL

Last quarter you mentioned that Solvency II remains uncertain. But that these uncertainties
are not that important that they would prevent additional distributions to shareholders. So
just if you could update your view in that respect that would be helpful. Thanks.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

So Matthias, thank you. Yes, Delﬁn, would you be so kind?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. So three questions here. The ﬁrst one on the solvency of NN Life, which is strong.
And as a consequence should maintain or allow some capital distribution from NN Life as
we move forward. Obviously, every decision will be taken at any particular point of time.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of the IFRS, yes, indeed the number of policies and the amount at risk (and the)
reserves are down. In terms of the capital that we hold against this, this is measured based
on our economic capital and, indeed, as the runoﬀ of the portfolio continues its path that
will gradually allow us to release capital and eventually to distribute it up to the holding.
In terms of the holding cash capital, as mentioned during the presentation, that level is
more or less stable when compared with the situation at year end. We do expect further
dividends coming over the quarters and we'll take the decisions in terms of dividends or
buybacks as the opportunity comes going forward.
Of course, to conﬁrm once more that the level of capitalization remains strong and that
gives us ﬁnancial ﬂexibility.

Q - Matthias De Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Okay. And just in terms of timing of dividends from the units you mention that Q2 you
would expect from Insurance Europe, is that the only entity which is expected to up
stream, or --?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

No. What I commented is that the dividends from Insurance Europe tend to come in the
Second Quarter. But that does exclude dividends from other units, nor that dividends
might come from some of the operations outside of the Second Quarter. It's just a bit of
concentration on dividends in the quarter, that's all.

Q - Matthias De Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, everybody. Thank you. So much. I'd just like to come back on Matthias' question
actually on cash ﬂow release. You told us what we already know, in a way. So apologies.
But it seems that the surrender rate and the reserve rate in Japan CBVA is just
accelerating faster than we thought.
So does that not suggest an earlier repayment of the EUR900 million of capital all
together from that business? So if you could just comment a little bit more on that.
And secondly, going back to the UFR, has the DNB asked you to recalculate your model
submission without UFR? Is that a formal request from the DNB?
And ﬁnally, going to the investment management business, the cost/income ratio is up.
How much is that is one-oﬀ in nature? Or should we assume that the absolute cost level
remains at the current level? Thank you.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. So let's ﬁrst -- thanks, Farooq. So let's make sure we answer your questions. So on
the cash release, Japan CBVA. So Doug. And then I think on the UFR question and the
cost income ratio, Delﬁn.

A - Doug Caldwell

{BIO 17900909 <GO>}

Yes, on the VA, maybe just to be a little bit more speciﬁc on what the reserve reduction
means, it doesn't mean very much to cash release. What's important when you look at the
VA book is the capital, not the reserve. And the hedge results which we disclose to you in
our regular reports. Those two release.
Eﬀectively you can think of the reserves are going up and down also with our hedges. So
reserves going up or down per se doesn't say a lot. What matters is the runoﬀ by policy
and the hedge results. That's the best thing to track.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Okay, Delﬁn?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Sorry, the microphone was oﬀ. So to cover your last two questions, in terms of the UFR
what DNB has actually done is that they have stated in a policy paper that very low rates
have made the UFR a more signiﬁcant inﬂuence on solvency ratios, which of course is true
and everyone agrees to it. And also they have added that they would like this to be taken
into account in dividend decisions.
Page 15 of 25



Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity
Date: 2015-05-07

And obviously we take all information into account when assessing our ﬁnancial position
and making dividend decisions, including of course the impact of the UFR from year 20.
But also other known factors there that aﬀect our current and future capital generation.

FINAL

So we are, as I said before, comfortable with our ﬁnancial position and ﬂexibility and,
obviously, we monitor what is our current and future capital generation following the
existing regulatory regime.
Then in terms of the question on the expenses for investment management, particularly
when you compare it with the First Quarter of last year you need to take into account that
then were two non-recurrent items, if I may call them like this.
One was having a positive impact of EUR5 million in the revenues and the other was due
to release of employee variable pay that was EUR5m. So there was a EUR10 million nonrecurrent.
And during this First Quarter, as mentioned in the press release, investment management
has continued to invest in their capabilities and some of that will continue going forward.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So the -- obviously there are -- I think the rebranding costs are not shown in the operating
line. I'm not sure if they are. But excluding that you think that the 1Q number is (the) run
rate?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

I would not highlight any particular non-recurrent in the cost of investment management
and, indeed, the branding expenses for investment management and all other segments
are reﬂected within special items and, as mentioned before, that amounted to EUR20m.

Q - Farooq Hanif

FINAL

Yes. Good morning all. Two questions from my side. I will take my colleague's questions
on the other side. You seem to be quite conﬁdent on your solvency position in NN Life.
My question is, given the DNB position on the UFR, do you think that the cash remittance
you can remit to the holding is actually sustainable going forward?
And do you see a risk of the regulator in telling you guys, well, you can't remit that
amount of cash? Basically, is the EUR350 million something sustainable in the future as
the regulator has (brought) some issues in some of your competitors' cash circulation?
And the second one is on Insurance Europe. You seem to be selling quite a bit more
protection products there, which is in my -- from my point of view is pretty good news. Is
there any country of speciﬁc focus for this type of shift? Which countries are the most
contributing to the shift? And yes, that would be questions. Thanks.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Guilhem. So let me talk ﬁrst about Insurance Europe and then
Delﬁn will take your question on solvency in NN Life.

Bloomberg Transcript

Already for quite a while in Insurance Europe we're moving the product mix away from
traditional guaranteed products so you can -- and moving more to protection products.
That has been, let's say, something that we've willfully executed over the last years.
And you can see that this year in this quarter our new sales were up in Insurance Europe
protection products 17% -- sorry, 17% in 2014 and 40% in this quarter. However, there was
one big contract in Spain that contributed to this marked 40% increase on protection
product sales this quarter. If you exclude that one big contract it's still an 11% uptick.
And basically it's something that -- if I look at the various countries it's in -- it's across the
board basically where you see a movement towards protection sales. And I would -I think that if I look at the total APE for Insurance Europe now roughly 70% to 80% of that
APE is actually coming from protection sales. So it's an area that we've focused on and
that we've done over the last years and that you can see the results coming through now.
With that point let me just hand over to Delﬁn.

Q - Guilhem Horvath

{BIO 18460437 <GO>}

Maybe just (if I could) follow-up on this one. Just a follow-up, please.

what's your strategy here?

FINAL

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes. So in Poland we saw the full eﬀect in this quarter of the pension reform coming
through. You may recall that last year it was -- the pension reform impact was starting in
March, while this year we have the full three months in the quarter being aﬀected by that
impact. So that's one thing.
What we've done there strategically is that if you look at the new sales it's -- the pension
sales are really very small. It's really focused at protection products sales. And that's what
we see in Poland.

Q - Guilhem Horvath

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

So with that I would like to hand over now to Delﬁn on the solvency question.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Guilhem, on -- in terms of the UFR, which, as you know, is not something new, it has been
in place since June 2012. What we are doing is considering for the distribution of
dividends in NN Life or any other subsidiary, what is the expectations in terms of capital
generation going forward in addition to what has been the capital generation over the
period of time.
So on that sense when we did our IPO we made a statement that we felt comfortable with
the level of solvency of NN Life. Since then, thanks to the evolution of the market, that
situation has improved. And as a consequence I would not read anything negative on the
comments on UFR in relationship to our capacity of distributing dividends from NN Life.

Q - Farquhar Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Morning, gentlemen. Just two questions, if I may, both on the ECJ judgment. There seems
to be a relatively wide gulf of opinion over -- about judgment and, in particular, both sides
claiming vindication. The judgment clearly states that open unwritten rules can now be
applied. But does clearly qualify that they must be clear, accurate and, as you say,
foreseeable.
Page 18 of 25



Company Name: NN Group NV

FINAL

NN seems to be lending particular weight to those references to clear and accurate and
foreseeable. And I just wondered if you could explain your understanding of what that
would legally entail, i.e., in terms of, say, burden of proof around them within a Dutch
court, given your view that it aﬃrms your position.
Then as a follow on could you just clarify the legal status of the preliminary judgment from
the Advocate General at the ECJ, because that document was obviously more extensive
and somewhat more critical of the information provided to policyholders?
In particular I'm just trying to understand whether that document would be outside the
scope of what the Dutch courts can look at. Presumably they can only look at the ﬁnal
judgment. Thanks.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you very much, Farquhar. So ﬁrst on the last piece, the Advocate General
opinion does not have a separate legal status. So it is a part of a proceeding in which
multiple parties in that proceeding give their views, or are asked by the European Court
of Justice to give their views. And one of those parties is the Advocate General.
And of course the Advocate General's opinion is an important opinion (that) the ECJ. So
that court needs to take into account. But it does not have a speciﬁc legal status. So that's
the ﬁrst point I'd like to make.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Farquhar Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

(Multiple speakers). So as follow on to that, can they actually -- can the Dutch court look at
that document, though, given it's part of the process?

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes. But it's been public and clear, it's there. So it's something that they can look into and
it's well known. But it doesn't have a legal status. The European Court of Justice has made
the ruling and they've taken the opinions of all the parties into account, including the
opinion of the Advocate General.
They need to take -- the European courts need to take the ruling of the ECJ into account.

Q - Farquhar Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

I think that's the important thing.

FINAL

They need to take into account the ruling of the Court of Justice itself.
Now, on that Court of Justice ruling, the following. The Court of Justice has said that the
Member State can place additional information requirements in national law. But they
need to be clear, accurate and foreseeable. Now, we -- this aﬃrms the position that we are
taking on this -- on these points.
And why we think that is important is that if you -- in some legal cases in individual legal
proceedings in the Netherlands sometimes they are based on -- things are put forward
that are based on, let's say, general principles of law, like in open norms like, for example,
reasonable and fairness.
What we -- our opinion is that that is not clear, it is not precise and it is not foreseeable.
And as a result according to our opinion these open norms cannot form a basis for
placing additional requirements on insurance companies, as they are not clear, not
precise and not foreseeable for us.
Now -- that now -- the ECJ judgment aﬃrms our opinion on that in our view and now it's
up to the Dutch courts in individual legal proceedings to take this into account. And we'll
have to await how they deal with that interpretation of the European Court of Justice.

Q - Farquhar Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. To come back on these legal
updates, my understanding is that the information disclosed need to be clear, accurate
and necessary. But this is for the policyholders. This is -- clearly, the information should be
clear and accurate for the policyholders, not -- nothing to do with NN there.
Page 20 of 25



Company Name: NN Group NV

FINAL

And I think they only mention that it should be foreseeable for the insurance, obviously.
However, they describe that given the complexity of the product it was up to the
insurance to make -- well, decide whether they had to disclose something. So I'm a bit
confused, actually, because it looks like the decision is much more negative for NN than
you actually mention now. That's the ﬁrst thing.
The second thing will be on your dividend and capital distribution going forward. Now
that we've got this European Court of Justice decision are you going to be maybe await a
local court to take their own view before being maybe more vocal on additional capital
distribution, as you have very good capital ratios now?
Then ﬁnally, on the Dutch margins, again, you have private equity gains. I just wanted to
talk about it. On the clean basis it looks like it was 96 bps and that was down year on year.
So what is your view on the underlying investment margin, again clean, for all the private
equity gains? And are you going to book again private equity gains going forward?
Thanks.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. So ﬁrst, Benoit, I will take the ﬁrst two points and then I will ask Delﬁn to take the
point of the investment margin. So ﬁrst, okay, once more on the ECJ ruling, it is about the
requirements.
So according to the ruling also the legal basis for additional information requirements in
national law must be such that in accordance with the principle of legal certainty it
enables insurance companies to identify with suﬃcient foreseeability what additional
information they must provide and which the policyholder may expect. So I think we are -yes, we -- therefore, I maintain and we maintain our opinion that I expressed earlier on the
question that was raised earlier on this.
When it comes to the impact of this ﬁle with respect to capital distribution, we assess -- as
you know, we assess whether we have at a certain point in time surplus capital. We assess
that by taking many things into account.
We take into account the cash generation that we see, the cash generation that we expect
moving forward, the situation on the ﬁnancial markets, the various risks that the Company
is exposed to, the existing solvency positions and the uncertainties that we need to deal
with.
And one of these uncertainties is the migration from the current solvency framework to
the new Solvency II framework, which is still not fully embedded and clear.
And the second -- and another element that we take into account is uncertainty with
respect to the outcome of, let's say, the unit-linked ﬁled, which over time can -- we've
always maintained the view that we cannot reliably estimate what that item can be. But it
may be substantial.

Page 21 of 25



Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity
Date: 2015-05-07

So that is another thing that we will take into account, along many other components that
we take into account when assessing the capital position of the Company and making
decisions on capital distribution.

FINAL

So with that on the investment margin, Delﬁn.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. In terms of investment margin, of course, dividends from equity is an important
element of the investment margin. In this quarter it was relatively high, particularly coming
from some dividends from private equity. So one should not obviously estimate that that
will be recurrent going forward of course.
We have mentioned already in previous calls that the low interest rate environment is
obviously putting pressure on our investment yields. And that's something that we have
tried to compensate so far, investing in mortgages and trying to invest in infrastructure
loans and higher-yielding assets.
But even in those the investment return is coming down. So there is going forward maybe
some pressure on the investment margin that we have not seen so far. But it depends for
how long the interest rates will stay low.

Bloomberg Transcript

One aspect maybe to take into account is that somehow when the interest rates are low
we beneﬁt, as you have seen over the last quarters through our investment management
business as assets under management and fees increases with the low interest rates.

Q - Frank Kopﬁnger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, everybody. I have two questions. My ﬁrst question is coming back to
the closed block VA business. It looks that the runoﬀ is going faster. How are your feelings
there? Do you stick to your guidance of having runoﬀ 90% until the end of 2019? Or is
there a chance that this could be really faster?
And my second question is on the technical margin in Netherlands life. There the
technical margin had been aﬀected negatively by a EUR20 million hit for higher
provisions on the unit-linked business. How should we think there going forward?
So do you have any sort of sensitivity if, let's say, the interest rates stay at that level so you
don't have to further strengthen the reserves there? Or is this is a continuous process
which will continuously be negatively aﬀected through higher provisions for the unitPage 22 of 25

linked business? Then, on the other side, is there a chance that you even release reserves
if interest rates go up?

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

FINAL

So thank you very much, Frank. We will -- so, Doug, can you take care of Japan CBVA?
Then the technical margin, Delﬁn. So ﬁrst the Japan CBVA question.

A - Doug Caldwell

{BIO 17900909 <GO>}

Yes. I think when we say it's going to runoﬀ over 90% by the end of 2019, that's already a
pretty high number. Whether it becomes 91% or 95% is going to depend mostly on the
markets.
What's happening now is the markets are very buoyant, the customers' account values are
much higher than they were a couple of years ago and they're very close or above their
guarantees and so it becomes an attractive time. And deﬁnitely when that happens the
surrenders go faster than when the account values are further down.
That's what happening now. As we've seen, that can -- markets can change, that can
change. But that is running oﬀ. And if markets stay where they are the block will probably
run oﬀ a little faster. But still over 90% by the end of 2019 is a pretty big number.

Bloomberg Transcript

You would not expect that to move to, say, 2018 because just the nature of the block of
business. So it's all marginal, I guess, versus that benchmark.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Delﬁn.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Frank, in terms of the unit-linked guarantee provision, if interest rate stays at the same
level then there is no movement up or down. Basically, these relate to the guarantees
provided to unit-link. So as interest rates come down the value of the liabilities increases.
That's what has happened over the quarter, with a negative impact of EUR20m.
Keep in mind that there is, if you like, a little bit of accounting symmetry here in the sense
that the impact on the increase in the liabilities is obviously reﬂected through the
technical margin in our proﬁt and loss account.
However, any appreciation on the general account assets move through the revaluation
reserve in shareholders' equity and, as a consequence, you don't see that impacting
equally on the operating result.

Q - Frank Kopﬁnger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

And just in theory if interest rates go up you are able to release the reserves?

margin. The reserves will be released.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Good morning. Just one question. Because your dividend payout ratio is 40% to 50%,
because you're targeting to return surplus cash to shareholders over time. And also that
your net cash generation will be roughly equal to your net operating result, are you in any
way restrained on paying out greater than 100% of net proﬁts to shareholders?
I believe that you might have to ask the regulator if you want to payout more than 100% of
earnings in one year. Is that true?

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So Delﬁn?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. There is no particular legal or regulatory constraint about paying below or above the
net earnings of the year. And I think that was the core of your question. So there is no
restriction.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

So yes. And as time goes on, obviously, you're generating as much cash as your operating
result then you can pay all of that out to shareholders. Is that correct?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

That's the guidance that we provided at the time of the IPO and is indeed the way that we
manage the Company towards. Obviously, we also indicated that the surplus capital is
above any opportunity to reinvest that cash generated within the Company.

Q - Steven Haywood
