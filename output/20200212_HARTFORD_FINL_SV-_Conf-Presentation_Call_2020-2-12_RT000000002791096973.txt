Bloomberg Transcript

So thank you for just for the opportunity. I thought I'd just touch upon a couple things. 2019
was a excellent year for the Hartford, both strategically and financially. Financially, and the
results speak for themselves, but at high level we generated $2.1 billion of core earnings
an ROE of 13.6% and we're able to grew book value per share about 11% for the second
consecutive year.
Strategically, I think we've proven we have the ability to acquire, and integrate operations
companies into our platform that helped us expand our underwriting capabilities, expand
our product sets and grow our distribution channels and capabilities.
So really at the Hartford we have been focused and we'll continue to focus on execution
in organic growth. We talked about for Navigators, the integration is proceeding well,
we're about nine months into it, and I think we have our arms around it as far as what we
have in the capabilities that we acquired.
We're pleased with it, but we're really focused on improving the underwriting
performance of that business unit. We're looking at how we cross sell within our larger
platform, we think we're bringing to Navigators enhance claims capabilities with our fast
claims operations and then really leveraging all the Hartford capabilities.
And when I say that I specifically mean data and analytics in our deeper actually our real
capabilities. So things are on track. In our earnings call in the fourth quarter, we did reaffirm
our view that we can create $200 million of incremental core earnings and what we did
was we shorten that by a year, when we closed the deal, we talked about generating that
over a four to five year period of time. Now, we think, we could generate that over a three
to four year period of time.

FINAL

And as I said, we have our arms around Navigators it's operations, the changes that we've
done over this past year, give us great confidence going forward that we'll be able to
expand margins. We also talked about, expanding Navigators margins in that 5% to 6%
range on an overall combined ratio. And that again is really driven primarily by
underwriting action, pricing actions, policy limits, looking at terms and conditions
differently, and quite honestly exiting businesses particularly in London, that just weren't
profitable.
So if I then changed to the Commercial Lines, we provide our guidance for underlying
combined ratio in that 92% to 94% range, that is an improvement over this year. Primarily,
again driven by the five to six points of Navigators of improvement, and I mentioned,
where that's coming from. And then also, we see improvement in our core Small
Commercial, Middle and Large Commercials segments, in spite of some margin
compression, slight white margin compression in workers comp, and that's just reality,
that's just reality, and I'm being honest and transparent as we always are.

Bloomberg Transcript

If I look at Group Benefits, Group Benefits add a outstanding year with $539 million of
operating earnings core earnings, a margin of 8.9% and largely what we're foreshadowing
is that they where at the late stages of finalizing the integration of the Aetna book and
we're pivoting towards growth. Growth in new products, new services that complement
our existing core capabilities, and ultimately focusing on a better customer experience,
particularly the employer experience.
As relates to capital management, I think we continue to be thoughtful in managing
excess capital that's generated beyond, what we need to fund growth in our operations.
We announced our $1 billion buyback program a year-ago. We expect to buyback about
800 million of shares this year in 2020, and we raised the dividend 8%. So, as I sit here
Jay, I think we ended 2019 with significant confidence in momentum as we head into
2020, about improving our operations particularly margins, and creating shareholder value
for that. So that's what I would say.

Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Any opening comments from you just about how the balance sheet shaped up relative to
what you expected at the end of the year.

Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

I think when you look at the things that we've done over the years to get the balance
sheet, I think in a very good position and we've talked for a while about our goals relative
to leverage ratios and so forth and we see ourselves really within of those goals as we
look to pay down some maturing debt this March, so very pleased with the profile there
as Chris commented on we're pleased to be able to increase the dividend again, this
year, and so I think it positions us very well going into 2020.

Just a follow-up something Chris, you said about the Navigators, you talked about
achieving your goals one year earlier. So that always begs the question, what changed
relative to our your original expectations.

FINAL

Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Sure. Well, we laid the path out to the $200 million as far as improved underwriting
results, expense synergies, and enhance net investment income. All three of those are
still the components, but we didn't anticipate this level of rate increase, we talked about it
in the fourth quarter. I mean basically the Navigators Group is plus 15% and closer to 18%,
and we see that continuing into the second half of '20.
So as those rates earn in your roll forward a couple years of continued rate increase, we
think we do have our arms around a loss cost trends for Navigators. We're going to hit our
goals a year sooner than we anticipated.

Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

I assume you thought initially those prices might be up single-digit?

Bloomberg Transcript

Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

We in essence had a view -- I wouldn't say exactly single-digits, but in that higher range of
single-digits just given the needed improvement where ROEs were, but we're basically
doubled the rate increase in from our original expectations in spite of interest rates
coming down in this really wasn't an expense play for us, this was an expanded capability
and maximizing our distribution fleet.

Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Let's talk about I guess the Commercial Line market. You seem to express some
conviction at this pricing momentum would continue into this year maybe even into next
year, as you look at the world what gives you that level of confidence?

Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Well, the straight answer is I don't think as an industry broadly defined, we've really kept
up with loss cost trends over the last five-years or six-years. And if you look at where we
are today in certain lines of business with our combined ratios, it's going to take 18 to 24
months of continued rate increases -- rate on rate increases. I think to hit targeted returns
and commercial auto liability and property. You coupled that with a low interest rate
environment, lower for longer and with 10 year today 160, 155. I think as an industry we
need to continue to be disciplined and focused on rate and underwriting to make up for
that loss in NII that inevitably is going to happen.

Jay Cohen

Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity

The question that I get a lot is yes prices are going up but there's a reason claims are
going up as well not across the Board, but in many lines. As you look at into 2020 and '21,
is your assumption that the loss environment continues to get worse from here or get
better, what's your underline assumption?

FINAL

Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

We believe, it's stable, but again, it's making up for sort of accumulation of years of not
keeping up with trend. I think we've been pretty clear that we feel good about where we
have trend peg today and that 5% range in aggregate for our portfolio, and we just need
to continue execute above that to be able to expand margins, from here. So, but I would
say again at least for our book of business, we don't see anything dramatically shifting,
we've talked about sort of our litigation rates, our representation rates have been very
stable.
We're not experiencing a major shift in any of our liabilities. We've seen over the years the
last five-years is the need to make adjustments in loss picks for certain liability lines,
primarily commercial auto in general liability, we've done that. So Jay for us and our book,
we just need to keep up with that trend that we pegged for liability lines in that 5% range
primary its maybe a little less, you get into umbrella and excess, it could be a little bit
higher, you blend it all together.

Bloomberg Transcript

And as an industry, which is need to catch up from where we were.

Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Is it fair to say that the backdrop is a fairly rational industry. In other words as you take this
action, would you expect your new businesses suffer notably or your renewal retention to
be impacted?

Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

What I would say is the trade between rate and retention. You always need rate ahead of
retention, because if you have an unprofitable account or unprofitable segment, just need
to fix it and if it leaves you, it's unfortunate from a customer side, but that's you need the
rate in your book.
So, I would say generally, our distribution partners understand the environment. We've
been working hard with them, particularly the last six-months to nine-months to educate
the reason for the rate, the trend environment and I think we have alignment with our
distribution partners about what are the actions that we head into '20, and then also head
into '21.
The best example, I can give you maybe just tangible is that, we worked really hard on our
commercial auto book over the last six years. It's about a $600 million book of business to
us. We put about 50 points of aggregate rate into the book over that period of time, and
it still produced 102 combined ratio today. So, when I talk about the next 18 to 24 months
Page 4 of 13



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2020-02-12

to get that line to targeted rate increases. We're going to need 10 points to 12 points of
rate this year, 10 points to 12 points are rate in '21 to even get close to earning an
adequate return on risk adjusted capital.

FINAL

Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

You could argue guys have been maybe a little ahead of the curve there. So arguably
others would have to at least see that kind of increase if not more.

Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

I'm not going to disagree with you

Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Okay, fair enough. Let's turn to workers' comp. I guess it was last year or the year before.
We had this bit of a speed bump, I think it was in the third quarter. We've talked, I think the
market made too much out it, was it second quarter.

Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

I think it was first half of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Okay. What are you seeing as far as claims trends there now? And for us to actually see
prices going up in workers' comp. I'm assuming there would have to be some sort of
change in the claims trend.

Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah, so you are right. We did basically the first half of the year signal that the frequency
of claims not severity. The frequency of claims in certain segments of our book was
increasing. And if you remember at that time, we talked about sort of the demand surge
that we suspected occurred with tax reform and hiring and getting maybe more
inexperienced workers into certain job classifications that pose just more injuries, early on
and that is still is what largely happened in our book of business. So, if you look at
segments, like retail, restaurants, I'll call it high demand maybe high turnover businesses,
there was a little bit of surge hiring that just was inexperienced in certain classes including
manufacturing.
I think that largely settled down in the second half of the year. And so as we sit here today
the trend really over the last six quarters except for those blips in the first two quarters of
'18 has been frequencies have gone back to normal, and have been slightly negative and
severity particularity in medical is better than our long-term assumptions that we
generated plan for in that 4% to 4.5% range.

Page 5 of 13



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2020-02-12

So I think the line is performing well, we still make good margins and returns, but with the
continued rate rollback pressure due to good experience, those margins as we alluded to
and guided to are going to be under some slight pressure heading into '20.

FINAL

Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

What's interesting is those factors that you cited, when the frequency picked up, arguably
are still around and in place yet, it seems like the frequency settled back down again. The
impossible question is why do you think that happened? No, there's no answer, but if you
can treaty it as a thought about it?

Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

I called it demand surge, right. So, when you needed workers, there was a demand surge
primarily rated, I believe to tax reform and some of the stimulus, and then what happens
is people get trained as they get more experience as safety always continues to improve
it reverted back to the long-term mean.

Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's talk about Small Commercial. You're obviously a leader in that area, but you're not
standing still, you continue to make investments there. Can you talk about some of the
more recent investments you've made, and how they could drive growth going forward in
that platform?

Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Sure. Yeah, we're clearly really proud of what we've done with Small Commercial over an
extended period of time. It's been about 30 years since we launched that segment of the
business, and it's one that we've constantly invested in for innovation, for customer
experience.
I think there's two examples that I can give you just quickly Jay without sounding like a
commercial. Unless you want it to sound like a commercial.

Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Go right ahead. You got a platform might as well. We're not going to charge you for it.

Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Thank you. As we rolled out what we called Next-gen Spectrum, which is basically our BOP
policy our Business Owners Policy, that combines property and liability insurance.
We've had a BOP out there for a long time that is used by many different classes of
business in the industry, but this one was basically a modular design. So if you think of
Amazon in your shopping cart, we're able to present to agents, that are quoting our BOPs
Page 6 of 13



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2020-02-12

FINAL

a more modular approach of sort of what is a baseline -- policy-based line from a liability
side, and then all the additional coverage and features that you can add whether it be
cyber enhanced protection in liability.
Industry specific recommendations for like restaurants, or dentist office. So, we really
customized it, so depending on what type of customer you were we're able to present to
you optional coverages, price points for those optional coverages, that protect your
business more holistically on a more transparent basis and clearly with more speed, so
that sort of your running total of what your spend for your policy.
So, we think it was well revolutionize, the BOP business, and we weren't going to be able
to do that, until we basically, invested in some core platform capabilities of how we
administer policies, how do we quote, so those all investments in started four or five
years ago on a baseline basis, that allowed us to innovate today with our next gen
spectrum.
The other thing that I would just say, and I know everyone in this room now is it, but the
power of data and analytics is real and our ability to cut down questions from let's say, 50
years ago down to something less than 10 to be able to pre fill data that makes
underwriters and agents jobs easier, to be able to use imagery in underwriting, just the
advancements in data and analytics that's embedded into the Small Commercial
underwriting process is pretty impressive.

Bloomberg Transcript

Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

So, it's interesting you mentioned, Amazon, people are so used to buying goods that
way, especially younger people, that are it's the phone or the computer, but that whole
process of buying something with a card. And so, your I guess you're tapping into that, I
think certainly as these younger people come up in the industry, that's a natural thing for
them.

Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Sure. No, it really is and the way we really present it and if you want you can go online, and
see it, it's sort of the base, sort of the good the better, the best. And then you could see
the optional coverages that are attached to each of those different characterizations of
good, better, and best.

Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

There something that I guess you haven't been impacted too much by, but you'd hear
well than the industry is this whole concept of social inflation except that some of your
businesses. Give us your thoughts on what do you think is causing that, is it just more
aggressive creative lawyers, is there a backdrop politically or socially that's changing it ?

True. Well, you like you said, and I said it a couple times in our earnings call. I mean it's a
phenomenon that's affecting all aspects of the insurance business, East Coast, West
Coast, Central and its effects vary obviously based on your business mix and what I was
trying to describe is our primary liability to writer might have certain impacts, excess
writers might have more as you get more severity into those types of conditions and
events, but what we are also trying to say is that I think we've been ahead of the curve,
when we've been adjusting and reacting to social inflation over the last five-years in
various aspects of our book. The root cause, look, I'm not a sociologist.

Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

That sounds good.

Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yes. I am an accountant. I just think we're in a litigious environment. I think maybe plaintiffs'
bar is doing a more effective job in arguing for larger settlements, maybe juries are more
sympathetic to injuries and outcomes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Whatever it is and others have talked about it, so I'm stealing some of their language, it's
a tax on society that we all pay in one way shape or another. So how we fight it? We do it
every day with our claims and law professionals and trying to say what's a reasonable
settlement.
I always say we're in the business of playing claims, those that are legitimate covered by
our contractual terms and languages, and that's fair. That's not excessive or punitive, and
that's our philosophy that we approach for our shareholders and our policyholders.

Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

I wanted to shift away from Commercial Line before I do that. Are there any questions out
there on Hartford's Commercial Lines business before I make that shift. Do you have
questions raise your hand, we'll get you a mic. I covered a lot of ground, you guys cover a
lot of ground. And that was pretty good for an accountant by the way.

Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Resemble that.

Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

That's let's shift to you. You had kind of alluded to before in your opening comments
about getting the leverage ratio down to your goal walk us through, I guess the next two
years capital generation. What debt you're retiring? And kind of when do you think you
can get to those margin levels or the leverage levels that you expect?

Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}
Page 8 of 13

FINAL

So we did I think lay out pretty clearly in our earnings release, our thoughts on capital
generation for 2020. So what we're expecting as far as dividends from our operating
companies and so, again our P&C Company targeting dividends about $850 million to
$900 million, Group Benefits 3 to 350 and then mutual funds $100 million to $125 million.
We do still have some more tax attributes on our balance sheet that were monetizing,
and so we expect a little over $500 million of cash receipt to the holding company as we
both get refunds of our AMT credits, as well as just continue to use our net operating
losses. So, very healthy cash flow to the holding companies as we look at 2020. As I
mentioned, we do have some debt maturing in March and we do plan to pay that down
not refinance, so that's $500 million of debt.
And so when we put that into the mix, it puts us in a really nice place relative to our
leverage ratios. And then from a holding company cash requirement, it's really just
interest in dividends. All of our operating expenses are allocated to our subsidiaries and
interests in dividends are little bit over $700 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, kind of give you a sense of the sort of what the cash flow generation is. As Chris said,
we do have $800 million of share buybacks that we'd be doing in 2020 to complete our
billion authorizations. And then as we look beyond that again, as our operating companies
continue to improve as far as earnings, we take that into consideration as far as dividends
in the future.
And so, I think and so I think there'd be some room for those to increase slightly and we
just raised our dividend again. We've been on a path of doing that year-over-year, so we
continue to evaluate if that made sense to do in the future, and then that kind of gives
you a picture of just the excess cash flow that we have at the holding company to decide
what the best use of that would be.

Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

So, you've done two decent-sized deals, acquisitions over the past several years. And I'd
say you executed on them well so far, but some hiccups with Navigators, but you're
obviously achieving your goals quicker than you thought.

Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Incredible with the hiccups, but this is your stage,

Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Well fair enough.

Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Because it was all part of the plan purchased and sort of opening balance sheet and
reinsurance and all the adjustments. We're eyes wide open on getting our arms around
Page 9 of 13

Date: 2020-02-12

day one.

FINAL

Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

So you've actually hit on both pretty well quite well, I would say. It always raises the
question; You're not going to close your eyes to future acquisitions. When you think about
the ability to acquire businesses. Someone comes to you tomorrow with the perfect deal
what does that look like to you? Realistically.

Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Sure. Well, yeah again the contexts of our acquisitions were things that we needed to do
from a platform side, to expand our capabilities to basically serve more customer needs.
That was the primary genesis behind our acquisitions, whether it be the scale business
that we achieved with Aetna or really some of the specialties and the liabilities. Specialty
orientation we picked up with Navigators, I thought both were strategically important and
financially will work out very well for shareholders.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, the bars high going forward principally, because I think we have everything we need as
a platform, as an organization. We just like to grow it organically make it bigger, have
larger scale, have more shelf space in our agents office. So, so I'm trying to describe that
there's not a burning desire of a need to do any additional acquisitions, but like you said, I
mean we're aware, we'll listen but the bar to executed is very high because it is just really
needs to be very,very accretive compared to where we are today.
But if something were to come along in the Small Commercial space or the Middle Market
space that would be a nice complementary bolt on that would give us additional scale
benefits. Particularly, in small I think we have the most efficient Small Commercial
operation. So, we could leverage that great operating strengthened. With Middle Market,
clearly, our goal is to be a bigger and more relevant player in that marketplace, and we're
committed to doing it organically, but if there's something that accelerates that we'll
consider it.

Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Got it. Any questions on capital or M&A? On this topic, no one wants to challenge what he
said, fair enough.
Let's talk about a business that part doesn't get enough attention, because it's been a
great business and that's the Benefits business. It feels like your 2020 guidance is really
conservative, given how great these results have been? What are we missing here?

Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Well, yeah, I mean it's $5.5 billion business, we are the second largest writer behind
MetLife, I think is right around the corner here.

Page 10 of 13



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2020-02-12

FINAL

So yeah, we're really proud of what we've built organically how we've improved that
business. I'm always reminded, when I joined the Hartford in 2010, in 2011 that business
earned about $65 million or $75 million of earnings. So it's at a pretty good turn around
and the acquisition obviously helps.
So yeah, all I the guidance really implies, is at 8.9% margin, it's probably unsustainable. We
experienced obviously very favorable severity, excuse me -- frequency and severity of
getting people back to work and recovery our approach to pricing and reserving assume
sort of a five year averaging, and that's what the guidance reflect.
So you're right, if the economy continues to perform, the people don't go out on disability
meaning lower incidence continues, we have a chance to outperform, but the way we
price products give them we make in three year rate guarantees or four in some cases,
way we reserve is and we assume earnings would emerge is more on a five-year average
basis of those incidents and recoveries. And that's what we guided to.

Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Got it.

Bloomberg Transcript

Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

The only thing I'd add is what another component of the outperformance was the
performance of the Investment portfolio. So our limited partnership portfolio performed
very strongly across our businesses, but in Group Benefits as well and we have a -- we
again take a long-term view when we plan, so that's also a component of that decrease.

Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

We all hope that's going to continue. On this business you sort of suggested in your
opening comments, Chris pivoting towards growth. We got a little bit of time left, talk
about the sources of that growth? Where does that come from?

Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Sure, well, I think there are two main sources. Our core product capabilities Group Life,
Group Disability both long-term and short-term are scale businesses, where we're not at
scale is our voluntary businesses, and voluntary in our vernacular means, critical illness,
hospital indemnity, AD&D, accidental death, business travel accident, you get into the
A&H side of things so.
I think there's an opportunity with our customer base over 20 million customers, our
distribution relationships to really enhance growth in our voluntary, A&H space and that's
what we're going to do.
Beyond that, we're thinking about I'll call it wellness in general, and technology, and
services, and how we might augment some of our core capabilities, but that those are
Page 11 of 13



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2020-02-12

things on the drawing board, but we are thinking just how is this whole health care
wellness benefits space going to emerge. So, those are probably the three primary areas
two short term voluntary and A&H, where we have products on the street today and one
a little bit longer term where we're innovating on offerings and capable and services.

FINAL

Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Got it. My last question in the time we have left. I was interested to hear in your call. When
you were talking and your fourth quarter call. You mentioned a number of positive I'll call
them ESG type attributes of the company. We generally don't hear that from insurance
companies. My question is, why did you bring that up? Are you getting feedback from
shareholders, investors, employees to suggest this as a bigger issue?

Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

I think from an investor side and you could point to people in this room and their firms and
some of the stances that people have taken on broad ESG issues.

Yes, it is becoming more and more important for investors to understand companies and
their strategies and their logic behind ESG. I think we've been a leader in this area for a
good decade. So this isn't anything new to some of the things that we've been working
on as an organization.
We define it more from a sustainability perspective in I'll call it four quadrants: one
governance and ethics, second quadrant would be diversity and pay equity, third quadrant
would be communities and giving back and the fourth quadrant would be environmental
EG your carbon footprint.
So we've been working on these things for well over a decade. We've gone public with
goals. Last year about this time where I put out a sustainability goal report in those
dimensions so yeah, I do think it's becoming more relevant, more top of mind because -you need a multi-dimensional focus. I think for all stakeholders to create value over a long
period of time, and obviously we're a shareholder driven organization.
We got to deliver to your shareholders first, but I believe there's ways of balancing that
with the other dimensions of creating a good work environment, good community
environment for the long term.

I thought it was great that you brought it up. I'm not getting attempt of questions on it,
but I know in our department in the equities business in general, it has become a really
big issue and it's great that you're kind of leading that and making sure your view of this is
out there, it's great. We are really bumping up against the end of the session. why don't
we call it quits here. Chris, Beth thank you very much for joining us again.
