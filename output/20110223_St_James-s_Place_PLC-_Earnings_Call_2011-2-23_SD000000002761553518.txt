{BIO 1553617 <GO>}

Good morning everyone. Thank you very much for joining us today and it's great to see so
many familiar faces. Very briefly, the program is as follows; David will talk about our strong
new business performance last year; Andy will cover what I hope you'll agree are our
equally strong financial results for 2010; and then David will say a few words about the
outlook. This will be followed by our usual question and answer session and David and
Andy will be joined by Ian Gascoigne, our Partnership Director, David Lamb, our Business
Development Director and myself. So I'll now hand over to David.

David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Thanks Mike, nice to see a smile on his face. Chelsea won last night; such a rare
occurrence these days. Morning everyone, good to see you all again and it's a pleasure to
be presenting to you against the background of a very strong performance across all
areas of the business.

FINAL

We've achieved substantial growth in new business, increased the size of the partnership,
increased productivity, saw funds under management rise to an all-time high of GBP27
billion and, consequently, have delivered strong profits on all measures, including the cash
result. That in turn has allowed us to recommend a substantial increase in the dividend in
the first of a two-stage process to re-base it, so all in all a very strong all-round
performance from the entire team.
Andy will go through the details of our financial results in a few moments, but before he
does, and by way of a reminder, I'd just like to recap on the new business figures we
released a few weeks ago and put them into some context. 2010's new business on the
traditional APE basis was up 32% on the previous year. The slide shows the picture over
the last five years and I think illustrates the scale of the recovery following the challenging
2008 and first half of 2009. APE has more than doubled now over the five year period.
A similar picture emerges, unsurprisingly, in respect of the new single investment growth.
In 2010 we attracted GBP4.75 billion of new investment business, 37% up on 2009 and,
again, more than double the figure five years ago. In fact, pretty much three times what
we attracted in 2005 and well spread across all aspects of the business; that's bonds
both onshore and offshore; pensions; ISAs; and unit trusts.

Bloomberg Transcript

The consequence of those investment figures, coupled with the very consistent retention
result we achieve year on year gives us a very impressive net inflow picture as seen on
this slide; consistent positive inflows year on year and through some very challenging
times. And I doubt that many of our competitors can claim such a consistent performance.
And the reason for that consistency three-fold; our unique culture; our unique distribution,
the partnership; and our distinct investment management approach. I'll come back to
those points a little later. But on the subject of the partnership, partner numbers were up
6% in the year, adding to, once again, a very consistent picture over the last five years.
And couple that with the growth in productivity and you'll understand how the business
grows.
Those two factors together continue to drive our business. And although I can't guarantee
that we'll hit our 15% to 20% growth target every year, we remain confident of our ability
to continue to achieve those objectives over the longer term, as we have in the past.
Here's a slide I first used in our July presentation, only now updated for the full year. It
shows for each of the last four-, five-year periods a very consistent performance;
averaged annualized growth, not just at the top of the range, but exceeding the target
range in three of the four periods shown. And the consequence of that consistent
performance is the growth in our funds under management. Here I've shown the 10-year
picture again to illustrate the consistency of the Company's performance and the
underlying growth.
At GBP27 billion we've now doubled the funds under management over the last five
years, as we did in the five-year period ending 2005. And with our ability to attract over

Page 2 of 21



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C
Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2011-02-23

GBP4 billion of new investments each year, with a modicum of growth in the stock
markets, there's no reason to believe we can't double them again in the next five years.

FINAL

I'll leave you with that thought and, for now, hand you over to Andy to go through the
profit and, importantly, the cash results. Andy.

Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Morning, everyone. Before starting, I'd just like to echo David and Mike's comments about
the strong performance during 2010, and it's a pleasure here to be presenting these.

Bloomberg Transcript

Firstly, then, looking at the discounted cash flow result or, in other words, the EEV result,
the combined profit from new business was GBP217.8m, some 40% higher than the
GBP155.4 million for 2009. The new business margin on an APE basis was 37.4%, up from
the 35.3%, and on a PV NBP basis improved from 4.3% to 4.4%. The increase in the
expected profit, or unwind as it is often referred to, reflects the opening higher value of
in-force, whilst the experience variance of GBP26.4 million principally reflects continued
strong retention of funds under management.
Over the last five years we have reported cumulative positive experience variances of
GBP68.7m, an average of GBP13.7 million per annum. This suggests that the assumptions
underlying the calculation of the embedded value are prudent. There was a small
operating assumption change, reducing profit by GBP3.4m. And the relatively lowassumed investment income of GBP4.2 million reflects the historic low interest rates and
the prudent investment policy. Taking all these into account the profit from the Life and
Unit Trust business, at GBP338.5m, was 36% higher than this time last year.
There was a profit of GBP5.8 billion from the Distribution activities compared with a loss
of GBP7.5 million last year, whilst the other operations contributed a loss of GBP11.7 million
against a loss of GBP13 million in 2009. Included in this other result is the cost of
expensing share options, at GBP8.2m, compared with the GBP8.6 million for last year. And
the balance in both years is made up of a number of small positive and negatives items.
Therefore, the total operating profit, at GBP332.6m, was 45% higher than the 2009
figure.
It is worth noting at this point that the operating profit would have actually been GBP4.8
million higher had it not been for the -- our share of the recently-announced FSC levy -FSCS levy in respect of the collapse of Keydata.
As you can see, there was a positive investment variance in both years, reflecting the
higher investment returns. There was also a small profit from economic assumption
changes in the current year, giving total pre-tax profit for the year of GBP455 million
compared with GBP362 million (sic -- see presentation).
Within the tax charge there was a positive GBP17.7 million which reflects the reduction in
the corporation tax rate from 28% to 27%. Although the government has also stated its
intention to reduce corporation tax by a further 1% in each of the following three years, we
Page 3 of 21

FINAL

decided not to reflect these future changes in the embedded value at this time. Had
these proposed changes been reflected then the post-tax embedded value would have
been GBP44.2 million higher. And finally, the post-tax result for the year, at GBP352.6m,
was 33% higher than last year.
The EEV net asset value per share was 352.9p, up 24%. And had those future reductions
in corporation tax rates been taken into account then the net asset value per share would
have been some 9p higher, at 362p.
Moving now onto the IFRS result, the current slide shows the breakdown of the IFRS profit
before shareholder tax. The total profit, at GBP84.2m, was 69% higher than 2009. The
key positive driver to this improved result was greater income from funds under
management, which themselves averaged some 30% higher than the prior year. Similar to
the EEV result, the total profit was negatively impacted by the GBP4.8 million FSCS levy in
respect of Keydata. The IFRS net asset value per share at the end of the year was 120.6p,
up from the 112p at the end of last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving now onto cash, the current slide shows a now familiar breakdown and you will
note that the total cash result for the year was GBP48.3m, more than double the 2009
result. The first line of this slide shows the return from the in-force business, which
increased by 24%, to GBP109.7m, the main driver here being the higher fees from funds
under management.
When considering how this cash from the in-force might develop it's worth remembering
that, due to the un-wind of surrender penalty, we are not receiving income from that
proportion of the business in its first six years where surrender penalties apply. This
relates to GBP8.8 billion of funds under management not yet generating positive cash
earnings, or one-third of the total funds. And this would equate to more than GBP60
million in annual post-tax earnings in the future. I should point out that this figure is for
guidance as it ignores the impact from the stock market and outflows since the original
client investment.
Returning to the previous slide, the cost of investment in new business for the year was
GBP61.4m, slightly lower than the prior year. This investment will generate cash earnings in
the future that should significantly exceed the cost of investment and, therefore, provide
positive earnings for shareholders.
The current slide provides details on a number of different measures for valuing this
investment. As you will see, the cost of investment as a percentage of new gross funds
under management was 1.3%, or 2% if measured against net inflow. The cash payback
period is five years and the internal rate of return net of tax is 19.6%. The return on
investment on all these measures has improved over the prior year. This is due to the
lower cost of investment and the higher value of new funds under management added. If
we achieve our business plan going forward this is a trend that should continue. Hopefully,
you agree these are good returns.

Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity

I would now like to spend a few moments on the outlook for the cash result in 2011 and
future years, which looks positive for the following reasons. Firstly, the average funds
under management are likely to be higher in 2011 than they were in 2010. The average of
the opening and closing funds under management during 2010 was some GBP24b. We
start 2011 with funds under management of GBP27 billion and even if we only matched the
2010 net inflows, and with no stock market growth, funds under management will average
GBP28.5 billion in 2011; that's some 20% higher. In addition, as previously noted,
approximately one-third of funds under management are not yet generating income but
will do so in the coming years.
And thirdly, whilst the income from the in-force business is growing the amount reinvested
to acquire new business will not expand at the same pace. And in fact, in the last two
years the cost of investment has actually fallen. Therefore, given all these factors, under
normal market conditions we expect the cash result to continue to grow strongly in 2010
and future years.
Therefore, in light of this we intend to re-base the dividend over the next two years, with
a significant rise in the 2010 dividend and a stated intention for a future significant rise in
the 2011 dividend. Thereafter, off this higher base we would hope to progressively grow
the dividend in line with the underlying performance of the business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Therefore, subject to shareholder approval the Board have resolved to increase the final
dividend by 49%, to 3.975p per share. This will provide for a full-year dividend of 6p per
share, an increase of 33%.
Before finishing, a quick comment on capital, which remains very strong and our
investment policy continues to be prudent. As far as Solvency II is concerned we
participated in the Fifth Quantitative Impact Study last year. And based on the current
proposed rules the Group will not be adversely impacted by these new requirements and
might actually see a reduction in the current capital that we are required to hold.
So in summary; EEV new business profit up 40%; EEV operating profit up 45%; IFRS profit
before shareholder tax up 69%; cash result up 106% and the full-year dividend up 33%.
2010 has been an excellent year for the business, with significant increases in profit on all
measures. In particular, the increase in the cash result should confirm that embedded
value profit is converting to cash over time and that this will allow for further growth in the
dividend.
Thank you for your attention. I'll now hand you back to Dave.

David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Thank you, Andy. I hope you agree a great set of financial results across all aspects of the
business. Before we leave the numbers I'd just like to reinforce some of the messages,
by putting them into the context of earlier years in much the same way as I did with the
new business figures.

FINAL

So very briefly, here's the new business profit for the last five years; a strong recovery in
2010 with growth of 40%, a very satisfactory underlying growth picture. Similarly, with the
total operating profit figure, strong growth in 2010 of 45% was a good underlying growth
picture. And the same shape emerges for our net asset value; consistent underlying
growth. And finally, before I leave the numbers, the cash result. Here we have the same
underlying growth in the post-tax cash emerging from the in-force book.
In the years ahead, as Andy said, the benefit of the strong new business flows -- inflows
should generate a proportionately greater growth curve than in other measures, hence,
the confidence that sits behind our dividend increase and the overall message.
Let me move on now, and I'll start with the regulatory matters and, specifically, the Retail
Distribution Review. Before that, though, a few words on the recent increase in the FSCS
levy.
Whilst a little frustrating and a little unfair, as we don't operate in the IFA market, it is in all
of our interests that confidence in financial services is not undermined by any failure,
wherever it occurs. And if the occasional larger one-off levy price might just have to be a
price we pay to maintain that confidence.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to the Retail Distribution Review, let me update you with where we are in our
preparations for the changes from the review. Just to remind you, there are three
fundamental strands to the changes. The need for more professional qualifications is the
first strand and is acknowledged by most as an important step forward for the entire
advisor community.
The second is the advisor charging rules, often referred to as customer agreed
remuneration, which up until now have been less than clear. And by that I mean that, whilst
the rules are clear for IFAs, for the IFAs, the agent of the client, it's less clear in the
vertically-integrated space for the likes of St. James's Place and other wealth
management businesses. And the third strand is essentially all about what's referred to as
status disclosure and, here, the proposed labels are independent and restricted. That's
how in future we should describe the type of advice offered.
Let me explain where we are on each strand. First to the professional qualifications and,
here, we've made some really excellent progress. Over 750 advisors, managers and
support players are now diploma qualified and a further 700'ish are within one or two
exams away from this diploma qualification, so an excellent result and real momentum in
the partnership. There were 3,000 exams passed since we began the journey just a year
ago and we are ahead of schedule. A massive effort by all concerned and an achievement
we are very proud of, especially when coupled with the business results you've seen
today.
On the advisor remuneration front we now have the clarity we were looking for, and that
our proposed remuneration structure of 3% initial and 5% ongoing is fine, and,
importantly, that our current product charging structures are RDR compliant. We will have
to change our disclosure formats but, to be frank, we don't see that as too onerous given
Page 6 of 21



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C
Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2011-02-23

FINAL

what we already do. Just so you know, here's what appears on every illustrational quote
provided to clients today.
I won't read it out verbatim, but you can see in the second sentence of the first paragraph
that we describe the value of the remuneration the advisor receives and then we predict
how much that remuneration is going to be worth year on year, even taking into account
market growth. We've been doing that since 1995. So pretty explicit disclosure of how
much the advisor will receive and, whilst the words will change, the fundamental point of
disclosing advisor remuneration is not new and shouldn't be that much of a step change
for us.
Insofar as the industry is concerned we are very supportive of the drive for more
transparency, providing it's in a form that consumers can understand. We worry, though,
about the potential confusion created by the introduction of platform charges,
performance fees, admin charges and transaction costs, and just how consumers can
compare these potentially different currencies.

Bloomberg Transcript

Putting that aside, transparency is good, although it may bring pressure on margins. If it
does, I suspect that pressure will be felt harder by the fund management community than
the online service providers, where access to funds and fund managers on a DIY basis will
become more commoditized. The labels for advice are what they are; the suggestion that
the advice is restricted is causing some tensions amongst some wealth managers and
private client stock brokers.
For our part this really isn't an issue for St. James's Place and, if anything, partners are
proud of their tied relationship. In any event, several industry commentators believe that
most companies, including a large proportion of the current IFA community, will probably
end up in the restricted space. Whatever the final outcome I don't think consumers will
care that much. They will simply want to deal with someone they trust. That's what
important to them today and it will be in future, regardless of the label applied to the
advisor.
The law says there'll certainly be fewer advisors and so more competition for distribution
as fund managers and product providers fight for access to the market. And as it currently
stands the lower end of the mass market may be deprived access to advice and
education currently afforded by the advisor community. Those that do have access,
though, will probably get a better service.
And there is an increasing view that, in line with the point I made earlier about trust, the
familiar and respected brands will attract market share. St. James's Place is a very familiar
and respected brand.
Let me now turn to our investment management approach and recent developments
there. As you know, our investment management approach is overseen by an Investment
Committee made up of a couple of Plc executives, non-executive directors and
independent investment professionals. They appoint new fund managers and monitor

Page 7 of 21



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C
Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2011-02-23

FINAL

their performance and, if necessary, change the manager if we have a particular
personnel or performance issue.
The Committee are advised by Stamford Associates, a specialist firm who provide a huge
amount of research and analysis of our existing funds and fund managers and,
importantly, similar analysis and research about potential new managers, and not just
those in the UK, but across the entire globe. They give us access to some of the best
talent available in the fund management industry today and some who aren't otherwise
available to retail clients.
The most recent appointments have been the addition of two new managers at
Schroeder's, as Nick Purves
moved to RWC. We've also appointed Adrian Frost and Adrian Gosden of Artemis to run
a new UK and International Income for us, and replaced one of our existing managers with
Dan O'Keefe and David Samra of Artisan Partners who are based in Milwaukee.

Bloomberg Transcript

That brings the number of new managers appointed in the last two years to 15. And we
now have a truly global investment proposition provided by some 30 fund managers from
some of the best investment funds around. As well as giving our clients a huge choice, the
breadth of the funds available now enables us to offer a selection of new model
portfolios, which, in turn, should make life easier for our partners and clients alike.
Having stressed the importance of diversifying investments across asset classes and
management styles, we've modeled the range of portfolios for both growth and income
portfolios to cater for a range of client investment needs. And there are no extra charges
for those portfolios; they're all part of the service.
To support the portfolios and our other client-facing material we've developed
applications to take advantage of the rapidly growing use iPhones and iPads. Initially to
support partners, these applications are the first of a number of developments in our
back office. All aimed at the efficient use of modern technology whilst, at the same time,
aiming to reduce the expense and delays associated with paper and other delivery
mechanisms; an important set of initiatives that will make a significant difference to
partners and clients alike.
I hope today has demonstrated the consistency of the Group's performance and the
overall strength of the business. Our strategy is clear. We will continue to focus on the
growth and development of the partnership whilst ensuring that we invest in the right
products and backup that they need to provide a high-quality service and advice clients
can rely on.
We've established that our product charging structure is RDR compliant, removing any
uncertainty. We've strengthened our investment proposition with the introduction of new
managers and the model portfolios and will ensure that this crucial aspect of our business
remains at the forefront of our thinking. We still believe that embedded-value profits are

Page 8 of 21

Date: 2011-02-23

FINAL

the best measure of our performance year on year and that cash will follow and I hope
today's results provide real evidence that that's beginning to happen as we expected.
We've established a strong reputation in the wealth management market and we remain
committed to building long-term relationships with clients who can trust us to provide
sound financial advice and manage their investments well. And the need for that advice
today is as great as it's ever been. Our enviable reputation and track record has enabled
us to attract good quality advisors into the partnership and we remain very confident that
we'll be able to continue this growth over the next few years.
Given the market opportunity available to us, together with our ability to increase both the
size and productivity of the partnership, we remain incredibly well placed and committed
to our 15% to 20% per annum growth target over the longer term.
Thank you for your time today. I'd now like to ask my colleagues to join me at the front
here and we'll be happy to take any questions that you have. Thank you.

Questions And Answers
A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Who'd like to start? Okay, Colin.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Colin Simpson

{BIO 15894636 <GO>}

It's Colin Simpson from Goldman's. I've just got two questions, please. I see that Barclays
has closed its Financial Planning division and I think Resolution today said that it wasn't
going to sell any more investment products. Are you seeing anything different in your
marketplace? And are you going to do anything different to try and capitalize on maybe a
different -- a slightly less competitive environment?
I guess the second question for Mr. Gascoigne. What are you actually going to do with
those who haven't passed the QCA4? I imagine there are some key people still not
qualified.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

On the basis of sharing these things around absolutely [ph] Ian picks up both of those
points, thanks, as their both in the Distribution space.

A - Ian Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

I'll start with the second one first, if that's okay. We've got a program of intense support
for the whole partnership and our objective is to get as many people through no matter
how much work it takes. If there are some who struggle for whatever reason and they
can't operate as advisors, there may be possibilities post-RDR for them to become
introducers or to retain some relationship with the organization. But they will not be

FINAL

allowed to provide advice. But our commitment at the moment is to do whatever it takes
to help people on this journey.
In terms of the -- regarding Barclays, if I come on to that, and that's in terms of
Distribution, 1,000 advisors have been released by Barclays onto the marketplace. The
situation for us is more of selection than recruitment and they're not all appropriate for us.
They're not all suited to the levels of advice and the types of business people we require.
So we're in a nice situation with regards to that in terms of it's more about selection than
recruitment. I'm not sure if that answers your question about changes, but that's certainly
on the Barclays part.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Okay. And one of the things I'd just like to add -- I think Ian's being quite modest as well. It
really is a great result that we've got so many people through our professional
qualifications so early. And one of the reasons for that comes from the benefit of scale
effectively and the fact that we have such a strong organization with support teams, Ian's
field management team.

Bloomberg Transcript

We've been able to engage that entire team who, in turn, have engaged the partnership
in getting through these exams, so a lot of credit should go to Ian and the field
management team for actually making that happen and keeping the momentum. And
bear in mind last year there were only three exam sittings that the CII held; one in April;
one in July; and one in October. So to have got the results, to get those 3,000 exam
passes given the three very limited windows was a significant achievement.
This year life's different, because we move into an online mechanism that the CII have
facilitated so much more flexibility around when and where you can take your examination.
So we should see that traction and that momentum continuing and the probably partypolitical tie.
James, over here. Good morning.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Morning, a couple of questions. First of all, can you describe the nature of the assurance
you've had on RDR? Is it a bilateral letter from the FSA, is there an industry guidance note
that's out, or is coming out? How comfortable are you that you're in the clear on that?
And second, on the qualifications it looks like 1,350 of your guys are nearly qualified or
whatever. Are those full partners or are they registered individuals? What percent of the
partnership is qualified both in absolute terms and weighted by sales?

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Yes. To deal with the first point first, I will take that. The conversation with the regulators
has been very intense for some time to get clarity. And what I said in my statement was
about vertically-integrated firms, because there are a lot of different types of people
Page 10 of 21

Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2011-02-23

FINAL

operating in that space and they have lots of different structures. So we were seeking
clarity in that piece.
The nature of the clarification has been very explicit. Your current product structure is
compliant. The words that we've exchanged with the regulators have been very specific
and the statement itself, regarding my CEO statement, has been agreed in terms of the
conversation with the regulators. Is there any bilateral? No. I suspect these things are firmspecific and are about the way in which the product is structured and the disclosure that
we will partake of.
Insofar as the number of qualifiers, the 750 is made up of broadly 650 advisors and about
100 management and support staff, so some of our technical people that get in behind
the partnership. The 700'ish that are within one or two exams is all partners, is all in that
advisor space, so that's the proportions we're talking about.

Q - Toby Langley

{BIO 15924432 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, it's Toby Langley from Barclays Capital. I've got two questions; one is on the hiring of
new partners. Can you give us some sense as to the pipeline in terms of how many
potential hires you're talking to at any one point in time, and also a reminder of what is
the timescale in terms of the recruitment period per individual partner on average? That's
the first question.
Then the second question is on implementation costs around the IT proposition that
you're building here. Where is that in the numbers that we've seen, if at all, for 2010? And
can you give us some sense as to what further spending you're likely to incur in terms of
building that out?

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Okay. Well that's Ian again taking the recruitment point and we'll come back to the
investment in the IT in a moment.

A - Ian Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

We keep very close MI on all the work in progress in relation to hires, so in terms of the
numbers of meetings our business acquisition team are holding, the completion of
papers, attending at various events, to course, to appointment. Work in progress is at the
same level now as it was last year and the year before; it's fairly constant. The change
over the last two or three years is more to do with the quality of the individuals rather than
the volume of them. So the volumes are tracking previous volumes, but my take would be
the quality of the work in progress is higher.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

On the investment front I'll pass it over to Andrew, just to pick up in the short term.

I'm pleased to say if you turn to page 22 of this massive document you would actually see
the amounts. We've spent GBP5.7 million on both the investment and RDR last year. The
RDR training probably came at a cost of about GBP2m, GBP2.5 million and the balance
was on the investment proposition. And there will be a smaller amount this year, but there
will certainly be some more spend this year both on RDR and the investment proposition.

Just to add to that, the great thing about iPhones and iPad applications is they're relatively
inexpensive to bring to market. There's so much activity going on out there. David's team
put together, alongside the rollout of the new model portfolios, working with our IT
people, the iPad application in an incredibly short space of time and got it to market quite
quickly in terms of our market, St. James's Place Partnership. So they don't come with
huge overheads just to make use of modern technology.

Q - Toby Langley

{BIO 15924432 <GO>}

Just following up on that, how close are you to delivering a non-iPhone, non-iPad, i.e., a
website-based real-time analysis tool that perhaps some of your peers are able to offer
right now?

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

I'll let David take that because that sounds a hard one.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - David Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

No surprise there. As it happens we're developing our thinking around both financial
planning tools and modeling tools that partners will use with clients and we're expecting
to roll that out later this year. So bear in mind we're advice-led so we're not saying to
clients here's something you can do yourself. It's very much about enhancing relationships
between the partner and the client, but we're looking to develop these tools fairly rapidly
now because, actually, as David says, this is very cost effective for us.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Just getting back to the real-time point, sorry, just to -- I'm not an IT man, but the iPhone
application which I have seen and used is aimed at partners. It gives the real time, i.e., as
of last night valuations for their clients and their asset allocations. So we're really up to
speed with exactly what it is that we've got available anywhere in the organization.
Now there's a problem; we've got two hands. Barrie first and then we'll pass it forward to
Blair.

Q - Barrie Cornes

{BIO 2389115 <GO>}

Thank you. It's Barrie Cornes at Panmure Gordon, a couple of questions, if I may. First of
all, one for Andy. I just wondered if the FSCS charge is likely to be repeated next year,
obviously not key data, but not a war chest needs to be built up, so whether or not we

Page 12 of 21



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C

should model anything bigger than the normal GBP1 million to GBP2 million that you
normally have in.

FINAL

And secondly, I just wondered -- I think you're no longer allowing partners to run separate
businesses any more from St. James's Place. I just wondered if that's had any impact on
partner numbers or feeling within the partnership.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Andy, go first with the --

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Yes. First of all, we always suffer an FSCS charge, because we are in the Distribution
category. Usually it is around about GBP1.5 million to GBP2 million a year and, to echo what
David said earlier, we feel that's unfair, but that's part of operating in our arena.
This year we had an extraordinary charge of GBP4.8 million for key data, bringing the total
charge for the year to GBP6.2m. We keep a very close eye on what's going on out there
with various claims and we're not aware of any other significant claims falling into the
respective buckets that we're in. It's quite a complex process, but we're not aware of
anything. So we'd expect another GBP1 million or GBP2 million this year.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Ian, do you want to take the --

A - Ian Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

Yes. In terms of other business interests and some partners, the conversations we've
been having have led to the early retirements of a few partners and led to some making
business choices where we didn't feel the two -- the relationship was compatible. So
there has been some departures. In terms of a scale on that, it's probably about 15 over
the last four months.

Q - Barrie Cornes

{BIO 2389115 <GO>}

Thank you.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks very much, Blair Stewart from BofA Merrill. Two questions, David. You talked
about industry margin pressure as a consequence of RDR. Could you maybe add a bit of
color on that, how you expect that to manifest itself and, more importantly, whether it will
spill over onto your business? I'd be interested in that.
And the second question is on the dividend. Clearly, a very significant increase this year,
possibly another one next year, but still you're probably going to be paying about 50%,
60% of your cash result out. Why couldn't a business like St. James's pay out all of your
cash?

A - David Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

Okay.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

FINAL

Well let's deal with the dividend first and let Andy just talk about that because there's -it's a -- yes.

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Yes. I think in terms of the underlying cash result it's very dependent on what the stock
markets are doing and whilst we're confident so long as the stock markets don't drop
down to 3,000 again. So part of what we'll do, Blair, is to build up a reserve in order to
able to smooth out the dividend in the event of a small market downturn or something.
And in fact, the last two years -- sorry, 2008, 2009, we were paying out practically 100%
of the cash.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of the margin pressure, and I'll let David add on to this in a second as well, the -as I said in my words, I think the margin pressure takes two forms. One, I genuinely think
that if you look at the market between advice and execution only effectively, I think in that
DIY space where people will increasingly look for access to fund managers via Web, the
price will become very, very important. And that seems to me where -- that's where most
of the margin pressure is coming from as people compete in that space.
The emergence of platforms, the 'what supermarket.coms' or whatever they're called,
looking for price comparisons, you want access Neil Woodford direct, then you go and
you pay extra. So I think that for me is where there is going to be a pressure and I think
most of the fund management community seem to believe that to be the case as well.
The second aspect may be -- and the answer's nobody really knows here. Maybe in our
world at the top end, the spill, if you like, at the top end of the market, things might get a
bit more acute insofar as people seeing more explicit disclosure and saying, actually, for
the larger investments I want to talk about those tariffs, those fees, those rates. There is
an argument, given the nature of the disclosure we've been making over the last 10, 15
years, that that happens to me anyway and there's nothing new going to happen that
may change behavior in 2013. But frankly, as I've said just now, nobody really knows.
David, do you want to add to --

A - David Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

Yes, I think the only point I'd add to that is that this is also a conversation about
Distribution. And if you're talking to a fund manager about how they get to market, then
price is a very sensitive issue for them, post RDR. The same for an insurance company
that's trying to sell a pensions plan that hasn't got Distribution. They're going via
platforms, they're going to have to put their wares out there on a net price basis and
price becomes a very relevant factor of what they do.

FINAL

At vertically-integrated firms like St. James's Place our proposition is about the
combination of what we do for them, looking after clients' money and the advice that we
give, and Distribution is the one thing that actually we're very good at looking after and
taking to market. So it is a different conversation for us in terms of price pressure
generally than it is for the likes of a fund manager or an insurance company that hasn't got
Distribution.

Q - Unidentified Participant
At the interim stage you included some comments about your relationship with your
controlling shareholder. I haven't seen anything in today's statement. Can you just refresh
us on the situation?

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

I think this is one that I'll hand over to the Chairman.

A - Mike Wilson

{BIO 1553617 <GO>}

Probably the only question he will hand over to the Chairman. The answer is we've got
nothing further to report, James. Discussions haven't proceeded and nothing has
changed and our focus is just on producing the best results possible going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Duncan Russell

{BIO 15944951 <GO>}

Duncan Russell from JP Morgan. First question, could you talk about sales outlook for 2011,
what hurdle rates you've put in place for the partnership, how those have changed versus
2010? And generally the risk appetite of your customer base; are they at a full-risk
appetite now or is there further to go, do you think, there?
And secondly, on our dividend, the guidance for next year, should we be referencing this
33% increase in the full-year dividend or the 49% increase in the second-half dividend,
please?

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

I'll take that one very quickly. I think it's by reference to the full-year dividend and what
we're saying is that we're increasing the dividend significantly this year, i.e. 33%, with the
intention of a significant increase next year. And I guess there's a bit of code in there that
you could read would be something similar.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

I'll let David talk about the risk appetite and how clients are behaving and then, perhaps,
Ian can pick up sales outlook in terms of 2011 and beyond. So David.

A - David Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

If you look at where clients invest their money it's roughly 75/25 in favor of equity-type
growth strategies. That's pretty consistent over the year. In 2008 when the markets were
wobbly there was a shift more weighted towards corporate bond-type portfolios. So last
Page 15 of 21



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C
Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2011-02-23

year was 75/25 broadly speaking growth-type strategy; that is very much the same
continuing on at the moment. So that's the consistent picture.

FINAL

Because we are client bankers, quite diverse, and so you have some people coming to
look into invest their income because they're getting toward retirement age; other
people who are much younger looking at growth. That 75/25 is a fairly consistent picture
around this year and last year.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Ian, can you pick up on sales outlook?

A - Ian Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

Yes. I like to think we deliver consistent sales growth over the mid to long term and I see
no change in that. There's nothing at the moment. I don't know how confident I'm meant
to sound at these things.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

You can sound very confident, Ian.

A - Ian Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I'm very confident. No. We've maintained -- the targets are set and we maintain the same
level of hurdle rate we have done each and every year.

A - Unidentified Speaker
We've increased the productivity bonus level.

A - Ian Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

Yes. Well in terms of internal dynamic we increase all the targets for the partners and,
internally, the partner targets, associate partner, senior partner targets were all increased
and we ensure partners are motivated to keep driving the business forward. But that's
only one of the key drivers of the growth in sales. The other one is through recruitment
and the impact of recruiters. And one thing that I'm very, very sure on is that the
recruitment result of the last four to five years will have a profound impact on our sales
growth for the next five years.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

The key point to remember, 6% growth in the partnership last year, 9% growth in
partnership in 2009, you will see the benefits of that coming through in 2011. This year's
recruitment will play into 2012 and beyond. So there is real momentum in the business.
And on the productivity side, the other lever that drives the business on -- I know you may
remember the graph that's in the pack. Strong growth last year but, actually, more of a
recovery back onto that underlying growth trend, so a long way to go.

Sorry, at the back here. Have we got a mic? You've got one.

Q - Neil Welch

{BIO 15172689 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, Neil Welch from Macquarie. Sorry, three quick questions, the first for Andy probably.
Which is can you talk through why there's been decline in the margins for Unit Trust
business and, indeed, what the trend might look like going forward?
Second is, has been talk about differentiation of product for clients maybe looking across
the whole market here, particularly looking at high net worth clients in a different way. I
wondered whether you were thinking about a differentiating your offer at all there.
And the other thing was that of the 88 people that you added to the partnership net,
what does their qualification status look like and how does that figure in your work in
progress and, indeed, how you think about new recruits over the next couple of years?

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Andy, do you want to take the margins first?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Yes. As we move towards the RDR one of the things that we are committed to doing is
equalizing the commission across all of our products. And what that entails is increasing
some of the commission on the Unit Trust and decreasing the commission on some of
the Life products. And the two will compensate each other out. So you're there now with
the Unit Trust, the right margin you would see all other things being equal, a further
increase next year -- this year.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

David, do you want to talk about the clients?

A - David Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

Yes. Interesting, one of the things that we benefit from is a very strong relationship with
clients. And at the top end we've been talking to clients about what more we can do for
them and, in fact, what more they want us to do for them. So we would expect us this
year to put in place some changes in terms of the investment options for our private
clients and the high net worth client end and that will be expanding essentially the range
and style of types of investment structures they can access via St. James's Place. We
intend to keep them within our overall tax structures, but we'll expand the range of
investment options because that's the sort of thing they're asking us to do. So we're
looking at that right now and that's a piece of work we'll finish off this year and bring to
the market later this year.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Ian, do you want to talk about the personnel qualifications?

Page 17 of 21



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C
Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2011-02-23

A - Ian Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. There's no real difference at the moment. What we do do in terms of the business
acquisition team is to incentivize them to recruit diploma-qualified advisors as against
people with a lot of work to do. So they do get a little extra bit of recognition for fullyqualified new joiners.
And it may well be that next year there may be a disincentive to recruit people who have
an enormous amount of work to do, because we don't particularly want to be a kind of
exam lifeboat for people who've left it very late and have not been committed so -- but
there is some -- we do have some levers that we can use in that. But at the moment the
vast majority who join us are either qualified or on the same part of the journey as the rest
of the partnership.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Robin.

Q - Robin Buckley

{BIO 3596512 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, Robin Buckley from Deutsche. Just on the establishment expenses, I think I'm right in
saying that those were held flat this -- well 2010 relative to previous year. Can you just talk
about -- talk around how those were held back, particularly given the growth of the
business, and what we can expect in 2011? And perhaps also just a comment on
development costs that we can expect.
Then, just more generally, as we move towards RDR are there any conversations that you
are having with some of your higher-producing partners that are basically not wanting to
take the exams and are seeing that as an opportunity to exit the business? Thanks.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Andy, do you want to take the --

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Yes, I might just talk about this year's establishment expenses first. We've had three good
years of controlling establishment expenses, if I use that expression, and we will continue
to do so. We've had efficiency drives but we're probably about there now. What we're
seeing in terms of expenses this year and what we say in the statement is that we are
impacted by the VAT. We are impacted by Employers' National Insurance and for the first
time in three years we will be increasing salaries for our employees. So we expect
establishment expenses to be somewhere in the region of plus 5%. That's what we say in
the statement.

A - Ian Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

In terms of the higher-performing partners, a greater percentage of them are already
qualified than the rest of the partnership and are well on the journey, so it's actually the

Page 18 of 21

FINAL

opposite of what you expect. They've got the most to lose, I suppose, and they've got on
with it.
There are a small number of a certain age range and we've been surprised, actually, at
the way that they're entering into the process and are keen themselves to get qualified. If
you'd have asked me 18 months ago there may have been an anxiety from some of us
that these would be people who we'd really struggle with in terms of personal motivation
to start with.
But what's being demonstrated with the work we've done is actually that the motivation is
quite high and they're coming towards us to get qualified. Whether all of them will get
through, the old-and-bold high producer, is down to a lot of work, but I'm certainly not
concerned about that as an issue now, whereas, 18 months ago it may have been we may
viewed it as a bit of a risk.

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, I'd echo that. Again, I think a lot of the work that the management team have done
has helped that process come to reality. And I think if you look inside the St. James's Place
community it is very much a community; partners are helping each other. And what was
disabling people 15, 18 months ago, with the thought of the RDR exams, was the fear of
failure and I think some of them have realized that, actually, they know quite a lot.
They might not be used to exams, but they're very well experienced in the business
they're in. And some of their colleagues have encouraged them to start and take on the
journey. They get an exam, they pass it, their chest goes out, their feathers fluff up and
they get on with the next one. And that momentum, that traction has really taken on with
some force in 2010. So I think I exactly agree with Ian. I think if you today feel nothing but
pride and pleasure with what's happened 18 months ago, probably suffered the same
fear of failure that they did, so we're in a good place.
Last question. Shall we just -- no, last three questions.

Q - Marcus Barnard

{BIO 2103471 <GO>}

Yes, Marcus Bernard from Oriel. Just a quick one. Is there any change to the outlook for
development costs, i.e. meeting RDR costs, training etc.?

FINAL

Q - Daria Asadullaeva

{BIO 16508025 <GO>}

It's Daria from Merrill. I just wanted to ask about -- regarding the -- given that you've got
so many partners for whom exams are behind, what are your expectations on productivity
growth we'll see and possibly partnership growth?

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Well I think this -- again, Ian covered it just now. That we commit, we don't do predictions
and promotions of those -- any specific growth. 15% to 20% annualized growth over the
medium term is probably all I can say on that. It's what we commit to and what we think
we can deliver at this time. (inaudible).

Q - Daria Asadullaeva

{BIO 16508025 <GO>}

Given that their exams are behind, they would start working harder or will they say done?

A - David Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No. I think they'll start working harder. But we're not going to commit to anything other
than our normal corporate targets of 15% to 20% growth per annum, which is what we
aspire to do.

A - Ian Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

We mustn't forget that 3,000 exams were sat in 2010. Sorry, 3,000 exam passes. So if
we do the same again then we're well on track aren't we?
