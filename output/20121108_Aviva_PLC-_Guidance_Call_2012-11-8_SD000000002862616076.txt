Presentation

Good day and welcome to the Aviva Q3 Interim Management Statement, nine months to
September 30, 2012 conference call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I
would like to turn the conference over to Mr. John McFarlane, Executive Chairman. Please
go ahead.

John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us. I've got Pat Regan our Financial
Officer with me here. The purpose of this is essentially to give you an update on Q3 which
is pretty much business as usual from my standpoint. So I will let Pat take you through that.
I think I've actually expanded the Q3 update just because I'm sure a lot of questions are
on people's minds as to what progress are we making on the various initiatives. I think it's
Page 1 of 32

important to then stand back and say, what are we trying to do here.

FINAL

But clearly over a number of years Aviva has got itself into a position where whilst there is
some very attractive things and a very strong brand, we've actually systematically
dragged down the value of the organization by having businesses that produce subeconomic returns. And by inefficiency inside the organization.
So it's become necessary to draw a line on that and then put in a program that will actually
transform that. And essentially there were four major things that I put in the release that I
was focusing on.
The first, of course, is to appoint a high quality CEO. Now part of the problem here is that
everybody's expectation is at five past eleven today I'm going to make an announcement.
Well I can assure you that isn't going to happen.

Bloomberg Transcript

As of this week, we were still interviewing external and internal candidates. We have
completed independent reports on them. And we're also doing checking, we're also
doing consultation with regulators. So that process has to complete before we can make
an announcement. But we are actually in good shape and on track and certainly in line with
the timetable that we set out as a Board. So I'm very happy with where we're heading
there.
The main objective financially was the concern over the company's capital level and
volatility of the balance sheet. And obviously we're working on taking the risk down and
building the capital up. Again we're making very good progress in that with our economic
capital levels and IGD rising since the beginning of the year.
And in fact we've also put in the release something about the non-core disposals,
highlighting the US. The important thing about that to understand is that it is a non-core
business, it's not a business that we should continue with given the target returns that
we're looking for. But actually the benefit to us is considerable from a capital standpoint
which is our number one financial priority.
And in executing that, if we can at the levels we are currently working with, it will bring us
out at or close to our minimum target capital; economic capital ratio. So it actually kills two
birds with one stone.
As with respect to the other disposals, they tend to be individual markets. They are quite
long in gestation. We will dispose of them all. They will be at prices which are perfectly
acceptable and we estimate that on average we will be able to do that around book value
and probably better.
Then finally, one of the problems that we have is that we're dealing with a very, very
complex transformational program here. Given the entrenched nature of some of the
culture and values that Aviva and also some of the analysis of our business has not given
us the real signals as to what we should be doing. So we've put in this very
Page 2 of 32



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2012-11-08

comprehensive transformation program. I've given you a complete rundown on all the
things we're working on just to give you a sense of this.

FINAL

The one thing that's probably making the biggest difference is when we get to the subanalysis of the individual business cells, we're finding at the micro level areas of strength.
But we're also finding areas, even within good businesses where we're burning returns
and producing negative returns.
So this analysis in and of itself will be self-correcting and will cause us either to improve
revenues within the segment to reduce costs to manage losses more effectively or to
withdraw capital. Or it may cause us, in fact to increase the investment in capital and
expense in businesses with very high opportunity that actually we've been under-investing
in.
So it's actually probably the most productive and sharp end nature of the program we're
running. It's the bit that we're wrestling, to the ground quickly and of course we are
actually building the result of that into our 2013 and 2014 plans as quite hard numbers. So
that is going really quite well.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now all of that said, getting to this hasn't been completely straightforward given the
nature of the company that we're dealing with. Sometimes it's been a bit frustrating but
actually as we work through it we're actually breaking it down and getting it to where we
need to do.
I'm actually really quite happy with where we've reached. So on that note I'd like to pass
you to Pat who will take you through the results.

Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Thanks John. Good morning to everybody. On the Q3 results first, obviously the economic
backdrop continues to be challenging. Both in terms of consumer demand but also
obviously the low interest rate environment. Nonetheless, the operating profit trend is
broadly in line with the one we saw at the half year.
Our capital generation, capital generation is GBP100 million better in the first nine months
than at this time last year. And is over GBP200 million higher if you adjust for the disposals
of the RAC and Delta Lloyd. Most of that improvement has come from a combination of
continued lower capital usage, better capital allocation across the Life businesses and
higher in force generation.
Particular progress has been made in UK Life, where again we've decreased capital
usage, principally from writing lower bulk purchase annuities and lower guaranteed bond
sales. And also increasing capital generation from the back book.
Italy has now returned to positive capital generation with the action was taken to reduce
new business guarantees. And France and Canada continue to be reliable and good

generators of capital.

FINAL

As John noted, we continue to make good progress improving capital allocation,
particularly between the 58 cells. But there's still more to do. What we are doing now is
taking the capital allocation down to the next level with sub-cell analysis. So an individual
cell, one of the 58 might have 10 or 11 sub-cells within it and we're differentiating our
capital allocation within those sub-cells.
Now all of that means we're putting clearly value over volume particularly on the Life
business. And when combined with market conditions, that means overall long-term
saving cells around about 6% in the first nine months of the year to just over GBP22b.
Life new business profitability is ahead of our target with IRRs at just under 14%. The UK
continues to perform well, protection sales are up 23%, individual annuities up 11% and
Group personal pensions, important for auto enrollment, up 15%.
We've targeted a reduction in book purchase annuities and guaranteed bond sales and
overall that meant that UK sales were level. And this deliberate shift in mix has seen the
IRRs increase from 15% to 16% this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

The UK Life business remains one of the key strengths of Aviva and we're confident that
the continued growth in those targeted areas of annuities, protection and group pensions
will provide a strong platform for the future.
Given our focus on capital allocation. And the subdued demand for savings products, we
have seen a fall in new business in Mainland Europe. We've actively worked to increase
prices and reduce guarantee levels in France, Italy and Ireland. And on the back of that
with-profit sales in Italy are now 36% this year on the back of a 47% decrease last year.
Our focus also remains on the effective management of the in-force books in each of
these markets. And maintaining retention levels to ensure that operating earnings remain
resilient.
In the US we've re-priced annuity products a number of times this year. The lag impact of
that you can now see on new business sales in the Third Quarter.
And in the emerging markets, overall it's flat with a 20% increase in Singapore offset by
lower sales in Poland due to the regulatory changes there.
Turning onto General Insurance where premiums were steady at GBP6.7 billion and a
combined ratio at 96.7%, slightly down on the half year due to higher weather claims in
the Third Quarter.
The personal motor market is our strongest and most profitable area in both the UK and
Canada. In the UK, personal motor sales were up 8% for the year, after adjusting for the

Page 4 of 32



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2012-11-08

FINAL

RAC impact and we now have over 250,000 new customers and over 2.5 million personal
motor policies in the UK. Personal motor rating is slightly softer now. But obviously this
follows big increases over the last two or three years. And the profitability of that book
remains good.
Our UK commercial business, motor rates increased about 6%. But the other lines -commercial lines is less positive and we have been more selective about the business
we're writing there. A combination of good risk selection, rate increases and cost control
means the UK combined ratio comes in at 97%.
In Canada, sales were up 5% to GBP1.6 billion and there's been a good increase
improvement in the combined ratio to 93% this year from 96% last year. And again this is
due to a range of actions on both retention, rating, underwriting and underlying growth in
our customer base.
Finally onto the net asset value. The MCEV net asset value increased to GBP4.46, up
GBP0.25 compared to the half year. Then the IFRS net asset value is GBP3.97 per share in
line with the half year with the increase in operating profits offset by movements in the
pension scheme due to a lower discount rate.

Bloomberg Transcript

Just to talk briefly about strategic progress. Building our financial strength remains the
single most important priority for the Group. To this end we've seen capital levels
increase since the half year. At the end of October, our estimated economic capital
surplus is GBP5.3b; it's a ratio of 146%, up GBP800 million since the half year. And up
GBP1.7 billion since the last year end.
Similarly, the IGD solvency surplus is now GBP3.7 billion or a ratio of 167%, up GBP1.5 billion
since the end of last year.
The increases were due to a combination of both improving market conditions. But also
the actions we have taken through the year. In the Third Quarter we reduced our holding
in Delta Lloyd, have done some further work to de-risk the pension funds and we've
extended our equity hedging program as well.
We've also sold down roughly EUR1 billion more Italian sovereign debt in the Third
Quarter, bringing the total we've sold down this year to nearly EUR3b. Now the sell-down
has been offset partially by increases in market values. So our net shareholder exposure
and this is now in pounds, GBP500 million direct shareholder exposure, down from
GBP800 million at the start of the year. And participating exposure is GBP4.7b, down from
GBP5.6 billion at the start of the year.
We've also confirmed today that we are in discussion with external parties to sell our US
Life and Annuities business. Inevitably this disposal can only be made to a substantial
discount to our IFRS book value; however, a sale would increase both the market
consistent embedded value and significantly benefit our economic and capital surplus. We
believe such a sale would be in the best interests of the Group.

FINAL

Narrowing our focus is another key strategic priority along with the potential disposal of
our US business, we continue to work on the 15 other red cells. In addition to Delta Lloyd,
we've announced the sale of our Sri Lankan business. We're working closely with banks on
eight other exits. And we're taking further radical action on the four remaining red cells.
We expect to make further announcements on these in the first half 2013.
Our third strategic priority is to improve the performance of the Group. We set out today
the nine programs to drive these forward. And within these programs we're working on
well over 100 separate initiatives. And have set out details on some of these in the
Release. I won't go through them now on the call. But will obviously be happy to take your
questions later.
There is no doubt it did take initially more time and energy to build momentum across the
programs than perhaps we expected. But we are now comfortable we are making good
progress.
So to conclude, although the economic backdrop clearly continues to be challenging, our
operating profit trend is broadly in line with the half year. We're making good progress on
all of our strategic priorities to build the company's financial strength, narrow our focus
and improve earnings performance.
We'd now be happy to take any questions you've got.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) We will now take our first question from Andy Hughes of Exane
BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Hi, guys, thanks very much. A couple of questions if I could on the General Insurance side
to start. Just noticing the quarterly trend in general insurance premium income is down
quite a bit, that's note eight. In fact it looks like it's down 10% over the quarter versus Q2
and down quite a bit versus last year. Maybe you could talk a bit about what's happening
on the general insurance premium income side.
Also, could you give more detail on the weather impact that's impacted the combined
ratio? Because I'm not getting the same message from anyone else that there was a
significant amount of weather in Q3. So is it an Aviva specific thing?
The third thing is a request really. On terms of asbestos survival ratios, can you just
confirm what they were at the end of the year and maybe if you've got an updated
number that would be very helpful. Thank you.

FINAL

Thank you for the last question, Andy. On the GI premium terms, I've got Robin Spencer
with me. So I'll let Robin talk to this. Essentially it's seasonality, the Third Quarter is
seasonally a little bit lower than the second. You really need to compare Third Quarter this
year with last year. But Robin, do you want to give it a little bit more color towards that?

A - Robin Spencer

{BIO 16514830 <GO>}

Yes that's generally a trend that we always see in the Third Quarter. I think to add to that,
Andy, if we cast our minds back a year we were at that stage we were still growing
strongly into a hardening market with personal motor rates going up 18%, commercial
motor rates going up 13%. Clearly we are in a different environment altogether at the
moment.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think that's the key reason for the different trend. I think the other thing I'd just pull out is
that we are taking more action, given what's been said about cells and sub-cells, we're
taking a lot more action to really focus on any of those segments of business where we
can't write business profitably and we're not exiting any lines but we are clearly shrinking
and taking action to reduce our overall exposure in those lines where we can't write
profitably.
I drew out a few in the announcement that came out this morning. Such as bluewater hull,
some agricultural segments, some leisure segments, pubs and restaurants and things we
find it difficult to write those profitability both in the UK and in Ireland at the moment. So
they'd be the key reasons why we're seeing some overall reduction in the pace of
growth. But overall we're still year on year up about 2%.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Just a quick follow on question to that if I could. I guess the point about rates -- that's one
of the reasons why I didn't understand why it's come off. Because obviously the rate
increases were going through the book in Q3 2011 and has the rate decline all gone
through the book in Q3 2012? Presumably it works its way through the renewal book over
time and that's why I guess I was surprised to see the decline this early on.
It begs a second question, is this rebalancing, how much more of the rebalancing is there
to go in terms of premium volumes? Thanks.

A - Robin Spencer

{BIO 16514830 <GO>}

I think in terms of rebalancing, one of the big advantages of our book, Andy, is the fact
that we do have multi-channel multi-products which allows us to dial up and dial down
where we're allocating our capital. So I wouldn't call it a one-off rebalancing, I think it's
really how we manage the book on an ongoing basis is to decide which segments we can
make money in because of our broad distribution that allows us to actually increase our
overall penetration in those segments when it's good for us. So I wouldn't say it's an
overall reshaping, it's part of a discipline that we have in running the overall book.

FINAL

I think your observation is fair in terms of the overall earnings of it right through the book.
You know that actually the full earning won't come through of some of those rate
increases for 18 months. So we're seeing that roll off. But at the same time we were
taking actions last year to exit some lines that were unprofitable and we're seeing some
rate reduction. So I think at a press release class you can't see that necessarily in the
numbers. But that's actually what's happening.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Overall, Andy, I think if you look at the General Insurance, Canada is still growing that's
been true for a while. GI overall in the UK where we're growing personal motor and happy
to do so, on commercial lines you've just got to be a little bit more selective as the rating
increases because the rate environment is a little bit softer.
On your weather point, taking it into context, there was slightly higher weather in Canada
in the Third Quarter versus the first half of the year. There was actually quite good
weather for the first half of the year. The combined for the discrete quarter overall for
Aviva was a bit over 98%. So it was a nudge up rather than anything particularly to shout
about.
Then on your asbestos question I don't know the answer off the top of my head. I'll have
to come back to you on that.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thanks.

Operator
We will now take our next question from Andrew Crean from Autonomous. Please go
ahead.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Good morning, all. It was just a couple of numbers questions I wanted to ask. Firstly, now
that you're talking about the US sale, could you give us the figures for the US business in
terms of what its contribution to economic capital available and economic capital
requirement were. And also what its tangible IFRS NAV was. That was one question.
The second question was what was the pension fund surplus at the end of the Third
Quarter? And what is the -- I know you've just done a triennial valuation, what is the
current funded pension fund deficit?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Thank you, Andrew. First question first. On the US book value, if you look at the half-year
information you get the total enterprise value including everything on IFRS basis is GBP3.2
billion or the pure equity number is a bit over GBP2.4b.

Page 8 of 32

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

That's for tangible, the GBP2.4b?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

FINAL

Both of them are the full IFRS numbers, including (inaudible).

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Right.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

The second bit that you can see there is that the full MCEV enterprise value is about just
over GBP300m. We haven't given -- so that gives you, if you like the half of your answer
to economic capital.
We haven't disclosed economic capital by business. What I would tell you that the risk
charges for the US business if you like the required capital element is well over GBP1b.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

There's one other thing about the US is that because the business is growing and the
nature of the product, we are adding a significant amount of capital each year. So were
we to delay this, while you could argue that you might have different market
circumstances, which we in fact doubt, nevertheless the maintenance of the business and
its growth would add significant amounts of equity next year and the following year. And
we do not believe that that additional equity would be released in sale at book value.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Great, okay thank you. And on the pension?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

On the pension scheme, Andrew, the surplus, accounting surplus was GBP1.4 billion at the
end of the Third Quarter.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

That's pre-tax isn't it?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes. We haven't yet gotten to the (inaudible).

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

But is that likely to be different from where it was at the end of last year?

We will now take our next question from James Pearce of UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - James Pearce

{BIO 16758460 <GO>}

Morning, everybody. Couple of questions. You haven't been explicit about the dividends
today. But given your comment about cash generation, economic capital and cost savings,
is it reasonable for us to assume that the outlook on dividends is at least no worse than it
was previously?

Bloomberg Transcript

Second, could you put your (inaudible) personal UK motor into a bit more context, given
that some of your peers are doing their best to shed business in UK personal motor and
why the different approach at Aviva. Thank you very much.

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

It's John. I'd say that nothing at all has changed on dividend. The statements that we
made that we would try and hold the dividend but couldn't guarantee to commit to it, was
in relationship to 2013 at the time we made it. Simply because when you think about
what's happening here is that we're taking action to reduce earnings in a number of
quarters because of the economic nature of the business.
We are disposing of non-core assets. We will be writing down the book value of the
organization. The earnings will drop and at the same time we've got this other program
which is trying to replace those earnings.
Of course, superficially, notionally if you take 2011 and take 2014 we're trying to make sure
that the earnings that are lost through disposals are recovered through the
transformation program. And if you remember 2011 was not a clean year, we've had a lot
of restructuring costs and other charges below the line. Where we are genuinely trying to
make 2014 a clean year. Which would mean if we achieve all of that, it would mean that
2014 is a much better year than 2011.
Now, of course, the problem with all of that is in maintaining a fixed dividend level when
you actually are adding earnings and cash flows decline. It does place more stress on that
in 2013. Essentially what we are doing is modeling on a month-by-month basis what the
Page 10 of 32



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2012-11-08

FINAL

cash flows and earnings are, because obviously if you think about the US for example, that
cash would not be released to the group center until the middle of next year or whatever.
It's going to be down there somewhere.
So we need to pace all of this, just to make sure. We are not more uncomfortable with
this at all. In fact we are broadly where we thought we were going to be. Therefore
there's really nothing different here but that might just throw a bit of color on why we've
said, look, we're going to try and do it but we can't commit to it until we actually see how
some of this execution plays out and how the pacing of it all plays out. But our intent to try
and hold the dividend is genuine.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Hi, James. On the personal motor. And again I've got Robin with me here as well. My
reflections on the personal motor market over a number of years is that to be successful
in that market you need a combination of obviously brand, scale, cost efficiency and really
good underwriting techniques.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think over the last two to three years we've taken some really good steps forward on
each of those. You will have seen this year we launched Quote me Happy, that's obviously
an internet only very low cost, targeted at certain segments. That's actually been quite a
big part of the roads and policy count this year.
So a combination of all of those means that we can both grow policy count but also with a
good profitability. That wasn't always true for us. But over the last couple of years we've
made big strides in each of those areas.
Robin, is there anything you would like to add?

A - Robin Spencer

{BIO 16514830 <GO>}

Yes, probably a couple of things just to add to that, Pat. Our expense ratio is probably the
lowest it's been since the year 2000 at the moment. So we're really building on the scale
point as Pat's just said.
We are growing Quote me Happy, we've probably got a higher proportion of our let's say,
preferred segments, than in any other part of our book because we are able to more
discretely price for those segments we really want to compete in and really want to have
on our books.
Another competitive advantage I think we've got is the fact that actually it might not be
very obvious but 53% of our total personal motor book still comes through brokers. And
actually we don't see that as price sensitive as some of the other segments. I'm sure you
all know that we've seen big fall offs in the motor rates that we're achieving. But I think
we've seen -- certainly we haven't seen as big a decline in the broker segments as we
have in the direct segments.

Page 11 of 32

FINAL

The last thing I'd just add to that is, as it relates to our growth. Whilst we have seen 8%
growth this year, I would anticipate that growth slowing and our ability, given that rates
have come off, our ability to write new business profitably that adds economic value over
the life time value of that policy obviously declines. So I'd expect the growth to probably
fall off a little bit as we go through the rest of this year and into next.

We will now take our next question from Blair Stewart of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Three quick questions from me. Firstly, could
you comment please on how your net flows have developed across the Life business?

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, there was a big pick up in investment sales, up 70% year-on-year. Just
wondered if there is any one-off special effects in there or what we should think about
going forwards.
Thirdly, just on the US disposal or potential disposal. You're saying that that disposal will
take you into the target economic capital range. I think you've said in the past that if you
assume US equivalents, it would take you to broadly about 165% on an economic capital
basis. So I'm just wondering if a disposal will take you towards your top end of your target
range or otherwise. Thanks.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Hello, Blair, thanks for those. I'll take them in reverse order. On the US, no. I think it's safer
to assume it will get us around the economic capital range. But in the bottom end of it and
not the top end of it. It's still important though getting into our economic capital range is
an important step forward for us.
On the net flows, the trends are broadly similar to the ones we saw at the half year. So
you see in the UK the new products if you like, demonstrating positive flows and then a
run off of the old endowment style with-profit products. Some good retention in
Continental Europe but lower new business sales. So a moderate, very moderate decline
in Continental Europe and very much a similar trend in the Third Quarter.
I think the main thing in investment sales actually isn't so much in the UK business, it's

obviously we're at 146% today and you can assume it gets us close to the bottom end of
the range, Blair.

We will now take our next question from Oliver Steel of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning, everyone. Two questions from me. The first is about the economic capital
requirement. I know these things are slightly vague. But it appears to have gone from
GBP11.3 billion at the interim to GBP11.8 billion as at end of October, backtracking from the
ratios you've given us. So I was wondering why that was because it seems quite a big
uplift.
Then the second thing is the IRRs on new business. You were achieving 14.4% I think at the
half year. You're now saying 13.8% at the nine month stage. I guess I've got two questions
on that. One is why has that happened. And then secondly, it slightly worries me more
generally that you're seeing quite a sharp deterioration between half year and nine
months in the combined ratio. You're seeing quite a sharp deterioration in the IRR. Is there
anything going on here that perhaps is not just down to exceptional weather and things
like that?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Thank you, Oliver. On the economic capital, the biggest movements on that on both the
available and the required is generally for us, credit spread movement. So as credit
spreads come in, you get an increase in both your available and your required. Your net
number goes up and the ratio goes up but you do see both of them move. So that would
be the principal reason why the required increase from the half year.
On the IRRs I think we were 13.6%, David, at the half year.

A - David Barral

{BIO 17035123 <GO>}

That's right.

FINAL

With each individual discrete quarter this year has gone marginally up, not seismically. But
marginally up on the IRRs. So I think we're actually moderately up, nothing greatly to shout
about but moderately up from where we were.
On the general insurance as I mentioned earlier, the discrete quarter combined was a
little over 98%. So still okay. We were good in the UK, we're about 97% discrete for the
UK. Canada had slightly higher weather in the Third Quarter versus the first half. Had a
98% discrete for the quarter and 93% year to date. A very strong result.
Candidly, where we're working a bit harder is we've got a couple of smaller businesses, in
places like Turkey where we need to do more work and we need to bring some of the
skills to Turkey and to a certain extent Italy, though we had Canada and the UK to bear in
those markets. So UK and Canada still performing very strongly.

We will now take our next question from Greig Paterson from KBW. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Greig Paterson
Morning, everyone, three questions. I wonder if you -- actually three and the first one has
two parts. I wonder if you could just give us a feeling in terms of written business, what
your new rate increases in September you had on UK motor and also what your claims
inflation as a percentage was year on year in the Third Quarter.
Also you've done a lot of re-pricing of product on the Life side. I was wondering to what
extent that is through the system. Ignoring the slowdown in European economic activity, I
was wondering should we be penciling some further declines in volumes in the Fourth
Quarter into the First Quarter next year? Or is the structural decline already in the system
now?
Then just in terms of individual annuities and protection products in the UK. I was
wondering do you have further plans to gain market share? I wonder if you can talk about
your market share and your product development there, what your plans are. Thanks.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

All right. Thanks, Greig, nice to hear from you. I'll let David come in, David Barral come in
on number three.
On UK motor right now, as Robin alluded to earlier, it's small declines in direct pricing on
new business and pretty flat in the broker channel is what we're seeing. Claims inflation
trends I think 4%-ish. So broadly similar to what we've seen before on that. But you'll

remember we've talked about quite a bit before, some of the risk selection stuff we've
done over the last two or three years has meant our bodily injury frequency has definitely
been lower than the market. We haven't seen the upticks that others have seen on that.

FINAL

To the re-pricing trend --

Q - Greig Paterson
Sorry, Pat, those are year on year, Third Quarter this year versus Third Quarter last year in
terms of your (inaudible) lines and direct and flat in broker?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes. That's right, Greig.

Q - Greig Paterson
And on a written or an earned basis?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

That in effect would be on a written basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

The re-pricing ones differ a little bit country by country. The US certainly there's a little bit
of a lag effect so I think you could expect to see, continue to see a downward trend in
terms of volumes.
Italy is probably similar we've taken a number of actions there in terms of how we write
new business and guarantee levels on new business.
In France, it partly depends on the overall market and that's probably a bigger factor
there where there's been a subdued demand overall for consumer savings products. We
are broadly in line with the overall market trend.
David, on individual annuities and protection.

A - David Barral

{BIO 17035123 <GO>}

Yes. So if I take protection first, Greig. We've built our market share in the IFA market
consistently over the last three years or so. We tend to fight it out with L&G on a monthto-month basis, who is number one in the IFA market.
Most of our growth though now is coming from strategic partnership. So you will be aware
that we've been focused now on people at the Post Office, Santander we launched last
year which is now coming on quite well. Barclays already in training, in fact recently just in
September launching a new exclusive five year deal with Tesco Bank which is still to come
through. So that's where our focus is in terms of continuing to grow that business which is
very profitable for us.

FINAL

In terms of annuities we had built a very strong position. We are sitting with well over 20%
market share. As part of the strategic review that John and Pat talked about. We looked at
that very carefully, decided that we would operate within a stricter capital budget on
annuity. That's allowed us to take a number of price actions. So that's sitting -- actually
(inaudible) quite well as well. So it's now sitting even more profitable than it was before.
Indeed recently we've been writing up business with zero capital strain.
So that remains focused, we've got a full suite of annuity products in there. I think
unrivaled in the market quite frankly. Standard, enhanced, we've got fixed term products
there as well, all the way to draw down and equity release. So this is a market, part of the
franchise we're absolutely owning and winning on at the moment and we continue to do
that profitably going forward.

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

I might make a comment on that annuity question, it's John. This is demonstrating the kind
of tradeoffs we're having to make in the organization at the moment. Given that we
prioritize capital first and then return second and then, in a sense, earnings third, the fact
that annuities are capital hungry causes us a problem when our capital ratios are below
our target level.

Bloomberg Transcript

So for that reason we placed some constraint on the ability of the annuity to grow.
Coincidentally the re-pricing of annuities has actually brought them to incredibly good
returns. So the rational thing for us to do is actually to add more capital to the annuity
book now because of the returns that we can get. But given that we've prioritized capital
over return we're actually slowing it down notwithstanding that.
That shows you when you get into this circumstances, if you're capital strong, you can take
advantage. And in an unlimited way of market opportunities when they arrive. But when
you actually are nudging under your capital levels you actually need to make tradeoffs and
this is a sort of trade off.
Now that said there would be a point at which where there would be some limit on the
proportion of our book that we'd have in annuities. Now we're probably short of that but
nevertheless I think there is a boundary condition at some point where you want to have a
bit more diversification other than that. But it just illustrates the kind of thinking that's
going on here. And in fact in other circumstances, we'd be putting our foot on the gas
here. But at the present time until such time as we get our capital ratios up, we'll probably
continue to walk this fine line.

Q - Greig Paterson
Sorry, does that mean since you've done the re-pricing given your new capital constraint in
this line, do you think you've lost market share or flat? Just to give an idea where the
market is going, whether the market is doing the same thing as you?

We will now take our next question from Chris Esson of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Chris Esson

{BIO 6194371 <GO>}

Hi good morning, two questions. Firstly of the increase in economic capital during the
quarter, I wondered if you could outline how much of that came from the US versus other
regions.
Secondly, also on the economic capital. And MCEV, to what extent will some of these cost
saves that you've achieved flow through to VIF and if or into perhaps some of the softer
forms of economic capital. Has that been reflected yet? Will it be reflected and to what
extent will that affect your ratios?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Great, I haven't got the specific number the US to hand, Chris. It certainly did go up slightly
in the quarter, something in the region of GBP100 million or GBP200 million I think is
broadly the order of magnitude.
Yes. Absolutely on your second; and that was; sorry I'm finishing off the question on the
US. The net obviously mainly due to narrowing credit spreads in the quarter. All things
being equal, the US actually declined, order of magnitude around GBP300 million a year
just because of the profile of the new business.
In terms of cost save absolutely, yes. We talked a little bit before that there's a number of
levers of putting up our economic capital ratios. One of those is as you reduce your
Page 17 of 32



Company N ame: Aviva PL C

expenses it improves your MCEV embedded value and hence your economic capital
ratios as well.

FINAL

We're not seeing that today. We're literally taking the actions or benefits in the future on
that. So over time as we get into 2013 and certainly 2014 you'll start to see that captured
in the MCEV embedded value and the economic capital ratios.

Q - Chris Esson

Can you provide indication of what percentage of the cost save targets are likely to fall
within the Life business?

We will now take our next question from Nick Holmes of Nomura. Please go ahead.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Hi there. Thank you very much. Just a couple of question. First one is on the US. I wanted
to ask about the rational for the US disposal. Isn't there an argument that you're selling US
Life at a cyclical low, whereas you could for example be selling Canadian P&C at a cyclical
high? Basically the problem in the States is obviously low interest rates. If these rise then
presumably the impact on your economic solvency will be just as good as if you sold the
operation. So I wondered if you could just take us through that.
Then secondly, with your French Life business, just wondered obviously the French banks
are a very big threat seeing massive outflows. Where do you see this all going in France?
Thank you very much.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Hi there, Nick. When we did the strategy in July there were a couple of things we said.
First priority is raise economic capital and you look at the most intelligent way to do that.
The second is we want to be in the right sort of businesses and the right sort of
businesses are the ones with really good market conditions and either they currently
produce good economic returns or they've got a realistic plan to do so.

Page 18 of 32



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2012-11-08

FINAL

The combination of all of that analysis led us to the view that the US wasn't the right fit in
our portfolio. It just delivers an okay return on local stat capital. But as you remember was
about a 3.8% return on economic capital. So a combination of that. We did not see any
realistic scenarios where that would get to our target levels.
Secondly, the difference between local stats, the US view of the world and economic
means you can generate a significant economic capital positive with that type of
transaction.
I guess we could debate timing and whether conditions will improve in the future and
whether that would flow through to valuations of US Life businesses; I have a slightly
different view to you. I don't think there's a clear path where that's going to happen.

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I was just going to say a couple of things. We look at the businesses across the cycle. So
across the cycle the US business, because it's well short of our economic -- well, it's
actually destroying value on an economic basis systematically. But it actually looks
reasonable on a local books basis. So for that reason you can't sell it intelligently but you
can't hold it intelligently. I think that's the problem that we have here and it's making that
trade off.
It doesn't diversify very well either inside. So the collateral benefits to the Group actually
are negligible. So the other part of that is given that we're looking at businesses across
the cycle, yes, it's absolutely true, we could sell our Polish business when the economic
growth in Poland if 5%. We can sell our Canadian business now which probably is at a
slightly cyclical high. So I would agree with that.
On the other hand, through the cycle this is a very attractive business for us and yes, we
do not need to make that decision for capital reasons. In fact, that business diversifies
very well for us and actually should Solvency II come in, it will actually be a very attractive
for us in a Solvency II world.
So there are lots of reasons, not just through the cycle value but actually from other
collateral benefit reasons why the Canadian business is more attractive to us than the US
business.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

So could I say the bottom line is that you are taking a call on interest rates. You're
assuming that US interest rates are going to remain low for a year or two and that makes
the US Life business fundamentally unattractive in the medium term.

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

Look, that may or may not be the case. We are not making a call on interest rates. We are
making a call on the stress scenarios in the United States which are incredibly unattractive
for us.

We're making a call on which businesses we want to be part of.

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

We're making a risk call here as well that adding sequentially incremental capital every
year in this area will not produce value for us and will take our risk to a level that we would
not regard as sensible.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

No. That's clear. Thank you. The French question.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

The French question, this is on the role of French banks in insurance.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, just your feel of where the market is going. Do you think the French banks are going
to let up a little bit or is this going to remain? How worried are you basically?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

At the moment I think, the main trend we're seeing as I said earlier, is the overall
reduction in demand for savings products. I think that's the predominant one. We're not
expecting any great change in the tax laws which is good. So there had been some
discussion of that and how the tax laws around French insurance products.
In terms of the banking part of that, we're not actually seeing any enormous change on
that at the moment. So I don't think we are any more aware of that. As you know most of
the French banks do in house manufacturing of insurance and again our expectation is that
won't change.

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

I might say something, that just occurred to me about the US. If we were in a rich capital
position, would we sell the US? The answer is yes, we'd still sell it. So to me that's the key
decision here.
Then the next question is would we be better waiting, even if we were full capital, would
we be better doing that now or adding more capital and doing it later? We still believe we
should do it now.

We will now take our next question from Jon Hocking of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Morning, everybody. I've got three questions please. Firstly, just to come back on the
dividend. John, I think you mentioned that 2014 is intended to be the clean year. I just
wondered in terms of the dividend going forward, are we going to get a resolution of this
at prelims or is there an argument for waiting and seeing how '13 turns out and what the
underlying run rate is before you go forward on dividend policy. That's the first question.
Second question, in terms of the sub-cell analysis work, how far along the path are you on
that. When are you likely to get to a point where you are implementing any initiatives that
come out of that? That's the second question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then the third question is just interested in the comments in the Release and that were
made at the front of the call in terms of the difficulties in getting traction for restructuring.
Is that communication, is that organizational structure? What do you think the issues are
there and how are you going to overcome them? Thank you.

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

I'll deal with the first and then we'll maybe get David McMillan to maybe come in on the
sub-cell analysis and then I'll come back to culture at the end.
The dividend is not under active discussion here. It's not a matter that we've raised with
the Board. So we have a genuine intention of trying to hold the dividend. So it's not as if
it's permanently under active consideration.
But obviously one of the things that we need to do once the 2013 and 2014 plans are
sharpened up and we're still work in progress there. We just need to make sure that the
cash flows up into the center and the level of cash at the center gives us prudent cover.
That's all we really need to do. If we were to sell the United States then obviously the
cash at the center would increase very substantially anyway now. So were that to have
been today, we wouldn't even be discussing this event. It would be a non-issue.
So it's actually just making sure if we achieve what we want to in 2014, the cover is
perfectly respectable I've no issues in respect of that. The cash flow should be adequate
and so forth.

Page 21 of 32



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2012-11-08

FINAL

It's just is there some (inaudible) tightness in 2013 that we need to just make sure.
Because we want to be in a position that where there's decent cover there. All other
things being equal, it's not -- from a management standpoint, we've been relatively
comfortable with where we are with it.
But the trouble is, there's a lot of execution assumptions built in to what we've said. And
that's why we've said, look, we're genuinely trying to hold it. But you know, there are
circumstances where we just would be unable to; they're not a likely scenario. But they're
possible scenarios. I think that's the thing we're trying to do. We've actually managed to
hold it so far. But remember, 2013 is that sweet spot where it just becomes tougher and
we don't know the answer but we think we know what the answer is. I think that's where
we are.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Thank you. In the past you've highlighted you're not a big fan of the scrip. How does that
fit into the decision making? Is it possible you make a decision on the scrip later or is
everything going to happen?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

It's a tomorrow decision. The question will be when things normalize are we able to
substitute a cash dividend for the script\ or not? That's the question and that's not a today
question at all, that's a down the road question. Make no bones about it, the reason for
the scrip when you look backwards at Aviva it's actually been necessary to bolster capital
levels. So we just want to get off that basically and then make rational decisions as what's
in shareholders' interests.
Now we're still in the process of building capital so we've retained the scrip. But it has no
place long term in normal circumstances and it's just how intelligently can we get to
normal circumstances and can we? So I think we've pushed that into the future rather than
a present consideration.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Okay so just to make sure I fully understand what you're saying. Effectively '13 could be a
tight cash year. You intend to hold the dividend but it's possible you hold the dividend with
the scrip policy intact and then at some point when things look better you could actually
eliminate the scrip. Is that fair?

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

That's an ideal scenario. All other things being equal. But I'm not committing to any of that
but that would be a rational aim for us.

{BIO 17298829 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, John. Good morning, David McMillan here. Just on the sub-cells, I think we are
viewing the forensic approach to the sub-cells of the business as a massive opportunity
for us going into 2013. We've been taking action in 2012 right across the board.
So some of the examples we've talked about in the press release on the GI side,
accident[ph], on leisure in the UK, Canada and Ireland. Agriculture in the UK, water
partnerships in France. And on the life side of the business David talked earlier about bulk
purchase annuities in the UK and we've also launched in Italy and across some of our
other Continental European businesses a whole suite of lower guaranteed products.
So we're taking action as we speak. The intent in 2013 is to continue that and we've got
comprehensive plans right across our major businesses. So on the GI side, for example,
we're looking for every sub-cell, the sub makes 7% core to have a corrective action plan
against it.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

On the culture, what I was trying to allude to here is that in the businesses right at the
sharp end of the customer part, you tend to get more rapid decision making and things
happen reasonably quickly.
In some of the stuff that we're trying to engineer across the company, it's actually a little
bit more difficult and slow. I'll give you an example, it's not -- so therefore in general it's
not the sort of thing where you press the button and something happens. It's that you
press the button and then you wonder what's happened. It does take a while.
There was a little cultural thing that was quite interesting where the decision was seen the
first step in a new negotiation. Again so getting through a decision is actually a decision
and you have to do it rather than discuss whether we should implement it or not.
So things like that. It's just little symptoms of it. A good example is the de-layering
program. Firstly, if you've got over 30,000 people -- how many people have we got now?
Okay, 40,000 people how many management levels is sensible for an organization like
that? The answer is if you exclude the CEO and the people at the bottom of the
organization, you're talking about four or five. But we have nine.
So the first question is how could you possibly build nine in the first place and think it was
any way constructive or sensible? Because you kind of had one person -- two people
reporting to one person and then two people reporting to one person and so forth. So
you have costs in all that and also the sluggishness, the pacing of things was way slowed
down in the process.

FINAL

So it's difficult to understand how you could actually get to that point. You've then got the
point of how do you take it out. In fact, in order to do it we've had to put in massive
amounts of process in order to make sure it happens here. Because all the way down
there was just negotiations and discussions as to why it didn't apply to me and so forth.
So things do take time to work through the system here. But obviously that's quite a major
one because once we get that down to five levels and we're there now, at least we've
taken that element of sluggishness out.
There's been a bit of a quality element to that too. In that we've made sure that the best
managers are retained rather than the weakest managers and so forth. So we've
upgraded our management in the process.
I think David McMillan would probably admit it's been tough getting consensus on some of
these programs. I don't know, David, if you want to.

A - David McMillan

{BIO 17298829 <GO>}

Yes, I think we've achieved a lot this year but certainly as John says, one of the things

to illustrate we're making quite a big change in what is a relatively bureaucratic culture. It
just takes time to get traction. But as long as you don't take no for an answer you can get
there.

Great thank you.

We will now take our next question from Paul (inaudible) of RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Yes, hi there, just a couple of questions please. Firstly, you talk about in the release
spending over GBP800 million a year on IT costs. I was just wondering where you think

Page 24 of 32

you can get that number to and also whether reductions in those costs are included in the
GBP400 million cost save target.

FINAL

Then second question was just on auto enrolment. You've seen good growth in group
personal pensions in the UK so far. But what do you see the pipeline on that. How many
large schemes have you got signed up and when do you think your existing book will be
starting to auto enroll?

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

I'll just say something about IT, it's John. The program for IT is over a longer period than
the GBP400 million promised. So obviously some of it is in there. You're dealing with an
apple and a pear here. We've not actually put on the table yet what the savings number is.
But it is significant. But remember it's a much longer program than the end of 2013. So
there's bits of it in the GBP400 million number but there's a good chunk of it actually later
as well.

A - David McMillan

{BIO 17298829 <GO>}

Paul, just building on the point about the GBP400 million savings that we committed to.
We're ahead of our plans in terms of delivering on those savings. So we go into 2013 with
quite strong confidence that we are going to certainly hit that number. I think some of the
opportunities that we see in our technology estate and the simplification of that just give
us further confidence that that number is eminently achievable.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

David, do you want to talk about auto enrollment?

A - David Barral

{BIO 17035123 <GO>}

Yes, Paul, on group personal pensions the pipeline remains strong. We've already auto
enrolled our first scheme actually which went absolutely fine. But the bulk of auto
enrollment for us won't kick in until 2014 actually because the vast majority of our book is
in the small to medium size. It's only more recently been moving up into the bigger
schemes.
So because of that the auto enrollment works from a legislative point of view it means we
actually see the tide shifting up in 2014. But we're already started.

We will now take our next question from Andy Hughes of Exane BNP Paribas, please go
ahead.

FINAL

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Hi guys, I can actually start with an answer because one of the benefits of being a
pensioner is I do get the funding update. So I think the funding deficit was GBP1.9 billion at
the end of March on the funding basis. That sounds right.
The question I've got. And I've got three questions. The first one is on the reinvestment
rate. Can you just give me the GI reinvestment rate for assets at the moment and how
that's moved since the half year?
The second question is Ogden and how you are reserving for that at the moment. Is it at
2.5 and what's the sensitivity?

Bloomberg Transcript

The third question is kind of overview strategy one. Because I think, John, you said it all
basically when you said, we're sacrificing earnings for economic capital. I'm just not sure I
understand why economic capital's important. From a personal perspective Solvency II
comes in maybe five years' time, maybe longer. But the biggest problem the Group
seems to face. And possibly the reason why it was downgraded is the fact the leverage is
quite high and the IFRS earnings, if you go through all the trends that you've described in
terms of net flows, are very negative.
So the danger is that you impact the leverage position by having negative net flows, poor
results from the GI business and that's what causes the problem, not actually capital.
That's just an intuitive point as to why the strategy is the way it is. Thank you.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

The reinvestment rate has not changed a lot since the half year, Andy. And it's about 2.5%
on net new money.
On Ogden, we've reserved for some increase. We haven't reserved for all the potential
outcomes on that. So there are some outcomes where you could perceive more than
we've increased. But we have reserved for some of the potential outcomes on that.
John, income and capital.

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

Yes. Actually I'll just take a bit of a distraction here before I answer that. I've just been
thinking that one of the things that surprised me as a banker coming into an insurance
company was how little focus we give to the asset side of the balance sheet. Which is why
I've added the program to David McMillan's program, which is the asset side and actually
having a better return on risk on the asset side.

FINAL

Of course Aviva Investors strategy fits into that. So we need to up our game in both of
those. But if this was a bank, we would be incredibly focused on the asset side and lots of
discussions, lots of analysis, lots of Board discussions on assets. So that's been a curious
entry point for me. I still believe that there is more opportunity that we haven't even
scratched the surface there, on the asset side. So I think that's been interesting.
On the economic capital, Solvency II isn't relevant. That's a regulatory matter. You can't
make an argument that you should produce sub-economic returns and therefore that's
rational under any circumstances.
So what we're saying is that any business that produces a negative economic return and
cannot be turned into one that produces a neutral deposit for returns should be
eliminated. It's as simple as that. So Solvency II just happens to be consistent with that in
that the assumptions underpinning Solvency II are based on economic capital. But if you
just run the organization on EVAR you'd get the same answer. It's the same.
Now just thinking about the tradeoffs for the moment, I don't think you're right in that the
reason the stock price was down. I think it was multi-faceted. I think the first thing was the
level of risk -- here's a simple symbolic two sets of numbers.

Bloomberg Transcript

Somewhere at the lower edges we had something like GBP3 billion of economic capital
surplus at the bottom. About GBP3 billion or GBP2.9 something. And we had GBP10 billion
of south European euros of sovereign debt. Again I'm not analyzing that, I'm just saying
symbolically.
So you're the shareholder looking in from the outside and you've got a very uncertain and
depressed market in Europe. You're sitting on GBP10 billion of that stuff and you've got
GBP3 billion or less economic capital at the center. I tell you what, that just (inaudible) this
company is running too much risk. And we don't have enough capital under stress
scenarios to sustain it.
So I think that is the greatest impact on the stock price. The level of risk and rise in the
cost of equity associated with the risk. So what we're trying to do is lower the cost of
equity and build the capital resources, such that in stress circumstances the company is
secure and is producing reasonable returns. So I think that to me is the dominant thought
as to why capital levels need to be built.
Now when I say making tradeoffs, the better answer to that is if you think of the value of
the company it's the book value, plus the present value of future excess returns. So that's
the equation that you need to manage.
Now in thinking about that equation, it's perfectly obvious if we're having to write down
book values, then according to market circumstances our book value is overstated. So
that's the first issue that we need to deal with, given that we were in the process of
putting an asset for sale and will have to write it down. That's the -- if we've written the
goodwill down already. So that's the first issue that we had, which means therefore the

Page 27 of 32



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2012-11-08

capital levels in general -- not on an economic basis but just on a book basis, are
overstated given that.

FINAL

So then you say, what is that present value future excess returns. Essentially it's an area
under the curve as such that you've got your future earnings rising, as time goes out then
they get discounted at a higher level because of long term returns. Risk rises at square
root of time.
So basically you get a shape of a curve that goes up and then up and then attenuates. At
the same time the excess returns always get completed to the norm, depending on your
competitive advantage. So there's a fade element in your excess returns.
You've got a growth element in your excess returns. You've got a return element and
then you've got a fade element but you've also got a risk element that deflates the curve.
So you get a curve that has a shape that's curved up and down. And essentially you're
trying to maximize the area under that curve. That curve is essentially a function of the
level of return, the risk of those returns, the fade of the returns and the growth of those
returns. Therefore you are making tradeoffs all the time on that equation.

Bloomberg Transcript

But simplistically what we've done is said, look, there's no question in our minds therefore
that the biggest priority here is to make the company safe. Because that's the thing when
we talk to the larger shareholders, they say it's the number one thing we want you to fix.
So what that means in order to fix that, as I said in UK annuities for example we are having
to make a trade off that we are actually going to forgo pretty solid returns instead of
building our capital bases. Or at least not making the capital erosion worse.
Now once we get to a level -- let's say we got to any of the -- I'm not using these
numbers scientifically. But let's say we got GBP7 billion of economic capital and a lower risk
balance sheet. That is a much better situation than the GBP3 billion economic capital and
a risky balance sheet. Much, much safer. (multiple speakers) you can start to make
tradeoffs and say, well hold on a second, let's be much more normal about the way we
manage the organization. Let's invest a little bit more in future returns. Let's actually put
more money into UK annuities. Let's not worry too much about the capital levels, let's
actually manage the company on EVAR and/or a return. So you're looking for more
earnings growth in that scenario.
So all we're really saying is that we genuinely believe and we're told quite categorically by
shareholders, eliminating the level of risk and building the capital base was their number
one priority.
Now we won't take that to the extent where we say we've got to be well above our
target ranges and keep the tradeoffs running. Once we get to sensible levels you can
start to say well let's run the place normally. That's all that's happening.

I think what I was trying to say, John, was that even if you build your economic capital
surplus up, you still can't de-lever the Group, which is the key challenge. For me the key
risk is the leverage not -- (multiple speakers)

FINAL

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

You have reduced your lev -- if your debt remains constant and your economic capital has
risen you have de-leveraged the group.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Not if your earnings have fallen significantly and your fixed charge coverage is significantly
lower than 6 times.

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

From a pure leverage ratio basis, our total assets over economic capital your assets will
come down somewhat, your capital levels will have gone up substantially. Remember,
capital levels will have gone up 2.5 times or more in that scenario. But your assets won't
have fallen by half.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

The other thing, Andy, as we talked about, was the third priority being the performance
improvement. All about replacing the lost earnings of the disposals with new earning
streams. That's what the nine programs are about. Therefore, net-net, once you've done
that; and especially as we've talked about a couple of times, our plan is sequentially over
time that we will pay down some debt. It's not the first priority it comes later in the
sequencing. But you replace the earnings for your earning streams in 2014 are
compensated. New earning streams replacing the things that are under disposal.

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

Remember we can't pay down debt unless we raise surplus -- unless we have surplus
cash. So there's a pacing to that.
The other thing is, if you're thinking about this equation we can't do much in the short run
about our earnings. Because even if we cut costs it's got a one year or just under one
year payback. Therefore we are actually improving the end of next year's earnings, not
the current year's earnings. Now that works on a present value basis.
So the thing that we can deal with quickest is the capital because it's actually mainly to do
with disposals and not putting more capital in to stop it destroying value. So that's dead
easy. You're actually not sacrificing; you're not making tradeoffs here.
There are marginal tradeoffs, for example that we're slowing down in annuities business.
But they're not significant. You then can say, well okay, the next thing that we can fix is
return because it will take us a while because we actually have to either improve the sales
or take capital away and so forth.

Then you've got the earnings growth basis, which is largely cost reduction rather than
revenue growth, although hopefully there is some revenue growth and loss reduction.
So this is just a practical reality to this. It's not really making tradeoffs, it's first things first.

We will now take our next question from Greig Paterson of KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Greig Paterson
I'll just be very brief. In terms of just clarification. The comments you made, there was
something contradictory. Did you say the US at its current run rate is generating economic
surplus capital or destroying economic surplus capital? One comment seemed to imply it
was one way and the other implied the other one.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second question is just the US debt -- sorry, the US if you sell it, do you expect that
debt to go with the transaction and hence improve your debt ratios?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

The comments we made were a couple of things. One was, has the US economic capital
profile improved in the quarter and the answer was yes. That's purely to do with public
credit spreads have come in.
Second is, in just even market circumstances what would happen. You'd have a negative
to the extent of around GBP300 million each year because of the negative profile of new
business.

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

Burning capital.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

So it uses economic capital all other things being equal.

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

It doesn't produce an economic return on that new economic capital.

Q - Greig Paterson
Is that sterling or dollars?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

FINAL

That's in sterling.

Q - Greig Paterson
Then if you sold you sell it with the debt?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes. Well we obviously haven't been specific about what any transactional structure would
look like. But I think it's fair to assume that what we'd like to do is sell the entire enterprise.

Q - Greig Paterson
So that will improve -- (inaudible) improve your gearing ratio.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes in a way, it obviously depends on the method of how you calculate the gearing ratio.
But yes, you would sell the entire enterprise to the equity and debt value of the business.

Q - Greig Paterson
All right. Thanks.

A - John McFarlane

{BIO 1509370 <GO>}

sequence.

Q - Greig Paterson
We're supportive at least at KBW.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Thank you, Greig. Any other questions? All right, well thank you everybody. Good
dialogue, good set of questions.
