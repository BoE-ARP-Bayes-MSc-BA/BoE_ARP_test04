Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Ladies and gentlemen. welcome to this conference call on Sampo Group's Q3 2013
results. My name is Jarmo Salonen and I'm Head of Investor Relations at Sampo. And with
me at this call I have our Group CEO and President, Kari Stadigh; Group CFO, Peter
Johansson; and Deputy Head of P&C Insurance, Ricard Wennerklint.
We have the same procedures as earlier; Kari will start with some highlights on the Q3
developments. But before handing to Kari, let me remind you that you can follow this
transmission on our website, sampo.com/results, and a recorded version of the call will
later be available at the same address.
And I think that's all from me now. I'll hand over to Kari.

This time, the good performance is more evenly distributed within the Sampo Group than
ever before. All areas of operations, as well as all geographies, are performing as
planned, and delivered solid numbers. I would like to single out a few speciﬁc areas of
strength.

FINAL

In non-life insurance, the ﬁrst nine months' combined ratio at 88.2% was the best ever
result.
In Nordea, one could clearly see that the focus of capital and costs starts to pay oﬀ. Core
Tier 1 ratio reached 14.4%, and credit losses continued to decline.
In life insurance, unit-link assets under management reached an all time high at EUR4.4
billion, and the weak proﬁt liabilities are now discounted at 2.5% for 2014, and at 3% for
2015. Also, the cost and risk ratios improved signiﬁcantly.
On the Group level, the post-tax unrealized gain in the insurance company investment
portfolio reached an all time high of EUR893 million.
Turning to the standalone Q3, it is worth noting that even if we are facing slow general
economic growth, the operating proﬁt grew steadily in all areas; If plus 9%, Nordea plus
3%, and Mandatum Life plus 3% as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

Given these solid numbers, If will certainly distribute in December as usual an internal
dividend of SEK4.3 billion. That is roughly EUR500 million.
Also, one can expect that Mandatum Life with a solvency ratio of 28.5% is well positioned
to distribute in the First Quarter of 2014 an internal dividend at the same level as this year.
That's roughly EUR100 million.
Also, of course, pointing -- or after pointing out these areas of strength, based on the
operational excellence customary to our management team, I would also like to comment
on things that keep me awake at night.
Actually, there are no such operational major issues at the moment, but on the investment
side, the same -- it's the same old issue. Our decreasing running yield, that's the main
issue that keeps me awake at night.
We saw interest rates increase in September, and we used the opportunity to increase our
covered bond position by buying more than EUR500 million worth of covered bonds.
However, now yields are falling again.
In If, our running yield, including cash for the whole ﬁxed income portfolio, is now at 3%,
down from 3.6% at the beginning of this year.

In Mandatum Life, our running yield, including cash for the whole ﬁxed income portfolio,
is now at 4.1%, down from 4.8% since the beginning of this year.

FINAL

So our investment stance remains the same. Cash is king until we see a steepening yield
curve.
There is not that much left of this year, but as you all have seen, we have narrowed our
combined ratio guidance to 88% to 90% -- between 88% to 90% for the full year 2013.
And even if we saw exceptionally strong wins in Denmark and Southern Sweden, we see
no reason to change this. All in all, conﬁdence prevails.

Questions And Answers

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

I have two questions, please. Kari, you mentioned the windstorms just now. I was
wondering if you are able to comment any further on the impact of those at all. One of
your competitors put out some numbers this morning. I was just wondering if you were
able to do anything in the way of quantiﬁcation of roughly what we might be looking at.
Then the second thing, being very picky on the numbers, but if I look at the net premium
earned in Norway in non-life, that's been falling slightly quarter on quarter for the last
three quarters. I know there's some currency impacts there, but nevertheless, if I try and
strip those out on my numbers, I think in local currency, Q3 was down maybe 2.5% on Q2,
and I was just wondering if there was anything that you wanted to highlight there.
Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I think, Peter, I'll turn this over to Ricard.

A - Ricard Wennerklint
Yes. When it comes to the windstorms, our current estimate is that we will end below our
net retention, which is roughly SEK250 million; so we don't see any major impact during
the Fourth Quarter. And as Kari mentioned, it means that we remain with the current
outlook of 88% to 90%. So not that big eﬀect of the windstorm.

Secondly, on the premiums in Norway, if you look at this in Norwegian kroner, we have a
2.3% growth in Norway during the ﬁrst nine months. So I think it's mostly currency eﬀect
that you see, actually.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thanks a lot.

Operator
Hakon Fure, DNB.

Q - Hakon Fure

{BIO 16623060 <GO>}

Two questions from me, please. Firstly, Kari, you touched on the internal dividends from If
and Mandatum. If we then look at Nordea, consensus expectations for Nordea's dividends
is for them to be up by more than 30% year on year. Given your capital position, is there
any reason why we shouldn't expect you to pass this on to your investors?
Then secondly, on the Swedish combined ratio this quarter, is this solely due to a high
degree of large claims in Sweden this quarter or is there anything else happening?
Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

On Nordea, I don't really think you expect me to answer your question, so I think that we'll
stick to the communication that Nordea has given. And Clausen has clearly stated that you
will see an increased dividend, but he will come back to this later this year.

A - Ricard Wennerklint
On the combined ratio in Sweden, it's not at satisfactory level, but it's mainly due to
volatility in large claims. On the underlying business, we continue to see a need for
premium increases in the private business and that is taking place as we speak.

Q - Hakon Fure

{BIO 16623060 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Matti Ahokas, Handelsbanking.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Two questions, please; a bit on the details from Ricard. What was the total impact of large
claims in the Third Quarter? I remember that you previously said that the normal level is
roughly EUR70 million.

Page 4 of 13



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2013-11-05

And also, if you could tell me what was the impact of the -- I guess you change also the
real discount rate in Sweden. If you could give me the ﬁgure, I would be very happy.

FINAL

A - Ricard Wennerklint
Let's take the interest rate in Sweden ﬁrst. I think it's at 0.94% discount level in Sweden.
On large claims, we have said that during the ﬁrst nine months, we're I think SEK70 million
above normalized, and that is what we give on the large claims. Nothing really to add on
that.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

But the impact of the Swedish discount rate, could you give me that in euros for the Third
Quarter?

A - Ricard Wennerklint
No. We don't disclose speciﬁcally the number in euros. The rate that we use, 0.94%, is of
course slightly higher than what was in the Second Quarter, but I don't have the speciﬁc
impact of that change during the Third Quarter, no.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Right. And while I have you on the line, a follow-up question regarding the Swedish
situation. Would you regard the weaker proﬁtability that we've seen in Sweden more of a
cyclical or structural factor? You mentioned that you're going to target some premium
hikes, but is this more of a cyclical or a structural problem that we're seeing in Sweden?

A - Ricard Wennerklint
I would label this as a very normal ﬂuctuation in the business.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Thanks a lot.

Operator
Jacob Brink, ABG.

Q - Jacob Brink

{BIO 18967018 <GO>}

So much about this quarter, but I was just wondering how you're going to treat Nordea
now where I guess Nordea's going to stop -- capital-wise, how are you going to treat
Nordea when --? I assume Nordea's going to stop transition rules risk-weighted assets.
Are you going to use Basel III fully loaded, or some kind of in-between? Or what kind of
level are we looking at?
Thank you.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

FINAL

This is Peter. So basically, if you look at slide 15 where we have the conglomerate capital
rules actually, with transition rules that we use now, Nordea consumes capital EUR3.6
billion.
If I would exclude the transition rules, Nordea would consume EUR2.7 billion. And if I take
from the Claussen's fully-loaded core Tier 1 ratio that he said on the CEO review, the
number would be EUR2.9 billion.

Q - Jacob Brink

{BIO 18967018 <GO>}

Okay. That would be somewhat less than your economic capital from Nordea, so which
maybe consider doing something to get up towards the old level, or would you actually
then use a lower level of capital for Nordea?

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

That would actually be the regulatory capital requirement, but we would continue to take
our share of Nordea's economic capital, which is the higher number.

Q - Jacob Brink

{BIO 18967018 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Blair Stewart.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

A couple of questions. Kari, you talked about buying some covered bonds in the quarter. I
just wondered what the yield on those investments was, please, just to get an idea of what
you think is attractive.
And secondly, the EUR893 million fair value reserve that you talked about as well, I just
wondered what's the strategy with that. Is that purely an investment management
decision as to when that gets crystallized? Or will you use that over time to help smooth
the earnings of the Company?
Thank you.

Company Name: Sampo Oyj

FINAL

Well if we start with the buﬀer, I think the buﬀer is there because we see value in the
underlying assets. And if our view on the value of the assets would change, then we
would sell them and then we would realize the proﬁt. So I think that's the basis why we
have -- they are roughly pre-tax, Peter? They are EUR900 million and EUR300 million,
roughly?

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

EUR900 million in equities and EUR300 million in bonds; a little bit less than EUR900
million.
Then on covered bonds, I think the (tenure) was three to ﬁve years and the yield was
roughly plus/minus 3%.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Exactly. It was a total of SEK5 billion, roughly.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. So it's a little bit more than EUR500 million. It was EUR560 million probably in euros.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

And the yield was about 3%, did you say?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yes. Roughly plus/minus 3% depending on the tenure.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

The ﬁxed income, of course, the unrealized gain of EUR300 million, that will run oﬀ within
two or three years.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yes, of course. Yes. And just one other comment, Kari. I'm pleased that they managed to
persuade you to stay oﬀ the golf course for a few more years and stay on at the Company,
so thanks for that.

Thomas Seidl, Bernstein.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Two questions, please, on the P&C business. Page 33 of the presentation, you show the
gross written premium by market. I wonder if you could give me a ﬂavor by each of these
markets what is rate driven versus what is market share driven.
And the second question is about capital management. I think you are now at EUR4
billion excess capital, 184% solvency ratio. What is your target capital level? And can you
think about using some of those excess capital to pay down debt, or even share
buybacks?

A - Ricard Wennerklint
Start with the gross written premium. I think the way to think about this number is that it's
basically ﬂat market share if you think about the retail business and the SME business
(versus) probably a fall in the market shares in the industrial market, and that is a general
truth for all the markets.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

On capital, I think that we have always been in a way over-capitalized with a strong
cushion, and I think that in these times, that's a sensible way to run this also in the future.
For us, we have not been that keen lately on share buybacks, even if we have that in our
toolbox. We are more here to secure that we can build a dividend history.
So I have said it many, many times that we are a dividend stock and we like to be able to
show to you slightly increasing dividends year on year.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

On the regulatory side, we don't have speciﬁc target for the time being because it's a
moving target due to the changes in regulation.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Per Gronborg, Danske Markets

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

FINAL

Two questions from my side, just a clariﬁcation. You're lowering the discounting rate once
again on your life business by 0.5percentage point. What has the cost been in euros for
doing that for a single year?
The second question is on the (technical diﬃculty) (allowance). You have (technical
diﬃculty) (market share). One of the other big Nordic industrial insurance (groups) has
also been giving up quite material market share. Who exactly is the ones that are gaining
on that part of the market? Do you have any comments on that. Is it Nordics? Is it national
players in the Nordics that is doing it?

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

On the cost (there), it's roughly EUR18 million to EUR19 million every -- for 50 basis points
lowering.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Per year.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Per year, exactly. EUR 18 million to EUR19 million.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

And on market share industrial?

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

This is, of course, we deﬁne the industrial market in diﬀerent ways in diﬀerent companies;
impossible to answer. But I would guess that the customers that we are losing are going
both to domestic players and to international players.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I have a small comment, Per. We are not really giving away or taking market share
because that's not the way we work. We price risks and then we see the outcome. So I
think that's always remember to -- always worthwhile to remind of our culture that market
share is secondary to us. For us, it's primary to price risks correctly and then earn my
money for shareholders.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Sorry for phrasing my question slightly wrong. I understand, yes.

Gianandrea Roberti, Carnegie.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

FINAL

The ﬁrst question, I think is for Peter. I was looking at the economic capital model, and If, it
seems like your models show a EUR160 million roughly jump from the second to the Third
Quarter. And if you can give us the explanation for that, that would be appreciated.
Then a couple of questions on non-life. Ricard, is there any chance at all you can be a bit
more precise on the windstorms. I'm surprised -- well, you actually just say it's below your
net retention, which is (SEK250 million). Did I understand you correctly, right; two, ﬁve
zero? It's because the (RSA) number this morning are quite a bit out of proportion
compared to the market share and compared to what the other players have been saying.
And the ﬁnal question would be on the non-life business in Norway. It seems like a trend
that started in the middle of last year is continuing. Can you add anything on the market,
and especially on the smaller players and how they're behaving.
Thanks a lot.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Gianandrea, on the economic capital, it's EUR150 million, like you mention. EUR50 million
is roughly model calibration, and the rest is then higher market risk.

A - Ricard Wennerklint
On the windstorms, this is still a moving target. So let's say that we are deﬁnitely below
(EUR250 million). Let's see where we (ended) there. It was only a few days ago.
The Norwegian market, very calm during the Third Quarter. I have nothing new to report,
so can't really add much to what has been said before about the Norwegian market.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

All right. So nothing -- I still hear that the smaller ones are being very aggressive and
chasing market share right and left. There's nothing new on that point?

A - Ricard Wennerklint
That would not be the way I would describe the Norwegian market currently. There has
deﬁnitely been an inﬂow of competitors during the last couple of years, but last nine
months, at least, a fairly calm market.

Paavo Ahonen, Nordea Bank.

FINAL

Q - Paavo Ahonen

{BIO 6531806 <GO>}

A question on dividends and on internal dividends. Firstly, on If, you are saying you are
planning dividend of around EUR500 million in Q4, and this, I guess, would imply maybe
somewhat lower payout there than on average recently. Are there any speciﬁc reasons for
this?
And secondly, on Mandatum, you are saying you are planning a dividend of EUR100
million for Q1 next year. So should we expect this will be included or have an eﬀect in
some Sampo's dividend payment from this year, or how would you handle this?
Thanks.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

The EUR500 million should be in line with previous years. That's the SEK4.3 billion, it
shouldn't be out of line from what we have been distributing in a good year from If.

Bloomberg Transcript

The EUR100 million is actually higher than we communicated at one moment when we
said that the with-proﬁt balance sheet is shrinking by EUR200 million per year. We said
that maybe there is a good basis to assume EUR50 million per year and maybe more in a
good year. So I think this is a sign. When we assume now that we could be distributing
EUR100 million early next spring, that's a sign that the year has been good.
On our dividends, I have nothing new to communicate. Of course, we want to increase
the dividend gradually, and you have just to wait until our Board is ready to make the
decision or proposal for next spring.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Technically, of course, if we take in December EUR500 million from If, that means actually
a pre-dividend from If. So it's this year's proﬁts will be distributable capital only after the
full-year numbers when they have been audited.

Q - Paavo Ahonen

Right. Okay. Thanks.

Q - David Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

I was just wondering, other than the Swedish private line, are there any other areas where
you're putting in signiﬁcant rate increases and we might see an improvement in the
combined ratio going forward?

FINAL

A - Ricard Wennerklint
I'm not sure I would use the word signiﬁcant. Remember that we have a combined ratio of
87.2% in the Third Quarter. I'm saying that we're working on (premium) increases in the
private market slightly above claims inﬂation. And the same, of course, goes for the
industrial business throughout the Nordics. Other than that, it's mainly in line with claims
inﬂation.

Q - Daniel Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Most of my questions have already been answered, so just one then on Mandatum Life.
The accelerated strengthening of the reserve, lowering the discount rate, does that
change the way you think about asset allocation and capital risk going forward; (thus)
that's the unchanged at EUR50 million per year?

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

It does not aﬀect our allocations. That's market driven based on our investment view, and
we have the capital to have the allocation we want.
