{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're
very pleased to start 2015 by reporting another strong quarter with operating income of
$827 million or $2.53 per share and an operating return on equity of 14.5%. Our
underwriting results remain very strong across all of our business units as evidenced by
our combined ratio of 88.9%. Additionally, we achieved a record level of retention in
domestic business insurance while simultaneously posting positive renewal rate change.
With Quantum Auto 2.0 in full rollout, in Agency Auto, we achieved policy in force growth
of 1.8%, the first time that metric has been positive since 2011. We posted these results
notwithstanding another severe winter and a reduction in net investment income from last
year's first quarter. Jay will speak about our investment income in just a moment, but for
now suffice it to say that nothing happened that we had not contemplated or considered
a possibility.
The operating and production results for this quarter remain very encouraging and
consistent with our belief that the amplitude of the historical cycle has narrowed.
Importantly, this stability contributes to our confidence in our ability to continue to deliver
superior returns on equity. The confidence that we have is in part evidenced by our capital
management strategies.
Today, our board of directors announced an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.61
per share marking the 11th consecutive year of dividend increases and bringing the
compound annual growth rate on the dividend to nearly 10% over this time. In addition, we
returned $850 million in capital to shareholders bringing our total since 2006 to $31.6
billion. And we've done all of that while continuing to make significant investments in our
business and our people. Canada, Brazil, and the data center in Omaha just to name a

few. Right-sizing capital and reinvesting in the business are not mutually exclusive, both
are fundamental to the way we think about the business for the long-term. We intend to
continue with these strategies and in that regard our board also authorized an additional
$5 billion of share repurchases. We've made substantial progress in improving our product
returns over the past five years through a thoughtful, focused, and highly analytical
approach to our business that has been well executed in the marketplace. We intend to
continue on this path.
In that regard, fixed income returns remain at historical lows and, as a consequence, we
must continue to be mindful that this challenging environment has already lasted far
longer than most would have assumed and we will continue to factor that environment
into our pricing strategies. In addition, we note that weather patterns do seem to be
different. This change, when combined with increased real estate development, causes
us to be very attentive to incorporating the real cost of weather uncertainty in our
business. Part of the answer to this challenge, above and beyond price and policy terms,
is helping our customers consider their risks and protect their assets in the most
thoughtful ways possible and we know that we and our independent agents are
committed to helping customers do just that. As the world gets riskier, the value of
thoughtful insurance advice goes up.
And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.

Bloomberg Transcript

Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Thanks, Jay. We're pleased with our first quarter results. Operating income of $827 million
and operating return on equity of 14.5% despite operating income being down $225
million from the very strong first quarter we had in 2014. Importantly, this decrease in
operating income was not driven by deteriorating underwriting results. As Jay just said, we
reported a consolidated combined ratio of 88.9% this quarter. Rather, the decrease in
operating income primarily resulted from three items: net investment income that was
lowered by $104 million after-tax, the inclusion in last year's first quarter of a $49 million
after-tax benefit from a change in state law that led to a reduction in our estimated
liability for state assessments for workers' compensation premiums, and while still at a
high level net favorable prior year reserve development that was lower by $32 million
after-tax.
Net investment income this quarter is being compared to a very strong first quarter last
year and both fixed and non-fixed income returns were lower than the prior year quarter.
Non-fixed income NII was lower principally due to private equity returns, which was slightly
positive this quarter as compared to a very strong first quarter last year. Energy-related
private equity funds produced negative NII of $21 million after-tax, giving up a small
fraction of what had previously been earned in these funds in recent years.
While we cannot predict future oil prices and even though we report private equity returns
on a three-month lag, a number of factors suggest that the vast majority of the impact of
the recent decline in oil prices has been reflected in the current quarter's results. Current
oil prices are slightly higher than at year-end, share prices of public companies in our

Page 3 of 23

funds portfolios are also higher than they were at year-end and nothing we've seen has
reduced our confidence in the general partners of our portfolio funds.
Additionally, for non-energy-related private equity funds, which represent approximately
85% of our private equity portfolio, returns were adequate this quarter although far below
what was an unusually good first quarter in 2014. Fixed income NII was lower principally
due to what we've been saying for many years now. Securities having higher book yields
ran off during the past 12 months and were replaced with securities having lower yields
due to the current interest rate environment. Another contributing factor was the level of
short-term investments which yield very little being somewhat higher this quarter than in
the prior year quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Each of our business segments once again contributed to our net favorable prior year
development, which totaled $243 million on a pre-tax basis. In Business and International
Insurance, net favorable development of $77 million resulted from better than expected
loss experience in the general liability product line for accident years 2005 and prior,
along with better expected loss experience in workers' comp for accident years 2007 and
prior. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $35 million resulted
from better than expected loss experience in contract surety for accident years 2010
through 2012. And in Personal Insurance net favorable development of $131 million
resulted from better than expected loss experience in recent accident years for
homeowners and auto liability coverages, as well as better than expected loss experience
in homeowners for recent cat and non-cat weather-related losses. On a combined stat
basis for all of our U.S. subs, there were no accident years or product lines that had any
meaningful unfavorable development this quarter.
Operating cash flows of $199 million compared to $703 million in the prior year quarter, a
$504 million decrease, entirely due to the $579 million payment we made this quarter in
final settlement of the Asbestos Direct Action. As this amount was fully accrued at the
beginning of the quarter, this payment had no impact on the quarter's operating income
or share repurchases and it will have no impact on future share repurchases. Holding
company liquidity was over $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter and all of our capital ratios
were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were
approximately $3.2 billion pre-tax or $2.1 billion after-tax, up from $3 billion and $2 billion,
respectively, at the beginning of the year. And book value per share was $77.96, or 1%
higher than at the beginning of the year. I'd point out that book value per share growth
was achieved despite the negative impact of the strengthening of the dollar on foreign
currency translations.
Turning to capital management. We continue to generate much more capital than we
need to support our businesses, allowing us to return $850 million of excess capital to our
shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of $178 million and repurchased $672 million
of our common shares this quarter, including $600 million under our publicly announced
share repurchase program consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy and
$72 million to primarily – to partially offset shares issued under employee incentive plans,
mostly to cover employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting and payout of
performance and restricted stock awards. And, as Jay said, the board raised our quarterly

Page 4 of 23

Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2015-04-21

dividend from $0.55 to $0.61 per share and added an additional $5 billion for share
repurchases.
So with all that, let me now turn the mic over to Brian.

FINAL

Brian W. MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Thank you, Jay. Alan and Doreen will go over the individual segment results in a moment,
but before they do, I want to take a few – make a few comments on the impact of
weather and the operating environment in the domestic commercial marketplace.
Regarding the weather, patterns continue to be unpredictable, and that was clearly
evidenced by another challenging quarter. Weather losses in the first quarter of 2015
were slightly higher than the first quarter of 2014, but more importantly, in both years, we
experienced losses above our expectations, driven by the polar vortex last year and the
extreme snow and cold in the Northeast in 2015.

Bloomberg Transcript

Much has been written about the snowfall in Boston this year, which at over 110 inches was
a record for the season. But the real story is that nearly 95 inches of this snowfall came in
just a 30-day period. To show just how unusual that was, The Washington Post cited a
meteorologist who calculated that Boston should not expect to see another 30 days with
that much snow for another, and I quote, "approximately 26,315 years." Now, I'm not sure
what they meant by "approximately," but suffice it to say, it was an extremely unusual
event.
As we think about the continuing unpredictability of weather patterns and our exposure to
catastrophic weather losses, our expectations for cat losses are significantly higher today
than they were just six or seven years ago. And importantly, historically, we would have
expected to have been below budget absent a fairly significant Atlantic storm.
Unfortunately, it has now become all too common for us to have significant cat losses
from what we traditionally thought were the lower severity frequency events like tornado,
hail, and winter storms. So weather patterns are changing, and accordingly, we are
continuing to reassess and manage our property exposure and pricing in a thoughtful way.
Regarding the domestic commercial pricing environment, we feel very good about the
returns we are seeing in this business and we're encouraged by the continued stability of
the market. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we embarked on a strategy to improve the
returns and profitability of our commercial business by increasing rate, improving terms
and conditions, and focusing risk selection. We said that we would execute on this
strategy thoughtfully and in a manner that would not be disruptive to the marketplace.
Accordingly, our initial goal was to achieve gradual rate increases, eventually reaching a
level that would drive significant improvement on the returns of our products over time,
and once our returns had reached an appropriate level we hope to see rate moderate at
a level that would allow us to sustain reasonable returns.
Looking back, this is almost exactly what we have seen over the last four and a half years,
and we couldn't be more pleased, not just in the results, but in how we have achieved
Page 5 of 23

them. We couldn't have scripted it better.
And with that, let me turn it over to Alan.

FINAL

Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Thank you, Brian, and good morning. We feel very good about our performance in
Business and International Insurance this quarter. Operating results were strong, and
importantly, we were encouraged by the continued stability in the U.S. marketplace as
reflected in the facts that our retention is at a record level and we're still achieving
renewal rate gains. As Brian said, we could not have scripted this better.
The underlying combined ratio was 92.7%, an increase of 3.2 points over the prior year
quarter. Eliminating the benefit from the state workers' compensation assessment in last
year's first quarter, the underlying combined ratio increased by about a point, reflecting a
typical level of quarterly fluctuation. Particularly in light of the severe winter weather that
Brian mentioned, we feel great about the underlying profitability.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to the top line, net written premiums were up about 1% from the prior year
quarter, with a timing and structure of a number of reinsurance treaties and changes in
foreign exchange rates having an adverse impact. Domestic net written premiums were
up about 2%, but adjusting for the timing impact of the reinsurance treaties, premiums
were up almost 3.5%.
In our International business, net written premiums were down 7%, driven by the adverse
impact of foreign exchange. The production results this quarter in our domestic business
continue to be very encouraging. As we've said in the last few quarters, more of our
business is achieving target returns and our objective has been to keep more of that
business through our very granular account by account and class by class execution.
Record retention this quarter speaks to the success of that strategy.
Renewal premium change was down about a point from the fourth quarter of last year,
and within that, pure renewal rate change was also down about a point. Notably, renewal
rate change across most of our businesses has been steady for each of the three months
within the current quarter.
Turning to Select, retention hit a four-year high and renewal premium change was strong
at 7.3%. Overall, we're pleased with the returns in this business and we'll continue to seek
higher retentions and higher levels of new business.
In Middle Market, retention was a very strong 87%, with over 90% retention on our best
performing segments. Renewal rate change moderated less than a point from the fourth
quarter to 1.1%.
In terms of new business, we're very pleased with the results in Middle Market this
quarter. As you've heard from us, the impact of rate gains over the past four years has
Page 6 of 23

Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2015-04-21

FINAL

resulted in more new business opportunities that met our return thresholds. The amount
of new business we wrote in the quarter was impacted by the high volume of new
business activity in the marketplace. January is a big month for new business submissions.
Also, it's worth noting that the prior year quarter was particularly low from a new business
standpoint, so that obviously contributes to the quarter-over-quarter increase.
Our International business also posted solid production results. Over the past several
quarters, renewal premium change has been steady and retention has trended up. In the
current quarter, new business levels were lower than we would have liked, largely
reflecting our disciplined response to conditions in the Lloyd's marketplace.
I'm pleased to note that as we announced last week, we agreed to increase our stake in
the P&C business of our Brazilian joint venture to 95%, up from 49.5%. We will maintain
our 49.5% stake in the JV surety business. Our P&C business in Brazil is small. We
launched it in 2012 and wrote about $20 million of net written premium last year, but we
continue to see long-term growth opportunities. The transaction is expected to close in
the fourth quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing
conditions.
To sum it up, we feel great about the quarter. We're focused on maintaining our attractive
returns and we're well positioned to execute where we find opportunities.

Bloomberg Transcript

And with that, let me turn it over to Doreen.

Doreen Spadorcia

{BIO 4883600 <GO>}

Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everybody. Bond & Specialty Insurance started 2015 with
a strong first quarter and we remain exceptionally pleased with the financial returns in this
segment. For the quarter, operating income was $124 million, a reduction from the first
quarter of 2014, due primarily to a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve
development and lower net investment income. Underlying underwriting results remain
very strong and well within our target.
As for top line, net written premium for the quarter was essentially flat to 2014 for both
our management liability and surety businesses. Across our management liability
businesses, retention and new business premium were both slightly improved from
recent quarters while RPC levels remain broadly consistent. In sum, not a lot of movement
in the quarter to highlight for you and we continue to feel great about this segment's
results.
I'll turn now to Personal Insurance where we also had a terrific first quarter, with strong
underwriting results in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners & Other. Operating
income for the quarter was $252 million, down slightly from the first quarter of 2014, due
primarily to lower net investment income. The underlying combined ratio was essentially
flat to the prior year and at a level that we feel great about for this segment.

FINAL

Looking at Agency Auto, we, once again, delivered strong top and bottom line results for
the quarter and continue to be very pleased with the performance of this business. The
90.2% combined ratio for the quarter benefited from approximately 3 points of favorable
prior year reserve development which was driven by better than expected severity in
bodily injury. The underlying combined ratio of 93% was a slight improvement from an
already strong 2014 and in a range we're comfortable with.
Production results also continued to be strong driven by Quantum Auto 2.0. New business
premium was 67% higher than the first quarter of 2014 and we continue to grow policies
in force which increased 21,000 during the quarter. Net written premiums increased 4%
from the prior year quarter, so by all measures, great results for Auto for the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to Agency Homeowners & Other, we, once again, delivered strong financial
results and we're making progress on production as we execute local product and pricing
strategy. The overall combined ratio of 74.4% was strong and benefited from favorable
prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 79.5% is also well
within our return expectations for the quarter. So financial results remain strong as we
continue to execute our disciplined underwriting and pricing strategy.
As for Agency Homeowners production, we said earlier that we continue to make
progress. New business premium was up almost 40% from the prior year quarter and
continues to trend favorably. We feel great about our market-leading homeowners
capabilities and know this product is a critical component of the customer package. Brian
discussed the continued impact of weather. With these considerations in mind, and our
strong financial results in this line, we remain focused on improving our offering, both
product features and process improvements to begin growing this business again. Based
upon the new business trends we're seeing, we're encouraged with our path.
Lastly, on Agency Homeowners & Other, net written premium was down 5%, primarily
driven by the impact of changes in the timing and structure of certain of the company's
reinsurance treaties.
So to sum up, Personal Insurance had excellent results and a great start to 2015.
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Gabby.

Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. One moment, please, for the first question.
And our first question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR. Go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

Hi, good morning, thanks. Two-part question on reserves, especially in the commercial
area. I saw the comments that you took some CGL in 2005 and prior and work comp in
2007 and prior, but, one, was wondering about more recent years in work comp and
casualty lines, if those need to season more, and two, if you could provide your initial take
on the 2012 and 2013 accident years. And the question there is given that you're about 36
months out from there and we had kind of a mini hard market in pricing in those years and
I think evidence of loss cost trends remain benign. Wondering how the 2012 and 2013
years are looking now that you can have a better view on that.

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

This is Jay Benet. I'll try to wrap in some comments about all of that and some overview
sentences. So, as it relates to the reserve development, these years do have to season a
bit for us to get a good look on what the longer tail liabilities are doing. However, having
said that, as you know, we have a very robust and granular process for looking at our
reserves, so we look at them every quarter, and if there are things that are developing
either currently or from prior years that would have a rollover effect, which we call base
year movement, into the current years, we'll reflect that as appropriate.
So looking at the more seasoned years at this point in time, we did take action to reduce
reserves, as you pointed out, in general liability and workers' comp for 2007, 2005 and
prior as we disclosed. None of that really had a major impact on the more current years.
The current years haven't developed in any meaningful way one way or the other at this
point in time in the current quarter. There have been actions in previous quarters with
some of the more accident years where we've made some minor adjustments. But, at
this stage, as I had indicated earlier, there really was no meaningful unfavorable
development taking place in any of our products, any of our accident years, and on the
favorable side, we pointed out in the press release what that was.

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

I guess the follow up would be just kind of honing in on 2012 and 2013 and understanding
they're not fully developed but there is some amount of time that's passed. I mean, given
the pricing that was better than, do you have evidence that loss cost trends remained
benign in that period of time or was there an elevation in loss cost trends in those years in
particular. Because from what we're seeing it, it seems like most loss cost trends for
causality have been incredibly benign especially in those years.

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Yeah, well, as we've said in previous calls, we're not seeing anything as it relates to loss
cost trends that's surprising to us or different from what our assumptions are. These are,
of course, very long liabilities, so you're going to react in a prudent way to any changing
information that you see, and as it relates to this whole – what you're referring to as
benign or whatever, everything is really dependent upon what you're reserving
Page 9 of 23

Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2015-04-21

FINAL

assumptions are and as long as you're reserving assumptions are based on what's taking
place in the marketplace, you're not making adjustments for things, which is not to say
over time you wouldn't look further at the data and see things that would cause you to
recognize favorable development or, God forbid, unfavorable development. But at this
stage, our reserves as we always do our best estimates of what we see today and we'll
just see how they develop going forward.

A - Jay Steven Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

It's Jay Fishman. Just let me add one point. A couple times in your question you
referenced a pricing and its impact on reserving. We just don't – pricing is not a factor as
we set up reserves for our business. Our reserves are driven by costs. And the pricing,
what we sell it for, is driven by the marketplace. And so the notion that our reserves are
set differently in a different pricing environment is just wrong, it's just not correct. So what
Jay I think is – so far so good. So far, our – the estimates that we established in the years
in which Jay referenced are continuing to stand up to whatever the developing trends are.

Q - Randy Binner

Understood. Thank you.

And our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please go
ahead.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you so much for taking the call. The first question is on the margin
and classify the one point movement in terms of business margin deterioration as a
quarterly fluctuation. So just wondered that one point impact by some non-cat large
weather-related losses and also, going forward, if you see your pricing continue to
decelerate, are we going to expect some continued margin deterioration?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Hi. It's Alan Schnitzer. Let me take that. So the one point we characterized is typical
fluctuation really arises from two components. One on the loss side; there's some
fungibility of losses, so – and we're talking about a relatively small number, so it's hard to
necessarily pinpoint what those dollars were, but as we look at our analytics and our
losses, what we really saw in the quarter was a very small, you can count them on one
hand, a small number of large fires around the world that contributed to after-tax, less
than $20 million. That may be where that comes from. The rest of it was on the expense
side and there's always going to be some normal fluctuations in expenses from period to
period.

FINAL

Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity

In terms of the margin outlook, you can certainly look at what rate is doing and what loss
trend is doing and do a very narrow quantitative analysis and say, gee, margins are going
to shrink. We tend to look at margins on a broader basis. So there are lots of things other
than the written rate and an estimated loss trend that are going to impact margins going
forward, you've got things like volume, exposure, mix, expenses, claim initiatives,
weather, large losses, all those things every quarter are going to have an impact on our
results. And so at least the way we look at written rate and loss trend at the moment, it's
hard for us to say necessarily what margins are going to do over the near term and we
take our best shot in giving you some perspective on that in the outlook section of the 10Q. So, I would suggest that if you have another chance, you take a look at that.

A - Jay Steven Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

This is Jay Fishman. One other observation. Your question and Alan's answer is in respect
of written rate versus loss trend. Obviously, on an earned basis, as we look forward to the
rest of this year, looking over to Jay Benet to see if I'm right, we anticipate that earned
margin will continue to modestly expand from here, all other things being the same and
they never are. So I'm simply talking about the calculation of earned rate versus loss trend
modestly. Everybody is pointing modestly here. So it's not a matter of this year.
Now, I second the motion on Alan's comment, which is, one is obviously a lower number
than four and all other things being the same, that would suggest some margin
compression. But, again, all other things are not the same; exposure, a meaningful portion
of exposure acts like rate, you get volume differences, you get productivity efficiencies.
So it's close. And I would hesitate on concluding definitively that written margins and at
therefore sometime down the future earned margins at this level will, by definition,
reduce. They may. It's possible. But it's not – it's just isn't that clear yet. The numbers are
just not that pointedly different.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thanks. I have follow up on the reserve side. If you look at the short tail line releases over
the past two years that account for majority of the reserve releases avenues (31:15) is two
years. I just wonder, in hindsight, because shorter line you would imagine probably a little
bit easier to reserve than the long tail lines. And what has helped you guys in the past two
years in terms of short tail line reserve releases, and the sustainability of that going
forward?

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

We can't talk about the sustainability of it, because going back to our reserving
philosophy, we're always reserving at best estimate. So I can talk about some of the
things that have caused the reserves to develop favorably. You say that short tail lines are
easier to reserve for, and it's an interesting phenomenon that takes place. If you're
dealing with short tail, and particularly if you're dealing with property, you have events that
take place. In many cases, they're taking place in a current quarter where you're coming
up with the estimates in that quarter. And even though it's a short tail business you're
dealing with, not a lot of claim information at that particular time.

So you're looking at recent activity or historical activity to make judgments as to how
those claims are going to develop, how the storms are going to develop. And depending
upon the nature of the storm, where the storm hits, you could have situations where
you're thinking that a tornado has a lot of hail associated with it. You look at the history of
how that's developed, and put up numbers. And then, as time goes on, we found that we
overshot the mark a little bit because that particular storm didn't follow the pattern of
previous storms in terms of the related hail damage. So it's like everything else in
reserving, you have some data upon which to make assumptions. And then, you
extrapolate from that, you make your best estimate and then you're always adjusting it.
And when I say – in the case of short tail, it can lead to higher fluctuations. What I really
mean by that is the period of time in which you find you're making the adjustments is a
relatively short period of time. It's correcting quickly, whereas in lines like GL or workers'
comp you can often find that you're seeing long-term trends and you're evaluating them.
But the period of time in which you're making the adjustments can oftentimes be over
several quarters or even several years, as you see the data getting more solid.
So, it's an interesting aspect of reserving that I found intriguing when I first got involved in
it. But as it relates to the short tail lines, you do see these fluctuations because you're
dealing sometimes with very, very little data.

Hey, it's Amit Kumar – Amit Kumar from Macquarie Capital. Just two quick questions. So,
the first question is for Doreen. The results in Auto were strong. Can you sort of expand
on the loss cost comment? I think previously you've mentioned that loss trends have
remained at around 3%. Is it fairly unchanged in terms of where we are in this quarter?

A - Doreen Spadorcia

{BIO 4883600 <GO>}

Yes, it is. We debated about whether to put that in and figured that you'd ask us about it
anyway. So, yeah, we do see the severity trends for Auto to be about 3%, and that's all in.
I guess I'm just trying to think, and that includes bodily injury as well. That's a little bit
higher, but when you blend everything it's about 3%.

net exposures pretty carefully. And together with our partner and our local team, we

This is Jay, Jay. Two Jays here. Way I – predicting, what it is, I mean, we talk about our
share repurchases as being driven by our earnings. So depending upon what you and
others feel, our earnings look like going forward, you can do the math as to how long you
think that share repurchase authorization will be out there for our utilization. And, of
course, that's in addition to the remainder of the previous authorization, which I think was
another $884 million. So, I think between looking at what your projections are and looking
at the utilization in the past, you can come up with a pretty good estimate of what you
think it'll be.

Q - Jay H. Gelb

Page 13 of 23



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The

income, investment income typically being seasonally highest in the first quarter, if I put
that together, it looks like you could see at least a 10% decline in investment income aftertax in 2015, maybe into the low-teens. Is my math okay?

FINAL

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

I think there's two pieces to that. One, looking at the fixed investments, we put some
disclosure in our Q as to what we thought the period-over-period decrease on a quarterly
basis would be for fixed income NII. And, of course, the drivers of that are twofold: one,
the lower interest rate environment as items mature either in the current quarter or really
in the previous nine quarters as well, they're getting reinvested at the lower rate, so that
will have an impact. And also, as we pointed out, we paid the $579 million on the direct
action, so that those funds are no longer in the investment portfolio. And when you
combine those two things, you're roughly at about a $30 million after-tax decrease on the
fixed income NII.

Bloomberg Transcript

As it relates to – per quarter – as it relates to the non-fixed income portion, we've
provided you data on what the composition of the portfolio is, you've seen the historical
yields associated with it. I don't have a crystal ball to say how the economy is going to
perform and whatever. We've tried to give information as it relates to the impact of the oil
price decline and the feeling like we've hopefully gotten to a point where the vast
majority of whatever repricing or revaluations will take place have been captured but I
think you need to make your own estimates as to what you think that part of the portfolio
will go.

A - Jay Steven Fishman

your comment about seasonality in net investment income is.

and then it trails off and...

FINAL

A - Jay Steven Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

There's nothing about our fixed income portfolio that has any seasonality to it,
whatsoever. Other than as time progresses and more of the portfolio is reinvested at
lower rates, we've been saying it for years now, the net investment income will go down
over time. No seasonality in that number at all. As it relates to the energy dynamic, I would
point out that we put out a schedule in last quarter's webcast which summarized how our
private equity investments and what we thought was the – and what we defined as the
energy space, my recollection is that somewhere around $760 million or so, inclusive, I
think, we can go back, I'm working from memory, but it's not insignificant but hardly
overwhelming. So those are the two points I'd add on investment income.

A - William Herbert Heyman

{BIO 3429455 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Jay, it's Bill Heyman. What you see in seasonality is really a degradation of book yield
that's gone on now for three or four years and we calculate it more or less to the basis
point and quarter by quarter. And so that slope, the slope of the slope will change over
time, but the direction of the slope will persist for a while.
Our basic allocation here, which is 93% or 94% fixed income is designed so that even if
investments other than fixed income don't perform, which we know on occasion they
won't, our interest revenues, assuming we collect them, even at these levels, are enough
to give the company a shot at an overall ROE in our target range, and that's the policy and
it's not really an accident.
In terms of the non-fixed income portfolio, I know we're making the comparison this
morning to the first quarter of 2014, but I think it's instructive to look at this quarter against
the fourth quarter of 2014 and then the fourth quarter against the third quarter of 2014.
And you can see that for non-fixed income investment as a whole in the webcast on the
bottom right of page 6 but that includes the entire universe.
In private equity, the decline over the last two quarters was pronounced. So this doesn't
come as too much of a surprise and given the elevated levels of the first three quarters
of 2014 you can see comparisons like this again for a couple quarters yet. What I think we
can say is that since we received results and report them to you on a quarterly lag, we try
to go behind them and look at market conditions and determine whether there is in the
portfolio some embedded, but yet unreported, loss that means that these marks are less
accurate. We don't see that.
Obviously, our vision isn't perfect, but Jay Benet alluded to developments in oil prices and
in the publicly held securities of these funds and we looked at equity markets generally,
but it is what it is, and for what it's worth, real estate this quarter performed very well at
levels equal to the first quarter 2014. Hedge funds performed better. The shortfall was in
private equity and 50% of it came from 15% of the portfolio. So that's the story.

Next question, please.

Next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein. Go ahead.

Q - Josh C. Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. Jay, I wanted to ask a follow up question on to Kai's question about
where we are on pricing relative to loss trends and how that implies for future margins.
So, I guess I'm really curious where do you think the break-even point is going to be for
future margin compression. If we sort of dial back I think a year ago, maybe 3% to 4% is
what a lot of companies were saying you'd want to cover loss trend with and now it's 1.4%
versus maybe the CPI something approaching 2%. I know there's lot of moving pieces,
you mentioned some of them, but what do you think the level is that we think might be
margin compression kind of pricing levels and if you don't mind the question, you guys
have led us through this pricing cycle so far, will you draw a line in the sand to preserve
margins before you get to that point?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jay Steven Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

First, we really don't perseverate really as much as perhaps you all do on whether margins
are a little bit wider or a little bit smaller. We've got, I don't know, the last time I looked we
have close to 1 million commercial lines accounts, each one of them were priced one at a
time. So the notion that we somehow think or manage with that level of granular dynamic
is just – it's silly almost. We occasionally show you the distribution of rate gains across the
entire book and that should impress you with the diversity of it that that every account is
priced on its own. So I start off first with a philosophical answer that, not that I won't try
and answer your question, the honest answer to it is I just don't know.
What we do believe, what we are currently recording is an aggregate overall loss trend of
4%. That remains across our entire commercial book, our business book, unchanged. It's
independent of whatever CPI numbers come out or Producer Price Index. We are pretty
granular about our loss trend and feel that we try hard to get it right. The reason we try
and get it right is a whole lot less about reserving than it is pricing. We price our product to
losses and if we don't have our losses right, we're not going to get the right price, so we
get very driven and very focused on that.
So if you wanted to do just simple arithmetic, you'd say unless you get four points of
written rate, all other things being the same, margins would begin to go down but all
other things are just not the same. Exposure, we've talked about this many times in the
past, has a fair amount of activity in it that looks like rate, acts like rate. An example would
be an increase in property limits on a building. You collect more premium, granted there
are more limits at risk but absent a total loss, that number will act in the calculation
Page 16 of 23

FINAL

equivalent to rate. And so when we start trying to analyze it, the best answer that we can
give you right now is it's close. It's close. And I – but, again, it's not as if we perseverate
much at all on whether it's up a little bit – certainly not up, down a little bit or flat, it's just
not – we think about returns over time, not about – importantly, not about margin in any
given quarter.
Returns, over time, it's how we think about it. So that's sort of our outlook. In terms of
lines in the sand, we always draw that. There's nothing different about that. One of the
things that's impressive to me, Alan shared some of this data with you a couple quarters
ago, sure it's dated. We don't even quote on round numbers 60% of the requests for
quotes that we get in commercial accounts, it varies, 60% to 70%, something like that, am
I close on that still? Just wanted to – and so, the line in the sand starts right there. It's not
as if we – we don't quote on more business than we do quote.
And then our hit rate is a function of that smaller quote rate. So we draw lines in the sand
every single day at every account. It's not a philosophical line in the sand. It's an account
by account philosophical line in the sand. And that's just so important. We don't pressure
underwriters for volume. We don't. If you do, you'll get volume. You won't like what you
get, that's been our philosophy but you'll get it. We let them run their business with
tremendous amounts of data like adults making thoughtful decisions managing it for the
long-term. So, yeah, we draw lines in the sand all the time.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

I would just add to that in terms of the line in the sand, as you've heard from us, we're
return focused and that's our objective. As we underwrite account by account, or class by
class, and in that return, we'll take into account interest rates, competitive conditions in
the marketplace, everything else. So while we are drawing lines in the sand on accounts,
we're not going to look at some magical return number and say that's it, we're stopping,
that's going to change and it's going to take into account all the facts and circumstances
over time.

A - Jay Steven Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

One of the questions that we've been asked over a long period of time and our answer
has been the same, to us the leading indicator about lack of stability in the market, and
the way in which you can best assess the sort of near term is retention. It is really, to me
personally, given my experience here, remarkable that we had record retention in our
domestic business insurance business while still getting positive renewal rate. I just think
that's really quite remarkable and speaks to the stability of the business. If you want to
get a sense of churn, you look at retention. And I'm getting a little long in the tooth, but I
go back to the late 1960s when retentions in the Middle Market were in the high 60%s.
70% was considered a pretty stable month. This quarter in the Middle Market, we were
like in the 87%. It just shows you the magnitude of the difference. And really, I think just
reinforces the way in which we run the business.

That's – Jay, Alan, that's really helpful. As we sort of think about simplifying all of this, I
guess my one follow up on that and then I'll let you guys move on. If I integrate what
you've all just said, which I think is that you're sort of near your break-even point on margin
compression and you're happy with rates. But then in your outlook you say that, basically,
that you expect pricing to be broadly consistent for the rest of the year with the level that
it was in the first quarter. Is that – did that mean we should basically be interpreting that
sort of the slowing pricing trend of the past seven or eight quarters has just been
relatively stable is going to stop here and we're going to see you guys try to keep pricing
where it is here for the foreseeable future?

A - Jay Steven Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So, again, I've got to fall back to the account-by-account discussion. If we – because that's
how we think of pricing, not as a single manifest order to the organization. An underwriter
is sitting with an agent and are talking about an account that's had, and I use this example
all the time, three consecutive years of price increases, and that account has been doing
just fine, and the agent and the underwriter come to a conclusion that it's appropriate to
renew that account flat, we are all for it. We are all for that. No issue at all. If the
conversation is that the account absorbs a tremendous amount of cost and risk
management, and loss experience is kind of marginal, and therefore we should be asking
for a fourth consecutive increase, we will.
It's by the account. What is true overall is that more of our business has moved into what
one would consider returned good, returned acceptable, than it was two, three, four
years ago. So as those account-by-account decisions get made, they get made in a
different framework of return to the company. We think that's great. Couldn't be happier
about the way our field underwriters execute on that.
So it's not a matter of us sending out a message that says, "stop here." We never would
say that. Our message is "look at the account, look at the costs, look at the expenses,
look at the load, look at the class of business. Do you want it part of your portfolio? Does
the account have stability? Use your best judgment. Do the right thing." And we leave it to
them. And that's – so I can't – if rate were to go – flatten from here and people were
pursuing that, it'd be fine in the aggregate. If rate were to go down another point and
they were pursuing that strategy, it'd be fine. The rate, in the end, is the result of tens of
thousands of transactions, not a single order that's given out to the field.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

And, Josh, to that I would add that on our most challenged segments of business, we
continue to get rate in excess of loss trend.

A - Jay Steven Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Yeah, that actually is so darn important because it speaks to the granularity of the
strategy, that where accounts are not meeting our return expectations, we already draw
in effect – come back to that line – we draw the line, and we're getting rate at that point
exceeding loss trends. So important.

{BIO 4883600 <GO>}

Hi, Mike, this is Doreen. Let me just – I'll bring you back just probably a year or so, so you
know what we put in place. But, we actually did some back-testing on what we needed to
do to be more competitive in the customer segment that we wanted. And when we
looked at that, we thought that our expenses needed to be adjusted. And so, that's what
we did.
We took $140 million out of our operating costs, as well as reduced the commission on
the new product. And what we told our agents, and, first of all, I want to give them great
credit, because notwithstanding that sort of salary change, they were great partners and
supported that. And what we told them was we wanted them to be competitive across
channels. We weren't doing this just so they could switch one company's business to us.
We wanted them to be able to compete with the captive and the direct writers. And,
while I wouldn't say that the price points are always what those companies are, it made us
and them much more competitive in those customer segments. But, I mean, the whole
thing, you need an organization that's willing to execute to that, you need strong agency
relationships. And at the end of the day, you need a product that people want.

We can see it in little pockets, Mike, but nobody has really taken the approach of adjusting
their cost base. So if they're doing that with pricing we can see a little bit of that, but

how you're thinking about investments there, and the potential for – do any of these new

A - Doreen Spadorcia

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure. On the direct-to-consumer initiative, I think Jay and Greg have talked about this in
the past. I mean, we still feel like there's a very strong value proposition for the customers
that we have and the advice that they get from agents. We just haven't seen sort of the
run on the bank that maybe would have been predicted a decade ago. That being said,
we also think it's very prudent to make sure that we have multiple channels of business
because our goal is the customers that we like, we'd like to bring in the door any way
they'd want to come in. All that being said, I know there's been some talk about some
entrants in the marketplace and I think I would tell you our view is to just evaluate and wait
and see what that might bring. We've made no decisions and we're in observation mode.

A - Jay Steven Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

It's Jay Fishman. I'd add a couple points, and Doreen's got it all right, which is that one of
the things that is – and well, you've said this before, nothing new in this. But increasingly
it's in the data. The nature of the customer who chooses to buy directly is a different
customer than that which seeks advice. And it's not just the nature of the customer, but
it's their risk management needs. So broadly speaking, and this comes from our
experience with being a GEICO partner for many, many years, the percentage of renters
in amongst the GEICO customer is a multiple of what the renter population is in our
agency business. The percentage of minimum and low limits buyers for Auto who buy
direct are a multiple of those low limits or minimum limits that buy directly. Now, that's not
a 100% and it's not an absolute statement, but broadly speaking, you would say that the
nature of the risk management needs based upon data, not anecdotal, not observational,
not television commercials, but based upon the data, is that they're different. Now, that's
in effect, really good news for us because the agency business that we direct our
attention to has been much more resilient and robust than people 10 years ago might
have suggested.

And maybe that changes in the future. It's possible. And it would be foolish of us to be
arrogant enough to say that that customer could never be attracted and so we're going
to continue to develop the technology such that if that business dynamic changes we're in
a position to respond. But several quarters ago, our conclusion was and we shared with
you that the nature of the customer that we seek is not yet buying enough through a
direct channel that the business is a scalable business around that. You – to make it
scalable, you have to be at that different segment and that's just not our sweet spot. So,
I'd say, gee, it would have been nice if the direct channel would have developed more
robustly but believe me when I tell you as I had to pick one versus the other going into
this, I'm much happier that the agency channel has remained more robust than people
would have suspected.

us. So most of the winter storm activity that took place this quarter was non-cat weather,
as we describe, or differentiate between cat versus non-cat. And looking at this year
versus last, and I think Brian made the comment, the weather in this quarter was
heightened from what we would think of as a – if there is such a thing anymore as a
normal quarter, it was heightened from that. Last year was also a heightened weather
quarter. And while the data is – it's voluminous data but it's also challenging data to say
exactly this is a weather loss, this isn't a weather loss, the feeling around here is that the
weather losses this year were elevated from the weather losses last year but they
weren't off the charts different, they were just a bit higher than they were last year. That
would be the feeling that we get from the data. So higher than normal, whatever normal
is these days. A bad winter season last year, bad winter season this year. This year, all in, a
little higher than last year and that would go for both cats as well as non-cat.

Got it, that's helpful. Yeah, definitely. And then, the second question was you talked about
the, I guess, some of the changes in reinsurance and the impact on premiums. Can you
discuss those changes and what drove the premium impact?

FINAL

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Well, the primary one is the change in the cat program that we announced last quarter. As
you recall, our cat reinsurance was generally done – was always done on July 1. And the
new cat aggregate treaty that we put in place was a January 1 deal. So, the premium for
that is primarily what we're seeing in this quarter through the ceded line that's impacting
the quarter-over-quarter comparisons, because last year there was no ceded – there was
no premium for that.

Because it all shows up in the quarter in which it's purchased.

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

And writ. Yeah and the writ.

And it's not amortized, to be clear.

On the written. All right, whereas last year in the third quarter of 2014, we would have
seen a similar payment taking place, whereas on July 1 of this year we will not be making
that payment because we've already made it.

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

The easier comparison in July should be up a little bit more than expected?

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Yes.
