Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
Good day, and welcome to this conference call with Gjensidige. Today's conference is
being recorded. We will now hand over the word to CEO, Helge Baastad. Please go
ahead, sir.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Gjensidige's conference call. It's Helge
Baastad speaking and with me I have our CFO, Jostein Amdal; and our Head of IR, Mitra
Negård. Earlier today, we announced the sale of Gjensidige Bank to Nordea. We have
also entered into a strategic partnership agreement with respect to mutual distribution of
non-life insurance and ﬁnancing products in Norway.
We are very pleased with the cooperation agreement, which together with the
divestment, strengthens Gjensidige's platform for growth and high insurance customer
retention, as well as increases our ﬁnancial capability. The reciprocal partnership enable
us to oﬀer a wide range of ﬁnancing products to both our private and commercial
customers, which we believe is a signiﬁcant contribution to maintaining high customer
retention.
The agreement will also expand our reach to Nordea's large customer base in Norway.
The agreement is exclusive, meaning that Nordea will distribute insurance products only
from Gjensidige in Norway. And likewise, Gjensidige will distribute ﬁnancing products

only from Nordea in Norway. We view Nordea as perfect match for Gjensidige,
particularly considering their broad bank oﬀering, their strong brand and leading position
in the Nordics, as well as their strategic focus on digital transformation.
Gjensidige Bank has had a very strong development since establishment in 2006.
However, the bank's growth combined with more strength against regulatory capital
requirements have tied up signiﬁcant solvency capital in Gjensidige. The distribution
agreement provide us with the opportunity to serve our customers with an attractive
product oﬀering without having to own and thereby tie up capital for banking products.
I will now turn you over to Jostein who will comment on the transaction details and use of
proceeds.

Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Helge. As you have seen in our announcement, the agreed price for
Gjensidige Bank is NOK 5.5 billion to be paid in cash. This is a price we're happy with.
The ﬁnancing transaction – the ﬁnal transaction price will be adjusted based on the
performance of the bank until closing of the transaction. We expect closing to take place
during the ﬁrst quarter of 2019, subject to regulatory approvals from Norwegian
competition authorities and the Norwegian FSA on our side, as well as relevant FSAs for
Nordea.
We expect to record an estimated gain of approximately NOK 1.9 billion for the
Gjensidige Group upon closing of the transaction. This gain will, as a non-recurring item,
be excluded from the basis for calculation of regular dividends. The proceeds from the
transaction will provide ample ﬁnancial resources to pursue value-enhancing growth
opportunities, giving further support to our short and long-term dividend capacity. As of
Q1 2018, the solvency margin would have increased from 159% to 233%. If M&A
opportunities do not materialize, we will pay out excess capital over time, in line with our
dividend policy.
With this, we will now open up for questions from participants. Operator, could you
proceed, please?

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. And we'll now take our ﬁrst question, Wajahat Rizvi from Deutsche Bank,
please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Wajahat Rizvi from Deutsche Bank. Three questions for me, please.
Firstly, in terms of M&A opportunities, can you tell us broadly which areas will attract you,
what you're looking, for example, any regions you're targeting? Do you all looking to get
Page 2 of 14



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2018-07-02

scale in Baltics or Sweden or would you want to consolidate your position in Denmark?
That would be the ﬁrst question.

FINAL

Second one would be a clariﬁcation, would you able to tell us what your Tier 1 sub debt
capacity will be once the deal will complete? And related to that, do you expect to revise
your solvency margin target of upwards from 125% to 175% once the deal is complete?
And just a bit more clarity on this ﬁnal point you have made around M&A that, if the M&A
opportunities do not materialize, you will return this capital in short to long-term. What do
you – how do you deﬁne long-term here? And what will be the mechanism of any capital
repatriation? Thank you very much.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. I can start with the M&A perspective. You know this, I guess,
from before, we want to develop our company and grow in a proﬁtable way in the
Nordics and the Baltics. And I have commented the M&A strategy before, we would be
very pleased to grow our business in Sweden. If it arise, consolidation opportunities in
Denmark, of course, we want to grow our business in Denmark as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the Baltics, we have a satisfactory position. If it arise opportunities, especially in Estonia,
we would look into that, because we have a stronger position in Lithuania and Latvia. But
it's about non-life expansion, if it's the right (05:53) opportunity and if it support our
ﬁnancial targets. So, the M&A strategy is the same as before.
Maybe your standard comment on Tier 1 capacity and solvency margin, and also ﬁnally
what we deﬁne as long term. Long term, we will not hold back anything. As you know, we
will pay out extraordinary dividends over time, but it's up to the board at any time to
discuss dividend. And the dividend strategy is absolutely unchanged.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yeah. I think actually you answered really the fourth of the three questions, Helge, that...

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Maybe I do.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

...over time is really a judgmental exercise and it's up to the board to asses that at any
time whether we should do something special or not. But don't think I will move any
further into being speciﬁc about that. And working backwards, the solvency targets, we
will come back to you with that during 2018. As for now, this solvency target stay as they
are, have been said before.
When it comes to the second question, the eﬀects on Tier 1 capacity, it is a slight increase
in theory in Tier 1 capacity because eligible capital is increased and the Tier 1 capacity is a

Page 3 of 14



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2018-07-02

function of eligible capital. We'll get back to you with numbers in connection with the Q2
in a very few days, 10 days. But it's not a big eﬀect.

FINAL

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

Okay. And, sorry, can I just ask a quick follow-up on this? So, if you return this capital over
time, given that you're losing all these earnings, the deal is likely to be EPS dilutive, and
you're not changing your dividend payout guidance as well. Like, would you need to
change your dividend payout guidance to at least ensure that expected dividend remain
at this sort of level? I'm talking about per share sort of number here.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Our dividend policy remains ﬁrm, which means that on the ordinary dividend, it's high
and stable normal dividends, and we expect to keep that dividend stream going forward
on the regular dividends.

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

Sure. Despite the deal being dilutive?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

On the earnings side, but you need to recognize...

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

...that the bank has consumed as much capital as it has generated in broad terms (08:44).

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

The bank hasn't supported a dividend at any time, actually.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

The growth – the bank has consumed the capital generated in the bank so far.

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

Sure. Thank you very much.

We will now take our next question from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca.

FINAL

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. So, my questions have been addressed, but there's one thing left, is,
you know, that I've noticed that you're also going to distribute insurance products
through Nordea's bank branches in Norway, I presume. I mean, you're already a very
large player in Norway. And what was the incentive to look for more distribution in
Norway? If you could comment on (09:39).

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

You're right, we have a very strong position as a market leader in Norway, but it's
competition every day, and we have to ﬁght for our customers every day. And we have
about 900,000 customers in Gjensidige. And Nordea, they have 900,000 customers.
They're number two bank in Norway. So – and they have also invested heavily into digital
solutions. So it's actually a huge potential for new sales through the exclusive agreement
both ways. So we want to continue with broad product oﬀering with ﬁnance products
from Nordea to our customers. And the other way, we want to secure that customer base
of Nordea can have the non-life products from Gjensidige. So, it's a potential for positive
organic growth going forward.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And if I may add that we moved from a bank with 170,000 customers to a bank with
900,000 customers, it obviously increases the potential for cross-selling.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

And in the car dealership channel, which is strategically important for us, for the car
insurance market, Nordea is slightly bigger than us beforehand (10:57), but there is very
little overlapping between their part of this market and ours, so it's a real (11:04).

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Sure. And can I just follow up on the M&A, though? Are you – I mean, because we've
heard this talk that there will be likely consolidation in the Norwegian market in the
smaller market share players, the typical 2%, 3%, 5% range. Is that also on the radar or is
that not on your mind that you already are going to grow bigger and bigger in Norway? Is
that a fair assumption?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I would be quite simple. Any value-creating opportunities on the radar, but our appetite is
ﬁrst and most related to growing non-life position outside Norway, but if it arise a valuecreating opportunity in Norway as well and it ﬁts, it's a good ﬁt, we will look into that. But

Page 5 of 14

ﬁrst priority, Sweden, Denmark, and as I said also to balance our position in the three
Baltic states.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

FINAL

Great. Thank you.

Operator
We'll now take our next question from Johan Ström from Carnegie.

Q - Johan Ström
Thank you. Two questions for me to start with. First of all, can you just conﬁrm that the
bank is using – Gjensidige Bank is using a standardized approach for calculating riskweighted assets? And if so, how important has this topic been for Nordea in your view in
terms of pricing the bank?
And then also, if you can comment on what you think is a normalized return on equity or
proﬁtability level in Gjensidige Bank today. It's been quite lumpy over the past couple of
quarters, but it's been in the range of 10% to 14%. So, what do you think is a normalized
return on equity on the current products put there (13:02)?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Okay. First of all, I can conﬁrm that they use standardized approach. I don't think you
should ask me how important that is to Nordea, Johan, that you should ask them. Thirdly,
the normalized return on equity, I mean, if you take away the one-time eﬀects that we
have communicated regarding the proﬁts from the sale of non-performing loans, you see
that we are still about 10% (13:27).

Q - Johan Ström
Got it. Thank you. And then just ﬁnally, overlap on customers, how many of the bank
customers are also customers in Gjensidige Insurance? And could you also give us a
number of your – or an indication of how many of the bank customers that are parts or
members of diﬀerent unions in Norway?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Of Nordea Bank customers, you mean?

Q - Johan Ström
No, of Gjensidige Bank customers.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I don't think we are disclosing that kind of details on the (14:01) on mortgage book, there's
a very large part of mortgage group is actually members of those organizations, 80% in
Page 6 of 14



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA

Date: 2018-07-02

total, but we're not disclosing each one of them, and as you know, we need to actually
(14:15) move to Nordea just a few weeks ago.

FINAL

On terms of customer, we don't have any numbers on the number of customers in
Nordea who are already Gjensidige customers, we just don't have the number.

Q - Johan Ström
Okay. Thank you. And then, one more, if I may. And, yeah, okay, sorry. Thank you. Just on
the equity injections you have made over the past three, four years closer around NOK 1
billion, if I'm not mistaken, have the bank paid out any dividends or have the retained
earnings in the bank being kept in the bank? So – yeah.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

The bank has never paid any dividends.

Q - Johan Ström
Thank you.

We will now take our next question from Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank. Please go
ahead, Matti Ahokas. Please ensure that your line is not muted.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yeah. Sorry. Good morning. Could you elaborate a bit more on why now selling the bank
and what's the kind of strategic rationale? Because I understand the argument that you're
saying that it has drag on the ROE, but this has been the case for a long time. So, what has
basically changed or what made you change your mind that the banking operations
would be better elsewhere?
And also on the timing, why now? Do you have some kind of M&A target on your mind?
And maybe, thirdly, was this from your initiative or Nordea's initiative the deal was done?
Thanks.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Matti, as you maybe have heard over the last few quarters, we have said that it's not that
important for us to own the bank going forward, but it has been important for us to ﬁnd a
solution where we can actually strengthen the product oﬀerings to all the customers. And
we have been in dialogue with several potential buyers for the bank since we actually
gave that signal some few quarters ago. And we concluded that agreement with – which
provide us with a good price for the bank and attractive distribution agreement for the
beneﬁt of our customers and to the value creation in Gjensidige. And the timing was now,
actually, and we are really pleased with the combination of Nordea and Gjensidige. And
as I said, we are satisﬁed also with the price.

Page 7 of 14



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2018-07-02

So, this actually – this process mentally actually started some few quarters ago. And we
had – I implicitly had also given the reason for that because we haven't so far had any
support from the bank when it comes to dividends. And Gjensidige – the dividend
strategy and the dividend concept is strongly important for us going forward.

We'll now take our next question from Vegard Toverud from Pareto. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.

Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

Thank you. First, just to take you on the new partnership agreement. Will that come in to
force on the completion of the potential current transaction?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

It's June 30, 2019, because of the existing agreement within Nordea and Tryg.

Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thank you. And for the price, you said it's adjusted for performance during the
year. Is that only a positive or is it potentially also a negative towards the NOK 5.5 billion?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Well, I guess, that could (18:23) go both ways. We've delivered good results over a
number of quarters and years. So, I wouldn't be too concerned.

Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

Okay. Could you give us some more details about how the performance structure there is
setup?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

No. Not this time. Certainly not.

Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And lastly, when it comes then to the use of proceeds, will you look to
the valuation in this transaction for what you're using money for?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

This is a bank transaction, Vegard. And going forward, our focus is to grow on the non-life
side.

Our next question comes from Steven Haywood from HSBC.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you very much. I just wanted to conﬁrm a couple of things you said.
I believe you said that the exclusive distribution agreement with Nordea it comes in and it
ends the Nordea-Tryg agreement at the beginning of 2019, is that correct?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

June 2019.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

June 2019. Sorry. Thank you very much. And then with this exclusive distribution
agreement, does it encompass all of Nordea's retail, commercial and corporate clients in
Norway? And is it a white-labeled product? And if you can give us any further information
on the potential you might see from growth, that would be great. Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

It's actually the most diﬃcult one, stressed a lot on the potential growth. I mean, this is
why we go into this because we know how much larger customer base to distribute our –
or cross-sell our products on. But we've (20:25), it's really the biggest work really, but
that's kind of part or that's strong reason for this transaction. It will apply for all customers,
both private and commercial or corporate customers in Norway.
And what was the ﬁrst part of the question again? (20:48)

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Whether white-labeled product.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

No. Sorry. Yeah, the branding, it's for the Gjensidige brand.

Our next question comes from Jan Erik Gjerland from ABG.

FINAL

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Hey. Good morning to you. I just have some couple of questions as well. Just to follow up
on Steven's last question. How much had the agreement to do with the sales to Nordea
when it comes to the total price? Is the sort of the agreement sort of independent of the
bank or is it a sort of a good reason to sell the bank to Nordea and get this exclusive
transaction agreement on place?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I think we sold this as a packaged solution. We have said for a long time we need to
provide, we had (21:45) provide banking products in combination with insurance products
to our customers. So, we will dispose of the bank without any agreement to distribute
upwards.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. How will the agreement comes – when it comes to the sales fees, et cetera, will you
get some sales fee from Nordea and then from you, or will there be some net agreement
on the total sales on how it always is structured?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Well, the commission (22:08). But, I mean, that's not the – commission income isn't really
the main focus area. It is the potential of cross-selling between two large customer bases
in Norway.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

History has shown us that it has not been that successful distributing insurance through
banks and vice versa. How would you be so certain that you will come to succeed this
time around? Is it because that you have so little overlap on the customer since, if you
think about your customer base, it's more linked maybe to the unions and to the rural
areas in Norway while Nordea's customer base is maybe more linked towards to the cities
of Norway? How do you view that?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

If you look at our history, and we do not have any ﬁgures, Jan Erik, but the potential
between Nordea and Gjensidige is signiﬁcant. And that's due to our history with saving
banks and DNB.
Secondly, I think when we started the bank in 2006, 12 year ago, two years after, we got
the iPhone. And today, it's a completely diﬀerent platform for service consumption
looking forward. So, I think we will see easier way to distribute ﬁnance products through
the distribution system we have and the other way as well.

Page 10 of 14

FINAL

And ﬁnally, you have seen some transactions recently and you have more bank
consumption of non-life products in Norway compared to other countries. So, I think we
have more – in Norway, we have more bank assurance, non-life in banks compared to
what we have seen in Europe and in the other countries in the Nordics. So, we actually see
potential in this agreement going forward.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. When it comes to – it looks like you triggered some 4% to 5% of the sales in Norway
through Nordea, you potentially have a much higher expectation on that. So what kind of
issues are you really looking for when it comes to kind of a product sales, et cetera,
because this – bankers have never been able to sell very hard non-life products. So, how
would you succeed this time around?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Our focus and our aims as discussed with Nordea is to get as good as possible
integration into their loan processes especially in terms of mortgages and to build further
on the success we have in car dealership channel where they are actually slightly bigger
than us as a starting point. So, it increases the potential for us to cross-sell on the car
insurance in that channel. That's the two main reasons. And our interaction with them –
priority one, is more on mobile and then second digital channels, and thirdly, on their
physical distribution network.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

And if you look backward, it has been very much focused on system, new IT systems in
the whole industry and also Nordea. So, looking forward, we see also more potential
because they have invested into digital solutions where it's easier to actually to consume
the combination of non-life and bank products. So, we actually see a signiﬁcant potential
going forward.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

On the vice versa side then, how much will Nordea get out of you? How good are you
selling, cross-selling ﬁnancing products to your customer base?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

We have been somewhat successful in selling mortgages to Gjensidige Bank through the
insurance network and our digital channels. But of course, Gjensidige Bank is a very small
bank compared to Nordea, so you see how much potential we can actually be for Nordea.
But that's our ambition, to be able to cross both ways.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Also on the corporate side?

Our next question is a follow-up from Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Quick follow-up. Jostein, you mentioned that this was a packaged deal, i.e., that the
distribution agreement was, I guess, a signiﬁcant part. How should we look at the value of
the distribution agreement? And does this also imply that you would have got better
standalone price for the bank from somebody else without the distribution agreement?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I think the distribution agreement is beneﬁcial to both parties on a standalone basis, and
the price for the bank standalone is also satisfactory to us, as we said. And we have, as
Helge mentioned earlier, actually been talking to other potential buyers and partners as
well, and this is the best one for us.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

agreement also with or where the other parties more like or just interested in buying the

Our next question is a follow-up from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you for the opportunity. Just want to understand that because Gjensidige Bank
is not a normal bank in a sense that the customer base is really Gjensidige's sort of captive

customer base. Is this likely to have any impact from – in other words, is it possible that
those customers may not want to remain because Gjensidige is not the owner or is there
any risk around that that you could clarify please and obviously because you have a
mutual agreement now. So, it's important that to understand this I think. Thank you.

Well, I guess there might be feelings related to the brand of Gjensidige, the brands were
changed (29:01) in Nordea, but otherwise, we are very conﬁdent that our banking
customers will get at least as good a product and oﬀering from Nordea as we've gotten
today from Gjensidige. And the beneﬁts of being a customer all places everything will
remain. So, I don't really see a rational reason as to why that should happen.

No. It's two strong brand names in Norway, and so, it's extremely limited (29:28).

I mean, there was no special prices or I don't just mean the brand, I mean – because if
you're a captive insurance customer and you are getting a mortgage, you are probably
getting it at a cheaper rate, or there's no such thing, right?
