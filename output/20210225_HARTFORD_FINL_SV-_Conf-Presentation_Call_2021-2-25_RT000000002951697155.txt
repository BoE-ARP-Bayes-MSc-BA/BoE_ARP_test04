Great. Good morning, everybody. Good afternoon for those in Europe. My name is Mike
Zaremski, and it's my pleasure to introduce Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of the
Hartford; and Beth Costello, Chief Financial Officer. The format of today's presentation
will be a virtual fireside chat.
I'll start off by quickly saying that it's been a whirlwind past year for almost everybody to
say the least. I've been making the case to investors in spite COVID-19 headwinds and
parts of the business. The P&C industry fundamentals are sound and there's actually
underlying positive momentum in many areas. I was looking at the Hartford's 2022 for
example consensus earnings forecast for example, and they've indeed decreased 13% of
the kind of June, July 2020 lows with COVID uncertainty was at its peak.
So with that, why don't I pass it off to Chris to make some opening remarks as well. And
then we'll get into a Q&A.

Thank you, Michael. It's great to be with -- Beth and I are great to be with you at your
virtual conference here and we look forward to our conversations. I just thought I'd
summarize a couple key facts about The Hartford that maybe investors would find helpful.
First, in spite of all the challenges in 2020, I thought the organization performed
exceedingly well and persevered through a lot of challenge. In the end, we delivered over
$2 billion of core earnings, a 12.7% core earnings ROE, and we are executing well on our
key initiatives, including our expense savings program, The Hartford way.
The guidance we provided for 2020 from our core drivers perspective, I think, points to
commercial lines ability to expand margins and grow in the topline. For personal lines, I
would say, I think margins will remain healthy there, while driving patterns begin to revert

to normal means going forward. And as we discussed, group benefits, first half of the
year is going to be significantly impacted by what we think is going to be continued
excess mortality due to COVID, but the underlying fundamentals of group benefits remain
very, very, very solid.
So -- and then the last point is we have begun to execute our capital management
program, which as we described is $1.5 billion of buybacks through the end of 2020. So,
we feel good about returning and buying back shares to investors -- from investors. So
overall -- my overall feeling that I would want investors to have is, I feel very optimistic as
we head into 2021 and our ability to perform, create value for shareholders and ultimately
remain a top competitor in an environment where there's a lot of good competitors out
there. But, we're looking forward to a of competing every day for hearts and minds of
agents, brokers and customers.

Questions And Answers

Bloomberg Transcript

(Question And Answer)
Okay. That's a great intro to kind of maybe set us up for some of the questions that I also
surveyed some investors over the last couple weeks too. So some of these questions are
from them. Maybe, Chris and Beth, I think most investors at a high level do understand
that Hartford's growth trajectory for thinking about kind of premium and a topline growth
has been steadily improving along with GDP levels lately. Maybe, you can kind of talk
about some of the pluses and minuses you're seeing or thinking about in both maybe
P&C and group benefits. I know there's nuances there. So we don't have to touch on
every business line, but maybe the main points you'd like to get across.

A - Christopher Jerome Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Sure. I think what we tried to say particularly in our last investor call with fourth quarter
earnings, Michael, was I think you got to put everything in context to where we are today.
And first, I just think about what is the macro backdrop. One, we're still in a pandemic.
We're approaching hopefully 15% of our population being inoculated with the vaccine. But,
they're still going to be some pressures in various sectors of our economy as we still deal
with the pandemic broadly defined. Second, what I would say particularly is, for us, Beth
and I have always talked about our firm being in employment centric firm, given our large
presence in workers comp and long-term disability. Those lines are still performing very
well from an overall profitability perspective.
But, when unemployment really spiked as it did in this second quarter and we're now just
beginning to sort of build out, I mean there was a little topline pressure as people
reduced payrolls, as exposures shrank. But, listen to the Fed yesterday, I'm sure like you. I
mean, if the economy really can grow 6% next year, I mean that is going to put a little bit
of a lift. I would say, a lot of lift particularly on jobs and wages, which again exposure
should come back into our premium-based over -- building over the year. I think again

Page 2 of 13

FINAL

most of this is probably second half of the year and that's why I think the first half of the
year and the second half of the year in 2020 is going to be dramatically different.
And then third, Hartford-specific, I think you know more than the most, we've been hard
at working and improving the franchise, making investments, doing M&A to add
capabilities, building our own organic growth capabilities with new products and services.
And I really feel like it's all coming together very beautifully next year, where our agents
and our brokers really know our expanded capabilities and are looking to use more of our
products in solutions with our shared customers. So you think about the industry verticals,
you think about global specialty, you think of some of the improvements that we've
focused on in middle market, I think all that is coming together to have a margin
improvement story and a topline growth story.

Bloomberg Transcript

One business, I would call out just because I know it gets a lot of attention is small
commercial. As you know, small commercial is the gem of a business for us. We've been
added for over 30 years making investments and it's a marketplace we know very well.
We know distribution very well in there. We know all the fin-tech startups in a very well and
watch things closely. But, I would say, that business is starting to normalize and will pivot
again to top-line growth as exposures and it's payrolls come back on particularly in the
second half of the year.
We're still seeing is some minor exposure shrinkage through year-end. I think, premiums
were down about 1% in small commercial overall. Just again, not a bad outcome just given
the environment. But, I do feel that's going to pivot back to sort of modest growth going
forward and our business owners product that we've totally revamped and we think is
really, really innovative is -- has grown 12 -- almost 12%, 11% in the fourth quarter. And I
expect that double-digit growth rate it to continue, because it's such a revolutionary
product. So that's just one example in one of our businesses, Michael.

Q - Michael David Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Great. And I guess on a recent earnings call an investor asked me, I think your colleague
used language, said transformed middle and large commercial over the last year or two.
Maybe, you can kind of touch on what that means.

A - Christopher Jerome Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah. I think the way I would describe it is, I think we finished year one of a three year
process, project plan to really transform middle market from -- I'll call a couple
dimensions. First, just how we underwrite product there; two, efficiency; and three, again,
a little bit of growth and profitability.
On the underwriting, the weight is simply think of it is, right now I'd say slow process for
us, and I think most of the middle market players out there a lot of manual activities in
spreadsheets going back and forward. So, we're really ultimately looking to simplify the
underwriting process with advanced data, analytics, pre-fill using digital tools to ingest
data, have more common -- more commonality in our processes from agent -- to agent,
ultimately, trying to reduce our speed and turnaround times, because sometimes and

Page 3 of 13



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2021-02-25

FINAL

very complicated lines if you're quoting, workers comp and GL and property all together,
it could take 20, 25 days to get back to an agent. So we're really trying to get that down,
and we've gotten most of our comp turnaround time down into that 4 to 5 to 6 day time
period. And speed counts in this business and ultimately, efficiency. So that's the second
thing, is how can we'd be more efficient, how can we have a better customer experience
for our internal employees and our agents.
And then third, the profitability actions that Doug and Mo Tooker overtook over the last 18
years. So it really tune some aspects of our middle market book, it was -- it's painful to do,
right, shutting business or raising rates, but you have to if you're going to maintain or try
to grow your margin. So, I would say we're largely done with that. There might be a
couple little spots that we still need to tune a little bit in 2021, but that's what we mean
holistically that we're trying to transform middle market in the way business gets done
and ultimately, our profitability and growth profile.

A - Beth A. Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Just to be clear Chris, you said 18 years, I think you meant 18 months.

A - Christopher Jerome Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah, 18 months. Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael David Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

And Chris, just a follow-up, the first part of kind of these transformations to me it sounded
kind of like the digitization of some of the business processes. Are you -- just curious,
because it's tougher for our investors to get kind of under the hood and really understand
how the brokers are transacting with the likes of Hartford? What do you say Hartford is
kind of trying to be a first mover in this digitization process? Are you playing a little catch
up? Just trying to get a sense of where you feel your position in that kind of middle and
large commercial space?

A - Christopher Jerome Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah. It's hard for -- it's really hard for me to sort of have a good picture on just how
others compete, but I would say, we're probably in the first mover cohort. There's others
that I'm sure are working on things. Middle market and large commercials are very
important segment to us. So as I said, over the last 18 months, not 18 years, we've been
focusing a very, very keenly on improving the overall results and the business processes in
that area and we're going to continue to do that. We still got two more years to go. But,
committed to fundamentally changing the way we interact with our agents and brokers.

Q - Michael David Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And I guess, I asked because I sense from speaking to some brokers that
with -- on the micro commercial I call it a very small commercial, you guys are ahead of the
pack, and it's an easy -- it's an easy process for them. So, maybe switching gears to the
Hartford expense initiatives that are well underway, maybe you can kind of offer some
insights into what are that you talk of a lot of savings that's going to benefit investors, it
Page 4 of 13



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2021-02-25

isn't benefiting investors. Do you -- is there any cyclycality element to this where some of
it, if we get into a soft market could maybe go away or maybe even you want to give back
some of the saving to the consumer to elevate your -- the natural rate of growth?

FINAL

A - Christopher Jerome Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah. I'm going to let Best comment also. But I would just give you the context, Michael.
We've been at this,I would say, really hard for the last five quarters now, and feel really
good about where we're at. I think we said early on, I mean, we're trying to reduce
expense ratios into the ranges that we've talked about. And if top-line expands, that's
great, that's additional lift, that will probably drop, but if also topline gets a little soft, we
still want to then extract the dollars that produce -- produces that expense ratio outcome.
So we've geared it two ways into to ultimately achieve dollars and expense ratio
outcomes because that's important. We still feel again that the investments that we've
made over the years in our overall operation, whether it'd be technology, whether it'd be
digital, whether it'd be advanced data and analytics, those will continue. But we wanted to
drop the majority of the benefits in this program to the bottom line over '21, '22. And then
we can recalibrate really where we're at from overall run rate and overall investment need
perspective in '23 and beyond. So I know that's looking out just probably quite a bit for
some, but just to tell you our mindset.
So Beth, would you add to your perspective of the program?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Beth A. Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

The only thing that I just would reemphasize is, we were very intentional and not just
talking about this as a dollar amount of savings, but also what we expect to see from the
expense ratio, because I think sometimes for investors it can be really hard to find the
dollars of savings, because there's other things that can be pluses and minuses.
So, we're really anchored on that overall expense ratio improvement in P&C, and then
also in group benefits. And a little bit on the loss side as well, because a part of this
initiative and the savings that we're generating is going to come from how we adjudicate
claims and the expense associated with that. So it really is across all areas of the company.
But, the true proof as to whether or not we're making progress is going to be in that
expense ratio as that is what we are focused on.

Q - Michael David Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Understood. And quick follow-up, were there any kind of tough elements to this in terms
of attrition in people or is this kind of plan that was more on the digital kind of technology
side that were tougher decisions have to be make made in terms of flattening that
structured organization or something?

A - Beth A. Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean, it's a combination. I mean, obviously to achieve the savings that we're
talking about there are people impacts. We are a service business, and so a lot of our
Page 5 of 13

FINAL

class our people. And so some aspects are just looking at the organization and how its
structured and so forth. But, this is all about being sustained.
And so to sustain things you have to change processes you have to improve them. And so
a component of this is doing that as well. That's why we were very clear in showing their
some invest dollars that are going into achieving this program, because there are things
that we need to invest in to -- as you commented on digitization and things of that sort
that will get us to our ultimate goal.
So it's always difficult when you go through these types of initiatives, but as we look at
what we think it will do for us in the long run and improving our overall efficiency,
improving customer experience because again, we don't want to take any steps
backwards in that area and really looking at this as a way to continue to improve that
experience across all our businesses is top of mind as we look at executing across roughly
over 600 individual initiative that make up this program.

Q - Michael David Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

It's helpful. Maybe we can touch on, Chris you mentioned, we -- I think more than half of
the people listening today follow you rather closely and understand that the drivers of the
improved commercial P&C margin outlook. Maybe, you can kind of talk to you what's
driving the improved outlook? I think some of this what we just talked about, but I think
there's other elements as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christopher Jerome Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah. I would -- I'd share in Michael, as you know, the guidance that we provided
particularly in commercial -- our focus on commercial and we could talk about any other
the businesses almost 3 points of margin improvement as we measured it on an
underlying basis ex-COVID between years, which is pretty meaningful. If you really then
peel that is the first layer, I would say approximately 2 points of that is loss ratio
improvement and 1 point is expense ratio. And if you peel it even more, I think the biggest
contributors in sort of rank holder our global specialty, middle market and small.
We've talked quite a bit, and that we have a large workers comp book that is performing
exceedingly well. But, we don't expect -- we expect more of the same in 2021, maybe a
little less negative on rate pressure in totality, but not a huge turnaround in small from a
margin in perspective. Middle could be flattish to maybe slightly up, just we have a little bit
more freedom of rate in middle. But, I think the margin expansion is it will be driven by
obviously ex-workers comp, but mostly coming from global specialty, our specialized
industry verticals some of our excess liability, our umbrella product lines and then the rest
of metal market.
So again, I think the rate environment we see is still going to be healthy. A lot of different
reasons for that, which we've talked about. But, I still think there is a lot of pressure on
social inflation. the 10 years, people think it's spiked, but you got to put it in context it's still
below 1.5%. So we're still going to be in a low environment. And, I think that's still points to

Page 6 of 13



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2021-02-25

a very friendly rate environment for carriers, I still continue to believe in the next 18
months, for sure.

FINAL

Q - Michael David Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

That's helpful. Maybe let's switch gears then Chris, to the group benefits. I think investors
understand the mortality impacts you spoke to and it was fair for us to unfortunately look
at kind of mortality rates and on our -- on the screen to get a sense of when that impact
can fall off ?

A - Christopher Jerome Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah. When does it stop, right?

Q - Michael David Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Christopher Jerome Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. You're right. I mean, what -- we are over 500,000, that's today estimated by CDC
caused directly by COVID. But again, I think what we've -- all industry participants have
talked about is the concept of excess mortality due to COVID and just people not taking
care of themselves during the pandemic here. And not doing the regular maintenance on
a human body that is required so that you remain healthy and don't get sick, and you
discover things more quickly.
So we know where we're at. I think your question ultimately is, as you said, when does it
stop? I think we were transparent and clear in our earnings call at the year end that I see
this as more of a first quarter impact -- first half of the year, but 75% of the impact in the
first quarter. And then continuing into the second quarter. The dollar amount that we gave
on a point estimate of our excess mortality, which there's a range around but sometimes
it's easier for investors just anchor around a point estimate is a $160 million of excess
mortality, again occurring mostly in the first half of '21. So, I think that's where we're at.
And all the data that I follow and I'm sure you're do too is, the vaccines are beginning to
bend the curve of infections. Death rates will follow, but you could see them particularly
after the holiday season and I consider in a holiday season basically in November and in
December. There was a spike, and now that that's spike starting in to come down. So
there's an encouraging signs, but again, we still have to keep our guard up as a nation, as
individuals and contribute to that overall healthy environment and recovery from COVID.
The only watch item is the multi-variants that are coming out of a different parts of the
world and is there a second spike due to the variations of -- in the mutations on the virus, I
don't know. But, I still think this is a first half of the year or first half of '21 issue, and we
should be in a much better position as we revert back to normal in the second half of '21,
Michael.

Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The

Understood. And just one -- yes, sorry Beth. Go ahead.

FINAL

A - Beth A. Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

I just want to add to that, because I know the question was specific to group benefits and
the comments that we made about our expectations for 2021. But as a reminder, we do
still expect to see some impacts in the P&C lines as well, I mean provided an estimate of
that and just like group benefits we'd expect that to be more heavily weighted to the first
half of the year, and to the first quarter just given what we're seeing.

Q - Michael David Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

And just one nuance, is there any IBNR concepts in group benefits similar to P&C where
you're kind of maybe trying to front-load maybe some of the impact that might even take
place and this second half of the year?

A - Christopher Jerome Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

I'll let Beth. Again, we've talked about our accounting quite a bit as a reformed
accountant. I mean, you have a concept of IBNR in life insurance, but it's when you cut off
on a quarter or month end, you try to estimate what you think the deaths were that
occurred during that quarter or during that month. We don't reserve for death that are
going to occur in April or May, at this point of time, Michael.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael David Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay, understood. And maybe if we talk about group benefits, the guidance excluding
kind of COVID impacts. I think the margins still look fairly excellent, but maybe a little bit
below last year's guidance. Is that -- am I remembering correctly maybe can kind of talk to
some of the nuances, what drove that?

A - Christopher Jerome Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah, you're playing Colombo on me. Do I remember correctly? Of course, you do. I
mean, you know our numbers. So yeah, what we've said is, ex-COVID the midpoint has
come down by 0.5 basis point or a 0.5 point -- half a full point, over the year. And this is
primarily due to what we think is going to be less favorable development both on the LTD
book and the life waiver book.
And again, you have to put that in the context of we still are sitting on and it can generate
healthy margins, but the margins that were generated over the last three, four years were
exceptionally strong, just particularly due to incidence rates and recoveries happening at a
much faster rate from a recovery side or lower incidences than we had price for, reserved
for initially. So, that's what's contributing to contributing to all the positive prior year
development, which I just don't think it's going to occur at the same rate that we have in
the past.
Then, the last point would be just a lower rate environment. That'sa loan duration liabilities
LTD, so rates coming down and it does have a little bit of a compression. But, you put it
into context, I mean this is still a strong double-digit low to mid -- double-digit range ROE

business -- that -- again we're one of the -- I think the top two players -- the top two
largest players in the business. We're growing our voluntary capabilities. We have strong
distribution relationships and a brand that people recognize and trust in the benefits
place, which I think all bodes well for us. And particularly as payrolls come back, I think
again we can begin to recover growing our top line in '21.

Q - Michael David Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

That's helpful. Maybe moving to Beth to investment income. I think it was a positive
surprise on the 4Q call when you kind of talked about the overall yield pressure being
around 10 basis points in '21 verses '20. Are there any shifts to making the portfolio and
this is the core fixed income portfolio to kind of offset the loan strain environment?

A - Beth A. Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. So one thing just to be clear, what my reference the 10 basis points, I was talking
about what we generated in the fourth quarter. And so obviously, fourth quarter was a
little bit lower than what the full year is. And yeah, I mean I think as we look at just our
overall asset mix, nothing significant that we're changing a little bit on the margin. And I
guess if you look at full year '20, what we'd expect in full year '21, I'd also remind you that
for a portion of the year we were caring elevated liquidity just as we were managing
through the pandemic and that had a little bit of impact on our reported yield for the
overall year for '20.
But, I would not call out any significant changes in the concert of our portfolio our HIM Co
folks, continue to look for opportunities to make sure that we're getting the right yields
that we need and obviously with the mindset of not taking undue risk. We don't want to
put outsized risk on the portfolio because we've been really pleased to see how its
performed from a credit perspective through this period. So again, nothing particular I
would call out.

Q - Michael David Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

All right. Next question. I'd say a lot of investors feel the Hartford stock is very attractive
from a valuation standpoint. And thus, sometimes ask why doesn't Hartford kind of
exclusively gear capital management towards buybacks and why do they just door need
to be left open for M&A? So I don't think -- Chris that's probably I have a question for you.

A - Christopher Jerome Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah. No, Beth and I will cover it. I understand the question and I think we've been pretty
clear. Over a longer period of time we've always had a balanced capital management,
philosophy. But more recent periods in the context of your real question is what else do
we think we need to do from a competitive side to continue to grow our franchise and I
think we have all the capabilities inside the four walls of the organization today. We need
to mature it, need to make sure all our agents and distribution partners know our full
capabilities. But that's internal activities and blocking and tackling, and it's hard work and
the team is working hard to do that.

Page 9 of 13



FINAL

Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2021-02-25

But I really don't feel like there's any gaps in our profile that we should fill in your vis-a-vis
M&A. And we've said we want to be able to grow. So incrementally that's going to take
some level of capital. It's not a lot if we're going to try to grow over the next couple of
years in this environment. We've just raised the dividend, which we've been a consistent
razor of our if I could say it that way of our dividend. And we announced a $1.05 billion
program over two years and as we know in the property and casualty business, there's a
lot of variables and a lot of unknowns, right? Who would have forecast what just
happened in Texas. We still have a lot of natural perils we are exposed to.
So I would not want investors thinking that we're not committed to doing our buyback
program, because there's some alternative motive. That said, look we're always going to
be aware of what's happening in the marketplace. And if there's ways that through M&A
that can add value and create value from a financial side, we'll consider that. But as I said,
that's a lower priority right now, just given what we're focused on and what we've been
able to achieve over the last couple of years in building out organically or through
acquisitions our products sets and capabilities. So that's what I would say.

Q - Michael David Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Maybe, since you brought up Chris, Texas, I know it's very early days, very wide band of
what the entry loss could be. Anything you'd like to comment on what Hartford is seeing
so far. I think some people were surprised that some forecasters are saying could be just
as much commercial as personal ones?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christopher Jerome Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah, I would and Beth can add her perspective. I would say yeah, first, it's just a major
event that again started basically if you think about it in the Northwest that you have seen
snow. I used to live in Houston. So seeing snow in Houston and down in Galveston and the
beach it's just a sort of amazing. And then obviously now things continued into the midAtlantic area. So a huge multi-day event that is both personal lines affected and
commercial lines. So I think the counts that we would have in right now particularly in
Texas, I would say, Beth it's somewhat 50-50, personal lines and commercial lines right
now. And we'll have to be a watch how that develops in across different parts of the
country, but yeah, truly a horrific event from another human toll perspective, but also from
some significant property damage, primarily due to freezing.

And with this being event that potentially you could utilize some of your reinsurance
partners protection or too soon to say?

A - Christopher Jerome Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah, I wouldn't want to speculate, Beth, but I would say that depending on levels of loss
it's why we buy reinsurance and we've structured, call it, deductibles in various retention
levels to take into account these types of events. So Beth, I don't know if you want to
describe our reinsurance program again.

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean again, I think that there is a very high likelihood that we would see some
recoveries under our reinsurance programs. And we provide pretty good I think disclosure
on our 10K that lays it all out. I'm primarily focused on that layer that's the 100 -- the 250
excess of a $100 million. It's kind of hard at this point to see us getting all the way up to
where that $350 million layer starts to work in. But as Chris says, early days and the way
that our reinsurance program works these -- this event would be covered by that layer
that we have. So we'll just have to wait and see.

Q - Michael David Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Beth A. Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

And I should remind you on that layer that we have that's 250 excess of a 100, we do
have a $50 million deductible on that. So for our first event you really kind of think about
losses up $150 million and then it would seed it into the quota share.

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. Yeah, you have very good disclosure on that. Okay. Maybe both, we have a few
minutes left, we'll touch on personal lines. I'll throw a couple questions as you can choose.
You did mention new AARP products being launched. So if it's too early feel free -- just
well be able to wait a couple months. But also just kind of curious about is the pandemic
throne kind of cause you guys to create a new playbook for how to kind of price the
business to try to maybe I don't know, if some of your clients are asking for a discount or
you feel deserve discounts? Just a more broad question.

A - Christopher Jerome Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah/ Let's tackle the AARP one first because it's actually quite exciting and I understand
the second point of the question, it's no less important. But I think the context here for
this Michael is it we struck a new 10 year arrangement with AARP, I think through the end
of 2032 now really with the idea of recommitting to one another.
And fundamentally, we thinking principle tenants in the program that has been very
successful over the past 30 years. But ultimately, both parties agreed that we probably
needed to modernize the program, modernize it from the importance of lifetime
continuity agreements, modernize it for six month auto policies so that we could have a
broader filter of people that we could filter into the organization and ultimately see how
they perform and take more rapid actions in managing your book than we did with 12
month policies and likewise.
The homeowners your product is a good product. We have a decent sized book of
business, but modernizing that so that LCAs lifetime continuity agreements aren't down
there. Again, all with the idea of how can our both organizations commit to grow faster
and capture more natural market share of their membership base. So, our first two
products, our first two states will roll out here by the end of March. Auto will fast follow

what with homeowners in those two states by June. I think there's another 7 or 8 states
that would happen in the second quarter.
And ultimately, we got states and territories to roll products out to, and I think that is
scheduled to happen through the end of '22. I think we could get it done by the end of
'22, but you never know with various regulatory approval and timelines there. So, that's
our objective and I think then we could start to more effectively grow, given that we have
more flexibility and how we think about attracting customers. Because, our ability to
generate quotes and responses with our direct marketing to the AARP channel was -- is
very good. Just our hit ratios given some of the constraints on the program, just what
weren't high enough. So as we loosen some of those constraints up because, then we
have more ways to manage once they're a customer, I think will contribute greatly to a
higher growth rate going forward.
Lastly, we really -- both organizations AARP and the Hartford are focused on the 50 to 65
year old demographic. So, we'll have to wait a little bit for you, Michael. But, that is a
growth area and if you're going to try to grow in that area, you're going to have to deal
with youthfuls at home, you're going to have to deal with teenage drivers. And again,
we're prepared to do that when we think about our underwriting, we think about data, we
think about pricing, all of it is just modernizing the program focused on a broader
segment of the AARP membership base.
