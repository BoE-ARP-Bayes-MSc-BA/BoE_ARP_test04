Thank you, Matt. And good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our second
quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to report the positive momentum that we've seen in our
underlying performance over the past few quarters continued into this most recent
period. We're highly encouraged by the sustained progress which follows several years of
rigorous efforts to enhance our market positioning, reshape our portfolio, reduce volatility
and increase our operating efficiency with investments in technology and a company wide
focus on expense discipline.
As we noted in the press release, we saw meaningful improvements in our underwriting
results in the quarter. Underwriting income increased year-over-year notwithstanding
higher cats and lower prior year development. Our reported current accident year
combined ratio, excluding catastrophes and weather related losses of 91.4 is a nearly five
point improvement in core performance compared to the prior year quarter. This includes
a 1.7 point decrease in our current year ex-cat loss ratio more than a one point
improvement in our acquisition costs and a 2 point reduction in our G&A ratio. And for the
six month period, our reported current year ex-cat combined ratio of 92.3 reflects core
performance that was more than 4.5 points better than the prior year. While the
combined ratios have noted our GAAP reported figures, the year-over-year
improvements in core performance are based on ex-GAAP figures, which I believe
provide an apples to apple reflection of our progress on acquisition expense.
We haven't reported quarterly or half year ex-cat accident year combined ratios this low
since 2013. This is tangible evidence of the work that our team has done over the past
few years to strengthen our portfolio is bearing fruit. The improvements in our loss ratio is
due to a combination of enhancements to our portfolio, change in mix and run off of
discontinued books of business as well as the increased rates that we're earning. And
even as we're delivering good growth and attractive lines, we're focused on limiting
volatility and controlling expenses. While it may have taken longer than we wanted, we're
convinced that this new level of profitability is not only sustainable, but one upon which we
can continue to improve beyond simply the impact of rate.

Stepping back and as I've said this in past calls, we believe that our hardest work is behind
us and that AXIS is poised to capitalize on the best market conditions that the reinsurance
industry has seen in more than a decade. We have the most balanced book in the history
of our company, and given our leadership and our chosen markets and our very strong
relationships with our producers, AXIS is exceedingly well positioned to reap the benefits
of the favorable market environment. We've worked very hard to get to this point, and
with firming conditions and pricing momentum across virtually every line of business that
we write, we have the win at our backs.
Before I pass on the call to Pete, I'd like to mention a few words on the impact of COVID19 on our company. You'll recall that AXIS was among the first to provide a more
transparent and granular estimate of COVID losses. We conducted in-depth reviews of
our policies and programs and found no reason to wait in sharing our conclusions with you.
We took a charge of $235 million in the first quarter. So far, we've seen no surprises and
this estimate continues to hold. Pete will speak more on this during his financial update.

Bloomberg Transcript

While there was no impact of COVID on second quarter underwriting results, it did affect
our investment income due to the one quarter lag in reporting performance of some
alternative investments. Nevertheless, our high quality portfolio experienced a meaningful
recovery in the quarter contributing to our strong 11% growth in book value to $55.90 per
share.
Finally, I'd like to add that despite the unprecedented upheaval sparked by COVID-19 as
well as the societal challenges, including increased racial tensions in the U.S. and
throughout the world, our teams have come together more than ever. We've been seeing
the best of AXIS. I'm proud of our team and deeply appreciative of their tireless work, the
way that they're working today to strengthen our business, support our clients and
partners in distributions, promote a collaborative and inclusive culture within AXIS and help
make a positive impact in our local communities.
In summary, this was a solid quarter for AXIS where we continued to see meaningful
improvements in our performance. We feel good about where our business is today and
even better about where we're headed. Peter will now walk us through the financials, and
I'll come back to talk more about pricing and have our Q&A. Pete.

Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Thank you, Albert and good morning, everyone. As Albert noted, this was a quarter where
we continued to see sustained improvement in our financial performance. During the
quarter, we generated net income available to common shareholders of 112 million and an
annualized ROE of 10%. We generated operating income of $72 million and an annualized
operating ROE of 6.3%. Underwriting income in the quarter of $87 million was 11% over the
same period last year with both segments contributing positive results.
In the quarter, we kept our COVID-19 loss estimate steady at $235 million as well as the
first quarter write-down of our WHO pandemic swap of $10 million. This doesn't mean
we've been standing still, we are constantly evaluating our estimates and the underlying

Page 3 of 21

FINAL

assumptions. As we continue to monitor developments across the world and gather more
data, we are getting more granular with our analysis and we're refining our views. At this
point, while it is early days, we remain comfortable with our provisions.
As a reminder, the COVID-19 loss provisions are associated with property, event
cancellation, A&H and pandemic coverages. And as of June 30, the vast majority of the
loss provision is still IBNR and the paid amount is de minimis. We have also carried out
detailed analysis of our exposure in lines of business that may also have been impacted,
such as professional lines, liability and credit lines. As you know, we are proactive in
establishing reserves where warranted. but based on current facts and circumstances, we
have no basis for making additional provisions in these lines at this time.
For example, in our insurance segment, claim notifications are running favorable for
casualty and professional lines compared to recent years at the same stage of
development. We have prudently not reacted to these favorable indications at this stage.
In addition, as part of our normal process, we establish IBNR for systemic risks, which give
us further comfort that our provisions are reasonable at this time. We will continue to
rigorously and carefully monitor developments and establish reserves, if needed, when
it's appropriate to do so.

Bloomberg Transcript

Lastly, I would remind you that all estimates are subject to a higher than usual level of
uncertainty, because of the inherent difficulty in making assumptions around COVID-19
due to the lack of comparable historic events, its ongoing nature and far-reaching
impacts.
Moving into the details of our group level numbers. During the second quarter, we
continue to see improvement in our company's underwriting results. Our consolidated
combined ratio this quarter of 94.7 points, a decrease of 1.4 points as compared to the
prior year. Our current accident year combined ratio ex-cat and weather decreased by 4.6
points as the repositioning of the portfolios in both segments and the exit from certain
product lines in the insurance segment earned through.
The cat and weather loss ratio in the quarter was 3.5% largely driven by the U.S. weather
related events this quarter, this compared to 2.3% in the second quarter of 2019. Given
the significant increase in weather activity and the civil unrest experienced by the industry
this quarter and the minimal increase in our cat and weather loss ratio, it appears the
repositioning of our property portfolios is delivering the intended impact. We reported
net favorable prior year reserve development of $3 million in the quarter, mainly related
to the reinsurance segment.
Overall, we have positive reserve development in short tail lines, but this was offset as we
strengthened insurance liability reserves and to a lesser extent, the Pro Lines reserves.
The strengthening in reserves for the insurance liability is attributable to an uptick in
adverse signals mainly focused in our U.S. excess casualty and program books of
business, our prudent reserving philosophy of reacting to adverse signals immediately
while delaying recognition of favorable trends.

The consolidated G&A expense ratio was 12.7 %, a decrease of 2 points compared to the
second quarter of 2019 and total G&A expenses declined by $25 million. As we discussed
in the first quarter, given the uncertainty of the year, we cut $50 million from our 2020
expense budget. The significant portion of these savings came through in the second
quarter. The savings were driven by lower personnel costs, including deferring, non-critical
hires, reduced travel and entertainment costs, lower office costs and delaying certain
projects. If I adjust the quarterly G&A and add back what are temporary expense
reductions, a normalized G&A ratio would have been approximately 14%.
In the quarter, we achieved our previously announced target of $100 million in net run-rate
savings, compared to the 2017 run-rate. This was related to our transformation program.
However, we have not stopped there and we continue to improve our operating
efficiency through leveraging our global platform, while advancing our processes and
technology. Operating efficiency and expense control remain important goals of ours, and
we continue to target the G&A ratio of the mid 30s for 2021.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving on. Fee income from strategic capital partners was $16 million this quarter
compared to $19 million in the prior year quarter. We'll now discuss the segments. Let me
first start with insurance. The repositioning of our insurance business is demonstrating real
traction with an all-in combined ratio of 94.2. The insurance segment reported an increase
in gross premiums written of $69 million or 7%.
This is the third quarter in a row where we have reported growth in the insurance line as
the largest portfolio actions are behind us. The increase came principally from
professional lines, property, marine and liability lines, largely attributable to new business
and very favorable rate changes, which Albert will address later. The increase was partially
offset by a 3% drag from exited lines of business as well as less business opportunity in
primary casualty and the credit, political risk lines due to the global economic slowdown.
The current accident year loss ratio ex-cat and weather decreased by just over 3 points in
the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2019. This was due to the impact of
favorable pricing over trends and improved loss experienced in our property in aviation
lines associated with the repositioning of those portfolios, as well as the exiting from
certain books of business. In addition, we saw reduced loss experienced in the credit and
political risk lines. The current accident year combined ratio ex-cat and weather decreased
by more than 7.5 points as the lower loss ratio was complemented with an almost 4 point
reduction in G&A ratio due to the expense actions mentioned earlier.
Let's now move on to the Reinsurance segment, which delivered another strong quarter
with an all-in combined ratio of 90.2. The reinsurance segment's gross premium written of
67.9 for the second quarter was comparable to the same period in the prior year.
However, this year we are seeing firming conditions across substantially all of our lines of
business. We had decreases in gross premiums written in our catastrophe, agriculture and
A&H lines as we look to better balance the portfolio. These decreases will partially offset
by increases in motor, liability and professional lines driven by rate increases and new
business at favorable market conditions.

FINAL

This quarter pre-tax catastrophe and weather-related losses, net of reinstatement
premiums were $20 million, primarily attributable to weather-related events this quarter.
This compares to $11 million in the same period in 2019. Net investment income of $45
million for the quarter was $93 million lower than the second quarter of 2019, this is
primarily attributable to negative returns from our alternative assets. As Albert mentioned,
there was a one quarter of reporting lag on this asset class, so the performance is
indicative of the first quarter market activity.
Lastly, we have reduced investment income from fixed income instruments as compared
to the prior year. Our current book yield is 2.5% and our new money yield is 1.6%. The
duration of our portfolio is approximately 3.4 years. Interest in income of equity method
investments of $7 million, represent the company's share in Harrington Re's income for
the quarter, which was attributable to positive investment returns.

Bloomberg Transcript

Diluted book value per share increased by $5.31 or 11% in the quarter to $55.9. This was
principally driven by net income and net unrealized gains partially offset by common
shared dividends. With respect to capital actions, following two debt issuance in 2019 that
raised $725 million, as you recall, we redeemed our Series D preferred shares of $225
million at par this past January. And in the second quarter, we repaid unsecured senior
notes of $500 million at maturity in June, which lowered our debt plus preferred to total
capital ratio to 28.1%.
Now that we have finished refinancing our debt, on a go-forward basis, our interest
expense will decrease by $5 million on a quarterly basis as compared to what was
reported this quarter. Finally, I will add that we feel good about our current capital position
as we entered the year in a strong position with capital in excess of AAA levels. And at
this moment, we have the ability to grow into the hardening market.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Albert.

Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you. Peter. Let's do a brief overview of market conditions and outlook, and we'll
then open the call for questions. As I noted in my upfront comments, we continue to see
accelerated improvement in pricing throughout our business. For our Insurance segment,
we're now into 11 consecutive quarters of rate increases or Reinsurance, the pricing
actions have become more recently, but we're seeing positive momentum picking up
now.
So within the Insurance segment, we saw average rate increases of almost 15% across the
book in the second quarter. That compares to about 10% in the first quarter of this year
and 7% in the second quarter of last year. Through the first six months, the average rate
increase is a little over 12%. In our US division, it once again delivered the strongest pricing
increases this quarter with average rate change of almost 17%. In AXIS casualty, we're
seeing hard market conditions highlighted with by average rate increases in excess of
30%. E&S property rates were up 19% and primary casualty increased by 11%. Our U.S.

FINAL

programs business, which focuses on homogeneous books of smaller accounts, saw
increases of more than 6%.
Within our North American professional lines division, pricing also continued to accelerate
and rates were up by more than 13% in the quarter. Our commercial management
solutions unit is also in hard market territory, with average rate increases of more than
30% in the quarter. Notably, public D&O where we're essentially an excess writer, showed
impressive rate change at 60%. In addition, we saw strong double-digit increases in our
Canadian specialty businesses, Bermuda AXIS and in financial institutions. Accident and
health was up more than 12%. Even cyber and tech, long laggards in pricing, are starting to
show rate increases.

Bloomberg Transcript

In our London-based international insurance division rates were up 13% on average during
the quarter. Renewable energy, where we're a market leader, was up more than 20%.
Professional and casualty lines were up about 17%. Aviation was up 16%, and the marine,
political risks and property books averaged about 10%. But within that, several sub lines
outperformed with marine cargo up more than 25%, and global property up 20%. Overall
in the quarter, 97% of our total insurance business renewed flat to up, more than 60% of
premiums renewed experienced rate increases in excess of 10%, and within that, fully
35% of the book had rate increases in excess of 20%.
Let's move to Reinsurance. We estimate that our renewed business was priced up about
12% overall in the quarter with the cat business up close to 20%, and the non-cat business
up close to 10%. We've already covered in our last call, the Japanese April 1 renewals
where quake was flat but wind was up more than 50%. For the June 1 renewals, we saw
the best market conditions in more than 10 years with tightening terms and conditions in
addition to higher pricing. We saw lower layers up about 15%, while upper layers increased
as much as 60% depending on loss experienced.
Our own book was up about 20% on average at the June 1 renewals. Nevertheless, we
reduced our Florida book as part of our strategy to manage risk, optimize the portfolio
and better position ourselves for the upcoming January 1 renewals. For the July 1
renewals, we saw positive momentum across almost every line of business that renewed,
although, it did vary by line and region. Overall, Reinsurance is clearly participating in the
rebound sharing in the underlying rate increases on subject business and also benefiting
from improvements in reinsurance terms and conditions.
In AXIS Re's case, we've used these recent renewals to continue upgrading the quality of
our portfolio and we think that we're well positioned to capitalize on the improving
market. Importantly, we're seeing improvements in wordings in terms and conditions in
both, Insurance and Reinsurance, and that will help loss ratios beyond the impact of rate.
Looking forward, we believe the favorable conditions that we're seeing will very likely
sustain well into 2021 and there's growing consensus that it will extend even beyond that.
We see several reasons for this. First, we're dealing with an underlying social inflationary
period that is putting pressure on prior year reserves and adds uncertainty to outlook.

Page 7 of 21



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2020-07-29

Second, interest rates are about as low as they've ever been, creating substantial
headwinds for investment income. And third, it's our expectation of the effects of COVID19 and its economic repercussions, will be felt over a number of years.

FINAL

This is not or these are not AXIS only issues. The industry is facing several challenges to its
profitability and needs sustained strong pricing to deliver an adequate return on capital
within the difficult social and economic environment expected over the next few years.
For AXIS, we continue to be encouraged by the conditions that we see. We're fortunate
to be well-positioned in some of the markets that are experiencing the most meaningful
improvements. Moreover, we're seeing an almost across the board increase in the
number of opportunities that are being presented to us across our company. Of course,
we're cognizant that a rising tide lifts all boats, and we're not satisfied by rate alone. As I
noted earlier, we're committed to sustain our progress in optimizing our portfolio,
increasing our operating efficiency and leveraging technology to better serve our clients
and partners in distribution.
In short, the current market environment we're seeing has a lot of opportunity and to the
credit of our team, despite the pandemic we've seen no drop-off in productivity within
both segments or everywhere that we choose to be, and we believe that we have one of
the best positioned books for today's market and that AXIS is poised and ready to grow
where we want to do so. We've worked hard to get to this place and our team is ready to
capitalize on the opportunities that stand in front of us.

And with that, let's please open the line for questions. Operator?

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)
Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)
And the first question we have will come from Brian Meredith, UBS.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Peter, for you first. I'm curious, can you talk a little bit about your capital position? I know
you've got your debt to capital is down, which is great. But just kind of looking forward,
where are you in the process of reducing your volatility? Where are you right now from a
capital position where you feel comfortable that you can kind of really ramp up growth for
this hard market?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Hey, Brian, this is Pete. Let me hit that with a couple of things; one, we do feel good about
where our capital position is, we have rebuilt it and actually that both rating agencies and

Page 8 of 21



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2020-07-29

they looked at our ratings actually mentioned that we have a very strong capital position.
So we do feel good about the capital position going forward.

FINAL

And some of the work that we've been doing so we can actually feel better about it going
forward is, is as you've [ph] mentioned, we brought down our PMLs, especially at the low
end of the curve, so you can see in the supplement, you'll see the 1-in-50 total AAL but
also especially the Southeast Wind are both down from prior-year.
And as we looked at our reinsurance purchasing for property in the second quarter, we
did not renew our cat bond, which really helped the 1-in-250, but we actually replaced it
with more protection at the lower end of the curve.
So I can tell you when I look at the lower end of the curve, our AALs are actually down
from 2019 levels by 20% in the 1-in-5, 1-in-10, and 1-in-20. And actually in the Southeast
Wind, we're down by over 30%.
So, we do feel good that we're more protected going into wind season this year. So
we're more protected going into wind season and we had our capital levels back over
AAA entering this year. So we feel really good about the capital position right now, Brian.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. That's terrific. And then just quickly, you mentioned that some of the businesses
you exited had a 3% headwind on -- in the insurance segment premium growth. Curious,
was there any impact from the runoff lines on the underlying loss ratios in the insurance
segment?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes, there still was. I'll point out, we got about -- still got about $30 million of unearned
premium on that book, especially this quarter we had about two points on the combined
ratio, really centered in the loss ratio, Brian. Really came out of some losses coming out of
the whole business that we exited. And so, if I take out the exited business, the ex cat
loss ratio for insurance would be just about two points better than the reported 55.6%.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Alright. That's terrific. And then last one for Albert. I'm just curious, Albert, when you set
your COVID-19 loss estimates here, what are your kind of assumptions with respect to the
international BI losses? I know there's something going on right now with the FCA. Does
that matter at all to you all and just kind of thoughts around that?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yes. So let's talk about the FCA and what's happening in the U.K. As you know, they're
reviewing all the wordings, and just to set the table here, our expectation is that the
arguments will be finished this week. We probably will get a response sometime in
September and then that'll probably go to appeal and no idea when those appeals will be
resolved.
Page 9 of 21

FINAL

But let's talk about what it means for us. There's a whole range of outcome, and Brian,
some of them could be very favorable to us in terms of some of the assumptions that we
made in our reserves could end up being not as necessary, but certainly they could also
look at it more adversely than we looked at it.
But I think what's really important is to remember that, in the U.K., we have a cat program
that attaches at $75 million. And with regards to the $235 million that we booked in Q1, I
think we mentioned to you somewhere $50 million, $55 million is allocated to the U.K. So
when you think about the net impact to us on the insurance book, maybe in the worst
case, there could be $20 million, $25 million, but I think we've got a real containment on
the U.K. side on insurance. Obviously, that could also have a little bit of impact on the
reinsurance side, but we don't have a large cat book in the U.K. So, I think the FCA
judgment, ultimately, would have a limited impact on us if it went against us. But it's still
early days.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. Thank you.

Operator
Next we have Meyer shields, KBW.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning. I think this is a question for Pete. I was hoping you could run
through, maybe give us a little more color on the reserve adjustments for the longer tail
liability and professional lines?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes, Meyer. So in the quarter, mostly on the insurance liability side, we strengthened those
reserves by about $17 million, and it was really focused on, I'll call it, some adverse signals
we were seeing coming out of the '17 and '18 accident years. As you know, early on in the
development of our reserve process when we see some negative signals, we'll react
quickly to it.
And on the pro line side, we saw some adverse signals both in insurance and reinsurance.
And again, we strengthened those in the single-digits and again that was centered more
on the 2018 accident year. And so, all-in-all, that probably added up to about $27 million of
strengthening, actually close to $30 million of strengthening through those three lines.
And then we had really favorable development continuing in property and credit and
surety that offset that, so we ended up with just a small positive development reported in
the quarter.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. I know this is an impossible question, but should we assume that that longer tail line
strengthening is like a one-time adjustment, assuming that reality doesn't get worse?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, I mean, we peg our reserves to what we think the ultimate is going to be. So, we are
keeping our eyes on those '17 and '18 years. Again, before COVID came around, we kept
talking about social inflation. We think we've caught up with that. But we are keeping our
eye on that. But we think that that is an appropriate reserve level on a go-forward basis.
But as new developments come, especially if we want to stay in front of things, like I said,
we do react to adverse before we actually show the positives.
The last thing I'd say is, since 2017, we have been getting significant rate on our liability
book on excess casualty and primary casualty. So the -- when I look at the '18, '19 years
and '20 year, they're at a much level -- better level of premium than we saw, call it, the
'15, '16 year.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. No, thanks. That's very helpful. Albert, just big picture question. When we look at the
Southeast U.S. Hurricane PML on a sequential basis, it's up. Is that the cat bond? Is there
anything else playing a role there?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yes. So if you look at it, I think it's down year-over-year. So if you look at July 1 to July 1, it's
down meaningfully year-over-year across every period. And with regards to the difference
between Q1 and Q2 it's -- as Pete noted earlier, the different reinsurance program that we
purchased and so we emphasized protecting ourselves in the more frequent periods.
And we decided not to renew our cat bond. And since the cat bond was attaching at a
high level, you can see this impact in the 1-in-250 going up, but that's the impact. And we
think, right now, we think we've built a better book across the curve.

The next question we have will come from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you. Good morning. My first question, I guess, goes back to one of the earlier
questions, you guys said that there was about two points on the insurance loss ratio from
some of those runoff lines in the quarter. Could you just remind us, I thought maybe it was
the first half of the year or when do you expect kind of have those all off your book?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

So, Elyse, this is Pete. As I mentioned at the beginning of the year, we had right around
$50 million of UPR of that -- those exited books. It's down to about $30 million now. By the
end of the year, it'll be de minimis. That will run off pretty much -- it'll be like low-single-

Page 11 of 21

digits. But I would say that one of the losses we had in the quarter was (inaudible) a client
that was to be ended 10 days and then all of a sudden they had a claim. So, I do think that
we're keeping our eye on this. We've projected it out as a fairly high loss ratio. But it
should be done by the end of the year. We'll have single-digit UPR into 2021.

FINAL

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Great. And then I guess a follow-up to that. You guys are running at about kind of a 55%
underlying loss ratio in insurance through the first half of this year, right? So if we kind of
neutralized for that two points, I guess that would put you at round 53%. So, you're
getting a lot of rate in your insurance book. So is that the right pace to think about
improvement off of in 2021. I guess with some assumption, way to [ph] counterbalance
against loss trend within that thought process?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. So we're starting, Elyse, to look at these things going forward. Basically, we've had
12% average rate increase through the first six months, a little bit more than that. And if
you take just as a placeholder an average trend of about five points, so that would
indicate that there would be three, four plus points of improvement in the loss ratio. My
expectation is that we'll probably be cautious in terms of some of these outlooks around
the systemic loads, around loss trends. So, I'm not sure that we would see the full benefit
of those four points immediately, but that doesn't mean that they might not develop over
time.
So, we've got that. We've got the drag that we've got on the discontinued operations in
the insurance division alone, which we also think could be an improvement. And then
there's the ongoing improvements in the book of business as we go forward. So we're
feeling very optimistic about the trend of improvement going forward from here.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And then on the capital side, you guys made the point (inaudible) saying, feel
[ph] confident in your capital position, but what feels like a pretty good market that we're
heading into for 2021. So as we think about -- you guys brought down the leverage, but as
we think holistically, is there a right rule of thumb (inaudible) premium to equity or
premium to capital basis for all of AXIS or maybe thoughts around the insurance and
reinsurance that we can think about, what incremental writings that your current capital
would be [ph]?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

So I would look at it from two perspectives. I think, as Pete mentioned, our portfolio is
increasingly capital efficient given the way we're managing the cat book. And importantly,
one of the things that we are very focused on is making sure that our growth, as we take
advantage of this market, is balanced growth. We're not going to be looking to go
extreme on the tail on any one of the areas.
So right now, everybody in this company is looking forward to meaningful growth as we
enter into 2021 and into 2021 we don't see us having any capital limitations on the growth
Page 12 of 21

FINAL

that we're seeing with regard to the opportunities that we want to take advantage of.
And then, of course, we've also got the benefit of having a meaningful third-party capital
business, which would allow us to make sure that we take advantage of all of the
opportunities that are available to AXIS, and at that point, we can decide whether we
want to monetize that opportunity through the retention of underwriting risk and income
or increasing essentially risk-free fee business.
So in both cases, we think we've got opportunities to increase our profitability going
forward. But at this point in time, given where our people are sizing the opportunities, we
don't see ourselves as being limited.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then one last one. When you guys set up your COVID loss last quarter, I believe
you had mentioned taking some event cancel covers through the middle of July. So given
that we're, obviously, not fully back to normal, can you just talk to the potential for losses
on that business to pop up in the third quarter?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes, Elyse, this is Pete. We are not big in the event cancellation business at all. We, literally,
have two contracts and they're both associated with the Olympics. So we're just looking
at that one event. And we feel good about the reserve, the loss provision we have up. But
for us, that's the only event we're really looking at.

Next we have Josh Shanker, Bank of America.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 21718992 <GO>}

Thank you very much. The first one, looking at the renewal season and what you're seeing
[ph] about rates in various areas. One thing that we're very understanding of is this
(inaudible) the PML. Can you sort of explain how the pricing improvements related to
decline in property cat reinsurance? And whether 2Q '20 is a period of time to be taking
more exposure rather than less exposure in the cat markets?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

So two thoughts there. We think the cat markets are now, they were pretty inadequately
priced. We think, right now, they're probably somewhere in the teens, which we're happy
to take, and it's important as part of our overall book of business. But these are not the
pricing opportunities that we had back in 2002, 2003 when it made sense to overweight
it. So that's the way that I would put it in the short term.

Page 13 of 21



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2020-07-29

FINAL

But I think it's really important that we put this in the context of our own longer-term
strategy. And Josh, you're very familiar with this. Our goal has been to move away from
what was a very volatile book of business that was built in the nots [ph] and what we want
to do is build more of a specialty portfolio on both insurance and reinsurance that has
strong results, but that are more stable and less volatile.
And so, I want to be very clear about this, we are not going to look to double and triple
down in the cat market because that is not what we're aiming for in this company. What
we're aiming for in this company is to deliver a profitable, stable book of specialty risks.
And so, yes, we will certainly grow our cat exposures in this market in a balanced way to
take advantage of it, but we have a very clear expectation of our appetite for cat and for
our portfolio in general.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 21718992 <GO>}

Okay. And then unrelated question. Looking at companies that have reported so far, most
companies that reported have a very low paid to incurred ratio during the quarter as the
slowdown in COVID has may be slowed payments, maybe slowed claims and there's a lot
of IBNR. Your net loss reserve was flat from 1Q '20. Were there any unusual large
payments you made for claims in the quarter? Should we expect that for this COVID
period we should see a low paid to incurred ratio? Do you have any thoughts there?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes. Probably -- this is Pete -- the only thing that I would suggest we had paids in the
quarter associated with the Japanese cats. So that flow through this quarter and that
would be affecting that ratio, Josh.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 21718992 <GO>}

And if I exclude those, are you also experiencing unusually low paid to incurred under the
current conditions in the market?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes. Overall, I don't have the exact number in front of me, but we can get back to you on
that exact one. I'd say what's been a little bit more interesting is we saw lower frequency
coming in and that could be just due to lower losses or could be due to just us not being
able to get the -- just slowdown in the reporting of claims, and we did not recognize that
at all in the quarter.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 21718992 <GO>}

Okay. And the Japanese cats, you're fully paid out on those for the most part?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

No, no, we're not fully paid out. We just made -- some payments were made in the
quarter.

Next we have Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line might be muted?

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Hello. Can you hear me?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Okay. Sorry about that. Yes. So I guess my first question actually goes back to the fixed
income yield. I think the quarter-over-quarter compression, 25 basis points or so, it seems
a little greater than I would have expected for this type of duration. Any comments as to
the moving parts there and what would have led to that level of compression?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes. It actually compressed about 22 points in the quarter. This is Pete. And where we saw
that come through is, one, about 15% of that portfolio is on -- is associated with floaters.
So while we were actually getting some good rate increases in 2018 due to the floaters
resetting higher, those floaters are based off LIBOR. And so they reset lower really right in
the quarter. So that impacted us.
And we -- also the maturity profile of the portfolio. We just had some maturities come up
this particular quarter and so they got reinvested at a lower rate. So, I wouldn't say the 22
bp drop in the quarter is going to be an indicative run rate going forward. It just happened
to be some specifics in this quarter.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. Then on the BI debate. Can you give us any sense of what the limit of
that U.K. reinsurance treaty is of how much protection you have once you get to that $75
million attaching point?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

This is Pete. I know we've looked at it, it's got a couple of layers to it. And in the most
extreme circumstance, we didn't feel we'd go through the top of the tower. That's what I
can tell you, Yaron.

FINAL

Okay, okay. And then maybe one broader and conceptual question. Given the
improvement that you've already achieved in the underlying combined ratios and the rate
environment we're seeing now, is this the point to start prioritizing growth over further
improvement or are you still more focus on the improvement over growth, or both
achieved at the same time?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Well, this is Pete. I'll just start with that, then I'll let -- I'd ask Albert to pile on. But I would
just say that, especially, overall, one, we've re-positioned the portfolios and if I think just
about insurance, they were at 7.2% growth, the exited line was about 3% drag. And I
guess, I would say, lower business opportunity in areas affected by the economic
slowdown, so that being primary casualty, credit and political risk. We really saw about a
3% drag from that. So in the lines we really want to grow in, we were growing into the
double-digits. And so, we do feel that we're poised for growth there. And on the
reinsurance side, the second half of the year is more of a quiet time, but the team is
geared up and is looking at growth as we go into 2021 to take advantage of the
hardening markets. Albert, would you like to add on to that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think that's right. Look, I think on the reinsurance side, in particular, you will have noticed
that those reductions actually came mostly in the first quarter as we were non-renewing
certain books that we felt would not be part of our book going forward. So, we believe
that we've made all of the big moves, whether it's on the insurance or reinsurance side.
We're certainly looking to continue improving the book but we're also, as we mentioned
during our prepared remarks, we're incredibly well positioned in the markets that are
seeing some of the best improvements. We've got great relationships with our clients
and our brokers and we are looking to take advantage of the growth opportunity.

Next, we have Douglas Eden, ECM.

Q - Douglas Eden
Good morning and congratulations on the solid quarter. With a bit more comfort -- with a
bit more comfort this quarter, it sounds like regarding the company's coverage exposure
to COVID and with tangible book value of more than, it appears to be about $51 a share,
would it be accretive to EPS instead of investing some of the new money at the low 1.6
yield that you mentioned to allocate a portion of this to returning additional capital to
shareholders, maybe by repurchasing some of the shares that are trading at currently
about 80% of tangible book.

FINAL

So, thank you. You're asking two very good questions. The first -- I'll answer the second
one which means -- which is that it makes no sense to us given where we are with our
profitability book value and opportunities that we're trading there. So, just -- that just does
not make any sense to me.
But the other issue, Douglas, would be that, if we were not looking to grow our
underwriting book at acceptable and attractive returns, you would be absolutely right. If
the only use for that capital was to invest at 1.6, it's the right call would be to buyback
stock. But we see the use of that capital not just investing at 1.6, but to write underwriting
business, which is probably the best we've seen in a decade.

Q - Douglas Eden
Sure. I missed -- I'm sorry, I missed maybe the overseas [ph], I missed the first part of the
answer about, did you -- I understand -- I heard you mentioned the -- it makes sense to
keep writing business at these hard rate -- at the hard market rate levels and get more of
a return there. But what did you say about -- with the stock trading so low to tangible, did
you say it does not make sense to repurchase some of those shares?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

No, what I said was --I agreed with you that the stock price was very attractive, especially
given the opportunities ahead of us.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Douglas Eden
Okay. And is it relates to repurchasing shares?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Right now, we believe that we can create more value by growing our franchise and taking
advantage of the growth opportunities that we have in the insurance and reinsurance
markets in which we participate.

Q - Douglas Eden
Okay. That's fair. And as a fairly large shareholder, I think maybe it doesn't have to be
either/or, I think maybe a combination of both could make sense. I mean the stock is so
attractive, trading at such a discount compared to some of our peers, and with our low
debt position. I think now it's the time, it could make sense. It just seems ridiculously low.
So, I'm in your guys' corner, we're all on the same team, but I think it doesn't necessarily
have to be an either/or. I think maybe it could be a hybrid of both with a 20% discount to
book.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I agree with you that the price of the stock does not make sense and I'd be happy to talk
to any investor who wants to analyze our book, our reserves and our opportunities. This
price does not make any sense to us either.

Next we have Adam Starr, Gulfside Asset Management.

Q - Adam Starr

{BIO 3781726 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just approaching the volume and growth from a
different angle. If we look how much of your business is shrinking and how much is
growing, you've certainly mentioned the price activity and the appeal that certain lines
have today. Where did the lines cross over? And where do you start to see the growing
lines more than offset the business you've non-renewed or discontinued. Is there a way of
looking at it from that standpoint?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Adam, I'm sorry. I'm not quite sure I understand the question. Because if you look at our
insurance book --

Q - Adam Starr

{BIO 3781726 <GO>}

That's growing very nicely.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

No, but -- so I'm not sure I understand what you mean by the growing point. Our disc ops
or cancelled lines probably took three point negative impact on gross written premium
this quarter. But the rest of the lines went up 10 points. So that, net-net, it was a positive
seven. So, I believe that we've crossed the line over there. So I'm not sure I understand
your question.

Q - Adam Starr

{BIO 3781726 <GO>}

Well. When we look at the reinsurance business, you're kind of neutral and that brings
down the overall company growth rate below the growth of price that you're getting. So
you're actually shrinking exposures, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but all your prices
grow [ph]. You're not -- and if business is so attractive today, one would assume that
there's an incentive (Technical Difficulty)

somewhere. We'll go ahead and proceed to the next question. Josh Shanker --

FINAL

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Let me at least address the question as I think I understood it. Again, I think if we look at
the reinsurance book, it was flat and we explained that one of the areas for that was that
we curtailed our cat book and I believe that the financial supplement provides the
reduction in that book.
I would say two things. I would say that, on the one hand, we have been cautious about
our cat book, and as I mentioned, we are going to look to grow our overall cat position,
but within a balanced portfolio. That would be the first comment that I would make.
The second comment that I would make is that there are still a number of markets in the
world that are not moving sufficiently on the reinsurance side where the opportunities are
in the single-digits and we do not believe that that's the best use of our capital.
So if we see those opportunities, we will certainly want to take advantage of it. But we're
very focused on making sure that the growth comes in from adequately and attractivelypriced business.

as price growth across the board, both primary and reinsurance.

FINAL

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

That's a fair question. And I would say that, we would be looking that on the insurance
side, very likely as we enter the rest of this year. And I would say that on insurance and
reinsurance, I would expect both of those to happen next year in 2021. It will, of course,
depend on the market opportunities, but that would be our outlook.

Generally, yes. I want to be comprehensive in my response to you. There are a number of
treaties where we are expecting to see increases that would get us to adequate levels
coming out of the January 1 renewals. If they don't, then we will, of course, have to take
corrective action. But our expectation is that if these trends continue, if the markets start
to equilibrate at reasonable double-digit ROEs, then we would be very happy to resume
growth, but it will be obviously treaty and risk dependent.
