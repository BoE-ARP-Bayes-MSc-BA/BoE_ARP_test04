MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this Conference Call on Sampo Group's 2015 Results.
I am Jarmo Salonen, Head of Investor Relations. And with me at this call, I have our Group
CEO and President, Kari Stadigh; Head of P&C Insurance, Torbjörn Magnusson; and Group
CFO, Peter Johansson.
We'll have the same procedure as always. Kari will start with presentation of 2015
highlights. But before handing over to Kari, let me remind you that you can follow this call
at sampo.com/results, and a recorded version of the call will later be available at same
address.
With these words, I hand over to Kari. Kari, please.

Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Thank you, Jarmo. Welcome to the conference call on my behalf as well. Looking back at
2015, I am happy to note that Sampo performed really very well in 2015. The result was

FINAL

best ever. According to the proposal made to the AGM, Sampo will increase its dividend
to €2.15 per share. It is the seventh successive spring when Sampo will raise its dividend
from the previous year's level. Sampo is a dividend stock.
On a more philosophical note, I would like to comment the world around us and especially
digitalization. The financial sector has traditionally targeted economies of scale as the
industry enjoys significant scale benefits. Efficiency, discipline, economies of scale, crossborder supply, risk assessment, risk management have been cornerstones for these
success stories. On the other hand also, agility, local presence and being close to the
customers has been a good basis for the success of several smaller companies.
If digitalization removes these boundaries between these operational models, the major
service supplier becomes local and, if need be, always present. On the other hand, even
a minor player can reach global markets easier.

Bloomberg Transcript

In this scenario and of the changing digital world, If P&C, Nordea, Mandatum are all in an
excellent position to prevail and succeed. Based on the market leader positions,
geographical coverage, good profitability and the number of satisfied customers they
have in the Nordics, this creates a solid base to be a forerunner also in the future when
meeting the customer demands. Significant investments in the digital world are already
proceeding at full speed in all our companies. So we have a very positive view on the
future as well.
Looking back at 2015, If P&C performed and delivered the best ever results. Its result
before taxes was €960 million and the combined ratio excluding the non-recurring items
at 86.5%. Customer satisfaction increased further in 2015 in almost all product lines. And
fine-tuning of the Nordic business model continued. The growth or efficiency in operations
was reflected especially in the cost ratio, which reached its lowest ever level even
excluding the non-recurring items at 22.3%. An excellent year indeed.
Nordea, the most important thing last year of course where several significant
organizational reforms that were executed. The most important of them naturally being
the appointment of the new CEO, Casper von Koskull. Even resources in administrative
and supporting functions, risk compliance, internal audit and so on were increased to
meet the exponentially growing demands of regulation.
In spite of the reforms and regulatory pressure as well as the low interest rate
environment, Nordea's result after taxes was best ever, as was the dividend of €0.64 per
share for 2015, Nordea will pay over €550 million to Sampo in the spring of 2016. Also,
here, a very good performance level and outcome.
Mandatum, the long-term work to improve efficiency in Mandatum Life could be seen in
the key figures. Expense and risk results were at new record levels. Premium income in
2015 was all-time high; €1.144 billion. Also, here customer satisfaction improved further.
2015 was the first full year when Suomi Mutual's group pension portfolio of €1.3 billion was
included in the company figures.

FINAL

After the financial crisis, it has been clear that in the banking sector, the only way to go
forward and minimize the risk is that you increase the capital in the banks. This is the
clearest and simplest remedy to the problems we have had in the past years. This has
already been done. For example, Nordea's core Tier 1 ratio increased from 7.5% to 16.5%
between 2007 and 2015. Nordea's Tier 1 capital increased during this time with more than
€10 billion.
It's very difficult to understand that there should be any reason for volatility in the Nordic
banks. I see the situation between the Central European banks and the Nordic banks as
very different. You must all remember that during the financial crisis, the weakest quarter
of Nordea was more than €500 million in profits.
If we look at the future, in the current from the financial sector's perspective, a quite
unfavorable environment, Sampo's ability to generate profits is not going to change
significantly one way or the other. However, to improve from these excellent levels, we
need to get some help from the outside world, we need to see our clients prosper, we
need to see their willingness to invest to grow, we should see the GDP get back on the
growth track and gradually we hope for rising interest rates.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the other hand, if these things that we expect to happen someday in the future are
postponed, we have several ongoing investments in IT and digitalization. And once they
are completed, our products and process improvements are going to offer a new
possibility for significant cost savings in the coming years.
The purpose of these large investments especially in Nordea is to further raise the current
good level of results going forward. Therefore, our guidance for 2016 is really more of the
same, nothing dramatic one way or the other.

Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Thank you, Kari. And, now operator, we are ready for the questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from Matti Ahokas of Danske Bank. Go ahead, sir.
Your line is open.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Hi, it's Matti Ahokas here from Danske Bank. Two questions if I may. First, regarding
the capital in If, there is still around €300 million buffer to the S&P A rating as far as I can
see. Is this a level that you think you should still have in as a buffer or should we expect
that the capital would more move towards the A rating level?

Page 3 of 18



Company N ame: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAM PO FH Equity
Date: 2016-02-10

The second question is regarding the Swedish business. In If, you had expense ratio
around or cost ratio of 19.9% which is the lowest we've seen in many, many quarters.
Obviously there is probably quite a lot of FX volatility here, but how come that figure is so
low? Thanks.

FINAL

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

On the first question, this is Peter, (10:04) the capital in If, normally we target roughly in
the midpoint of a single A rating level and then it also depends on how much we happen
to have liquidity on the holding company. So I think we left a couple of hundred – €100
million or €200 million roughly of liquidity on the holding company level. But it was this –
the dividends are also driven by the cash needed to the parent company for paying out
our own dividend.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

On the cost ratio, please don't look at individual cost ratios for individual countries,
individual quarters. That's pure coincidence whether we run marketing campaigns,
whether we do large IT investments at quarter, et cetera. We have no – we don't spend
any energy trying to smooth out those numbers.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great. Thanks a lot.

Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Vinit Malhotra of Mediobanca. Go ahead, your
line is open.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. Sorry. Three quick ones if I can – if I'm allowed. Just one is, I've seen that, I mean,
in Mandatum Life, you are looking for higher internal dividend this year, and please could
you just highlight how the recent market volatility, for example, (11:23) trying to get more
or being able to get more out of Mandatum? So that's the first question. Second question
is, if you could just comment a bit on the reserve increase seen in the quarter. Is it just
something we should be careful about going forward? And lastly, please could you just
remind us of your stand on leveraging up. I know you stated in the past that you have the
option, but are you more or less inclined on what would be the trigger? Thank you.

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

This is Peter again. Yeah, we increased the dividend from Mandatum from €100 million to
€120 million, so there was no exact science around that numbers, but we still had a
significant buffer with transition rules, of course, €700 million, when we calculate the
solvency ratio. So we had a solvency ratio of actually 158% at the end of year. The
sensitivity from – you can the sensitivities from the equity and interest rates, and then
actually I myself looked how the sensitivity numbers work. So with the volatility that you

Page 4 of 18



Company N ame: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAM PO FH Equity
Date: 2016-02-10

have seen in the market, the biggest effect has actually come from the interest rate. So
(12:54) solvency, if we would disclose the solvency now, it would be roughly 150%.

FINAL

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I'd be very comfortable with this new dividend level, because you must remember that
the weak (13:05) profit portfolio is melting away with €200 million a year that frees up €50
million of capital in a way. Then we haven't touched upon the issue with hybrids and so on,
so you could see this as a new level. We have the €100 million for so many years. It was
time to increase it now.
Second question was that reserving when we lowered the interest rate of Mandatum?

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

No, it was more the P&C side, sorry. It was more on If.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

If ?

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, because there has been a very unique – I mean we haven't seen in many years, and
there is a reserve addition in it. I missed a few – maybe I missed some details there, so if
you could just remind them.

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
The reserve increase that you can see during the year is because of the lowering of the
discount rate in Finland. So, that increase is the annuity reserve and therefore affects the
numbers.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

And even on the fourth quarter?

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Not in the fourth quarter.

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
Might be second quarter and fourth quarter.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

FINAL

Not in the fourth quarter. So, what was in the fourth quarter? Should we know some –
should we be careful of something, sorry (14:13)?

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
I think we will actually have to look at the number. I cannot remind myself of what the
numbers exactly are.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay, fair enough.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

And if you're looking at the euro movements, there is easily quite big currency
fluctuations.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Fair enough, all right. Thank you very much.

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

(14:33) event, I am looking a bit disturbed at your question.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

And you had a question on leveraging up. Would you like to clarify that question?

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

(14:53). Okay. Clarification, I mean I know that you had the ability to do it. And I was just
wondering if now you're feeling more inclined on this, but I think given the answer you just
made on Mandatum, I think I've got my answer already. So you can ignore that question
please. Thank you.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yeah. I think that we are dividend stock and we are in a very comfortable position that we
strive to increase the dividend year after year also going forward. Nothing new on that
front either.

FINAL

Thank you. Our next question comes from Blair Stewart of Bank of America. Go ahead, sir.
Your line is open.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good afternoon, gentlemen. A couple of questions. Just on the
solvency of the Life business, why is the ratio 150%, why is it insensitive to equity is going
down 10%? Has this just got some – is there some protection that you have in place?
That's the first question. And thanks for the answer earlier giving us the mark-to-market.
It's useful.

Bloomberg Transcript

And as a follow-on to that, again just on the greater level of dividends coming from the
Life business €125 million. I appreciate the point about what the profits fund (16:17) running
down and freeing up capital. But, of course, the transition has also run down at the same
time, which is I guess in some ways a cost of capital. So I am slightly surprised to see the
increase in the internal dividend, but you seem to be suggesting that is sustainable, I
don't even think there is a question in there, but maybe you can comment.
And, thirdly, just on your investment philosophy at this point in time with a bit of volatility in
the market spreads widening, I remember a few years ago, you used this type of
opportunities to buy, I assume, this kind of amount of credit. So I wonder if that type of
thing might be on your radar screens at the moment? Thank you.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

On the solvency on Life. So the solvency on Life, it's the sensitivity on equity. It's actually –
it look s a bit surprising if you look at the sensitivity table in a sense that if equities go
down by 10%. Then it (17:18) impacts of course the SCR, but it also affects on the amount
of equities. So, that means that the solvency ratio looks neutral, but at the same time in
the beginning of the year, rates have come down and that's the reason why you have
actually seen the movement on the solvency ratio, which would have been roughly in line
with €150 million, so a drop from €158 million to €150 million.
I would feel quite comfortable with the dividend of €125 million unless we continue to see
massive volatility in the market because simply the rundown on the portfolio with
guarantees is €200 million per year. And we have reserved €244 million by lowering the
discount rates now for this year to 1%, next year to 1.25%, and then to 2.25%.
And if you look at the expense result, risk result, so you need roughly investment income
around €30 million – only €30 million on the guarantee book for this year to start making
up profit, and the expense result and risk result together was close to €60 million in 2015.

Company N ame: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAM PO FH Equity
Date: 2016-02-10

On the investment side, I think that you know us so well, Blair, that we always enjoy
volatility and we are contrarian. What we are picking up now is Nordic bank AT1s. We feel
that there is definitely value. We can't see any reason for this re-pricing that is going on,
so just give them to us.

FINAL

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. (19:19). Peter, just on the equity sensitivity again, is it just core (19:26) of the 10%
number or are you saying that that would be true for further stresses down in equities, I
find that very surprising?

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

There is a sensitivity table on the supplementary package, where you can see what the
effect on actual – on the mark-to-market portfolio, so if equities go down by 10%, the
direct impact – the direct mark-to-market impact is minus €173 million, but then you see
that there is a neutral impact on the solvency ratio.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. Where is that, Peter? Is that in the supplementary pack?

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

It's in the supplementary pack.

Q - Blair Stewart

Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Niccolo Dalla Palma of Exane BNP Paribas.
Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Yes, good afternoon, everyone. My first question is on the fact in your report you
mentioned that you have withdrawn your application for the internal model of If P&C with
Finnish FSA. Could you just say something more on that? I mean, is this for the entire If
P&C Group, is this just for the Finnish businesses, what are the implications and what do
you expect going forward? Are you just going to run it on the standard formula because
you don't think it were having internal model on the side, so if you could just clarify that?
And the second question is, if you could give us a quick refresher on your thoughts around
Denmark and the level of your stake? And what you are thinking is around potentially the
opportunity of owning 100% of its cash generation and if the evaluation starts to get
levels that are more interesting compared to what we have seen a few months ago?
And thirdly, maybe sort of a very boring quick question on the finance costs, either if you
could remind us what the normal run rate level is here because there are some moving
parts. So if you could just remind that to us? Thank you.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Are you referring to the finance costs at the holding company?

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Holding, yeah.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

That's correct. Yes.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Right. Maybe I'll start with the internal model. This has been a very lengthy process that's
started actually with the Swedish regulator, and it was work in progress for three years
with this Swedish regulator, but then the regulatory responsibility shifted to Finland and
actually there wasn't really time to finalize it. And the reason why we pulled back the
application is that you basically have two choices that you take back the application
because if you don't get the decision within a six-month period or you stop the clock and
then you continue the discussion with the regulator.
But we came to a conclusion that the key part of the internal model where we see that we
get significant diversification benefit being a pan-Nordic P&C player that would have been
watered down so much with good discussions with the regulators what they were willing
to approve, so that was one of the decisions or key decisions that we simply pulled back
the model application and now run with the standard model.

Page 9 of 18



Company N ame: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAM PO FH Equity
Date: 2016-02-10

FINAL

So we haven't made any decisions how to go forward, but let's see. And the limiting
factor is really the S&P (23:29) model. So we didn't face enough regulatory hassle. So we
didn't want to take more extra regulatory hassle from the internal model. So let's see how
we go forward.
The benefits from the internal model would have been €300 million, €400 million – or
€400 million. So as we're overcapitalized, this is not a critical issue, especially when S&P
rating is anyway more demanding than the modeling. On the Topdanmark, you have
heard me saying for a long time that the share price is too high for us to see value in it
than for us to buy more shares. And it has been good that our time sense has been so
clear and in a way stubborn because the share price has been coming down for a longer
time already.
Whether it's nearing levels where we would have interest, I think that we have to see and
look at the relative valuations with other possible investments that we have. But of course,
we follow it all the time. We have now passed one-third of the votes and Topdanmark is
coming out with its results tomorrow. So we will then hear how many shares they redeem
and what is our true ownership. All these things affected, but we are not doing anything
special until the evaluation is such that it would create value for our shareholders and that
is not today.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Okay. And just to reconfirm the – you don't expect – I mean the – clearly you probably go
for the 33% threshold, as they disclose the new number of shares and the expectation is
still that the Danish have to say well not for us any movement on the back of that. Is that
correct?

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Our legal advice is very clear on that. We haven't bought any shares since 2011. We
haven't exercised any power to that extent that we would have to make an obligatory bid.
No, that is still the same.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Kari, for these answers.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

And then you have the question on the parent company funding cost. And if you look at
the numbers, we have an average interest rate of roughly 1.5%, which gives an annual
interest cost on the gross debt of €2.3 billion at around €35 million annually. The reason
why we had in Q4 somewhat higher finance costs of actually exactly €12 million is simply
the Swedish krona debt that we have on the parent company, so you always see some
quarterly volatility on the finance cost line.

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Because of currencies.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mika Koskinen

{BIO 1557965 <GO>}

Thanks very much. Only one question from my side, would relate to the large claims that
you report that were substantially – were clearly higher than you anticipate normally, and
also of course clearly higher than they've been historically. And they seem to be fairly
concentrated in Norway. Could you just discuss slightly more around that and are there
potentially some sector concentrations or industry concentrations, and I guess the (27:30)
question from my side would be, how much do you just think that maybe the lower
energy prices are (27:37)? Thank you.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

With the longer time perspective, this is coincidental. The claims that we've had are very
normal typical Nordic industries that are actually both in Norway and Sweden in Q4, but we
have looked at them, they're not in any way abnormal and over a longer time perspective,
this is actually not even a very large deviation.

Q - Mika Koskinen

{BIO 1557965 <GO>}

And no concentration?

FINAL

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two from me please. The first, I'd
be interested to hear a bit about claims inflation by markets and line if possible. And just
what are you thinking about your ability to price this claims inflation out given I'm sure your
clients are feeling the pinch to some extent from the macroeconomic environment
particularly on the commercial side? And secondly, it's interesting your comments around
digital and the changes that we're going to face quite soon. I was just wondering if you
could elaborate a bit about what were you were investing in and are you seeing any
tangible benefits hereon; if not, how long might that take? Thanks very much.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Thanks. Inflation first maybe. The only market where there is a structural challenge for us is
Norway where competition is intense due to the large number of companies there and I
can see lines where it is challenging to increase prices with claims inflation. Having said
that, claims inflation in all Nordic countries is very low maybe to the tune of 1.5% to 2% on
average, and no line stands out as very different from that, and our pricing abilities in any
of the other markets is well in line with us.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

On the acceleration (29:45) in general I think that the big investments are in Nordea and
there you have to look at Nordea's communication. I think that in general there is lots of
data and conferences and consultants and talks about any disruptive behavior in our
industry. I still think that if the market leaders are really alert and on the ball, there will not
be a disruptive development. However, there will be a very, very significant change in
behavior from our clients.
And those who invest in this have the best client interface and who has fewer branches
than the others. I think those are going to be really well positioned, because when this
development really rolls out, of course, the burden of branches is going to be significant,
because clients are going to communicate digitally with the service providers, and the
structure is, therefore, different.
So significant cost improvements and efficiency improvements to be seen. Part of that will
be given to the clients, but part will also improve our profitability, going forward. We are
really well positioned.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks for that. And just going back to the claims inflation, perhaps, I mean, do you
think there's scope to go further than claims inflation, i.e., improving underlying margin, or
will you just be happy pricing out claims inflation where you can, given the high absolute
level of profitability?

Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Do-Thoi of JPMorgan. Go ahead, sir,
your line is open.

Q - Daniel Anh Khoi Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just have one actually. And it's on the
make-up of the dividends. Now, when I look at the Nordea, the consensus, the (32:04)
growth expectations sort of around 3% per annum over the next two years and then if I
look at the upstream dividends from (32:11), I guess those have been fairly stable in
nominal terms in recent history. And then, final, on Mandatum, you mentioned €125 million
is the new and sustainable level. But still, if I put that all together, should we get more
used to a more gradual growth in the dividends, going forward, or are there any other
levers that you could pull, going forward, as well? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

I think that we have been very clear in our communication, that we will see – our target is
to be able to increase our dividend in a balanced way, so that it optically looks nice. And I
think we have several levers. Our internal dividends this year were €60 million bigger than
the dividend we distributed to our shareholders. So there is some buffer.
Depending on the investments and so on, I think that we have a new level of dividend for
Mandatum. In this case, I don't see the need to increase the dividends actually because as
Nordea communicates, they are also going to gradually increase their dividend. So I don't
see any reason why our dividend wouldn't gradually increase.

Q - Daniel Anh Khoi Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay. And just a follow up. I mean, if there were any sort of bumps of regulatory
requirements for Nordea. Also, this year, as based on last year, is there perhaps a bit
(33:47) possibility to increase the pound ratio (33:50) moving out the dividend. Is that a
possibility? Thank you.

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Of course, it is possible to [Technical Difficulty] (33:58) dividends if necessary. And on
Nordea's part, I think we have to stick exactly to the wording of their communication,
nothing more, nothing less.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Christian Hede of Nordea. Go ahead, sir. Your
line is open.

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

Thank you. Yes, good afternoon. This is Christian from Nordea in Copenhagen. I think
most of my questions have been answered, but if you could give a bit more flavor on how
you see the weaker macro market and any effects you've seen so far in P&C, that's one
thing.
And then, a very detailed question. I think Kari, you said that you would know by tomorrow
how many shares (34:37) are going to reduce? I think there would be a new policy from
them, as normally we've had to wait for – as far as I know, at least had to wait for the
notice to come into the Annual General Meeting. So is that just an assumption, or should
we expect that actually to be in the report tomorrow? Thank you.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I don't actually know what they are going to report tomorrow. So, I thought that they
would report. But if you know better than me that we will get the information only in the
AGM, then we have to wait for that.

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

Very well.

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

And (35:15) region macro, well, non-Life insurance is always lagging. So, the effects that
we've seen so far are minute.
Furthermore, we actually don't write energy business to anything that has varying
significant degree. So, even if that part of the Norwegian economy would shrink or not
grow, we would be – the effect on us would be very limited.

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

FINAL

Hello. Just one question left on – If P&C, the top line growth, including FX is now pretty
flat. So if I push you off the fence, what is basically your outlook for the next one or two
years' opportunity to slightly grow from here? Or should we, because of competitive
pressures, actually expect it now to start shrinking?

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

The main reason for the development of the growth in P&C is GDP. So if you tell me what
GDP will be, I'll tell you what our growth will be. Joking apart, we are, of course, affected
by the developments in Finland at the moment. We are affected by the relatively good car
sales figures in Sweden, which is important for us. But we will also, of course, see what
happens in Norway and that – the way the lag will impact our numbers.

Can we have a follow-up question from Blair Stewart of Bank of America. Go ahead, your
line open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you. Another one for you. Peter, Just coming back to the transitionals, you talked
about the weight profits book running down at €200 million per annum, which frees up
about €50 million of capital, I think, you said, I'm just wondering what is the offsetting drag
from the loss of one year of transitional per annum, if you can give some guidance on
that? And then, secondly, with regards to your sensitivities that you show in the pack, and
– does that take into account a recalibration of the transitionals at this point in time? Would
it be fair to say that?

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

On the transitionals, so yeah, we still say that's at least – we said in the past that at least
the next five years the rundown will be roughly €200 million per year. Now I would
probably say that at least the next three years, four years, the rundown should be close to
€200 million. So that will release capital. But the transition then, of course, runs down first
on the asset side, where you have – after six years, seven years, you have higher weights
on your equity. But on the other hand then, the balance sheet is shrinking gradually on
weight profit book.
So, so far, when we look at forecast, this should go okay.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

So the unwinding of the transitional and the unwinding of the actual book are broadly
equivalent in financial terms to that €50 million, I think, you said. Is that the way to interpret

it?

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah, because the transition is so long on the liabilities side. So the discounting is 16 years.
So that's after 16 years, I think there will be a tail, which is less than €1 billion in group
pension policies.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Very good. And are you be able to reset the transitional amount? If markets are
adverse, does the transitional increase every quarter, for example?

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

No. No, I don't think so.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. It seems to be different for every company. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jakob Brink of ABG. Go ahead, your line is
open.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. It's Jakob from ABG. I have two questions, please. Coming back to the
capital and the withdrawal of the application for the internal model, Peter, also I think you
once told me that the Finnish FSA would not allow an insurance company to use expected
future profits as well as the tax asset in connection with a 200-year event, what you use
to internal model. So the fact that you're now going over to the standard model, I guess
that, that means that you can start to include those new capital elements in your solvency.
And also, regarding the modeling, is there anything new on the treatment of Nordea in
your capital? Those are my first questions.
And then, I guess, the second one. I could, of course, have done the calculation wrong.
But if I was trying to take your reported euro premiums by country and adjusting them
with the FX rates you provide, then it looks like, in the fourth quarter, there's quite
significant declines. Norway is down around 3% year-on-year in Q4; also, Sweden, this
year, it's still positive growth, but somewhat lower than in the past three quarters; and
Finland as well, in euro terms, is down 3% year-on-year. So it looks like your four was quite
weak on the premium development. Could you – is there anything particularly going on
here, or is growth just slowing quite dramatically towards the end of the year? Thank you.

FINAL

Yeah. On your first question on the expected profit. So when you look at the P&C solvency
capital numbers that we have reported with the partial internal model, which is not then
used in when we calculate group solvency numbers or the capital requirement for it, it
does not include a expected profit. And I'm skeptical to believe that the Finnish regulator
would give approval on that.
The funny thing is, technically, if you look at the legal entities separately If P&C (41:45)
Sweden, so actually calculating the original internal model is actually three models. So it
includes If P&C is in a standalone in Sweden and then for a group model to get the group
diversification, but the standalone capital requirement for Finland would have been the
same with an internal model or a standard approach.
When it comes to the growth numbers for Q4 that you mentioned, they don't quite tally
against what I have. But let me give you an example of what might be a (42:22). In
Sweden, we did not renew one of the large industrial agreements, which is large enough
to – for you to see in your numbers. The way that you calculate is one quarter, it is not.
There's definitely no trend changing the assessment that I see for us, going forward.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Thanks very much. A very quick follow-up. Is it possible to give us a view of the Mandatum
Solvency II ratio, excluding transitional measures, perhaps on a roll-forward basis?

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

I think we have disclosed it. So it's...yeah?
(43:17) 103%, I think...
So we are on the borderline. Yeah.

Yeah. And actually, the Mandatum bearing – you have to keep in mind also that we only
have €100 million of hybrid. So, the first line of defense, of course, is the profitability in the
company and the second line of defense is that we can use hybrids in Mandatum.
That is 103% excluding both transitionals on the assets side and the liabilities side.
