MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning or good afternoon. Welcome to Swiss Re's 2018 Annual Report
Conference Call. Please note that today's conference call is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to John Dacey, Group CFO. Please
go ahead.

John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Thank you, and good afternoon or again good morning to those of you dialing in from the
Americas, and welcome to today's Q&A call. I'm here with Patrick Raaflaub, our Group
Chief Risk Officer; and Edmond Kartun, the Head of Actuarial P&C Control; and of course
Philippe Brahin is here, who's the Head of Investor Relations.
Today, we published the 2018 Annual Report, which includes our Corporate Responsibility
Report providing overall more than 500 pages of corporate disclosure. For your
convenience, we've prepared a presentation with an extract on our economic results, the
group's economic solvency and capital generation and our P&C loss ratio development
triangles. We will not go through today's presentation slide by slide, but rather highlight

FINAL

the most important elements. Having said that, we're happy to address any questions you
might have during the Q&A session.
So if I can bring you to the extract report. Starting with slide 3, we reiterate the
importance and relevance of EVM at Swiss Re. This is our proprietary integrated economic
valuation framework which forms the basis for our business steering and allows consistent
measurement of our performance on an economic basis. It also forms the basis for
deciding on our capital actions. We've developed and used EVM for the last 15 years.
Slide 5 shows our track record of economic earnings calculated as the sum of EVM profit
and capital cost released to shareholders, the cost of debt and additional taxes. Within
the EVM profit, you see the strong contribution of EVM new business profit, mainly driven
by our Life & Health and P&C Reinsurance businesses. The EVM investment profits are
evaluated on a risk-adjusted basis after taxes and capital cost. They are inherently more
volatile as they reflect market movements. EVM explicitly recognizes opportunity cost for
shareholder capital. That is why the total contribution to economic net worth is a total
return generated for shareholders or what we call our economic earnings. It's a key
element of our capital generation. Over the last five years, the average economic
earnings of the group have been $3.4 billion supporting the capital generation and capital
actions of Swiss Re.

Bloomberg Transcript

If I can take you forward to slide 8. You have a reiteration of the group's over-the-cycle
financial targets and how we have fared against those. After a series of outperformance,
2017 and 2018 were two challenging years, the costliest and fourth costliest years for the
insurance industry with respect to large losses.
In 2017, we still met our economic net worth per share growth target. In 2018, the
combination of higher than expected large losses and the negative impact stemming
from financial market movements led to our performance being below the targeted
levels. We remain focused on these targets.
Moving to the group's 2018 EVM results on slide 11. You can see the key EVM figures. Our
economic earnings were $2.2 billion, despite the impact of the large nat cat and manmade losses, the credit spreads widening and negative equity market performance.
I would like now to move to the next section of the presentation and speak about our
group SST ratio, which we published today as well as our capital generation.
On slide 17, you see that our 2019 group SST ratio stands at 251%, which reflects our
attractive capital repatriation including the 2019 regular dividend and 90% of the first
tranche of the proposed share buyback program. We remain comfortably above the
220% target.
Slide 19 is another slide I'd like to highlight in this introduction. As it illustrates the resilience
and strength of our capital position on the various market stress scenarios, we remain
above our group target ratio level under any of these considered scenarios.

FINAL

On slide 20, we show the moving parts for the group SST ratio. You can see the impact of
our economic earnings, the capital we deployed in the business through our P&C
renewals, the growth in Life & Health Reinsurance, and finally the impact of our
deleveraging and our strong capital repatriation to shareholders.
Slide 21 illustrates our economic earnings – how our economic earnings have driven our
strong capital generation over the last five years. With $2.6 billion generated annually and
ultimately supporting the peer-leading capital repatriation of Swiss Re.
We have also updated the overview of dividend upstreams for the group on slide 23. The
overall capital repatriation for the five years, 2014 to 2019, now amounts to $14 billion.
With that quick introduction, I'll pass over to Patrick Raaflaub, our Group CRO for the
remainder of this introduction.

Thank you, John, and good day also from my side. We also published our loss ratio
development triangles today and I will briefly provide you some – with some remarks on
those starting on slide 24 of the presentation. As you know, our reserves are set on a
best estimate basis for the robust process and controls which remain unchanged.
On slide 25, you can see that the Swiss Re Group remains prudently reserved, in the
upper half of the range of best estimates, between the 60th and the 80th percentile.
This is true for our group reserves as a whole, but also for recent underwriting years and
has consistently been the case over more than 15 years now. The reduction in reserve
releases for the most recent years is driven by motor and liability lines.
In particular and as previously said in 2018, we strengthen liability reserves mainly due to a
large one-offsettlement related to a very old contract on which we experienced late
reported claims. The underwriting years, 2015 to 2017, have been strengthened in some
cases on a preemptive basis and in some regions partly due to observed increases to
claims frequency and due to adverse actual versus expected claims in general. For such
recent underwriting years, the IBNR is still a big portion of the total ultimate loss.
We continuously refine and improve our reserve setting approach and have made several
adjustments this year. I would limit my remarks to this. But I am here in the room with our
Head of P&C Actuarial Control, Edmond Kartun, and we are happy to address any
questions that you may have.
With that, I will hand over to Philippe Brahin, Head of Investors Relations, who will guide us
through Q&A.

Thank you, Patrick and John, and good day to all of you also from my side. So as usual
before we start our Q&A session, I would like to remind you to please restrict yourselves
to two questions each and register again if you have follow-up questions.

FINAL

So with that operator, could we please take the first question?

Q&A
Operator
The first question is from the line of Vikram Gandhi from Société Générale. Please go
ahead.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Hi. It's Vikram, SocGen. Thank you very much for the opportunity. Firstly, I see a pretty
significant increase in the 200-year PMLs Y-o-Y and given data from January renewals and
potentially higher cat exposures through the mid-year renewals. I wondered if the group is
contemplating any change to its retro strategy?

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, can you just give us a sense of how much the excess PAT at the reinsurance unit
in terms of the capital? The reason is P&C Re has upstreamed quite a lot over the past
couple of years, but literally very little earnings. And today we see another $1.7 billion
tabled for approval, although I appreciate that's a combination of both P&C and Life &
Health units. So, that's all from my side. Thank you.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Thanks, Vikram. So, maybe we'll start with John. PAT exposure, retro.

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Yeah. So, I think you're right that we have been successful in writing this very interesting
new business at the beginning of the year. We look to continue to build our nat cat book,
if in fact we find ourselves on certain peak risks at a level which we would otherwise find
somewhat uncomfortable, then we would potentially be prepared to use retro to manage
that – those positions. So, I can say at this moment that what we have on our books today
is comfortable for us to maintain.
On your second question with respect to SRZ, I think we've disclosed actually conveniently
in the context of a debt issue which went out today. Our SST ratio for 2019 for SRZ at
218%, that's down on the year as you indicated partly because of strong dividends up, but
it remains very, very strong over any actual requirement. I think the total, if you did the
math, you'd find it probably something like $14 billion above 100% requirement. So, as a
unlisted 100% owned subsidiary, we're very comfortable with the continuing capital level
of SRZ.

FINAL

The next question is from the line of Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi, there. Two questions. First of all, on Life Capital. Why did the contribution from new
business go down when the volumes of new business went up, and maybe if you could
differentiate between front book of Life Capital and any new business that you share with
the PAT book?
Second question on reserves. I can see the stronger loss picks or the higher ULRs for
motor books, liability books, also I think A&H books including workers' comp. I guess what
surprises me is having made the decision to strengthen the three most recent action
years, your opening loss pick for 2018 looks very low, much lower than 2017 for all those
three books. Now, is that just a seasoning thing because you haven't earning much of
2018 yet or the text refers to mix changes? What is so different about the mix of your
2018 book for those losses than the previous years?

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Andrew. Why don't we start with reserves? Maybe Edmond is with us in the room
as Patrick mentioned.

A - Edmond Kartun
Yeah. So on the reserves, I mean, you're right. The 2018 loss pick is lower than other years
– other adjustment years, mainly because 2016 and 2017, those two years, we had a large
multi-year whole account quota share written with one of our (00:12:38), which was not up
to renewal. And that allowed us – basically, that was quite a large contribution and that
allowed us to be able to have a lower loss pick for 2018. There is also the reasons on
motor for example, where on motor we had historically I think Asia property for example,
reduced the volume of a – proportion of business in Asia since 2013 slightly reducing the
volume of proportion of business, which then increased naturally a little bit the size of
non-proportional on the motor sites. So, there is different reasons for different portfolios.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Okay. And then on your first question, I'd ask John maybe to...

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Swiss Re Life Capital, yeah. So Andrew, very astute question. We've got a slightly different
treatment between U.S. GAAP and our EVM on the LNG transaction. For U.S. GAAP, this is
booked in the Q1 of 2018. It actually came into Q4 of 2017 for EVM. And thus inflated those
numbers up, and when you do the year-on-year comparison, I think you're missing the fact
that that was a positive in 2017 not replicated in 2018.

FINAL

The next question is from the line of William Hawkins from KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hello. Thank you very much. Just trying to understand the relationship between your EVM
and some of your SST figures, please, particularly for Life Capital. We know that your
economic net worth was $3.3 billion. Can you try and help me understand what the SST
NAV or risk-bearing capital is for that number? The reason I'm asking is because as you
know at the group level, there're big differences between economic net worth and SST
even though economic net worth is the basis, so whilst you've got $36 billion of group
ENW, your risk-bearing capital is $40-odd billion, so that's considerably higher. So, can I
just pro-rate that or can you help me understand what the solvency capital is for Life
Capital?
And then secondly very similar, what is the required capital for Life Capital? And again, we
only know the group figure. So if – related to that question, could you, now you've given
us the figures, maybe talk a bit more clearly about what would be the impact if you got to
deconsolidate that business from your SST ratio? And in the back of my mind that there,
you've emphasized the benefits of deconsolidating Life Cap ReAssure. But I'm also sort
of trying to understand what will be the offset, because I'm assuming the regulator is
going to require you to add back some kind of equity charge and it will be strange if you
had too much of a benefit simply from deconsolidating a business? Thank you.

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

So, William I'm going to defer a little bit the first question. While we have disclosed in
relation to the subordinated debt issue into the SST on SRZ, we did not disclose for the
other subsidiaries. And in April, we will come back out in the financial condition report with
some details around all three business units. And if I can ask you to wait for us, I think you'll
get most of the answers you're looking for on Life Capital and the SST numbers in that
disclosure is the first part.
And the second part with respect to the potential benefit on the deconsolidation, our
expectation is were we to drop our ownership of ReAssure down just below 50%, call it
49%, we're likely to have a look-through treatment for the risks of ReAssure and the
calculation of our Swiss solvency. And so instead of what now is a 75% ownership of that
business, we would have a 49% ownership of the business, but the asset risks and other
risks associated with ReAssure would still come through into the calculation.
There will be some point, and I don't know exactly what that point is because FINMA is
being as a good regulator a little less than perfectly transparent about where it triggers
that this would transform from a look-through approach to a simple equity charge, and we
would have a position in liquid debt equity group with the well understood charges that
Page 6 of 16

the SST framework places on that. It would be a big swing and we'll be subject to the
volatility of that share price over time.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

FINAL

All right. Thanks, William, for your questions. Can we have the next question, please?

Operator
The next question is from the line of Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you. There are two questions. One is on SST, the
other one is EVM earnings-related fees. So, the SST question is relating to the market
value margin. So very substantial increase because if we had just, I mean, if this increase
didn't happen, the SST might even have been say 10 points lower. But I'm just trying to
understand what drove this increase. You have written the growth in Asia, but I mean in
terms of dollar premiums, the P&C was flat and Life Re was 7% at the group level, is that
what really drives this? And then can this now MVM remain where it is? So, that is the MVM
topic.
And then, second thing is just on the EVM earnings and I'm trying to see if you can
address Life and P&C, but let's try at least once. The P&C Re has a very strong prior-year
earnings of $698 million on slide 11. And just the prior-year development hasn't been
obviously as high in the U.S. GAAP terms in terms of PYD. Could you help us understand, is
there something more in this, and I do appreciate that there is, I mean even in the past,
the U.S. GAAP and EVM hasn't always had a very, very correlation? So, I'll stick with these
two. Thank you.

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Sure, Vinit. Happy to help. On the MVM, you're right, we did refer to our Life & Health
Reinsurance business. Actually, it was largely driven by a new business written in Asia as
multiple markets, not a single market on critical illness. And that has required an
adjustment of probably close to the $4 billion that you see (00:20:01) up here. There
were some other pieces, plus and minuses, but the strong growth of what we believe is a
long-term valuable business for us in the Asian markets between a transaction and
support for some of our core clients across Hong Kong, China, Korea and Japan have all
resulted in a increase as you say of about $1 billion in the MVM adjustment.
With respect to the prior-year development, yes, for P&C Re, that was more positive
under EVM than it has been under the U.S. GAAP. The U.S. GAAP numbers have been
brought through into EVM as well. But the main difference there is just the change in the
capital requirements for prior years and some adjustments on the payout patterns, which
we think have been positive on those prior-year reserves.
So, we're comfortable with those amounts, but it's related to capital and payout patterns,
not that we had any specific losses which came through one and not the other.

FINAL

The next question is from Sami Taipalus from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first one just on the reserving side. In the
reinsurance liability proportional book, you've had I think some additional adverse
development both from some recent years and then a little bit on some of the older
years as well. Could you just talk through what was new in 2018 on that? I know these have
been developing adversely in previous years as well, but just what was the new element
there?
And then, the second question I have is going back to the financial strength in SRZ, I think
you mentioned a $14 billion surplus, but what are the binding constraints here? I guess
that's again on the regulatory view, but what is actually the binding constraint for that
business, and much – how much surplus do you think you have on that view? Thank you.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Sami. We'll start with reserves with you, Edmond, yeah?

A - Edmond Kartun
Yeah. There's nothing really new to the previous trends that we've observed in 2018, what
we've started to see already in 2017 basically continued. We've seen a little bit more
increase in the frequency of some claims. We also had on the liability side several manmade losses. So, it is really a combination of the previous trends we've seen plus
individual large losses, which resulted in an adverse development on the prior year's
liability.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

And on SRZ binding.

A - Edmond Kartun
SRZ binding. I'd like to say, Sami, that our Reinsurance CEO, Moses, will be happy that you
asked the question, so we can clarify that we don't expect the $14 billion dividend up from
the subsidiary. There are other constraints that we pay attention to in the context of both
liquidity and capital the rating agency's view of that business, and I think we can safely say
that the actual binding constraint is quite some distance from that $14 billion, but we've
not disclosed actual numbers. But again, the indication of the dividends to be paid gives
you a sense of what we believe to be a healthy balance sheet and very unencumbered
liquidity at this point in time and we're comfortable expecting continued strong dividends
from our reinsurance operations.

FINAL

The next question is from Frank Kopfinger from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Yes, good afternoon, everybody. I have a follow-up on Will's question regarding the
deconsolidation process of ReAssure. As you described that there is a two-step approach
at some point, it will change from this look-through to the equity charge. However, my
question would be also whether we should think at this point once you only have this
equity charge, but that there is some sort of offset in terms of additional capital
requirements some sort or that we really should expect the full release so to say. And
then secondly on the 200-year nat cat events as Atlantic hurricane increased significantly,
also California earthquake increased, so my question will be whether – how should we
think about your nat cat budget, and what is the current number?

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Thanks, Frank. So, maybe John, on the deconsolidation...

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Yeah. So again, I think while it might be useful mentally to think about this in multiple steps.
We're not predicting the outcome of the IPO, and anyway we simply said that our – it's our
objective to be able to deconsolidate. We'll see what market demand is at the point in
time that we decide to announce. But you could imagine a range of outcomes in the first
case.
In the second case, yes, there will be this point where we get to a level that's low enough
for it to be treated as equity. But there will be a capital charge for equity. So, while we
won't have a look-through anymore, that equity charge will be there. Given the nature of
the balance sheet of ReAssure and given the relative importance at the moment of
financial market risk and credit risk and our calculations, I would expect us to have a better
treatment and a lower capital under an equity investment than a look-through position at
the same ownership level. And so, that will be a benefit for us, the amount of which is
probably premature to quantify.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

we came out with our full-year results saying, yes, of course, our exposure increased, and
you can see that today with the annual report in the stress tests we are publishing. But we
will come back to you, Frank, with the nat cat budget with our Q1 results. That's what we

The next question is from James Shuck from Citi. Please go ahead.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hello. Good afternoon, everybody. So, my two questions. Firstly, I'm just looking at the
accident year developments were posted in the accounts. So, I can see that there's been
positives PYD around property and on specialty that has been negative on casualty on the
Life & Health Re. I think the casualty one, you've kind of largely explained, but I'm just
interested to see the negative development on Life & Health Re given that that's been a
book that you've been growing pretty aggressively in recent times. I think the triangle is
showing me just the long tail development and I'm struggling to see the years it actually is
coming from that drives that $249 million of adverse development.
Second question, I guess the combined ratio the guidance you've given for 2019, 98%,
that's about 1 point better on the original guidance for 2018. The casualty combined ratio
though has been consistently above 100%, so I think you did about 110%, 111% in 2018. And
again, that's being driven by some adverse development on the large contracts. But
presumably that number is going to normalize, and I guess, if you're expecting casualty
PYD to revert to a neutral position at worst, then I guess just the mix of impact, so as that
casualty combined ratio gets better would suggest a group's combined ratio getting
better by more than 1 point. So, if you just help me with my understanding a little bit there
please, that'll be great. Thank you.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

All right. Thank you, James. Maybe we'll start with the Edmond on the accident year?

A - Edmond Kartun
Yeah, yeah. So, I mean on the accident year, you have to keep in mind that whatever is
reported on the Life & Health Reinsurance, it's not really the same thing as P&C, mainly
because on the Life & Health side, the reserves that you have here are mainly disability
life reserves, and you will – the way we report things, you will always be seeing some PYD
on this business as the active life reserves basically become disabled. So, you will always
see that phenomenon. So, the comparison between P&C and Life & Health is not really
meaningful in that sense, so you can't compare those two things. Yeah? But $249 million
also is made up for various moving pieces, some positive, some negatives offsetting each
other marginally.

Then the other question was...

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

FINAL

Casualty.

A - Edmond Kartun
Around the casualty, yes. I mean, yes. I mean, casualty, you're right. There might be at
some point some normalization of the loss ratio, but what we can say as of now is we're
prudently reserved. We don't expects – we don't plan for any positive development in the
reserves or negative development in the reserves, and we reserve at the best estimates.
So, the view that we have now is what we call as best estimate and that's what we call our
view of the reserves.

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

James, maybe to go a little further, I think bringing that estimate of the underline or
normalized rate down to 98% reflected both the strong renewals on nat cat, but also
recognition that we also increased our casualty book on January 1. The nature of the
casualty that we wrote and particularly where the large transaction was different in kind I
think than our average book, it's a shorter duration. And so, it's reasonable to expect that
if we brought that on thinking it's creating value for us, it will have a lower combined ratio
than the average casualty book that we have, which tends to be fairly long. So, I think
again we're comfortable that in spite of that $1 billion transaction, we're heading in the
right direction on the combined ratio estimate for 2019, and we'll see how the year plays
out.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Thanks. Thanks, James, for your questions. Can we have the next question, please?

Operator
The next question is from Thomas Fossard, HSBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. I have good one question for – probably for John on the
dividend policy of the group. John, when I'm listening to your GAAP earnings call, actually
you said 12% DPS and you mentioned the rebasing effort that the group did in 2018, and
implicitly not encouraging us to expect the same DPS growth going forward. Now, I'm
hearing and listening to your EVM disclosure and the message I'm getting is that the
economic earnings is the right benchmark to gauge (00:32:50) going forward or what's
going to be the best proxy to gauge the dividend policy of the group as you're steering
the company on an economic basis.
So, $2.2 million this year, normalized $2.9 million, average $3.4 million. So, I mean all that is
pointing to confidence in growing the economic earnings of the group going forward. So,
which should lead to better gross and – in dividend expectations. So, maybe I'm wrong,

but I'm a bit confused because it seems to me that there is a kind of discrepancy in terms
of message either you – when you're talking about GAAP numbers or when you're talking
about economic numbers. So, I mean, anything you can say or explain on how to look at
things on these two different metrics? Thank you.

Sure. So, it's not our intention to confuse people about the dividend policy. What I think
you're referring to the slide in the deck that we used, probably the best reference point is
slide 21 where we talk about net solvency capital generation in the middle of the page. It's
something like CHF 8 per share on average over the last five years. That is an average
and it has been both above and below that number. We think over a period of time that
that's a reasonable position.
What we said with our dividend increase this year, the 12% increase from CHF 5 to CHF
5.6, which has been recommended to the AGM is that we're confident that we should be
able to continue from that point, a reasonable dividend policy which says the dividend is
highly unlikely to ever have to go down from there, and from that point we should be able
to manage reasonable increases over time.

Bloomberg Transcript

What I warn people is not to expect a 12% increase year-on-year for the near-term years.
Now, if it turns out that we're highly successful in the context of the underwriting of 2019
and 2020, we'll reevaluate that this year and then going forward. But at least for now, I
think what the economic results, EVM release today shows is that this wasn't false
bravado and moving ourselves to CHF 5.60, but supported by strong underlying
economics, that's our new base and we'll continue from there.

The next question is a follow-up from Vinit Malhotra. Please go ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Well, thanks for the opportunity. So, just a thing. My question was related to the Life Re
and a bit linking it to SST sensitivities. So slide number 13, John, says that there was an
impact, a negative impact on the investment – EVM investment income from rising interest
rates from net long duration in Life Re. But equally slide 19 suggests that the SST benefits
from rising interest rates. So, as we go into the year and one reason I'm asking this
question is because I'm trying to figure out what the solvency would look like in various
areas. But as we go into this year, how should we be thinking about interest rates and Life
and SST, and these two slides together? Thank you.

FINAL

Yeah. So, I think if we come back to 13, you do see in fact that there was an investment
loss due to the rising interest rates, so the net long position. The sensitivities, so this is
our EVM framework. There are some differences in the treatment between EVM and SST
for changes in interest rates. And so, the best way for you to think about what might be
happening and what might have already happened frankly in 2019 would be the go to
slide 19 on the SST, and that will show the sensitivities for our SST positions.
I think these on the credit spreads in particular were demonstrated to be an accurate
indication of how far we would go as spreads blew out in the fourth quarter of 2018, I
think with interest rates and with credit spreads having changed directions or in credit
spreads in particular changed directions in the first two-and-a-half months of this year, you
would see a reversal of maybe not exactly the same size, but a large part of what
happens. So, in terms of your objective to find or to estimate our SST ratios going
forward, I'd focus you on 19 and understand that on 13, the EVM calculations have a
different basis for this and that's why we've separated the two segments to try to help
you understand those differences.
Patrick, I don't know if you wanted to add anything?

A - Patrick Raaflaub

{BIO 16381419 <GO>}

Just to add, so the main reason for interest rate sensitivity of the SST ratio is the market
value margin, especially – as MVM, especially in the long tail and all the other components
are actually fairly well matched from an interest rate sensitivity perspective.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you very much. Sorry to drag the call out. On slide 11, John, what should we think
is a normal EVM profits on investments? I'm not quite familiar about how to think about it.
On the one hand, if that figure is strictly speaking your alpha against a neutral benchmark,
should I just be plugging in as zero unless I think you guys are sort of brilliant fund
managers? Or is it a figure that is inevitably going to exaggerate just market movements
to the extent that you're always at low market risk? So in a good year, it's going to be up a
lot and I think it was in 2017, and in about year it's going to be down a lot. I'm not quite
sure what you would suggest like kind of plug-in if I'm thinking about a normal year? Thank
you.

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Well, I'm sure our Chief Investment Officer would like you to think that he's brilliant. But I
think in the context of this modeling, aiming towards zero is a reasonable starting point is

probably the best place to be. The volatility I think will be there, it's not obvious to me that
it's going to be dramatically more than market moves. And I think you just have to
evaluate from which direction performance is moving. We've now reduced at least at the
moment our exposure to equities at least at year-end 2018, they were materially down
partly from market themselves. But we're – we've maintained through the 2018 a fairly
conservative positioning on risk assets, and I think the fact that these numbers weren't
worse reflects that.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Oh, hi, there. Thanks for taking my follow-up. I just want to return to the SST target range
or the target level you have, so the 220% ceiling, John, I think you've been pretty clear
that you will look to manage down towards that level in the near term. So, by that I
assume within the next two to three years, you would manage that SST down towards
kind of around the 20% – 220% level, and so the kind of the 250% level. And I guess
within – when you think about that, as you deconsolidate ReAssure over time and
presumably the level of risk and the level of volatility that's needed within that ratio also
comes down. So, is the 220% itself still going to be valid post-ReAssure? Thank you.

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

So, maybe if I can add a little bit of clarifications. I don't believe that I said we're aiming to
bring the group's capital down to 220% in the near term. I think we said and we reiterated
that that's our long-term target. I think that you've seen that in spite of a modest
downward move year-on-year from 269% to 251%, we're continuing fairly shareholderfriendly capital actions both the increase of the dividend, the commitment to the first
tranche of $1 billion and the potential for the second tranche depending on our overall
capital positions later this year. So, I think market conditions as well as potential business
opportunities will influence our – the speed with which we come towards 220% at the
moment. I think everyone around both the executive committee and the board is
comfortable with a robust balance sheet.
There are a lot of things going on in the world on a macroeconomic level which make us
believe that there's utility in maintaining this balance sheet strength. I'd also say the
success we had at the beginning of this year in terms of renewal leads us to think that
there might be some interesting opportunities during the rest of 2019 and into 2020 for
continual underwriting of profitable business. And if we can deploy capital in that direction,
we will, which by itself would bring us towards 220% but without any specific capital
repatriation.

The next question is from Andrew Ritchie. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi, there. So, sorry. Two very quick follow-ups. This is probably a naïve question, but I'm
just going to ask it anyway. Why did your SST requirement for non-Life only grow 4%, but
the PML for 100 and 200 Atlantic, just a big one scenario grew about 30%. Is that the
magic of diversification or I'm just surprised the SST requirement didn't grow more? And
just to clarify, the SST requirement and the PML is a forward-looking number. I think it
reflects already any growth of nat cat exposure that took place in January 2019.
And the other question was in your introductory comments, there was a comment that
you're constantly refining your approach to reserving, I think those are the words you
used, and you would – what did you do, was any change in broad approach in 2018?
Thanks.

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. So Andrew, I can take your first question. So, indeed it is the effect of diversification,
especially the nat cat peak risks diversify very well. And that's really the long and the short
of the explanation.
Edmond?

A - Edmond Kartun
Yeah. Well, on the reserving, I mean indeed we constantly refine and revise the way we
do reserving. I mean, reserving is not something which is fixed, the segmentation we use
is not something which is fixed. So, what we did mainly last year in terms of reserving
enhancement or updates to our model was on the UK PPO, where we updated the way
we apply the mortality assumption, in the past we used the multiplicative approach to how
to apply the impairment modificator. And last year we decided to use an additive
approach whereby it was more accurately reflecting the fact that when somebody has
suffered an accident, and he was – and if he was – the longer he was living, the longer his
life expectancy was getting closer to somebody who was an unimpaired life basically.
We did also other modifications on the workers' comp in the U.S. We also started to use
Life & Health techniques in order to assess the tail factor for these portfolios. Some other
enhancements were for example on credit maturity, where we also enhanced the way
that we do reserving by having a re-costing of the initial expected loss ratio using the
costing tools. So, we're combining a bit more the costing experience – the costing tools
together with the reserving. I can go on with different techniques. But I think that's enough.
Yeah.

Andrew, I think the overriding important message is you've been constantly looking at
specific technical approaches for specific sub-portfolios. But in the general reserving
orientation, absolutely no change. Complete stability in both, our objective to be correctly
