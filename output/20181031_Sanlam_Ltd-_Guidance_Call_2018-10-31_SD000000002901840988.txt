{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Thank you, Judith. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us on the investor call today.
With me on the call is Wikus Olivier, who's Executive Head, Group Finance; and also Sipho
Nkosi, who's our Lead Independent Director and has obviously been actively involved in
this whole process now for quite a period of time. And I would have -- I'm sort of
assuming that most of you have seen this (trend) and -- I've have seen some of the
reports that are out. And -- but let me go through and provide an overview of the
proposal and then we'll take questions.
So today we announced a proposal to effect a series of transactions and agreements
aimed at strengthening our competitive position in South Africa. And this should be seen
alongside the recent completion of our acquisition on the remaining 53% shareholding in
SAHAM. And that will position us to drive long-term sustainable value for all our
shareholders. So it's not just -- we haven't just been working on Africa. We've also been
working on these series of transactions in South Africa over a period of time. And of
course, the timing of the capital raise on -- for SAHAM has led -- has worked well.
So there are really 5 key takeaways from today's announcement. First, I think leadership in
South Africa, which is what we've strived for in financial services, we define as part of that
is leadership in empowerment. And this is also designed to consolidate our position as

FINAL

the leading financial services player in the country. And this will really position us for
growth. Of course, you're going to go out and do the business that we understand well at
SAHAM. But it's how you turn up. And we really positioned our group and also some of our
subsidiaries operation businesses for that growth and improve how they turn up,
particularly in the institutional market.
Third, the relationship that we've had with Ubuntu-Botho, it's really worked well for us. It's
a genuine strategic partnership and it's worked very well. And I think we've now taken this
relationship, we've broadened it, we've deepened it, we've taken it to the next level. And
all the stuff that we've sort of envisaged when we re-signed the agreement with UbuntuBotho in December 2014, which we've worked on is now sort of -- been finalized and
announced. I'm not saying there won't be further stuff. There will be further stuff but at
least this is a substantial package. And it will give our business additional resilience,
particularly in the institutional market.
Then we've always had a culture of prudence and a conservative approach to capital
management. Then, of course, this restores our balance sheet flexibility and our
optionality. It enables us to repay -- it will enable us to repay down the debt that we had,
short-term debt on the SAHAM deal and put our discretionary capital back to the level
that we feel comfortable.

Bloomberg Transcript

And it's all around, of course, finally positioning it -- us to contribute at sustainable value to
our shareholders and our stakeholders. I think we've demonstrated that over many, many
years. And today's announcement, I think, is all part of that value creation.
Now let's unpack that a little bit further. So the SAHAM transaction -- it means we have the
most extensive network of our competitors. And that significantly diversified our earnings
base. But of course, SAHAM market is where our engine room is, our IP is there. It makes
up approximately 2/3 of our earnings. And of course, that will come down but will remain
very substantial into the future. We have to defend. And we have to grow our market
share in South Africa. And we've talked openly about 4 areas where we need to get to
our leadership positions: third-party asset management, the employee benefits, the
health and the entry-level market. And we want to have a stronger position, ideally a
leading position in those segments. And all of these transactions are focused on assisting
us to close that gap. As I said earlier, it's how you turn up to do the business. Of course,
we have to go and do the business and do it profitably for Sanlam. But all of you will be
aware that South African institutional clients are increasingly looking at environment not
just at the listed company level which is important. But also at the subsidiary level when
they award mandates in -- be it in asset management or be it in employee benefits or
health care or particularly what we call the corporate cluster and the investment business.
And of course, we support all of the reasoning behind transformation and improving
economic output and consumption. And of course, that's important for improving
business conditions in the country as a whole.
So we're the leaders. It will position us as 18% -- almost 19% direct, 55%, if you can look at
direct and indirect. It puts us immediately from a strong level 2 position right up into level
1, which is unique. And that's sort of where we can plan -- trade profitably off that.

So let's go through the various legs of the transaction. I'd say there are 3 legs. But Sanlam
really focuses on 2. But I want to just unpack it a little bit. The first leg is the 5 -- what we
call the 5% deals and that's too broad-based. 80% of the 5% goes to the broad-based
and 20% of the 5% goes to our strategic partner, Ubuntu-Botho, who's been with us since
2004. We use the proceeds of that to settle the short-term debt, it's around $4 billion,
which is where we end up at the SAHAM acquisition. Puts us back to replenish our capital
position, we'll talk about that later. Then we will start to put back some funding, 30% into
the structure along with one of the banks for new black shareholders.
The second leg is how we reposition the shareholding in the asset management business.
And step one of that. And it needs to be seen as step one of that, is to sell down 25%
into UBI. And that will give them, in that business, on a see-through basis, over 51%. And
they can really play aggressively there on the institutional mandate. And that needs to be
seen as partly â€“ it'll represent. You'll see it as part of something further. But it is the first
step that was done in terms of that and really attracting top quality black asset
management into that business will be the sort of next stage. And we think there'll be
some consolidation in that market. So we'll play along with that as well. Then on the -- just
to clarify, sorry, on the 5% deal, we're talking about professional black women, rural and
urban, poor black women, youth -- black youth groups, black partners of the business and
the broad-based groups, community-type organizations and then Sanlam employees, not
the ones who are sort of already in the incentive structures mainly sort of the lower level
employees. Then -- and the third, last leg of the deal, which is really I think, very important
is to provide the facility to UBI ZAR 2 billion. And that will enable them to acquire directly
or indirectly interest in our subsidiary. That was envisaged way back in 2014. And that will
serve to further their portfolio investments into financial services businesses that are
complementary to Sanlam's strategy. And obviously there was, as invested in both, they
would encourage businesses to work together, I wish you to understand and that's also
the advantage of Sanlam.
And those benefits -- those businesses that we see as being important in this whole
initiative is third-party asset management EB, health administration. And entry-level
insurance. And Ubuntu-Botho will partner with us in those areas and it'll just help us close
the gap in there. The $2 billion facilities made available on market-related terms, it's
available up until the end of December 2020. There'll be exits in tranches as the
transactions are rolled out. And we have an independent committee of the board, it's
very active -- has been very active in all these deals up to now. And they will approve
those transactions on a case-by-case basis. But transactions must support the execution
of Sanlam's strategy. And it will ensure that the UB investments go into financial services
companies that are complementary to the broader Sanlam Group. Then our intent is also
to acquire 25% stake in the portfolio of financial services investments of ARC to make
sure that we're properly aligned for the next 10 years or so with Ubuntu-Botho and really
broadening, deepening the relationship as we take it forward. And that's just in the
financial services side of ARC, not in the others investments.
So in a nutshell, that's the proposal, just in terms of the mechanics of it. And you see -you'll see that we went for a price range and really, we have -- we're all set to do this deal
at a particular price. We thought we have the price all sorted. And obviously of late,
there's quite a lot of stock market volatility. And that's really why -- that's why we

Page 3 of 8



FINAL

Company N ame: Sanlam L td
Company Ticker: SL M SJ Equity
Date: 2018-10-31

introduced the range. You see in the range that's there, we think it's appropriate. The
independent committee of the board in conjunction with UBI will decide obviously, as our
partner or our shareholder, decide on the pricing. And the funding and the timing of the
transactions, which would be approved based on the prevailing market conditions and the
recommendations of some executives. But of course, we have to have shareholder
approval prior to moving ahead with that. Then that price range will enable the committee
to price and to fund the transaction in a way that balances the interest of the shareholders
with the other stakeholders at the time of issue. So if we get approval, we will all set to
go, the funding structures are in place. And that's why we (reduced) the 3-day (relapse)
and to -- once to facilitate the funding. But obviously that can only be with -- if it's within
the range of 74 to 86. We will place the shares of that discount 10% to that 3-day relapse
and that's typical for such transaction. And we've given ourselves a long stop date of 30th
of June once those conditions are fulfilled. Now obviously, one of the big issues that we
deal with is the cost and the dilution to shareholders.

Bloomberg Transcript

The net IFRS cost is in the order of 0.9%. And that's well below the benchmark of
comparable deals we worked from the beginning with guidance from some of our
independent committee, which in turn came from guidance from the market we're
working within a dilution of 1.3%, which we thought was appropriate. So we're quite
pleased that we got in at 0.9%. But we want -- we just want to make the point that having
worked through all this stuff, I know Wikus can talk to that. But all through this, it was
accounting stuff. We think that's our mistake, the cost of the transactions. And that's why
we put in economic cost at a lower level of 0.6%. And we certainly think that over time,
the benefits to be derived from the package will certainly outweigh. Plus we
demonstrated that before with the deal we did with UB way back in 2004. And obviously,
it's up to us to deliver that again.
So in conclusion, just before I hand over for the questions, this was an important strategic
move. South Africa is the heart for the business. I think it enhances our long-term
sustainability. It really helps us how we show up in the institutional markets, both at the
group level and at the operational business level. And I think that's all very good for longterm value creation for shareholders. I think it helps us consolidate and grow in South
Africa, where we still have 2/3 of the earnings. And I think, as you see this transaction
together with this SAHAM transaction, really, it puts us in a very, very strong position in the
continent and diversifies our earning streams. It helps our competitive advantage in the
market and in terms of how we leverage the partnership with Ubuntu-Botho. I think level 1
is quite an achievement for Sanlam. 19% direct shareholding over 35% on the FSC
calculation really puts us in a strong market-leading position in terms of empowerment.
And it will be tough to catch us there. So -- and the beauty about that is, of course, it
leverages off the fact that Ubuntu-Botho never sold and they (stayed in with us). And they
have no intentions to sell. And I think if you see this strategic package together, you'll see
that clearly they're with us for the long term. We think the cost of the transaction at the
0.6% is really at the lower end of the range, certainly compared with comparable
economic and BEE transactions that we've seen. And it's up to us to make sure that over
the medium to long term, we (keep it) at 0.6% but that's why we've done this. And of
course, in terms of our prudent capital management policy, it strengthens our position on
the capital side and that's important in terms of ensuring that we can get our returns,
along with our dividend payout and the stable current rating. You'll probably see the
timetable, it takes us through to the 12th, I think of the 12th of December for the vote. But

just to also confirm that Ubuntu-Botho and also relates it sort of conflicted parties have
confirmed to us that they will not vote on any resolution. And of course, because these
are related transactions, they're all subject to the oversight of our investment committee,
which Sipho chairs. And also we get independent fairness opinions on each of the
transactions that are involved.
So that's really it. It's been a lot of work taking place over a considerable period of time.
And we thought now is the time to roll it out. Really all that's happened in the last couple
of weeks is the volatility, which we've had to watch but then we thought let's go for the
range and let's get it out into the market because we first actually announced this 5%
intent to do the BEE once we announced the SAHAM deal back in March. And clearly that's
been in the market for some time. So we think it's better to get it out there and get stuff
on the table.
So that's really enough for me, I think. Wikus is here, Sipho is here, I'd like to hand over to
questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Rudi de CÃ¶ning of Prudential
Investment Managers.

Q - Rudi de CÃ¶ning
Just a question, with ARC increasing their holding in SIM, is there any scope for Sanlam
funds to be used in Alexander Forbes' employee benefits?

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Let me just understand. Is there any scope forâ€¦

Q - Rudi de CÃ¶ning
Sanlam funds to be used in Alexander Forbes?

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Rudi, we -- I have been very open on this. We've held -- over the years, we've held
shareholding positions in Forbes. I really don't want Sanlam owning shares in Forbes. And I
don't think it helps the relationship. I actually think it would -- if you look at the Forbes
business model, it's very important when they're dealing with institutional clients that
everything that they -- how they deal with Sanlam is at arm's length. It doesn't really help
the relationship, in my opinion. So we've not -- anything that SIM would do, they may make
-- they may well make portfolio investment into Forbes that will be their choice. But we will
not be -- it's not our intent to have shareholding in Forbes. We have a strong business
relationship with Forbes. We would, of course, want that to extend. Of course, you need

Page 5 of 8



Company N ame: Sanlam L td
Company Ticker: SL M SJ Equity

to invest it in both. They would also want that. But that's just on the basis that we do
business with Forbes at the moment. It's not our intent on shares.

FINAL

Q - Rudi de CÃ¶ning
Sorry. You're not necessarily your shareholding but more on the SIM investment
management and sort of on for Alexander Forbes to invest into the SIM funds, is there
any scope for that?

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Oh, yes, yes, yes. I mean, of course, we would look to build the business relation. Thank
you for clarifying that. We've had many discussions with Forbes over a long period of time
in terms of the business relationship. But that's really strictly on an arms-length basis.
Forbes will do business in the best interest of Forbes. We will do business in the best
interest of Sanlam. We're trying to do as much business as we can with Forbes. And they
will do business with us that makes sense for them. I'm glad you clarified that. I was on the
wrong track there.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) The next question comes from Larissa Van Deventer of Macquarie.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Larissa Van Deventer

{BIO 20764470 <GO>}

Two questions, I suppose. The first one is on the ZAR 2 billion that you -- that goes to the
Ubuntu-Botho part of the transaction, you mentioned that 26% of their buying of -- or 25%
of their buying of SIM. Can you give us a little bit more detail about the entry-level last
market? Then the second question is, would you consider going wider than asset
management or life? Or is that where your investment focus is going to be through that
vehicle near term?

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

Okay. So the entry-level life is a new initiative we've been working on for a while. There is.
So you know, there's a gap there, we have to close that gap. We think we've got some
very clever ideas. And this is part of closing that gap along with the work that Sky is doing,
along with Capitec deal and this is a new initiative with a very, very strong black control,
management control, shareholding position and new initiatives. I mean we're not really
announcing the deal. We have come -- that will come -- the business will announce into
the market at the right time. But we're just signaling the type of the areas that we're in.
And I think what you need to look with the ZAR 2 billion is to say, okay, the first part will be
where they'll invest, for example, as you said, like into the asset management. And to this
entry-level life initiative. So the stuff we do together with them. But also you need to see
where they will build their portfolio. And you need to think about those 4 areas where we
need to, I'd say, close the gap. And they will -- we will obviously be working with them in
those areas, employee benefits, third-party asset management, health care and entrylevel life. Those are the 4 areas. So you feel to say that's really where the ZAR 2 billion is
going to move because we work them together on it.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Sir, we don't seem to have any further -- we have a follow-up
question from Rudi de CÃ¶ning of Prudential Investment Managers.

FINAL

Q - Rudi de CÃ¶ning
Ian, just a question on that sort of lower last segment. Do you hear any market share
being given from Sky to the new African Rainbow Life business?

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

It's all complementary. It's the same question we get with Capitec. There has to be but it
won't be significant. We try and position these initiatives with as little overlap as possible
but accepting that there may be some overlap. But our business is -- it's not like we sit
here in the group office and do these deals and we let the Sky people run their own
business. The Sky people are absolutely involved in all of these initiatives. And if it doesn't
work for Sky, we wouldn't do it. So I would say there'll be very little overlap there. We're
moving into the new areas. Wikus, I don't know if you want to add to that.

A - Wikus Olivier

{BIO 20074722 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Just I agree with that. If you look at Sanlam Sky's (inaudible) now strong. It might mean
(inaudible) like marketing, for example, where they struggle to grow. So there are specific
areas where there's not that much overlap that the new company can focus on.

Operator
Sir, that does seem to be the last and final question. Do you have any closing comments?

A - Ian Maxwell Kirk

{BIO 1778703 <GO>}

No. I mean it's an important day for us. I think we have this vision to be the leading PanAfrican financial services group. We have a vision to lead in South Africa. South Africa is our
home. I think these transactions are in line with the national agenda. Business needs to
invest to rebuild our economy and needs to work with government and labor to do that.
We are not -- we're able to support projects, which we will obviously do that. But this is an
indication really where we're building out black business in the country and we're
improving the position of Sanlam. So we're excited with this. We've been working on it for
quite a while. And I think it's going to help us really in how turn up in the institutional
market for years to come.

Operator
Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Sanlam Limited, that
concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your
lines.
