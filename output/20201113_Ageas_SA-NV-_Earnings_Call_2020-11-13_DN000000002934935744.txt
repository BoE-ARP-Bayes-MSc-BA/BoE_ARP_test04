{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for dialing into this conference call
and for being with us for the presentation of the results of Ageas for the third quarter of
2020. I'm happy to be hosting this conference call for the ﬁrst time as Ageas new CEO.
I'm joined in the room by Christophe Boizard, our CFO; and Emmanuel Van Grimbergen,
our Chief Risk Oﬃcer. And as usual, Filip Coremans and Antonio Cano are also in the
room. And as you may have seen in our press release two weeks ago, their roles within

the Group have evolved. Filip is now Managing Director, Asia, while Antonio became
Managing Director, Europe. This change, which reﬂects the growing importance of a
dedicated regional focus for the Group, will enable us to strengthen our business
oversight within the Executive Committee. Moreover, they will both have transversal
responsibilities within the Group. Antonio will remain responsible for reinsurance, which is
becoming more and more important for Ageas, and for real estate, more speciﬁcally
working on how we could expand our strength in real estate to the beneﬁt of the entire
Group. As for Filip, he will continue to be in charge of innovation and business
development.
Before commenting on our results, I would like to quickly mention the Group news ﬂow,
which has been quite intense recently. Firstly, as announced, our AGM took place on
October 22 and approved the payment of the remaining part of our dividend, which has
been paid last week. Therefore, the gross cash dividend of EUR2.65 per share over the
2019 exercise that we had announced in February has now been fully distributed to the
shareholders. The EUR435 million cash-out related to the payment of the remaining part
was almost fully covered by the EUR427 million dividends that have been received from
Belgium early this month.

Secondly, on the M&A front, we have announced several transactions in the past few
months. Shortly after announcing the acquisition of an additional 23% stake in our Life
joint venture in India, IDBI Federal Life, we have announced our intent to further expand
our successful collaboration with China Taiping through the participation in the capital
increase of Taiping Reinsurance leading to a 25% stake. We are very happy about this
unique opportunity to partner up with one of the top Asian reinsurance companies with
an outstanding track record and a promising growth potential.
We have also announced the divestment of our stake in Tesco Underwriting in the UK,
which will enable us to focus on our core business, relying on our strong partnerships in
the local market, while further (technical diﬃculty) business. And lastly, you may have seen
our press release yesterday announcing that Fitch has conﬁrmed our A-plus rating with a
stable outlook.
So now back to our results. In Q3, we enjoyed a very strong operational performance,
undermined by equity impairments. In Life, our result, which amounted to EUR116 million
was impacted by EUR35 million negative capital gains compared to positive contribution
of EUR56 million capital gains in Q3 last year. This was due to impairments in Asia on
speciﬁc bank stocks listed in Hong Kong.
In the European consolidated entities, despite the reduced amount of capital gains and
the lower recurring ﬁnancial income, the guaranteed operating margin stood this quarter
at a solid 88 basis points, within our target range, thanks to a strong underwriting
performance. Over nine months, although gradually improving, the guaranteed margin
remains nevertheless still below target following the adverse evolution of the equity
markets in the ﬁrst quarter of 2020 and the COVID-19 impact on real estate revenues. The
Group unit-linked margin also improved within the Group target this quarter at 30 basis
points.

FINAL

In Non-Life we recorded an excellent net result of EUR130 million this quarter, as we
continued to beneﬁt from lower claims frequency especially in motor. Over nine months,
this favorable claims experience fully oﬀset the impact of the adverse weather in Q1 and
led to an excellent combined ratio of 90%.
On the commercial front, inﬂows were 4% up this quarter, recording strong 11% growth in
Asia at constant FX, thanks to a full recovery in China, a 7% growth in Belgium from unitlinked commercial campaigns and a 6% increase in the UK. We are currently experiencing
a second lockdown across Europe, which brings uncertainties around the ﬁnancial
markets and the overall economy. The resilience demonstrated by our operations during
the ﬁrst nine months of the year gives us conﬁdence on our ability to overcome the
second wave of the pandemic. Of course, we have to remain prudent in these uncertain
times. However, providing no major negative impact from the ﬁnancial markets would
take place in the coming months, we feel conﬁdent in our ability to deliver results close to
our initial guidance of EUR850 million to EUR950 million, excluding the one-oﬀ -- positive
one-oﬀ impact from the FRESH operation and the impact from RPN(I). The fact that we
expect to end the year close to our guidance despite beneﬁting from virtually no capital
gains so far this year. Compared to EUR197 million for the ﬁrst nine months of 2019,
illustrates the strength of our operational performance. This also demonstrates the clear
beneﬁt of relying on a diversiﬁed portfolio, both in terms of products and geographies.
Lastly, I would like to emphasize the strength of our balance sheet. We enjoy a robust
194% Solvency II position, comfortably above our target of 175% and a solid cash position,
which stood at EUR1.5 billion, of which EUR0.4 billion is ring-fenced for the settlement and
EUR0.3 billion is set aside for the ongoing M&A transactions. Furthermore, our operations
rely on a solid asset portfolio, which has remained stable over the ﬁrst nine months of the
year. And therefore, I feel that we are well armed to face to continuous turbulent times.
Ladies and gentlemen, I will now hand over to Christophe for details on the results.

Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Thank you, Hans, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. As you can see on Slide 5,
our nine months result amounted to a high EUR994 million or EUR662 million if you
exclude the EUR332 million of net capital gains related to the tender on the FRESH
securities realized in the ﬁrst half of the year and will not be available for dividend
distribution. Over the period, the COVID pandemic had a contrasting impact on our
results.
Our Life activities suﬀered from equity impairments and from lower recurring ﬁnancial
income, mostly from real estate and dividends. On the contrary, our Non-Life activities
with their limited exposure to commercial lines, beneﬁted from reduced claim frequency,
mostly in motor. Overall, we estimate that the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact
close to EUR100 million on our results over nine months as the EUR215 million lower
capital gains and recurring income recorded in Life were only partially compensated by
the EUR120 million positive impact from lower claims frequency in Non-Life.

As usual, I will give you now some comments per segment. Slide 6, in Belgium, our Life
result was up this quarter, driven by a strong operating performance. The Life guaranteed
[ph] operating margin stood at 85 bps, above the level of Q3 last year, despite lower
capital gains and the reduced recurring income from real estate. Over nine months the
guaranteed margin is still below target as it has not yet fully recovered from the impact of
the Q1 equity impairments, but quarter-after-quarter, we are catching up, and this should
continue into the fourth quarter with the help of capital gains realized in real estate. Three
deals are indeed already closed and they will generate capital gains of around EUR65
million.
In Non-Life, we had strong results, thanks to lower claims frequency, mostly in motor,
although to a lesser extent in Q3 than what was experienced in Q2. Over nine months,
this fully oﬀset the impact of the storms in Q1 and resulted in an excellent combined ratio
of 89.3%.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the commercial front Life inﬂows increased this quarter, a successful sales campaign in
unit-linked boosted the sales and compensated for the lower inﬂows in guaranteed
products. Non-Life inﬂows continue to be resilient like in previous quarter.
In the UK, Slide 7, in Q3 the results was -- the result was also supported by continued low
claim frequency and strong prior-year releases, mainly in motor, while claim related to
business interruption, even cancellation of rental insurance, remained very limited.
Therefore, the combined ratio amounted to a strong 88.2% despite ongoing sector-wide
claims inﬂation in motor and a volatile pricing environment. Inﬂows were up this quarter,
driven by new commercial deals, mainly in household, while motor inﬂows remained
broadly ﬂat compared to the third quarter of last year.
In Continental Europe, Slide 8, we recorded a solid net result mostly driven by Non-Life.
The performance of our Non-Life operations was strong in Portugal, thanks to continued
lower claims frequency in motor, which combined with benign weather and a continued
focus on expense management, led to an excellent combined ratio of 83.6% over the nine
months. A solid result generated in Turkey despite claims frequency back to normal level
in Q3, was, as often, mitigated by the adverse FX rate evolution. In Life, our guaranteed
operating margin, although impacted by a lower level of capital gains, remained above
target this quarter, thanks to a solid underwriting margin and continued eﬀorts on
expense management.
With regards to the sales, in the current low interest rate environment, Portugal is shifting
its product portfolio to our unit-linked and protection products. However, the growth in
unit-linked in the quarter would not compensate for the decline in guaranteed products.
In Non-Life, inﬂows continued to prove resilient with growth in Portugal in all business
lines and a strong growth in Turkey at constant exchange rate.
In Asia, Slide 9, the solid operating performance was underlined by negative ﬁnancial
market impacts, such as equity impairment and the unfavorable evolution of the discount
rate curve in China. We indeed recorded this quarter EUR50 million negative net capital
gains due to the drop in value of some speciﬁc Chinese high-dividend stocks at the time

FINAL

of the Q3 closing. Shortly after the closing date, these stocks partially recovered, but we
applied our very prudent rules and took impairment this quarter. As you may remember,
our impairment rules diﬀer from the ones in place for local accounts and these
impairments were not recorded in typing local accounts. Therefore, the hit we took it was
not alleviated by any mitigating technical elements, making it more severe for Ageas.
Excluding these market impacts, our result was ﬁrmly up in Asia, which illustrate our solid
underwriting performance. The better Non-Life result was supported by ongoing lower
claim frequency, driven by the continued lockdown measures. The rebound in inﬂows
recorded in Q2 continued in Q3. Inﬂows were up 11% at constant FX, driven by China
where the economic activity picked up earlier than in the rest of the region.
The Reinsurance segment, on Slide 10, recorded a positive net result of EUR37 million this
quarter, again, supported by lower claim frequency in the operational entity. Over nine
months, this more than compensated for the negative impact of the storms in Belgium,
and in the UK.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving to the capital position now, as mentioned by Hans, our Group Solvency II ratio,
Slide 12, stood at a strong 194%, comfortably above our target level. You may remember
that our solvency decreased in the ﬁrst half of the year following the tender of the FRESH
and the negative market movements, mostly on yield and equity. This quarter our
solvency was up by 2 percentage point, supported by a solid operational performance
and spread tightening.
Our operational free capital generation, Slide 13, which beneﬁted from the strong NonLife operational performance in Q2 and in Q3 amounted to EUR573 million, including
EUR132 million dividends from our non-controlled participations. Therefore, we are
conﬁdent that we will reach this year our operational free capital generation guidance of
EUR500 million to EUR540 million for the Solvency II scope.
And this is the end of my presentation. As a conclusion, I will highlight the kind of
unexpected impairment in China. If they had not been recognized, we would have
presented record result and this proves that the underlying results are extremely strong,
and I will repeat what I said at the end of my Q2 speech, saying that the proﬁle of the
Group based on personal lines proved to be extremely resilient in these troubled times,
and Q3 is a conﬁrmation of this.
Thank you.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hello, gentlemen. Thank you very much. You've already touched on some of the details,
but I wondered if you could just, ﬁrst of all, help me normalize the nine-month results. I
think you've given some of the detail, if you could just kind of list it, that would be helpful.
And I suppose behind my question is, if I just adjust the nine months for the FRESH deal,
you're at EUR662 million, and actually annualized it is close to EUR900 million. And so,
given that you're saying you still expect only to be close to your target range, which starts
at EUR850 million, I'm not really sure what the 4Q negatives in particular are going to be.
So the question from that is, could you help me normalized EUR920 million for all the
things you've talked about, and on the basis of that normalization, why are you still being
so conservative in your guidance for this year?
And then lastly, if I may please, on the back of that, could you just talk about your comfort
range going into 2021, because in theory, you still got a business plan to be growing your
earnings. And so if you are at EUR850 million to EUR950 million for this year and you're
expecting you're going to be close to that or could even be in it, should we still be
expecting that earnings can grow in 2021, or are there headwinds that we need to be
concerned about? Thank you.

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, thank you. Maybe on the underlying I think the ﬁrst point I'll give to Christophe. I
will come back to you on the outlook for the fourth quarter and related to our ambition
level as far as 2021. Maybe ﬁrst some comments on the underlying.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Yes. Will, you are right, so the ﬁrst and the prominent element is obviously the FRESH
impact and divided into two operation, as I said, it is EUR332 million. But you are right,
there is a lot of other things. The most striking element is obviously the lack of capital
gains. There is a slide in the presentation saying that this year we have recorded almost
no capital gain, and I think if we had to restate vis-a-vis normal levels, I would add
something around EUR150 million. That's something, which would be more in line with
our long-term view on capital gains; you remember that it is based on 5% global return
on real estate and 7% on equity. So, EUR150 million.
Then on weather impact, we are slightly above historical level or so, it is around EUR30
million. But I'll let you judge if it is worth taking that into account, but then we have some
other big elements. And the last one I will mention, taking only the biggest ﬁgures, is the
VIR eﬀect in China. You know this, the discounting eﬀect on the reserve that ﬂow through
P&L, and on this the eﬀect is estimated at around EUR80 million this year. So these other
main elements we have.

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, Christophe. On Q4 and our statement related to our guidance, what do
we expect in Q4. First of all motor frequency, I think we assume to be performing strongly
here, because in some of our markets, Belgium, Portugal, UK, we are in partial or full
lockdown. So we assume that these strong results can continue, but on Non-Life, you
Page 6 of 22

FINAL

should also take into account and we have still some uncertainty on that element that
some business lines work with usage-based premium, and I'm talking about liability, or
workmen's compensation where customers pay an advance payment in the beginning or
throughout the year. And there will be a ﬁnal calculation on, for instance, numbers of
employees and all these things will of course be impacted by the temporary or
permanent unemployment, to give some examples. So we still have some uncertainty
there how the ﬁnal premium settlement will end throughout the year.
The second element mentioned already for the previous quarters is China and the impact
on VIR, which we assume to be in a similar range as it has been over the previous three
quarters, meaning something in the range of EUR30 million a quarter. Thirdly, of course,
subject to volatility in the ﬁnancial markets and then speciﬁcally looking at two elements,
one is further eﬀect on the yields from parking business, which we assume will go to
similar levels as we have seen in the ﬁrst half of the year, as well as commercial real estate,
although they are not in a full lockdown, but in some partial lockdown, and then of course
the additional risk that remains on impairments.
So these are, I think the key elements. I would say, if all these turn out positively in the
third quarter, then I agree with you, we should arrive within range, but with these
uncertainties, we want to be slightly more conservative and staying close too.

Bloomberg Transcript

Last question, 2021, well, budgeting, I think, has never been as diﬃcult as this year,
because we have no idea how the COVID will continue next year and how economies will
or will not recover the coming year. So we are now in full preparation of budget and
business plan cycle, but it is too early to give you any guidance in this respect.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Thank you gentlemen. If I may just come back very brieﬂy, can I assume that the VIR
impact that you're talking about for this year, like the EUR80 million you referred to, that
just becomes zero next year on the assumption that there is no change in the interest
rates, right. These are all one-time changes adjusting for how the interest rate in China
has moved, right?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Let me take that question. William, not exactly the valuation interest rate, as you know,
used in China is a 750 day moving average. And while in the fourth quarter, we see it go
down with about 10 basis points, there will still be some decline in the course of next year
before it ﬂattens out. Of course, the 10-year government yield in China has rebound a lot
from the lows in March, where it was even touching something like -- I'm trying to ﬁnd a
ﬁgure -- even 3. -- 2.5, it has rebounded to 3.20 to 3.26 now. But the averaging eﬀect will
play through. So it has improved, certainly, but there is still a negative eﬀect to be
expected next year.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Right. Gentlemen, thank you for that detail. Thank you.

Thank you. Next question from Farooq Hanif from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thank you very much and hope you're all doing well. Firstly, slightly aligned to
Will's question, can you help us with trying to sort of normalize Asia, so as we can have a
go perhaps at the discount rate impact and we can try to make an estimate of realized
gains? But when we strip those two elements out what's the best way to model it? Would
you say the year-to-date, for example, proﬁt excluding those items, if we compare that to
liabilities, is that a sort of a -- would you say it's a reasonable kind of normalized margin if
we do that? And aligned to that also, what happens to the, for example, the banks that
you own given that they have recovered under your impairment rules in Q4? So that's
question one.
Question two, going to Tesco, can you remind us again of what your thinking was in
closing the deal, because you were just getting to proﬁtability, it's obviously an important
distribution channel. Just wanted to understand what happened there in making that
decision. And then lastly, quick detail question. In 4Q, would you have any exposure to
earthquake risk in Turkey? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

The speciﬁc point on the three banks. So your question is what will happen to our result if
the shares recover. They have already recovered, you know that the impairment threshold
is 25%. But they have regained more than half of this 25%. So they are up. The sad part of
the story is that there are long-term equity, which means that we cannot hold, but that will
be sold in the near future. So they will stay like this and you know that one way to recover
impairment is to sell the shares, as it was the case before. But now I think that today we
cannot hope to have any recovery on the short term, because they are held for a long
period of time and the beneﬁt brought by this share is the high dividend, the dividend is
around 7% on the stocks. What can happen in the future, the positive element on the
result, but now I am entering into, let's say, more a detailed caution. This will happen next
year. If the shares are still under their book price in the TPL accounts, TPL will be obliged
to recognize an impairment under the 360 day rule of impairment, and in that case,
something will happen because this loss could be at least partially compensated by some,
what I call in my speech technical element, for instance, a movement on some proﬁt
sharing reserves for instance to compensate for the impairment. So this could occur for
Q2, because the ﬁrst formal closing where this 365-day rule will apply in the TPL account
is Q2, since they close their account only twice a year. So the positive could come in Q2
through some compensating mechanism put in place in the local accounts of TPL. That's
the precise question.
Well, regarding your question relating to normalization of the Asian result, If you look at
the result this year to date, we had recorded or reported EUR258 million -- EUR257
million, and in fact, net-net, the amount of capital gains in there is zero year-to-date, and
the impact of the VIR, the valuation interest rate adjustment, as Christophe mentioned, is
around EUR80 million, EUR90 million, so underlying. Ignoring these two components,

Page 8 of 22

Date: 2020-11-13

FINAL

you could say we would have been around EUR340 million on a normalized basis. Now
that being said, the fourth quarter in Asia is always weaker than the previous quarters for
many reasons, but an important one is that in China they start to focus on the New Year
and preparing the year-end or the beginning of the next year campaign. So, traditionally,
our fourth quarter results in Asia are not as strong as the US.
However, I'm not going to try to build here a model on the (technical diﬃculty) forwardlooking projections, which is an exercise that is in our budget mix, but the most important
drivers are indeed the overall, I would say, growth in the business volume, which has
translated, in one hand, in the new business ﬁgures which we disclose, but it would be
with a quarter delay in our tables, and obviously indeed the assets under management,
which gives a balance sheet view. But that is too short, I would say, to the -- cutting the
corner. A lot depends on the quality of the new business that is being sold and thereafter,
refer to the tables which really close with a quarter delay, which are on our website.

Thank you. Next question from (multiple speakers)

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

Sorry, there were still two questions open. Good morning. On Tesco, well, very brieﬂy,
Tesco actually indicated that they wanted to end the partnership, which was to end
anyway in 2021. So we have anticipated that for one year. And so we arrived at the
mutually beneﬁcial deal. So we have closed -- there is no really any other story behind
that. I think Tesco wanted to bring their insurance activity and the bank closer together.
And as we published, we will realize a small capital gain on that deal. And on Turkey, I can
also be very brief, our exposure is about EUR1 million, so it's fairly low.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay, that's really kind. Thanks for your help.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

We can just add that on Tesco we also plan to have a cap gain of EUR9 million in the
transaction. But that will only be realized next year.

FINAL

Q - Michael Huttner

Fantastic. Thank you very much. Thanks. My ﬁrst question is really, I don't know just very
well, so apologies you might have spoken about that in previous investor days, but is
there a point in terms of government yields in Europe, interest rates, whatever, where you
kind of reach a cliﬀ edge where the Life business does not make money anymore,
because I look at these margins and I'm amazed, we have negative interest rates in lots of
countries and your guaranteed margin year-to-date 59 bps, okay, in Belgium, but the Q3,
85 bps. Where is the point where you kind of say, (inaudible). And then the second
question is, is really simple one, and so like please, please give me some comfort, can you
talk about the buybacks for next year? Thank you.

A - Hans De Cuyper

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

Maybe the ﬁrst one on the investments on the Life side. And then I assume you talk about
the Life guaranteed. Well, ﬁrst of all, main -- our main market, of course, is Belgium. In
Belgium, we always manage the portfolio as a whole. So that means that we take the total
customer return, so guarantees plus the proﬁt sharing and we look at it compared to the
yield of the portfolio. And that includes of course also the high historic yields. Then you
add the new business you like to do in the year at the new money rate. The new money
rate for ﬁxed income was close to 1.5% for the ﬁrst nine (technical diﬃcult). So this is not
only government bonds. So the new business, or the new investments have been
diversiﬁed; government bonds, corporate bonds, but also more and more for instance
infrastructure ﬁnancing where you have, or you can beneﬁt some government or some
regional guarantees. We also have I think given up a little bit of liquidity, liquidity is not an
issue for most life insurers. And so we have I think expanded, for instance, the portfolio in
mortgages, which is also a very attractive investment from a solvency point of view. So
new money rate just below 1.5% for the ﬁrst nine months. And then we see in total return,
how we can make the margin. An important element in that margin over the year, and
there you have some important seasonality is the capital gains. The capital gains are then
coming from equities or real estate -- I mean real estate, often these are a few material
deals that we do throughout the year and it happens to be this year that actually most of
these transactions will be done in the fourth quarter. I can tell you, I think that Christophe
just mentioned that EUR65 million of capital gains have been already realized in three real
estate transactions this quarter, and there are still a few more in the pipeline and on
schedule. So that you put all together to make that operating margin towards the end of
the year.
Is there a risk of going oﬀ the cliﬀ? Well, the key point of course is that based on the new
money rate, you also deﬁne your guaranteed rates that you give to customers and that is
approaching zero. And that is something we are actively managing. I think it will be
complex to sell with interest rates below -- but at no guarantee investing at just below
1.5%, I think we are still in a comfortable position today. And lastly, both in Belgium as in
Portugal, we are also mitigating the impact by focusing more on unit-linked business. So
we have not announced -- not decided to close the guaranteed business, but we
deﬁnitely push towards new business. And to give an example AG launched a very
successful commercial campaign in August and September together with the Bank on the
unit-linked side bringing in EUR250 million new business, unit-linked.

If I may add something. So indeed, we have 1.5% of new money yield on ﬁxed income,
and by the way, this is rather stable because this speciﬁc quarter, Q3, we did 1.6%. So we
don't have a very -- a declining trend. So 1.5% over the year, but on the top of this, we
have the contribution of other asset classes like real estate, and on the real estate, the
long-term view is 5%. We have a 10% allocation. So this adds 0.5. So all in all, all asset
classes together, we are at around 2% new money yield. And the 5% return on the real
estate is guaranteed over the future years by the very high amount of unrealized capital
gain. So we have an excellent visibility over the future on realizing this 5%, so all the asset
classes together 2%.

If you want to see that in more detail that proﬁle, I can recommend you to look at it in the

evolve as well (technical diﬃculty). The second question you had was on buyback. Well,
the only thing I think we can say now is that throughout the connect [ph] '21 cycle we

Q - Fulin Liang

{BIO 21126177 <GO>}

Thank you. I just have two questions, the ﬁrst one is a follow-up on the UK. So since you
dispose the Tesco channel, would that actually change your overall thinking behind
owning UK business at all? So that's my ﬁrst question. And the second question is on Asia.
So, I appreciate it. So the large capital loss is due to a large owning of the Bank. And this
sounds like to me is like you are potentially doubling down on your exposure to interest
rate, because if interest rate goes down, then your both assets and liabilities will be kind
of negatively aﬀected. And so I just wonder, is that the reason. So you think actually the
interest rate in China will go up. So you double down, and then kind of maybe behind
that, actually how much you are involved in the strategic asset allocation of TPL. Thank
you.

Regarding your question on Asia, on the investment strategy and the reasoning behind
this large positions that were taken in the top-tier banks. First and foremost, they were
built as an essential part of the long-term investment portfolio in the participating fund. So
they're mostly back-proﬁt sharing counters and they are both for the dividend yield. Let's
be clear on that. And these speciﬁc counters have dividend yields historically between 6%
and 7%. In the par front, of course, the liability structure is very long and it's very diﬃcult
to ﬁnd such long-dated ﬁxed income instruments. So they have a place in the strategic
asset mix. The reasoning is from that angle very sound. How we are involved in decision
making in terms of investment? Well, there are of course it's our partner is there in the
lead. But let's not forget that we are very actively involved in the management, the
appointed actuary in China is actually an AGS appointee as well as the Chief Risk Oﬃcer
of Taiping asset management. So we are deﬁnitely at the top table when these decisions
are made. Of course, partners can have a diﬀerence in terms of risk appetite and if the
diﬀerence is material as we have done in the past, we can take some hedging at the level
of the Group. But at this new moment we feel that this is reasonably aligned with what we
think is the right asset mix for the par front in China.

Hello, good morning everybody. It's Vik from SocGen. Just a couple of questions from my
side. Firstly, I appreciate the Belgian guaranteed life margins are gradually improving
quarter-over-quarter. I'd just be interested in your thoughts around the leeway that you
have in terms of proﬁt sharing for the policyholders and how do you think that is likely to
play out at the end of the year.
And secondly, just wanted to a clariﬁcation with your comments on motor claims
frequency in the fourth quarter, are you assuming it to continue to be lower, or did you
say that you assume it at more normal levels for the fourth quarter? Thank you. That's all

Hello. On your ﬁrst question, if I understood it right, you asked about the leeway we have
on proﬁt sharing and what the outlook would be towards year-end, and correct me if I'm
wrong, if that not was your question. So in Belgium, indeed, proﬁt sharing is discretionary.
So we have a lot of leeway and the proﬁt sharing this decision is something we put
forward to the Board and the General Shareholders Meeting, or in this case, the number
of shareholders are obviously limited, but that's a decision we take towards year-end and
considering a lot of factors, but one of the key factors is obviously as Hans was saying, our
target margin for guaranteed life in Belgium, where we want to remain between 85% and
95%. And indeed as you're saying, there is quite some discretion in Belgium for that.

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

On your question on motor claims frequency, well, I think we only can try to estimate what
the impact is from the previous month experience, and what we have seen is that you see
a quite material drop in claims frequency during a full lockdown, but even that I think
varies a lot from one country to the other. On the contrary, what we have seen over the
summer period is that claims frequency actually went quite rapidly back to normal levels.
And that is due to a few elements, ﬁrst of that is the agility in traﬃc, which of the drivers is
more of the same. After a period of lockdown, also related to trucks, for instance, where
trucks are not used to the cars anymore. And there is a number of cars on the road, which
is increasing after the lockdown but the speed, the average speed is not yet coming
down. So we have seen actually quite diﬃcult few weeks immediately after the lockdown.
Now we are in some of the countries back in lockdown, so we assume that we will see, but
it's too early to say, the claims frequency improving again during this four to six weeks,
but after that -- and that will be then mid-second half of December, when it is winter time
and we come out of lockdown, of course it is where we hard to guess what the impact is
going to be. So that's a bit the outlook on frequency in motor.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Hans De and good afternoon. Just a couple of questions I have, one is
on Asia. Sorry, going back to the Asian earnings again. I mean EUR260 million this year,
year-to-date. There is no capital gain in that. So it looks like it is more or less normalized
given that the volatility, the VIR impact is going to stay. But how should we think about
capital gain on top of this? So you mentioned that at the Group level your assumption is
about EUR150 million. Can we get a bit more clarity on China level, on Asia level as well?
I'm just trying to get a bit more sense on what should be the Asian earnings going
forward with this VIR impact. I mean are we talking about say about 400 type number or
are we talking about a bit lower including, capital gain. So that's the ﬁrst one.

Second one is, you still have about EUR1.5 billion cash. So what are your plans for that? I
mean, do you look forward to do any bolt-on M&A anywhere, any thoughts on that would
be great. And just a small one on your next year guidance for EPS. I think based on the
Connect 2021 plan, it's about say EUR4.28 to EUR5 if we use the 67% growth rate. I mean
how conﬁdent you are on that EPS number? Thank you.

A - Christophe Boizard

Thanks, Ashik for your question. So, ﬁrst and foremost, having a target range, which we
have now put at 300, 350 for Asia this year, obviously this year I would not count on too
much capital gains. Let's be realistic. And with VIR impact, we feel that we will be close -maybe just below that range. That is a reasonable expectation and that we can be a year
without capital gains. Now the capital gains in Asia have been quite volatile, as you would,
without any doubt have noticed. We tend not to rely too much on it in terms of thinking
about our forward-looking statements. But as Hans said before, we are still in the middle
of the budgeting exercise, which is complex, but let's be sure that that range will not go
down looking forward, but it's a little bit too early to make statements on that, Ashik, you
would have to wait till Q1 results.

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

Okay, Ashik, then on the second on the acquisition, I mentioned it already, you can also
see it on -- in your deck. And so the EUR1.5 billion cash position we are having today,
EUR400 million is ring-fenced for the settlement and EUR300-something million for the
already ongoing M&A transaction. So that brings us at a cash position EUR700 million to
EUR800 million today. And, of course, we still have some potential debt capacity, as well
as a Group if need be. So regarding M&A, the only thing I can say is, you do see some
activity in market and we react on that activity, based on our principles of M&A and that
we have always been transparent on with a strong ﬁnancial discipline, but I cannot give
you more indication than this.

Yes, good morning gentlemen. Several questions on my side. So yeah, coming back on
the guaranteed business in Belgium, looking at the fall of the gross inﬂows versus the
maturities you expect, is that fair to assume that you will see a net decrease of the
technical provisions in the coming years, especially looking at the insurance tax on new
money, potentially your lowering of proﬁt sharing, I guess the project will be a bit on the
pressure on the gross inﬂows. And I was wondering if it -- it could translate into a net
decrease and by how much potentially, trying to ﬁgure out that. On the real estate
portfolio, there's is a lot of debate on the market on valuation levels with (inaudible)
transactions, obviously. So real estate agents seem to keep the pricing level quite still
stable, but I was wondering if you do expect also in Q4 and probably next year a bit more
negative revaluations on the real estate portfolio. I don't think that will ﬂow into P&L but
that could ﬂow into Solvency II capital.
Third one was on the pricing of Non-Life. Obviously very low frequency on claims. Do you
plan to give back part of this low frequency to the clients, especially if you get out of the
second lockdown with again low frequency, what is your view on that going into 2021?
Then maybe just ﬁnal on the AG Solvency II at 173%, what are your thoughts on the
dividend for 2020, can we expect a 100% payout from AG again this year? Thank you.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sorry, maybe I'll take the ﬁrst question on the technical liabilities in Life Belgium. Well,
they could go slightly down, they could go slightly up, diﬃcult to tell, also depends on
what the alternatives are for customers to save for their pension, and it would not be a
major movement. So I think the best guess would be a stable level of technical liabilities.
If you want some delta, it might be a gradual increase. So I'll leave it for that.
On -- maybe on the real estate some comments. Strangely we've -- so the couple of
transactions we've already realized in the fourth quarter were at prices that were
surprisingly high. So we still see quite some appetite for high -- for quality real estate. So
I'm not so sure if really activity has decreased. I don't have a really pan-European view on
that. But in the markets we are present, which is basically Belgium and France, we still see
quite some appetite for real estate. And on negative revaluations, I think that focus is
mainly on shopping center, or retail, valuations for certain assets might come under
pressure, but things like warehousing, say logistics or prime oﬃce space, we have no
indications that evaluations are going down there.

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

I'll take maybe the other one (Technical Diﬃculty) of the price, you see for example in the
UK a gradual price decrease on new business, but in UK, there are also other things
playing like the FCA pricing review et cetera. Don't see in Portugal or in Belgium any
signiﬁcant drops in premiums, neither big increases either in motor. So I think, let's not
jump into conclusions that COVID will lead automatically to major drops in premiums.
There are also other risks more negatively impacted by COVID-like situation. Think about
the business interruption, et cetera. There is some spillover on the reinsurance market. So
reinsurance prices will harden that will have an impact on pricing of direct insurers. So
many things moving there, but I would not jump to conclusions saying the prices will
decrease.

A - Emmanuel Van Grimbergen

{BIO 18010465 <GO>}

Okay. Emmanuel. I'll take the question on the Solvency position of AG. So you refer to a
ratio of 173% which is a Pillar 1 ratio. And as you know, we manage our business based on
the Pillar 2 ratio. So from a capital management point of view, from a risk appetite point of
view, but also from a dividend point of view, we steer and we manage based on Pillar 2
and on Pillar 2, AG is still at a very comfortable and high level of 203%. Of course Pillar 1
and there is something where we have been consistently communicated in that way, we
have to keep an eye on Pillar 1, but we consider Pillar 1 more as a ﬂoor but we prefer and
we manage the business based on Pillar 2.

A - Hans De Cuyper

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

The dividend will be 100% again or?

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We don't know yet. It's too early, we are not yet at the end of the year. Again, if nothing
changes and they apply the dividend policy, yes, then I can conﬁrm. But it all depends
how it will further evolve for the rest of the year. It is too early to decide on the dividend,
but they have speciﬁc rules on the dividend upstreaming, so today, I would say they are
still within that ambition.
Maybe on your ﬁrst question, little bit of additional color, on the liabilities in Belgium
actually I refer to slide 23 in your deck, because you see that even in these circumstances
AG is able to grow the base of technical liabilities, which I think is very positive. More
growth in unit-linked with a small decline on the guaranteed business. I think it is very
important to dissect these technical liabilities, because a lot of them are pension-related
liabilities, corporate pension schemes, as well as individual pension contributions, which
are very, very stable, which is not something you swap overnight and even we see in
employee beneﬁts if a company would decide to change plan from guaranteed to unitlinked AG is very well positioned to make that transition in the business. So I'm actually
not too worried about the evolution of technical liabilities in Belgium.
And then, besides what Antonio said on pricing pressure in motor, your question was also
to real rebates from the COVID crisis. Well, ﬁrst of all, we don't feel material pressure in
any of the markets that we are. In all the markets where there had been some rumors, I
must say the regulator has always been very reluctant to accept the pressure, because
generally spoken motor is not, I would say in most market, the most proﬁtable segment of
the markets, and last but not least, let's not forget that COVID has a lot more impact than
this, you have the impact of ﬁnancial markets. We also had -- didn't have an excellent year
on storms. It was a heavy year on storms in the ﬁrst quarter. So there are a lot of elements
that play in the proﬁtability of Non-Life, which I think is very well understood by the
regulator.

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. And two questions from my end, the ﬁrst one is on the net leverage.
On your own deﬁnition you're at 17.2% and increase in bolt-on M&A has mostly been paid
out of the holding cash buﬀer, I think, with EUR260 million still to be paid. At what point
which you consider again issuing debt and issuing M&A through the debt ﬁnancing, and
what kind of capacity can we currently see that you have also in relation to maintaining a
good rating for your reinsurance business? So what's the kind of debt capacity you have?
And the second part of the question is on M&A, I mean in the Belgium market, I think
there is one trial in play, but probably quite troubled player evaluating [ph] those are the
NBB (inaudible) this week as well. Is this something you are willing to look at and what
capability could that bring, or is this a company that maybe be able to repair [ph], so to
speak? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

So I can answer on the debt. So indeed, capital leverage 17.2%, you know that there are
diﬀerent ways of assessing the capital leverage. What is important to us is to keep this
leverage to below the maximum imposed by the 3 rating agencies that we have. So with
17.2% we have a lot of homes vis-a-vis maximum, and we could issue debt. So it depends
and the maximum diﬀers from one rating agency to another, but at -- we could easily issue
EUR500 million of Tier 2 while being still far from the maximum of the 3 rating agencies,
the leverage they consider as a limit. And so we -- EUR500 million. The Tier 2 bucket has
still some room The room is close to EUR1 billion, but it's the, what I would call the
regulatory room. Then if we refer to the leverage, we can issue EUR500 million. But we
would be closer to the limit of Standard & Poor's, but without hitting them, but we could -being slightly hedged going to twice this amount. So as I said, something close to EUR1
billion.

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

Thank you, Christophe. Albert, on your second question, M&A in Belgium and the
(inaudible) indeed you have seen that the National Bank has appointed a special -- how
do you call it in English, I don't know -- responsible to manage the company. I understood
that he has two clear thoughts. First is to explore the sale of Antegral [ph] with the
partners -- with the oﬀers they got in the bidding process, alternatively is preparing and
guiding liquidation of the company. I can't be transparent that we did not make an oﬀer.
In the ﬁrst round we found it diﬃcult to meet, I would say, our ﬁnancial conditions for an
M&A ﬁle related to this company together with an asset mix that also raised some
concerns.

Yes, hi gentlemen. Probably a couple of more questions at my end. On the UK, you had a
charge because of prior year reserve, so you had a prior year reserve release. If you could
quantify it or, say, if it was like close to EUR10 million that would be very helpful. And also
what are your thoughts on the underlying performance evolution ex the COVID impact for
2021?
And the second question is, Filip almost stole my question with his answers on the fourth
quarter. Yes, in China it is weaker, but could it be stronger due to the -- especially versus
last year on an underlying basis, due to the fact that we still have this 50,000 additional
net agents? And also a bit related to this, do we have any tax one-oﬀs that could come
back in there? Thank you.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

On the UK and the previous year releases, maybe a good hint is, if you go to the pack and
slide 33 there, you actually see the previous year releases expressed as a percentage of
net earned premium. Now if you do the math, if you see that it's a rather big number, and
the previous year releases in Q3 are a big number and bigger than the EUR10 million that
you mentioned, I think for motor and that we saw pre-reinsurance would be more in the
order of EUR30 million, 3-0, certainly in Q3. And those are -- actually a lot of those claims
relate to 2019. As you might remember, we struggled a bit in 2019 with our large losses,
so bodily injury-related large losses where we seem to be a bit of the odd one out in the
market. Well, it proves that with insight, our claims just were a bit or bit -- or quite
conservative on many of those claims that today you actually see unwinding. So that
explains the larger than usual previous year positive releases, which are always going to
be large in the UK, like they are in Belgium, it's just the very nature of our reserving policy,
which is conservative, always leads to signiﬁcant releases. If you look at that same slide for
2018-'19, we already had something close to 10% of net earned premium as releases. So
that's just a part of the business.
And then, your second question, I think you asked for a kind of what our expectations are
for the UK. I imagine without any of the special items, well, they remain the one that we
Page 18 of 22

expressed in the past and now it's a bit trickier to pinpoint the exact number, because we
have the big quota share and LPT business impacting also the UK, but if you bunch them
all up together, we will be again around the EUR70 million net proﬁt on a steady base. So
I would say fundamentally not a big change.
Right. Regarding your question about what to expect on the, I would say, the commercial
side in China for the last quarter, well, I would not directly link that to the bottom line,
Jason, if I may. But the commercial activity in China, as you could have seen also from the
last quarter, has rebounded quite materially. So we saw a growth held backed by FX of
3% 4% versus last year, which bodes well and indeed, because you may have noticed in
the tables we published the value of new business over the ﬁrst half of the year was not
blended, they started late with the year-end campaign last year. Then they went in
lockdown, but we see it is not disclosed, but we see strong recovery in Q3, and indeed,
the focus is really on quality business through agency. So we expect fourth quarter, as it
was in the third quarter, to be of good quality production, but they will be immediately
translate that in higher result expectations than what we have been talking about; that will
mature let's say after that, because they will be preparing already in December if not half
November for the start of the New Year. But the commercial activity in China is back on
track.

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

Yeah, I agree. That's very good to hear. By the way, if I do a quick follow-up, sorry there is,
ﬁrst the taxes, if you could also tell me if there is anything there. But also within the same
scope, the proﬁt sharing lever, is it -- could it be used against the VIR, because that was
something that was mentioned I think about six months ago, and now it was mentioned
more as part of the capital gains next year, so I was wondering if it can be used this year.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Well, ﬁrst the tax eﬀect, let's be very clear that supported the result in Asia or in China,
particularly last year about EUR50 million. This year there is no such thing, that is zero,
that is normal business as usual situation. Last year there was a kind of catch-up
retroactively, that eﬀect is no longer there.
Then the second part was related to compensation for VIR in proﬁt sharing. I think the VIR
eﬀect is mostly related to non-participating business lines. There is no VIR impact on the
participating side, there is a diﬀerent treatment there Jason. So it does not aﬀect, there is
no compensation in par.

Q - Robin van den Broek

{BIO 17002948 <GO>}

Yes, hi, good morning, everybody. Just ﬁrstly a quick follow-up on Benoit's question on
the Pillar 1. I think in the past you've said that 140 is more of a critical level for AG and
(technical diﬃculty) number. Secondly, on free capital generation, the print is sort of weak.
If you look at the beneﬁts from low frequency, which is driven by your SCR increase of
EUR40 million, withholding EUR70 million from your free capital generation, seems to be
related to asset management actions in Belgium and some scope broadening in the UK.
Could you please clarify those actions and what we could expect from that in future
occasions?
And sorry to come back on Asia again, but if I look at the clean earnings in nine months
2019, I think it's closer to EUR230 million that you just alluded to, for this year, the ﬁrst nine
months are close to EUR320 million. So that's a 30% increase. Of course, Asia, we expect
growth but 30% is quite stellar. So I was just wondering if you could give some
commentary on why the growth has picked up and to what extent we should consider that
to last also into 2021. And a small one, also related to Asia is Taiping Re, I think it should
be s-- the deal should happen this quarter. So should we bake in EUR25 million for '22 -2021 already or what should we do there? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

The question on the free capital generation. So indeed, you are right, the SCR increase,
and this is mainly due to the asset allocation where we are going to more "riskier assets".
So, for instance, in Portugal we have more real estate, we increase equity. In AG, there is a
plan to increase the equity with the high yield of long-term equity, strategic equity with a
favorable solvency treatment. So this has an impact on the free capital generation and
indeed this change in the asset allocation has a weight on the SCR. So what was
mentioned in my comment on the free capital generation is that you have two eﬀects
going in the opposite direction, you have some COVID beneﬁt on the operational free
capital generation. That's for sure, but at the same moment, this eﬀect is more than
compensated, because the eﬀect is above the COVID eﬀect, it is more compensated by
this SCR increase. And you know that the SCR is multiplied by 1.75 in the free capital
generation. So, all in all, this eﬀect is more than oﬀsetting the beneﬁt we have coming
from COVID-19.
So asset allocation?

Well on the ﬁrst question. So the 140% for AG, Pillar I, I'm not so sure whether we have
ever yet communicated this so clearly, but what I can absolutely say is that obviously if the
Pillar 1 ratio go closer and closer to 100%, of course, we will need to take action. And one
of those actions would be a reduce dividend, that's for sure, but again I really want to
insist we steer and manage on Pillar 2 Solvency ratio.

On (technical diﬃculty) why we had such a strong growth in the underlying result in Asia,
maybe good too, because you mentioned 30%, in our mind it's slightly less, but

nevertheless it is there. If we take out the eﬀect of capital gains, VIR, and last year taxes
and neutralize that as well as the VIR impact this year, we would have gone underlying,
let's say, from 260 to 340 year-to-date. So now in the 340 in all honesty, there is also
some positive of COVID in the Non-Life lines in Asia. So knock of EUR15 million I would
say for that, which is in line. Then you have about 20% growth. Now one of the eﬀects
there that comes into play and is also part of the reason of the impairment on the Chinese
banks, they were just bought, let's say, in the days before their coupon payments, and
that is a massive increase in the dividend payout in Asia, which to some extent is part of
the impairment, if you think about it. So that has boosted the result without any doubt, if
you neutralize for the capital gains.
So I would moderate that growth in reality down a bit, but nevertheless, the growth
indeed has been good. Now what can I say. Almost this is not a growth rate you can
project forward. I would be happy to tell you that it would be the case, but I would not do.
I would stick to what I said earlier, a bit too early to give clear expectations. Conﬁdent that
we are not going to lower our guidance range and maybe a little bit, but that will happen
when we announce our ﬁrst year result. Growth in line with overall business volumes,
provided that the quality of the book of business that is being written is good, which we
do disclose to some extent with a quarter delay should guide you there.

Yeah, maybe the question on Taiping Re. So if all goes well with the regulatory approvals,
et cetera, we could very well close the deal in Q4 this year. So the impact on the results
for this year will obviously be very minimal. If we close in Q4, it will probably in December.
And then going forward, I mean the number you mentioned is good enough to start with.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
But we are conﬁdent on the closing this quarter. So next year we should have a full-year
Taiping Re numbers. So that's right.

Q - Robin van den Broek

{BIO 17002948 <GO>}

Okay guys, thanks. That's really helpful.

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

Close to certain that the deal will be closed for the simple reason that Taiping Re does
need this capital increase to be done by December 31, so that they have their
underwriting capacity for 2021.

Thank you very much. That was the last question for the moment registered. (Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your questions. To end this call, let me summarize
the main conclusions. We reported a third consecutive strong quarterly net results, driven
by an excellent Non-Life performance. The operating performance was solid both in Life
and Non-Life, mitigating some speciﬁc impairments on the Asian banks. Our Solvency
position was up and well above the target level. And lastly, given our solid result over the
nine month and despite the absence of support of capital gains up to now, we remain
conﬁdent in our ability to achieve a result close to our initial guidance, providing, of
course, that no major negative impact on the ﬁnancial markets would take place in the
coming weeks.
And with this, I would like to bring this call to an end. Don't hesitate to contact our IR team
should you have outstanding questions. Thank you for your time and I would like to wish
you a very nice day.
