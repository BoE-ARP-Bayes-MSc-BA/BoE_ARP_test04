Board members. With today's AGM, the term of all supervisory board members are
terminated. As in the past, however, the Supervisory Board will be made up of
representatives of the shareholders' side and the employees' side.
I would like to use this opportunity to express our gratitude to those shareholder and
employee representatives who will leave the Supervisory Board by the end of this AGM
today. Like all the other representatives of the employees' side, they have -- sometimes
came up with critical but always constructive comments and addressed the terms and
tasks and duties of the corporation and thus made a vital contribution towards the
success of the Munich Re Insurance company. For this we owe them your and our
gratitude. This holds true, in particular, for my deputy, Mr. NÃ¶renberg. The new
Supervisory Board members of the employees' side, are part -- and on the basis of the
Codetermination Act, have already been duly elected by the corresponding committees.
Mr Kagermann and myself will no longer be available for reelection, we thus will leave this
Supervisory Board with the end of the AGM here today. Mr. Kagermann has been a
member of the Supervisory Board since July 1999 and thus is with almost 20 years on a
board, the oldest serving member of the Supervisory Board. He was also member of
nearly all the committees of the Supervisory Board, amongst others. He was a member of
that audit committee, whose chairman he also had been for the last 10 years. During his
many years of working effectively in our Supervisory Board, he has made a vital
contribution towards the sustainable and long term development of our company. We
have come to appreciate his independent advice, his extensive digitalization expertise
and support, especially in his function as a many year chairman of the audit committee
and have come to appreciate extraordinarily. We thank him, at this point, for his decade
long collaboration and assistance here in our Supervisory Board.
I would like to add here, at this point, that such a long tenure in the Supervisory Board
would no longer be possible today. But all the same, I think anybody here can and will
agree with me that his independence was never in danger in these 20 years that he
served on the Supervisory Board. Of course, we are grateful to all the other
representatives of the shareholder side, whose expertise has made a vital contribution
towards the success of our corporation. Thank God, we have found that in the course of
the last term, a number of colleagues of the shareholder side have declared themselves
willing to terminate their post in order to make sure that we have a continuing change in
the recruitment and starting of the shareholder side. My gratitude goes therefore to Mr.
Van Rossum, Professor (Gruz), Mr. (Soma) and Mr. (Meyerhuber). We know that Mr.
Meyerhuber left effective as of the 31st of December 2016. As you probably know, he has
regrettably passed away at the end of 2018. All shareholder members of the -- all
Supervisory Board members of the shareholder side will be newly elected today in
individual votes. The selection of the candidates who you can vote into the Supervisory
Board today have been determined by objective criteria. We have looked in particular at
the expertise and experience that is necessary and important for supervising and
monitoring the business activities of our group. The Supervisory Board proposes, as you
will have seen, from the invitation to the AGM, to have 8 previous member of the
Supervisory Board and 2 new candidates to be elected to sit on a new Supervisory Board.
All the candidates have confirmed that they have the necessary time available for the
activity on the Board and also can find the time to work on the various Supervisory Board
committees. For reelection, we therefore recommend, following the proposal of the
nomination committee, Miss Ann-Kristin Achleitner, Mr. Kurt Wilhelm Bock, Clement B.

Booth, Mrs. Benita Ferrero-Waldner, Mrs. Ursula Gather, Mr. Gerd HÃ¤usler, Mrs. Renata
Jungo BrÃ¼ngger and Mr. Maximilian Zimmerer.
These ladies and gentleman, proposed for reelection, have given their previous work on
the Supervisory Board, become profound experts of our group and company and have
proven the last few years to be committed and competent Supervisory Board members.
Given their previous work, I'm sure you're all familiar with them and therefore I will not
introduce them to you individually. The new candidates are Mr. Nikolaus von Bomhard and
Mr. Karl-Heinz Streibich. Now, Mr. von Bomhard will, following the recommendation of the
nomination committee of the Supervisory Board will follow and will be for election to the
Supervisory Board. Furthermore, Mr. von Bomhard, in the case of his election, will also
succeed me as Chairman of the Supervisory Board, as I said, in case he will be reelected.
The significance of this function of the Supervisory Board Chairman is something I don't
think I have to go into detail here. I believe that in the close collaboration with that CEO
and monitoring and rising the managing board require deeper, profound knowledge of
the core business as well as executive capacities. I'm in full agreement with nomination
committee of the Supervisory -- and the Supervisory Board, that Mr. Nikolaus von
Bomhard, given his extensive expertise in all parts of the (value chain) of our complex
business model from both primary and reinsurance, knows what he's doing and his allaround recognized and highly appreciated personality and his many years of experience
as CEO of the Munich Re meets the requirements placed in this position and he would be
the best candidate to meet these requirements. I'm equally convinced that he will
manage to realize his role, also when it comes to collaborating with the CEO in the sense
of good corporate governance.
Mr. von Bomhard had been member of the Management Board from January 2000 until
April of 2017 and he chaired that board since January 2004. As an all known expert of the
industry, our (conserved) industry, I believe that his expertise and his knowledge will be of
vital importance and significance for his work on the Supervisory Board.
Furthermore, the nomination committee is also appointing Mr. Karl-Heinz Streibich, for the
first time, to sit as member of the Supervisory Board. From October 2003 until August
2018, Mr. Streibich was CEO of Software AG and amongst the many other functions he's
holding, he's also President of acatech, the German Academy of Engineering Science. He
is a proven expert in digitalization. And the significance of digitalization for the insurance
business is something I don't think we have to go through any detail here. Mr. Streibich is
thus a perfect addition for the work and for the Board of the Supervisory Board of Munich
Re. We are delighted to present in Dr. von Bomhard and Mr. Streibich, leading
representatives from the industry and field them for voting. And whose experience and
expertise will be of particular value for our group. In this context, allow me to also refer
you to the brochure you received when coming into this AGM. As you will find in the
invitation, it contains further information on those candidates up for election today as well
as the newly elected representatives from the employers' side. That much on agenda
item #5. Dear shareholders, the Management Board has also seen changes. Dr. JÃ¶rg
Schneider, following 18 years as member and working on the Management Board has,
following his completion of the 60th birthday, retired effective as of 31st of December
2018. Mr. Schneider was the longest-serving, responsible CFO. Yes, CFO, that means, yes
well, Chief Financial Officer, both in the German blue-chip companies, the DAX 30, as well

as among the German -- among the big European insurance companies. Allow me to use
this opportunity, dear Mr. Schneider, to thank you in person and also on behalf of the
Munich Re group and also, I believe, on behalf of our shareholders, for the work and
service you have provided to the group and our company.
I believe we all wish you all the best for your professional and private future. As successor
of Mr. Schneider as CFO, the Supervisory Board has appointed Dr. Christoph Jurecka.
Christoph Jurecka, following his degree in technical physics and his diploma at the
Technical University in Graz, started his career as scientist at the Technical University in
Braunschweig, where he also wrote his PhD, following these stations in finance and risk
management amongst others as CFO and CRO, the Chief Risk Officer with various
insurance companies in Germany and in Switzerland, he joined the management board of
the ERGO Group in 2011 and thus became a member of the Munich Re group. Since
January 2019, he signs responsible as CFO, following in the footsteps of Mr. Schneider,
with a brief for the group by controlling risk management, financial reporting, as well as
Investor Relations. Furthermore, a new Board of Management brief has been created in
order to centralize responsibility for our investment portfolio. To this end, the Supervisory
Board appointed Dr. Nicholas Gartside. And made him member of the management
board. Since the 18th of March of this year, he has been appointed as Chief Investment
Officer and thus is responsible for the asset management of the Munich Re Group.
Nicholas Gartside signs responsible or has signed responsible so for as International Chief
Investment Officer with an international bank in London where he held the global fixed
income and currency commodities position. So as it says, global fixed income, currency
and commodities, his professional career was started as fund manager for Fixed Income
in London, where he assumed afterwards the position of head of Global Fixed Income
with a big major British bank in London. Mr. Gartside, as you will hear from his name and
his, well, CV of British birth, he has a Bachelor of Arts from Durham University in History
and Politics and had a Master degree in International Relations from Cambridge University.
Allow me to move on to the further agenda items here of this AGM, first of all, agenda
item 1A. That is a submission of the report of the Supervisory Board, the corporate
governance report and the remuneration report for the financial year 2018. The group
financial report and the report of the Munich Re AG has been available since the
convocation of the AGM on the websites of the company. They contain all the relevant
information as required by the German Stock Corporation Act. During today's AGM, the
annual reports can be received in printed version from the information booths, the online
participating shareholders have these documents available on the web. The report for the
Supervisory Board can be found with all new detail in the group report 2018 on the Pages
9 to 15. The corporate governance report on the following Pages 16 to 21 and the
remuneration report on Pages 29 to 46.
In his report, the Supervisory Board has outlined the result of his annual financial
statement review and outlined it in due detail looking at the assignments and issues that
he had addressed in fiscal year 2019. Center of our consultation were amongst others,
the strategic focus of the company under various business divisions of the Munich Re and
the development of the operative business. On the basis of this report of reports also
submitted by the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board addressed and consulted key
issues in due detail, monitored the board, the executive board and supported him. In
addition, the extensive explanation in the group and report, allow me to just make a brief
comment on the remuneration report of the Executive Board. This remuneration report is

based on the new remuneration system that was approved on the AGM last year and
which found the approval of the large majority. This remuneration system is in line with the
social and Supervisory Board, stipulations including the German Corporate Governance
code. That's the remunerations made up a bubble of fixed success, independent as well
as performance dependent components as well as a corporate pension commitment.
The Supervisory Board has looked at its meeting of 19th March 2019, at the appraisal of
the annual bonus of 2019, as you may recall. What is important here is the IFRS group
result and we have an IFRS group result of EUR 2,275 million for fiscal year 2018, thus
(inaudible) on the basis of the stipulated linear scale thus stands at 96%. Regarding the
appraisal of the overall performance, thus the Supervisory Board on the basis of the
previously defined criteria has come to the result that neither any rebates or surcharges
on that target should be made. The multi-year bonus, that is, a bonus that's paid out over
multiple years, falling from the new remuneration system will be for the first time up for
appraisal in the year 2022 and it is based on the development of our total shareholder
return which is measured relative to our peer group. I can thus therefore tell you that this
year and well, my successor will have to save you and us from listing our percentage
points and percentage points for calculating how this multi-year bonus is calculated and
then also distributed.
Which brings me to agenda item 1B of today's AGM, that is the submission of the
adopted company financial statement, the approved consolidated financial statements,
the combined management report for Munich Re and the group for the fiscal year 2018,
the explanatory report on the information pursuant to Sections 289a, Clause 1 and 315a,
Clause 1 of the German commercial code. Aforementioned statements and reports as
well as the proposal of the Executive Board for the appropriation of retained earnings can
both be found in the annual report 2018 of the Munich Re AG for fiscal year 2018. These
annual reports are, as you know, available from the website of the company and also if
you wish, we'll send out to you in paper if you so asked. And as I said, are also available
here for perusal. Which brings me to agenda item #2 of today's agenda, that's the
resolution on the provision of the net retained profits for fiscal year 2018. Now, I propose
that we use the proposal submitted by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board,
namely, to take the balance sheet profit of the previous fiscal year 2018 of EUR
1,383,230,912.25 and to use it as follows: to pay a dividend of EUR 9.25 per share on each
no-par value share, that is, EUR 1,334,940,214.25 and to carry forward to new account EUR
48,290,698. On the agenda item #3, that's the resolution to approve the actions of the
Board of Management. Both Executive Board and the Supervisory Board propose to
approve the actions of the Executive Board for said term of fiscal year 2018. Agenda item
#4, that's the resolution to approve the actions of the Supervisory Board, we also
propose to approve said actions for the same period. Looking at agenda item #6, that is,
of course, something that had to do with the invitation of the AGM, that's the resolution to
amend Article 1, Clause 13 (sic) (Article 1, Clause 3) of the Articles of Association to render
the object of the company more modern and flexible, as it gives us more lever in our
business operations, which now means I can hand over and ask you, Mr. Wenning, to
submit your report on fiscal year 2018 together with an outlook on fiscal year 2019. Thank
you for your attention so far.

Shareholders, present and former colleagues, welcome to Munich Re's annual general
meeting, that I can say that it is a great pleasure that I report to you about the 2018 fiscal
year and Munich Re's strategic priorities for the coming years. But before I do, allow me to
say a few words, like Mr. Pischetsrieder announced the mandate of the supervisory
position is expiring, there are some members to the Supervisory Board who will no longer
be a candidate. As you know, in terms of the company law, that Pischetsrieder is not
supposed to assess the work of the respective Supervisory Board. But nevertheless the
Board of Management is supposed to give an opinion about the acts and the supervisor -the Management Board -- and on behalf of the Management Board, I would like to say all
members of the Supervisory Board that you have worked for the benefit of Munich Re,
you've assumed a lot of responsibilities and everyone assuming responsibilities always
knows that sometimes this is an encumbrance, is a burden. But I can say that you really
have done an excellent job with a lot of expertise and knowledge and with your hearts
and having said that, I'd like to thank you, on behalf of the Board of Management and on
behalf of all our shareholders, thank you.
In addition, I would also like to address you directly, Mr. Pischetsrieder. Since 2002, you've
been a member of this Supervisory Board and since 2013, you've been the Chairman of
the Supervisory Board. You have been leading this company in a very circumspect way and
in all these years, I can say that you really went all out for doing the best for this company
in good times and less good times and we know that there were ups and downs in the
history of this company. You always had the entire business and operations of this
company in your side and I personally too can say that you really helped this company.
And in February this year, the fund company, Union Investment, gave Munich Re top
ranking for corporate governance among the DAX 30 companies. Good corporate
governance will strengthen the investor confidence in our shares and I can say that you
really have had a very important and personal part in this. I can say that for me and for
others, it was always possible to reach you no matter which day it was, no matter which
hour it was, day or night. I don't think -- well, at night, I don't remember. But no matter
what we wanted to know from you, it was always possible to access you, to reach you on
the phone and in person, for me this is really remarkable. And during the ordinary
meetings, we can say that it was always possible to talk to you. You've always been very
serene but at the same time, you also have been a critical, a well meaning person, a
chairman with a lot of humor and you've always been an adviser. And you've always been
straightforward, always been frank and open in what you said and I know that there were
many situations in our talks that we always have seen parallels or analogies and you
compared the development with the experience you made in other companies of other
interested -- industries. I can say, Mr. Pischetsrieder, it really was a lot of fun to share your
experience. And in particular, I would like to say that there has always been a close
cooperation and trustworthy confidential cooperation over the last two years between
you and me. You gave me your trust and I would like to thank you personally, in particular,
in this respect. And this, on behalf of all our shareholders, of our employees as well as the
members of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board, I would like to thank you
for 17 years of being a role model for this company and having worked for the benefit of
this company. Thank you.
Ladies and gentleman, the year 2018 has been a good year for Munich Re. We have
generated a profit of EUR 2.3 billion, we have increased our profit, we reached our result
target and I can say that all parts of the group contributed to this outcome. ERGO is

picking up pace and ERGO has fulfilled the objective or the target for 2018, this refers
product sales, it is increased by 20% year-on-year and the new business has grown by
around 10% and in life, we can say that we now have a new attractive business -businesses or products and therefore the increase was 25% and the profitability, ERGO's
profitability has been increased in core countries; in Poland, the Baltic States, in Spain and
in Austria. And we can also say that ERGO also generated much higher premium income
in the growth markets of India and China and all of this together will sharpen ERGO's
competitive edge.
Talking about reinsurance, we can say that we really have written profitable new business
and we really have seen growth, considerable growth. In the life and health segments, we
posted a result that was considerably above expectations and this, in particular, due to
the very favorable claims development in the United States. We also posted good
earnings in property-casualty reinsurance and I think this is remarkable given that natural
catastrophe losses were high, particularly in the Fourth Quarter and not least -- just think
about it, not least because of the wildfires in California. But nevertheless, this segment
accounted for around half of our consolidated profit.

Bloomberg Transcript

And you know there's something else we should not neglect, we weathered the effects
of volatile capital markets in 2018 and we emerged strong. I can say that 90% of these
classes have lost in value but nevertheless, we were able to weather all this and in other
words, this means we delivered on our promises.
We can say that more than 41,000 employees were instrumental in making this happen.
Thanks to your great personal commitment and thanks to your outstanding work and I
would like to express my gratitude to you for this.
Shareholders, your company earned good money and so should you. We are going to
increase the dividend from EUR 8.60 to EUR 9.25 per share, provided you agree. Add to
that, that we are going to launch a new share buyback program with a volume of EUR 1
billion.
Under the share buyback program in 2006, which means in 14 business years up until
today, buyback and dividends, we returned to you more than EUR 27 million (sic) (EUR 27
billion). So just calculate it. This means EUR 2 billion every financial year. And I can say the
share in this company offers you good return and in comparison with the 8 reinsurance
and European primary insurance companies, we can say that in 2018 too, our earnings per
share means that we are really among the top companies. But not only that, you can also
be sure that in addition to the mere or pure financial aspects, you have invested in a
company that is Munich Re, which in the overall economic and social circumstances, makes
an important contribution. I can say, because in addition to the financial aspect, you can
really feel very comfortable having invested in such a company. Only by making risks
insurable, people will be ready and prepared to take on new challenges which are always
connected to special risks. This is our business. This will provide progress. And this will
create the wealth and well-being of which we all will benefit and of which we live or
survive. And of course, there are disasters and there are catastrophes which happen
sometimes. And I think all they show that -- or what the meaning and significance of our
company is, we mitigate the suffering and alleviate suffering. We show people what it
Page 7 of 12



FINAL

means to be insured. Catastrophes and disasters for our industry are the moment of
truth. You may put it like this. And just put yourself in the shoes of a householder whose
home has been destroyed by a hurricane, who has been evacuated and still does not
know how bad or how high the loss will be. Now, for this person, the help of an insurance
company becomes an inestimable good, if you like. And this is exactly what provide -deliver to our customers, primary and reinsurance, because at this point, we are going
and are using artificial intelligence. Immediately after a hurricane, aircraft are flying over
the affected area and region, algorithms are used to automatically calculate the damage
of buildings or 2 buildings, rather. And the results will then be made available to our
customers, the primary insurance companies. And they will be able to handle all these
claims properly. And this, often enough, before the affected owners have returned to the
damaged homes and get to know the damage. In this moment of truth, the insurers are
there to help their customers, either by making payments, providing services or repairing
damage. And this is where we are using artificial intelligence for the benefit of the insured
person.

Now, this is an offer which we make. And this is something which we are going to market
in the United States and selected countries in the Caribbean. Now, the potential you can
find in it. Well this is something which we heard from the -- from a pilot project which we
carried out when Hurricane Michael made landfall in Northwestern Florida last October.
I can say that within nine days after the disaster, 85,000 square kilometers of the affected
area had been photographed, scanned and analyzed. 85,000 square kilometers, this is
larger than Bavaria and it is almost the size of Austria. In respect -- with respect to over
40% of the building damage, we were able to contact the insurers before the
policyholders were even able to notify them. And in dozens of cases, the insurers were
able to rapidly compensate their customers for the insured damage to their buildings. But
this example shows and demonstrates the opportunities that digitalization offers. But it is
just one example among many.
In addition, I would like to address sustainability aspects as well. We include them in our
value creation in a very systematic way. Our commitment has been rewarded with top
ranking in the key external ratings. And there's a central mainstay or pillar here, this is our
climate strategy. We believe that greater leverage can be gained by driving forward new
technologies to achieve a low carbon economy in power generation, in transportation, in
energy storage, in industrial production. We offer insurance solutions for which we partially
bear the burden of these often unusual risks. We shoulder these risks. Two examples,
performance guarantees for photovoltaic systems and just recently, performance
guarantees for battery storage. And this means we once again extended the boundaries
of insurabilities and we are the trailblazers, the pioneers in this field. But that alone is not
enough to handle climate change. We are convinced that we need a monetary approach
in order to avoid the emission of greenhouse gases. In all sectors of the economy, there
should be a clear price to pay for emitting carbon dioxide and is across the board. We
hope that a suitable market mechanism is launched soon and that this market mechanism
can become a powerful driver for change and it doesn't matter whether this is a tax or
any other incentive. At the end of the day, they will have the same effect. But this means
that we have to maintain and preserve our competitiveness and also any other effects
across the society, particularly when you change or convert from fossil fuels to alternative

FINAL

fuels. This is something which has to be taken into account but all this will make it possible
to gradually have a successful switch to nonfossil fuels. The message in this room as an
insurance company and a reinsurance company, we are ready.
Ladies and gentleman, 2018 was not only a good year in terms of our result, it has also
been a year of reaching out for new horizons, setting off to new horizons. But it is all
about our development in the various segments and also in the group. I can say we have
focused on the markets and the performance there and implementing everything, this is
no (inaudible), it's really hard focused, disciplined work which we do. And the guidelines
which guide us are 3 strategic priorities: 1, we are going to drive digital transformation; we
are going to reduce complexity; and we are going to drive ambitious growth initiatives in
reinsurance and primary insurance. And by doing so, we will be able to increase Munich
Re's profits and in all these 3 strategic approaches, I can say that we really have made
progress in 2018 and surely, I would like to give you some more details: first, Munich Re is
becoming more digital; quicker, more flexible, more agile, if you like. When you have the
term, digitalization, this is a kind of a weasel word. And therefore, I want to be a bit more
specific. Focus on digital transformation. Here, I can say that we want to offer an answer to
specific needs, specific needs of our customers or sales partners are to be solved by us
and let me give you 3 specific examples: the first example refers to private customers like
you or me. Today, we expect offerings of services from insurance companies and we
expect them to be delivered to us personally but we also expect them to be offered and
delivered in digital form. I want to have some personal advice or maybe on the phone or
per video but I also want to get it online directly without any personal, say, interference,
intervention. Now, ERGO now has got -- has made good progress in this respect by
offering a personal database and this means they can now seamlessly connect all these
factors with its integrated customer database and at the same time, they are able to
handle losses and claims very quickly. Then, industrial customers. For industrial clients, we
offer solutions referring or in the context of the Internet of Things. Industrial clients, for
instance, want to increase the availability of their industrial facilities, increasing the number
of units they produce and improve the quality of their products and we want to support
these customers and do so bringing about their goals by offering connected
manufacturing. They want to launch products faster and together with (Qualcomm) and
the consulting company NHP, we would and will relieve them of the burden of having their
own manufacturing facilities and the catchword here is smart factory as a service. And
they can then focus on developing and producing new products and this means we can
reduce the production times by about a third. Small and medium businesses, they also
want to sell products and they can do so when they use the services of our company
relayr. They will help and it will help them to increase the machining times or the
production times and lower production down times. Then cyber. Companies and private
customers, please accept this, increasingly become victims of cybercrime, of data theft,
sabotage in the digital world. And even today, these losses occurring worldwide are
estimated to be around USD 600 billion and the trend is a rising one and therefore it is
even more important that we offer insurance coverage in this respect. But in addition,
services which range from preventive measures to the recovery of lost data after a cyber
attack up until restoring data lost or damaged. We offer all this and more. When it comes
to insurance cover and when it comes to related services, we are a leading supplier in this
field, having a 10% market share.

Well this is just one -- please be careful, just one person applauded. Thank you. Now,
digital transformation, which I've outlined with a few words and what it means to us is
tangible for us in many aspects. Let me single out a few exits. Here, we've got ERGO and
flexible there. I would like to mention the travel insurance possibilities using Alexa, I would
like to mention algorithms and their function-ability in relation to what they've been
conceived for. If you leave this room, then you will find a few booths or other stands
where you can get more information about this, I can only ask you, get a better picture of
what is possible in terms of digitalization.
There are many digital efforts and they promise a lot. We use digital revolution in order to
strengthen our competitiveness to maintain our position in the marketplace, extend it and
also generate new sources for revenue and income. We want to use the opportunities
and chances in the future, which occur due to the changes in the markets and in the minds
of people. Therefore, we had to look at the Articles of Association and want to adjust the
subject matter or the business model of our company to today's circumstances.
Shareholders, we have proposed a resolution and you are going to take a vote over this.
Now, 3 more priorities. Munich Re will become leaner. Over the last few years in
reinsurance and in the group, we reduced our efforts, the group is more focused now, it is
more efficient now. ERGO in Germany has saved over EUR 170 million in costs in Germany
and this means we or the company will be fully on track to cut our costs in Germany by
around EUR 280 million by 2020. And in addition, we are going to decrease our spending
by EUR 200 million by 2020. But we also streamlined our programs, our portfolios, we
had 17 international companies which we divested. And in reinsurance, we can say that we
sold 2 specialist companies in the United Kingdom and this allows us to focus on what is
strategically relevant. Now you may ask, what is the impact, the effect of all these
measures. To sum up, their impact is that we can do and generate more business with
less effort and these savings offer us latitude, offer us leeway to invest more in
digitalization and we can say that both these factors and aspects make us more
competitive; 3, Munich Re is to generate more money. Our revenue ambitions by 2020,
we want to increase our consolidated results compared with 2018 by another EUR 500
million to EUR 2.8 billion. Along the way, that is, to achieve this goal, we in -- visit a profit of
around $2.5 billion for 2019 of those $2.1 billion in reinsurance and EUR 400 million from
ERGO. Now, what is it we have to do in this respect. Well ERGO will continue to pursue the
successful path it has taken so far. The focus will continue to be on enforcing cost
discipline and sustainable profitable growth. We will have new products which will be
available online and offline and this means we will take into account the so called hybrid
customer. In addition, in the European core markets, ERGO will extend and expand its
already leading market position. ERGO will also make sure that it will grow in the emerging
markets in India and China. Reinsurance. Here, too, we want to make progress, we want
to increase profit. And of course, this is a matter of cost. In highly developed markets,
particularly in the United States, we would like to grow where our market share, over
there that is, cannot really be compared with the competitive position which we have in
the world. And of course, there's always presupposes that the possibilities to earn money
comply with our requirements or expectations and this also means and this is certainly not
anything that's new and this will happen during the forthcoming year. In these markets, we
are going to use and harness growth potentials in Asia and Latin America. It is our
objective too, to grow in the cyber market as well and this means in 2020, i.e. next year,
the entire cyber market will account for EUR 8 billion to EUR 9 billion, that is the premiums

that will be generated. Just recall our 10% market share or slightly more than 10%, this is a
market share which we are going to have. This means that we will have doubled our
underwritten business. But it is important for us and for you, it is important that you
remember we are going to grow but not at the expense of the profit. But no, we will not - as a consequence, we will not decrease our business opportunities in the respected
markets.
In addition. And that's new, our profitability in our investments will also be strengthened, it
is our goal. And to sum it up, to say, to generate high returns from our investments
without taking on more risks. Now to do so, MEAG must focus more strongly on managing
and specializing in the most important asset classes in our portfolio and using specialized
external providers for managing all other assets. Now, both areas require expertise and
these asset management responsibilities need to be overseen by one member of the
Board of Management and we therefore have our new Chief Investment Officer, Nicholas
Gartside, on our side -- on board, that is.
Shareholders, to sum up, Munich Re will become more digital, quicker and more flexible.
Munich Re is driving digital transformation, it will be getting leaner and it will earn more
money. And in view of the many challenges that lie ahead, we do not want to be a
scaremonger or scaremongering people and we also do not want to play things down,
you see, nor do we want to make any promises we cannot keep. We want to use today's
situation, we want to use this opportunity to explain why we are looking forward with
optimism and I hope this is something which we've shown you today. On behalf of my
colleagues on the Board of Management, I would like to thank you for your trust and I
hope that you will stay with us for the near future. Having said that, I'd like to thank you for
your attention. Thank you.

Well thank you very much, Mr. Wenning, first of all for your very friendly words you've
found for me. Thank you very much for that. I believe, shareholders, that Mr. Wenning was
quite elucidated in the way he managed to show the word innovation, which maybe to an
outsider, is something you would not initially, well, associate with reinsurance companies.
But for us it is a key element, it's a vital element for our current business and also for the
business of the future. So Mr. Wenning, to you. And also to the colleagues on the Board of
Management, I would like to express my gratitude and thanks for the many efforts and, of
course, I mean the Supervisory Board is fully aware of this, that you have put great effort
and I put great effect in this question of innovation and as you have pointed out, this
really, well, also means that it indicates what for years you have been looking at that you
want to go well beyond the pure insurance business and want to also use the expertise
out there for various aspects. So all the best to you, good luck to you, the board
members and the many associates and colleagues in the house and in the group that
have also helped to make the -- what's probably not an easy year, 2018, to turn it into the
success that it has become for all of us.
Those of you, the viewers who have been following the AGM on their, well, webcast, I'd
like to tell them that now the public part of the AGM and the public transmission will end
