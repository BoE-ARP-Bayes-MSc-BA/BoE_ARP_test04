{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody and welcome to AXA's Conference Call on our Activity
Indicators for the First Three Months of 2020. I'm pleased to welcome Etienne Bouas, our
Group CFO, who will be taking you through the highlights of the release covering both
the usual activity elements for the ﬁrst quarter and also the additional disclosures we
made in respect of COVID-19. At the end of his introductory remarks, Etienne will be
happy to take your questions.
Etienne, I hand over to you.

Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Thank you, Andrew. Hello and good morning to all. Thank you for joining the call. Starting
ﬁrst with the 1Q activity indicators. As you can see from yesterday's release, AXA
performed well in the ﬁrst quarter of 2020 recording strong revenue growth plus 4% at
the Group level, and importantly across all our business lines, preferred segments and
geographies.

FINAL

Let me go rapidly through some of the details. First, revenues in P&C increased by 3%,
supported by the 5% growth in commercial lines with price increases across the board.
Notably AXA XL grew by 8% with continued strong price increases for the quarter, plus
10% in insurance and plus 6% in reinsurance. We see price increases continuing into April.
Health revenues grew by 8%. All our countries contributing to this achievement.
Additionally, Life & Savings revenues increased by 4%, most notably from unit-linked and
protection products. Finally, our Asset Management segment recorded strong
performance with AXA IM revenues growing by 11% in the ﬁrst quarter, mostly supported
by net inﬂows and positive market impacts.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving now on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be resilient even in
the face of this volatile market conditions. Our Solvency II ratio was 182% at the end of
March, resilient and performing in line with our published sensitivities. Our debt gearing
is now below 28% on the pro forma basis, adjusting for the repayment of 1.3 billion sub
debt on April 16. You would have also noticed that both S&P and Fitch have reaﬃrmed
their ratings on AXA over the past weeks at AA minus with a stable outlook.
Let's speak now about COVID-19. The safety of our employees was, and remains our ﬁrst
priority, and they have been able to continuously work remotely, in order to provide
undisturbed services to our clients. As a responsible insurer, we have also taken several
exceptional measures to support our clients and the society at large. In France, for
example, AXA is the largest private contributor to the state solidarity fund. In France, we
have also given two months premium refunds for impacted SMEs and have extended
work stoppage insurance coverage for pregnant women and people with chronic disease.
We have as well in dedicated funds to help the medical staﬀ and to ﬁnance the research
against the virus.
As explained before, we grew strongly in the ﬁrst three months of the year. However, we
can expect COVID-19 to have a progressive impact on our revenue growth. We have seen
a decline of around 5% in March discrete on the like-for-like basis, and initial trends
indicate a decrease of around minus 12% in April. We can expect this impact to be more
pronounced in Life & Savings and to a lesser extent in P&C and in Health.
In terms of claims, we have seen limited amount of notiﬁcations in relation to COVID-19 at
the end of March. However, we do expect the conﬁnement measures enforced by the
diﬀerent countries to have a material impact on the level of claims for this year, most
notably in event cancellation and in business interruption. In event cancellation, a
preliminary estimate would be around mid triple-digit million euros, before tax and net of
reinsurance. For business interruption, it is too early to make an estimate at this point.
In terms of earnings. While it is too early to provide a guide -- precise guidance on the
diﬀerent impact, we believe that the overall eﬀect of COVID-19 taking into account
revenues, claims, expenses, ﬁnancial markets and the cost of exceptional solidarity
measures will have an overall material impact on the Group's earnings in 2020.

FINAL

In terms of assets, it is important to note that our asset portfolio remains of high-quality,
primarily composed of goviz [ph] rated AA on average and corporate bonds rated A on
average. As you can see in the additional disclosure in our press release, within our
corporate bond portfolio around 90% of our assets are rated at or above BBB with a
signiﬁcant share back in participating products. We also have limited exposure to the
most vulnerable sectors in the current context.
To conclude, the Group has performed well in the ﬁrst quarter with 4% growth in
revenues, supported by all business lines and preferred segments. Our balance sheet
remains resilient in the context of volatile market conditions. While it is too early to give a
precise guidance, we believe the impact of COVID-19 will be material for the Group's
earnings in 2020, as it's no doubt the case for the insurance sector as a whole. Looking
forward, we are conﬁdent in our strategy and its execution and the need for enhanced
insurance coverage in our preferred segments conﬁrmed our growth potential post-crisis.
I'm now ready to take your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

(Operator Instructions) We have our ﬁrst question from Mr. Peter Eliot from Kepler
Cheuvreux. Sir, the ﬂoor is yours.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. I had two on business interruption, please and one on Switzerland.
On business interruption, Etienne, I was just wondering, could you update us on your
view of the proportion of your policies that speciﬁcally exclude pandemic risk from the
terms and conditions. And also, you say it's too early to make an estimate of the claims
costs, but I'm just wondering if you can give us a little bit of comfort in terms of -- there is
ballpark, we're talking about in terms, if you know, is this an earnings event, yeah, I mean,
just comfort that this is an earnings event that you envisage rather than a potential
balance sheet event.
And then on Switzerland. Two years ago, I guess you essentially gave away some life
business to the local players. Now it seems, it's coming the other way. I mean I appreciate
that this is semi-autonomous business and doesn't have the market risk of the business
that has gone away from you. But I'm just still wondering if maybe you could add a few
words about why -- why you're a better owner of that business than the local players. So
yeah any -- any extra color there, would be very helpful? Thank you very much.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Thank you, Peter. So the vast majorities of contracts across the Group are not exposed to
COVID-19. And why, because as you all know BI coverage typically triggers in the case of
physical damage in the insured premises. And second, we apply ISO standards wordings
in most cases as well, and notably for our business sold in North America. So there are
Page 3 of 19



Company Name: AXA SA

Date: 2020-05-05

FINAL

some cases, where we may have exposures. It's by exception, and we have the following
cases, Where there is an explicit pandemic extension, ADT is the [ph] cases sometimes,
but really exceptions.
Second, where the policy wording is subject to interpretation, and this is being reviewed
on a case-by-case basis. And third, and this is the most frequent case, when in some
jurisdictions, industry wide solutions and concessions are made. This is the case for
instance in Germany for coﬀees, restaurants, hotels. This is going to be the case maybe in
Switzerland, also sometimes in the UK further to the positions taken by Ombudsman. So
industry wide solutions. So therefore, I can conﬁrm to you that it's an earnings impact and
not a balance sheet impact.
Regarding Switzerland, what happens is that actually in the Q1, you saw that the -- this
business -- the semi-autonomous business is growing. Because some of our competitors
changing their conditions in their traditional business are losing their customers, who are
very happy to ﬁnd alternative solutions like the solutions we're providing in Switzerland.
And this is what this business in Q1 delivered very well.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

Thank you, sir. Next question is from Mr. Andrew Sinclair from Bank of America. Sir, please
go ahead.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 21847791 <GO>}

Thanks and good morning, everyone. Three from me as well, if that's okay. Firstly, it was
just on travel. Just wondered if you could give us any more context on travel claims, which
I'd assume would mostly be front-loaded so far -- we've seen so far there. Secondly, on
the bank cancellation, thanks for giving that guidance, which I see is for mostly in the next
6 months to 12 months. How much exposure do you have beyond that? For example, let's
say Olympics was canceled next year after its postponement could have an impact -other big events scheduled next year, et cetera.
And third one from me is, you've got three good sized disposals are meant to be
completing this year, and AXA Life Europe is still not completing again, possibly missing
another guidance for completion date. Just could you give us an idea of -- do you still
expect these three deals to complete when and will there be any adjustments to the
price? Thanks.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

So I start with the third one, which is relatively simple. The two transactions, you're
referring to are AXA Bank Belgium and the CEE disposals. This processes, ﬁrst there is
absolutely no discussion about the price. So no worry to have on this point. Second, the
process is going on in a completely normal way. It's just then a question of execution of
Page 4 of 19



Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity
Date: 2020-05-05

FINAL

the deal, which might from time-to-time be postponed by one month, two months, three
months. So it's purely a question of months and not a question of price or a question of
any kind of other possible questions like competition or whatever.
So we're very conﬁdent that these transactions will be closed. I cannot guarantee you that
the timing will be in Q3 or Q4 or -- if there is a delay, it might be January more than
December. This we don't know. But at least one of the two should close this year. And the
second one at this stage is scheduled for Q4. So conﬁdence on these two transactions.
Regarding travel, this is a business with less than EUR1 billion GWP more, I would say mid
triple-digit as we say, most of which is realized by our Assistance business, which is a
service like business. So we have an impact. But I would say that it's not the biggest hit
we'll have.
Regarding events cancellation. What we have done is that, based on our -- what we see,
the assumptions we've taken is that there would be a loss of 70% of our exposure for -from March to September, and from September to March 21, we have taken 25%. So this is
the way we did it. So it gives you an idea of our total exposure with (inaudible). But this is
the assumption we have taken.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 21847791 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Right. And sorry, just -- just for -- you're saying that the context of travel claims not the
biggest hit you'll have. I mean it's -- are you talking triple-digit millions, are we talking
double-digit millions, any context around that?

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Look, if it was mid triple-digit, we would have said it. So it's much less.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 21847791 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

Operator
Thank you, sir. Next question is from Mr. John Hocking from Morgan Stanley. Sir, please
go ahead.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. I've got three questions, please. On the property covers that
AXA XL writes in the US, which might include BIs. I wondered whether those are written
on the standard ISO wording or whether there is sort of separate wording, give us some
excess and surplus business.
Secondly in XL's reinsurance book, is there any trade -- really trade credit exposure.

Page 5 of 19



Company Name: AXA SA

Date: 2020-05-05

And then ﬁnally, just looking at the sort of rate environment in the commercial wholesale
business from your comments and others this morning, it does seem that there is quite a
good rate hardening stories. Is there any appetite to change the Group capital allocations
and try to take advantage of that? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

So starting with the third one. You're right to say that on the commercial lines, the prices
are going up. And this is what we expected when we released our numbers on the 20th
of February. This is what we said. And it's very true notably in North America. And I must
confess that -- we're -- in terms of price increases above our expectations, right now. And
this gives me the opportunity to say that, excluding COVID-19, XL's business is well on
track with our expectations.
So regarding capital allocation. I mean there is no -- there is no problem to grow at the
moment. There is not a capital shortage in the businesses, which want to beneﬁt from this
price hardening. Let's put it that way.

Bloomberg Transcript

Your ﬁrst question related to the property, so the BI coverage in the US. I think so -- your
question was, is all your business ISO -- with ISO wording. And to my knowledge in the
very vast -- the vast, vast majority of the cases, it is ISO. So the US, the only question is, at
the moment is will there be a political move or regulatory move to force anybody to pay
more than what is contractually stated. And this threat has been existing for the last six
weeks, I would say, with ups and downs. But we're pretty conﬁdent that it will not go
through because it's -- it would be anti-constitutional. So at this stage we're pretty
conﬁdent for the US business.
And your second question was (Multiple Speakers)

A - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Maybe, John, could you rephrase your second question. Yeah.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

The second question because I wonder whether you -- sorry, Andrew. I just wonder,
whether you've got any trade credit exposure and the reinsurance book at XL because
you don't seem to -- you haven't mentioned it and in the release. So I'd like -- I'd say
(inaudible) might appear.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

So there is some exposure on the reinsurance of trade credit. I will not give you any
number in terms of claims because today we have no claims. However, it's an assumption.
The GWP to give you an idea $300 million [ph].

Operator
Thank you, sir. Next question is from Mr. Farooq Hanif from Credit Suisse. Sir, please go
ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, everybody. I hope -- I hope everything is going well. Just a few questions. You've been
kind enough to give some GWP numbers. Can you give a BI GWP number or proportion
of premiums. In terms of motor claims frequency, some companies have had early data on
lower loss ratio. Can you give us an idea of how much kind of frequency has gone down,
and to what extent your refunds will be applied for the months of frequency has gone
down.
And then a bit more comment, please on expense reduction. So I think that you've talked
about measures that you could take. Now some of this of course will be because of lower
acquisition costs. But what are the measures, can you take to oﬀset some of the earnings
impact. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

So ﬁrst question relating to the BI numbers. I answered in the ﬁrst part of this session with
-- what I can say. So it's an earnings impact, it's not a balance sheet impact. And giving
GWP numbers will not be, I think a good indication for what you're looking for.
So the second question is motor claims frequency. What we observed across the -depending upon the countries, our frequency during the conﬁnement [ph] periods down
between minus 40% and minus 80%. So potential reforms. It's diﬃcult to tell you. At this
stage, we don't refund the premiums for two reasons.
First, our priority is to support our customers, who are really in trouble ﬁnancially or from a
health point of view. So we're dedicating all our eﬀorts on this population -- of this
segment of clients. It can be physical person. I refer to the people with chronic disease,
pregnant women, but also it can be SMEs or very small enterprise. Second, the year is not
ﬁnished. So in the loss ratio for motor, you see obviously that we anticipate Q2 to be
excellent in terms of loss ratio. However, there is also Q3 and Q4.
So let's see how the customers will behave because they might use less public
transportation. The oil prices will be relatively low and all of this -- should be looked at on
medium term basis and not very short term. So some mutual companies have started to
refund. It's -- at this stage, not the majority. And we're very keen to look at the overall
balance of our P&L before refunding retail clients after just one or two months of pretty
good expense.

Page 7 of 19



Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity
Date: 2020-05-05

Expense reduction. You're right to say that acquisition costs are reduced. So what we're
looking at is actually our expense ratio overall, which means that we have to tackle part of
our ﬁxed cost. And obviously, we're reducing a lot of general expenses and reducing as
well our investments.

FINAL

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Do you think -- sorry, if I may come back. Do you think that will be -- I mean, obviously do
you think that could be quite signiﬁcant. So you have the tools to oﬀset a lot of the claims,
no revenue reduction.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

No, when I am speaking about expense ratio, I'm referring expenses related to revenues.
You cannot oﬀset with cost with the higher claims. I mean it's disproportionate.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

But I mean, what I'm saying is, I guess to make it clearer. Do you think you can maintain
expense ratios or do you think there will be a spike, but you're trying to limit the spike.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

So it's very much depends on -- you know, the forecast for the revenue decrease. So far
what I'm just telling you is that the objective we have set to our entities is to manage at
expense ratio. So in some cases, they will do a bit better and some of the cases a bit -they will not make it. It very much depends on your business mix, various countries, the
competition pressure, a lot of things.
So in the countries, where you have major drop in revenues, it would be more diﬃcult,
and some of those it -- it will be moderate. It would be easier. So it's more -- I'm giving
here you the idea, how we manage during the crisis. We (inaudible) out expense ratio and
we do the best to try to maintain it.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you, sir. Next question is from Mr. James Shuck from Citi. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Thanks and good morning, everybody. Three questions from me, please. Firstly, the life
investment margin, I think Ambition 2020, you had a plan between 55 basis points to 65
basis points from the life investment margin with 65 bps in 2019. Can you just comment
on the outlook for that margin, whether you're [ph] still conﬁdent you can reach that
interest. And then how much really you got in terms of policyholder sharing versus the
minimum levels, please.
Page 8 of 19



Company Name: AXA SA

Date: 2020-05-05

FINAL

Secondly, could you just provide an update in terms of Q1 nat cat and large losses at XL.
And how is the underlying performance of that business so far year-to-date?
And my ﬁnal question, just around on the health side of things, please. Presumably with
people being followed and with medical practitioners being reallocated to diﬀerent
places, that's going to lead to a spike in health costs in time. If you could just shed a little
bit of light over how to think about that vision in the current environment, please? Thank
you.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

So ﬁrst, the investment margin. You're right will be a bit lower. Why because the dividend
yield from equity -- private equity, even real estate will be lower. It will not be -- it will not
impact. We're not touching the guarantee level. So -- if you look at the -- really what we
make the diﬀerence this year investment margin doesn't come as you know, the main
driver. We didn't refer to it in our press release. We referred more to the fees earned on
equity positions whether through AXA IM or through our unit-linked business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second nat cat losses. I think we're in line with our budget. So it's -- there were some nat
cats in Australia and in the South of the United States in Q1. Nothing really special in April.
So we're pretty in line with our budget.
And lastly on the health side. Today, we don't see an increase in claims partly because
people don't go to the hospital or to the doctors. So it's a little bit like the motor business.
In some places people don't use their -- or don't go to this -- don't spend on the health
side because they are scared to go to public spaces, and because they can -- they are
consigned. So this is what's happening on the short term. And there might be a spike in
health cost in -- maybe in Q3. But overall, we don't see -- we don't expect a major
deterioration.
And the last point is the mortality. We ﬂagged -- when the crisis started the risk we had on
the mortality, which was to say for around 1 million deaths in the world. We could have an
impact of EUR100 million net after tax for us. We're still away from this number. However,
at this stage we have not seen -- we have not observed any deviation in our mortality rate
on our clients.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Okay. If I could just return quickly to XL, just the underlying performance in Q1, and what
your reserve experience has been year-to-date, please.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

So I told you before that XL excluding COVID-19 eﬀect was in line with our expectation. So
which means that it's true for the nat cat, it's true for the large claims. So it's across the
board.

Operator
Thank you, sir. Next question is from Mr. Nick Holmes from Societe Generale. Sir, please
go ahead.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Hi, Etienne. Couple of questions, please. Firstly, can you update us on discussions about
your dividend with the ACPR?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then second question is sort of looking at COVID more widely and coming back on
some of the questions, you've had, what -- what would you say as your biggest worry. Is it
actually top line revenue or is it claims, which one sort of in your management discussions
you're most concerned about? Thank you.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

So on the dividend. Of course, I'm not going to tell you today, what will be the ultimate
decision. But I can give you some element of context, in case you don't know -- you don't
know it. The Board had made a proposal for the Annual General Assembly to pay EUR1.43
per share, which means 7% increase in dividend. Afterwards, there was -- I would say an
information published by the (inaudible), but most importantly for us by the ACPR urging
French insurance companies not to pay dividends, before October at least.
So we decided to postpone the General Assembly in order to take the time to understand
exactly the position of the ACPR and to have a chance to dialog -- to have a dialog with
them. So this is what's happening, and you'll know more in the upcoming weeks because
the decision will be -- the new proposal is it's new -- will be made in May.
Regarding the COVID-19, I'll not answer precisely this question, because you're trying to
assess and to put the number on the one aspect or the other. I can say that it's still a bit
early. I would say that top line of proﬁtable business, it's very costly. So I would say, the
top line in life doesn't worry me too much. Because especially if you look at 2020
because the ﬁrst year is not where you get the most, the biggest proﬁtability because it's
a -- their construction of long term business -- a long-term business.
In terms of P&C, it can be very costly, if there is a severe drop in revenues. And of course
claims, I'll not comment. So I'll not make this comparison. But I'm sure you have already
Page 10 of 19



Company Name: AXA SA

Date: 2020-05-05

an idea of what's more costly.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

FINAL

Sorry, I'm just coming back very, very quickly. So to reiterate on dividend. Is it correct that
your clear intention and wish is to pay your 2019 dividend. Do you think you have the
ﬁnancial ability to do so?

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Sorry, if I was not clear. The liquidity, the solvency and the proﬁtability of last year's allow
us to pay this dividend. And this was based on -- all of this that we made this proposal to
the General Assembly. So the only thing, which was new for us was the statement of the
ACPR, so the French regulator.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Yes, that's very clear. Thank you very much, Etienne.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Thank you, Nick.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, sir. Next question is from Mr. William Hawkins from KBW. Sir, go ahead.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hello, thank you very much. On business interruption, I appreciate you don't know an
absolute number yet. But could you comment a little bit on what you're thinking about the
mix of the claims that you're seeing with regards to the three areas that you talked about
right at the beginning. So what you're seeing in some of geographic mix in terms of US
versus non-US. And what you're seeing in terms of your carrier exposure in terms of XL
versus the rest of the group. I'd be interested to get some of that ﬁeld? Thank you.
And then secondly, a couple of months ago, I think actually you used to talk about 100
and 200 year pandemic hit of EUR1 billion. We've learned a lot about pandemic
(inaudible) what we need three months ago. So I'm just wondering to what extent do you
think your original models were valid. And without going into too much detail if they're
not valid, what you're learning?
And then lastly, on the solidarity measures, you gave the -- the good examples in France.
Is there any way that you can put just a global number on what you think is the cost of the
solidarity measures to you at the moment, please. Thank you.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

So as usual, I'll start with the third one. It's diﬃcult to know as well because the solidarity
measures have started, but it's not yet ﬁnished. You see that as long as the conﬁnement is
Page 11 of 19



Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity
Date: 2020-05-05

there, there are still a lot of discussions and people in need for support. So I can tell you
that group-wide, it's a few hundred million euros.

FINAL

And then, let's be careful because we're not always clear between what is solidarity -sometime solidarity measures, and what is BI, if you see what I mean. Because sometimes
we're in between.
Regarding the pandemic hit, and the original models, it's true that we're realizing that the
pandemic hit, it's not just a spike in mortality rate. It's much more than this. And therefore,
I would say that the original models from this point of view have to be reviewed. And as
we just discussed the mortality, the cost of the mortality even if it's million of death is not
what hits us the most. It's the resulting systemic risk and related to -- I would say, the drop
in GDP and the risk related to events cancellation, to business interruption and so on, on
the one side. And the ﬁnancial implications on the other side, on the asset side. So -- so it
has to be reviewed clearly.
And when you discuss with the actuaries here, this is clearly on their agenda. This is
something, which will be reviewed this year for that models.

Bloomberg Transcript

Related to BI. I will -- so BI, it's not XL or not XL. It's across the board for all commercial
lines, right. It's a commercial lines issue. I told you that there were a lot of discussions in
Switzerland, in Germany, in the UK, in the US. So it's across the board. It's overall. So I'll
not give you the split.
And in terms of US, non-US, my guess is that it might be a bit more costly on the non-US
part. But it's still early, too early, because if you look -- if you speak with our US colleagues
so that -- not colleagues, but our US peers, they will tell you that they see the risk also in
the US. So it's -- really, I don't want to answer not because I don't want to give you the
numbers, but because it's really too early. And I don't want to make any commitments. It's
too early, really.
So we'll know more quarter-by-quarter and every time we have an information, which we
think is reliable and which is sensible, we'll provide it to you. But today, we went beyond
the revenue indicators because we knew that there was a need for information. But we're
a little bit at the limit of what we can tell today.

Thank you, sir. Next question is from Mr. Andrew Crean [ph] from Autonomous. Sir, please
go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

All right. Good morning all. Can I ask three questions. Firstly, could you give us a bit more
detail on social inﬂation in the US. So I know -- it was -- you're in a sort of discovery period
in the fourth quarter, as to just don't know how much it was accelerating. Can you talk a
little bit more detail in the ﬁrst quarter's to whether that settle down, and that you'll
comment about that this year -- issue.
Secondly, you gave at the full year, your schedule of debt redemptions, which could be
between 6 points and 9 points hit solvency. Are you in a position now to say which end of
that scale is going to be?
And then thirdly, Solvency II. Firstly, could you give us an update from March as to where
the coverage is. And also whether the sensitivities you've given historically still hold or
whether you've been hedging heftily in the recent period, and therefore, your downside
sensitivities maybe slightly less?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

So regarding the social inﬂation, I would say that we've not observed any -- any new
information, any changes in Q1. So we just -- so the price is going up. But the claims, no
new information, I would say. Nothing that changes the view we gave you on the 20th of
February. Second, the debt reimbursement. Your question was -- what kind of impact on
Solvency II. Is that correct.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

No. I think you said it would hit Solvency II by between 6 points and 9 points this year.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

And I was wondering with your current plans, whether it's more likely to be 6 or 9.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Okay. So the debt we have reimbursed, the EUR1.3 billion has an impact of minus 4
points. So if you want to say -- to know if it's minus 6 or minus 9, I would bet for minus 6
rather than minus 9.

Thanks.

FINAL

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

And your question related to the Solvency II number. At the end of March, which was
182%. I would say end of April, the main event is certainly the debt reimbursement. So on
a pro forma basis, if you start from 182%, you could reduce by 4 points -- four [ph]
percentage points

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Was that better market?

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Yeah. All the -- the other elements, I would say are not material.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

And the downside sensitivities still work?

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Excuse me.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Did the downside sensitivity -- have you hedged the balance sheet more -- more heftily
since the year-end?

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Sorry, no. No change on the hedging. No change in the hedging, and maybe because
we're speaking on Solvency II, I said, you know in the previous response -- answering to
the previous questions that our actuaries are looking at traditional models, which is true,
but with no impact on the Solvency II model. It's too early stage.

Operator
Thank you, sir. Next question is from Mr. Ashik Musaddi from JPMorgan. Sir, please go
ahead.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, and good morning, Etienne. Just few questions all on capital. First one,
again, sorry, going back to Solvency II. I mean currently your Solvency II ratio is about
182%, and you have redeemed some debt. I mean what gives you conﬁdence on this
ratio, given that credit market continue to remain volatile, interest rates have started going
down again. And if I remember your hurdle is 170% to 220%. So I mean, you're not really
far away from your hurdle rate. So what gives you enough conﬁdence that the solvency
capital needs is okay, yeah, from a 6 months to 12 months due. That's number one.

FINAL

Secondly is can you give us some clarity on how the local subs capital is at the moment. Is
there any breaches in those local subs, which could impact the cash remittances from the
subsidiaries based on the current due?
And lastly, the new sensitivity you have provided on credit rating downgrade, it's pretty
interesting because it's only 6 points for 20% of your portfolio getting downgraded,
which is like a big portfolio getting downgraded by one full letter, and it only impact by
six percentage point. Can you give some clarity as to how that works. Any -- any thoughts
on that would be helpful? Thank you.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

So the -- ﬁrst of all the solvency ratio is the number you know, and then -- you have all the
sensitivities to ﬁgure out what it could be, under which circumstances. So here I'm not
going to provide you with our estimate of what it will be. So -- and just to be more precise
at the end of April, when we said you can reduce by four percentage points. The main
reason is that the lower rates were oﬀset by narrower [ph] spread since March. So all of
this is moving.

Bloomberg Transcript

The other point, which is important in my view is that the 170%, even if we were to reach it,
would have no consequences. So you know that we have diﬀerent targets. We have 170,
but we have also 140. And the regulators has 100. So don't overestimate. You know, the
fact that would be at 171 or 169 or 165. I'm not sure it will have an impact in the short term.
The second point is, we have no breach, I would say at the local subsidiary -- local entity
level. And the -- I can tell you that in the current environment, the fungibility continues to
work within the Group. And that our liquidity position as a result is strong at the holding
level.
And then your -- the new sensitivities, we have provided of minus 6 points. I would say
that the -- when you're -- the high rated -- the highly rated part of the portfolio, when it
goes one letter down, it doesn't cost us that much. So it's more at the bottom. And at the
bottom, our exposure is pretty limited. So this explains why the minus 6 points might see - might look limited to you at this stage.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

That's very clear. Thanks a lot.

Thank you, sir. Next question is from Mr. Michael Huttner [ph] from Berenberg. Sir, go
ahead.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Hi, Etienne, and I had three questions. One -- it is really ten trick
[ph] questions, you'll love them. On debt gearing, you said below 28% pro forma. And I

Page 15 of 19



Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity
Date: 2020-05-05

always wonder, what this pro forma mean, what am I supposed to think here. I just
wondered if you could give us a kind of a ballpark ﬁgure of what an actual ﬁgure would
be.

FINAL

The second is you have this really interesting comment about solidarity eﬀort and there is
an overlap with business interruption. I just wondered, where you're going to book these
solidarity eﬀort. I don't understand what they could be.
The third question is on the -- you gave some positives in the press release, which was on
investment income, where you gained in adjusted earnings and net income of 200 million
and 300 million. Can you -- why did you give those ﬁgures, is it because you think they
are sustainable through the year? Or is it just to give us a kind of a breath of fresh air. I
doesn't quite understand because (inaudible) from them I'm kind of thinking, oh my gosh,
is there a positive here, which we're missing.
And then the last one, the -- I struggle a little bit with the press release as a whole because
there is ﬁgure for event cancellation, but no ﬁgure for business interruption, and that
seem to be the -- the really big one, which is kind of the elephants in the room. And so far,
I haven't -- I haven't gained much -- much clarity on that. Anyway, sorry, too many
questions, and I hope you can help me out.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Don't worry, Michael, they are clear questions. So the pro forma on the debt gearing, it's
just that if you don't -- if you take the balance sheet at the end of '19 and you reduce your
debt by EUR1.3 billion, you come to the number we have indicated. That doesn't mean
anything else than that. So it's a very, very basic calculation, just to give you a ﬂare, an
idea.
Second, the solidarity eﬀorts. You wonder how we will book them. Most of them will be
booked under underlying earnings. There might be -- there might be one or two
exceptions. If you know we are -- like in France, we're just wondering if the -- the amount,
which has been paid because it's not deducible [ph] and because you know it was -- there
was no choice basically could be considered as an exceptional items, but it's more the
exception. So I would say the majority of these impacts should be in the underlying
earnings.
Third, your question is don't make it too complicated. We gave these numbers ﬁrst
because we knew that the question would come. And because we have the numbers, we
know this information. So because we know it's tricky calculation. We gave it to you. Not
to give fresh air because we do not know when we decided that we would deliver this
information, what would be at the end of the day, the impact. And so it's just clarity. We
don't see anything else than this. And we don't expect you to take -- to take that as a
good news or the bad news. It's clarity and information and make the best use out of it.
But it's more to help you.
Lastly, I understand that you would like to know more about business interruption, but
please understand that the nature of the claims is much easier to grasp -- to get on --Page 16 of 19

FINAL

there is very short term risk on events cancellation because it was immediate. We had
information much earlier than on the business interruption. So if you -- if you think for the
next time, we should not give any numbers related to know -- related to us to know. But
event cancellation, we know much more. So that's it. It's nature of the claims, which makes
it easier.

Q - Michael Huttner

Operator
Thank you, sir. Next question is from Mr. Thomas Fossard from HSBC. Sir, please go
ahead.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good morning, Etienne. I have got two or three questions. The ﬁrst one would be
related to the recessionary impact on your top line development actually you're providing
some numbers for March and April and you're highlighting that the Life & Health
businesses was signiﬁcantly impacted. I was wondering why (inaudible) because I was
expecting your business to be more on regular premiums and single premiums. So
maybe you can help us to understand why the Life & Health revenues are, I would say
more impacted.
Second question related to this is, on the P&C side. Could you maybe touch upon the part
of your P&C revenues, may be more in the commercial lines, which you believe is
recessionary exposed or sensitive.
And the -- so the next question will be related to the Life & Health reserves. Are you
seeing, I would say early sign that the policyholders are changing a bit in terms of
behaviors, and you're seeing some, I would say some temptation to surrender the polices
at the present time? Thank you.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

So I start with the third question. You have seen that the net inﬂow are -- don't signal the
change in behaviors. And in terms of -- retention -- at the end of March, the numbers were
pretty stable. They were up of course in the P&C business, but in savings business or in
Life & Health business, no change in behavior.
Second, in terms of top line trend, I would say that the Life business is by far the most hit
business because you have the single premium in savings, which have a huge impact. So
it's particularly true in -- in the -- in France, Italy and Spain. And so the drop is in the area
of minus 20%. So it's clear. But it's really this eﬀect of accounting, right. It would be
encountered diﬀerently in terms of pure income impact, it's much less than that.

FINAL

P&C is the second business, which is hit with a negative trend in April between minus 5
and minus 10, depending upon the country. Italy there also -- France and Italy are the
most hit countries, and Health is very, very resilient. So I wouldn't put Life with Health in
this context.
And for the P&C, of course, the GDP drop will have an impact on the top line because
some premiums are indexed on the level of activity. So we'll see, but it will have an impact
on the commercial lines. So you'll have some positives on the hardening of the prices and
some negatives linked to let's -- let's call it GDP.

Operator
Thank you, sir. We have no other questions. (Operator Instructions) We have another
question from Mr. Michael Huttner. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Sorry about that. Hi, thank you. The -- I think on -- at the beginning, there was a question
on AXA Life Europe, and I just wondered if you -- if you could say a little bit more on that.
And then I'm going to press a little bit just on the (inaudible) sorry the -- is it down or up
from the 27.5. I'll put it in another way, if you want to redeem any more debt, would you
actually -- would you hit your 25% to 28% target by the end of the year? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

So AXA Life Europe, so you're referring to the disposals and sorry, if I misunderstood the
question. I was -- I answer -- I thought that the question was related to the two transactions
announced [ph] this year. AXA Life Europe is transaction, which has been announced in
2018 -- at the end of 2018 and which is still under discussion, given its complexity, so the
buyer and the seller always motivated to make the transaction. But the discussions with
the regulator, but that will be 9.5 hour complex long lasting, and this is the only thing I can
tell you on this.
On your question, Michael, your second question related to the debt gearing. Can you
precise a little bit more, what -- what do you mean that?

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

I'm worried because you didn't answer it well, that's why I asked for the ﬁrst time once
again gosh, am I missed something. So you said pro forma 27.5 or 28, whatever the ﬁgure
is, but insisting on pro forma when the world has changed so much, I'm kind of thinking -what is the ﬁgure now. And so, another way of asking it instead of saying well, can you
give us a ﬁgure now, maybe you don't have it, I don't know is if you were not to redeem
any more debt beyond the 1.3 billion, where you have done, would you at the end of the
year still be in your 25% to 28% target range. That was all. Thank you.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}
Page 18 of 19



Company Name: AXA SA

Okay, which is another way to ask, what will be our earnings this year. So -- and then this
one, I will not answer. Because the gearing, it's not only the question of debt, it's also the
question of retained earnings. The OCI does not play a role, and therefore I'll not answer
this question, Michael.
