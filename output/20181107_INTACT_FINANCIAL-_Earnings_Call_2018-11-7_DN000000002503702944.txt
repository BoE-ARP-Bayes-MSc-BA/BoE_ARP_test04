Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Yesterday
evening, we announced third quarter net operating income of a $1.62 per share driven by
solid underwriting performance in both Canada and the U.S. and strong net investment
income. Robust top line growth of 23% was driven by the addition of OneBeacon and
strong organic growth of close to 6% in commercial lines across North America.

Bloomberg Transcript

The overall IFC combined ratio was solid at 93.8. The Canadian performance at 93.9
reﬂects signiﬁcant improvements in personal auto and strong results in personal property.
This was hampered by elevated CATs and large losses in Canadian commercial. In the
U.S., the OneBeacon team delivered another solid quarter with a combined ratio of 93.5.
When we compare ourselves to the industry and the end of the second quarter, our
advantage widened further as expected. We outperformed by 740 basis points on ROE,
well above our target of 500 basis points. However, we remain unsatisﬁed with a 12%
operating ROE. We're focused and committed to the actions necessary to return ROE to
the mid teens in the coming year.
Let's look at our results by line of business, starting with Canada. In auto, as anticipated,
the portfolio shrunk, as our rate increases remain ahead of the market. However, our
actions continue to drive bottom line beneﬁts. The combined ratio at 99 was higher than
expected, but improved over 6 points compared to last year, driven by stronger
underlying performance. The main variation from expectations arose from 1.9 points of
unfavorable prior year claims development, still largely isolated to pre-reform accident
beneﬁts in Ontario.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, the run rate combined ratio is also improving to
approximately 96% at the end of Q3. Our action plan including rates, risk selection and
claims are delivering results. Both claims frequency and severity are lower again this
quarter. Our work continues and we're well on track towards our goal of the mid 90s run
rate.
In personal property. Premiums grew by 2%. While rates are up. Our actions in auto are
putting pressure on growth. The combined ratio is excellent at a mid-80s level, partly
aided by a modest level of CATs in the quarter. Our strategies over time proven to be

FINAL

quite successful and this line of business is now running at a sustainable low 90s or better
combined ratio.
Looking at commercial lines in Canada, topline momentum in both regular and specialty
drove growth to 8% in the quarter. The combined ratio was higher than expected both in
the quarter and year to date due to elevated CAT and large losses. While, we're
monitoring closely we remain conﬁdent that the underlying fundamentals of this business
position it for the low 90s performance.
Turning to results for our U.S. commercial segment, premiums of 469 million bolstered
IFCs topline growth meaningfully. On an organic basis, growth increase to 5% and this
included low double digit growth in the segments, we're focusing on for expansion.
Segments with proﬁtability plans declined as expected. The combined ratio of 93.5
represents a third sequential improvement since closing. While we can expect some
lumpiness in quarterly results over time, we're pleased with this progress as we work
towards a sustainable low 90s performance.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's now look at the outlook across our businesses, now that the marketplace continues
to tighten with increasing rates, capacity constraints and ongoing growth in the residual
markets. This environment in our view supports our proﬁtability improvement plan. Our
competitive position is improving and we expect the return to growth in the coming year.
In personal property, the outlook remains favorable. The industry grew north of 6% in the
ﬁrst half of 2013 and we expect mid-single digit growth over the next 12 months. As
growth in auto improves, we expect property growth to accelerate.
In commercial, in Canada we expect -single digit growth for the industry in the coming
year. With our loss ratio outperforming, our performance running well above 10%. We're
positioned to take advantage of the ﬁrming environment and we expect our growth
momentum to continue.
In U.S. specialty market conditions are evolving better than anticipated with modest
upward pricing trends continuing. Overall we expect low to mid-single digit growth for
the U.S. specialty industry over the next 12 months. The OneBeacon team is only just
beginning to capture the upside beneﬁts from broadening product distribution.
Opportunities in proﬁtable segments position us well to outperform the U.S. industry
growth in the coming year.
Turning to strategy we're investing to lead in digital engagement and artiﬁcial
intelligence. Two key levers in our strategy. In August we added our newest Telematics
oﬀer UBI 2.0 to both Intact and better direct industry leading mobile platforms.
UBI 2.0 apps features and functionality to better engage with Canadians, while promoting
better driving. It's also signiﬁcantly more predictive. On the data science front we

continue to rollout, our latest auto rating algorithms which are grounded in machine
learning.

FINAL

In conclusion our diversiﬁed platform produce solid results in Q3. In personal auto our
action plan is delivering an underlying performance is tracking towards a mid 90s run
rate.
In the U.S., we've improved the OneBeacon combined ratio in the 12 months following
close and then over close to 5% accretion to NOIPS. We're well-positioned to capture
opportunities across our North American specialty business where we target $3 billion in
premiums in the mid-term and a sustainable low 90s combined ratio.
Organic growth momentum is building across our platform as market dynamics continue
to evolve in our favor. And IFC's balance sheet is strong too and we're ready to take
advantage should consolidation opportunities arise. Our strategies, initiatives and
discipline position us to deliver on our ﬁnancial objective about performance of the
industry ROE by at least 500 basis points and to grow our net operating income per share
by 10% per year over time.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Louis Marcotte.

Bloomberg Transcript

Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles and good morning everyone. For the third quarter, net operating income
of $237 million was up 8% compared to last year. The improvement was driven by
personal auto results, increased investment income, and OneBeacon, which contributed
$22 million of underwriting income.
CAT losses in the quarter were lower than expected, but we remain elevated year-to-date.
Our annual CAT expectations reﬂect a longer term view of weather trends, premium
growth and product changes.
On that basis, we maintain our guidance for CAT at $275 million per year for IFC. We
continue to expect close to half to occur in the third quarter and approximately 75% to
impact personal lines.
Now, let me provide some additional color on underwriting results, beginning with
Canada. In personal auto, the combined ratio improved 6.1 points compared to last year
with close to ﬁve points of improvement in the underlying performance. This does not
include a point of higher industry pool losses. At 72.5%, this loss ratio was the best Q3
underlying performance since 2014 and highlights the solid progress we are making.
Our action plan is delivering tangible results. Return rates are up 6% and earned rates up
over 5% in the quarter. Rate momentum continues with rate approvals in place today
guaranteeing mid single digit earned rate increases through the end of 2019. Beyond
rates, our actions on claims and risk selection will also continue.

FINAL

As Charles mentioned, we recorded 1.9 points of unfavorable prior year development,
mostly on pre reform accident beneﬁts in Ontario. The uncertainties surrounding the
ultimate cost of these ﬁles, is diminishing fast and is expected to be negligible within a
year.
The mid 90s auto combined ratio run rate objective is within our sights and with our
continuing actions, we're conﬁdent we'll be there by year end. Do note that we would
expect approximately three points of unfavorable impact from seasonality in the fourth
quarter.
In Canadian commercial, top-line performance was excellent. Direct premium growth -direct premium within growth in auto and P&C were up 12% and 6%, respectively. Rates
robust growth in specialty lines and the sharing economy were the key drivers.
The combined ratio was higher than expected at 94.9%, driven by elevated CAT and nonCAT large losses. These events, which were mainly ﬁre and water related occur randomly
and are not indicative of any unfavorable loss patterns.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our Canadian expense ratio remains little relative to peers and stable at 28.5%. We
remain focused on managing expenses thoughtfully, while making ongoing strategic
investments, and prudently growing the business. We expect the overall expense ratio for
the full year to remain at the Q3 year-to-date level.
Now turning to U.S. commercial. We've reported a solid 93.5% combined ratio in the
quarter, driven by healthy underlying loss ratio of 57% and two points of favorable prior
year development. Expenses picked-up slightly, due to seasonal variations in the business
mix. However, on a year-to-date basis, the expense ratio is in line with our expectations for
the full year.
With a year behind us since closing, excellent progress has been made with the
OneBeacon team to improve proﬁtability. We have delivered three sequential quarters of
combined ratio improvements. We've exited two lines and our proﬁtability improvement
plans on underperforming lines have gained traction. We are also ahead of schedule in
expense synergies. We realized $7 million in Q3 and have exceeded our $25 million U.S.
annual run rate target.
Our focus continues on improving the underperforming lines and realizing the beneﬁts
from internalizing and improving the claims processes. We're making strong and steady
progress towards the low 90s combined ratio objectives. But we do expect some noise
along the way.
Already in October, we have seen elevated loss activity including Hurricane Michael,
which will likely impact the U.S. commercial combined ratio by some three points to ﬁve
points in Q4.

FINAL

Net investment income of $133 million, was up 32% versus Q3 last year. This was driven
not only by the addition of OneBeacon, but also by the portfolio optimization that took
place earlier this year and higher reinvestment yields. We expect Q4 investment income
to be close to the Q3 level, driving annual investment income growth north of 20% for
2018.
Distribution business contributed $34 million to operating income this quarter, an
increase of 13% over last year. With weaker industry results lowering estimates for
contingent commissions, we expect distribution in Q4 to be similar to last year's Q4.
Now just a few words on our strong balance sheet. Book value per share at the end of Q3
increased to 6% year-over-year driven by earnings. We ended the quarter with a total
capital margin of $1.2 billion. A slight decline over last quarter largely related to
deleveraging. Our credit facility is now undrawn and debt to total capital is just below
22%.
In conclusion, we delivered a solid quarter and made good progress on our near-term
objectives, improvements in personal auto and OneBeacon together with rising
investment income are laying the foundation for near-term earnings expansion and a
return to a mid-teens ROE.

Bloomberg Transcript

With a strong balance sheet, we're making the right investments in our business to extend
our competitive advantages. And we're ready to capture inorganic opportunities as they
arise.
We've been very successful and our objectives are growing, now it's like 10% annually
over time and exceeding -- industries ROE by over 500 basis points every year. I'm very
conﬁdent that we have the right strategies in place to continue to meet our ﬁnancial
objectives overtime.
With that, I'll return the call back to Ken?

Thank you, Louis. In order to give everyone a chance to participate in the Q&A, we kindly

(Operator Instructions) Your ﬁrst question comes from the line of Kai Pan of Morgan
Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

FINAL

Thank you. Good morning. So my ﬁrst question on personal auto. Just want to clarify
Louis about your three point's unfavorable seasonality in fourth quarter. So which implies
like 98% combined ratio in the fourth quarter would be -- you would consider achieving
your target. So I just want to put it all together in one question. So if that's the case, I just
wonder, are you getting to your probability target that you were looking more for top line
growth into 2019.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

So I guess on the run rate, your approach is right, Kai. So the three points is really saying,
we would deduct them from the reported combined ratio, assuming CATs are as
expected and there would be no PYD in that 98. But the three points I referred to is
something that would be deducted from the reported combined ratio to arrive at the run
rate for Q4. That's on the run rate on the next year 2019.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think on the top line we're seeing that the market is ﬁrming up. We're starting to see a bit
more rate momentum. Now we're still taking rate, Joe. Just to put things in perspective
our work has not stopped. But incrementally if we look across markets, we're seeing a
deceleration in particular in the last few months, a deceleration of shrinkage. I'll pass it to
Darren, who will give you a better perspective on the state of the personal automobile
insurance market.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

No, absolutely I think if you look at the industry results after the ﬁrst six months of this
year, industry continues to be challenged with the combined ratio in excess of 100%. We
saw clearly there is rate adequacy within the market that ultimately will drive further rate
increases.
I think if you look within the capacity terms in terms of the behavior of markets that
continuation of tightening is very evident. FA, Facility Association insured a lost reserve.
Coast to Coast is up 30% year-to-date. So it's another signiﬁcant sign of tightening within
the marketplace.
So, as Charles alluded to I think we're seeing the curve of our growth has changed
slightly. We do expect that the industry will catch up with rate adequacy as the conditions
continue to ﬁrm. We'll continue to be prudent. But we're not chasing growth. We're not
chasing growth by lowering rates, as we move into 2019.
We deﬁnitely will be looking more at assessing growth opportunities as they arise, very
segmented, very cautious, very prudent. But we do expect that there will continue to be
some short-term pressure, but we think more in the nine to 12 month phase, we can see
growth opportunities are rising for us.

FINAL

Yeah. I think Kai our experience with previous periods of that nature, given where we are
in the cycle, some of the actions that we've taken our view is that within 12 months we
should be back in positive growth territory. The return rate momentum is very strong and
intact. And as other markets are catching up, I think the return rate momentum and a
deceleration of unit shrinkage should contribute favorably to the top line.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's very, very helpful. My follow-up question is that the interest in your thoughts about
potential implications from the legalization of cannabis.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Right. Darren, maybe you want to give a brief perspective on that, very early, obviously.

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Yeah, no absolutely very early. So, ﬁrst of all, when you look at the introduction of the
legalization of cannabis. First of all, there is no frequency impact studies available with
respect to Canada. So, we're very much using U.S. studies. And there are numerous
studies coming out of the U.S. in terms of potential frequency impact. There is quite a
range within those studies. Some suggesting no impact and others are obviously
indicating otherwise.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think as we move forward, we'll be very prudent in terms of how we reﬂect the possible
impact of cannabis both in terms of our prospective view on automobile, but also in terms
of subsequent rate increases that we'll be looking to gain pretty much coast-to-coast.
So, we'll be evaluating very closely our frequency trends and adjusting rates accordingly. I
think what's important as Charles alluded to our rate momentum is very strong. In the
month of September alone, written rates were up 6.5% and with more momentum
coming; that does not reﬂect the recent rate approvals that we just received in Ontario.
So, we have a lot of rate momentum -- written rate into the remainder of 2018 and into
2019 and then obviously, a lot of earned rate momentum. And as Louis mentioned midsingle-digits in the pipeline already on earned rates in 2019.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. So, I think prudence embedded in our thought process in terms of frequency
forecasting and relationship with the uncertainty associated with cannabis, Kai, is how I
would sum it up. Maybe when I look at frequency today, though encouraged, nothing to
do with cannabis, but encouraged by the fact that in the quarter frequency was down
3.7%. And we've seen momentum building in terms of frequency dropping now for a few
months and that gives me comfort when it comes to public policy issues around cannabis
and the impact on frequency early to tell.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay, great. Well, thanks so much and good luck.

Your next question comes from line of Tom MacKinnon of BMO Capital Markets. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks very much. Just want to -- a couple of questions with respect to the personal
auto I think one was with respect to the pre-reform accident beneﬁts stuﬀ you're seeing in
Ontario. How long before you expect this to be negligible or essentially zero?
We saw it in the second quarter, it ticked down a little bit in the third quarter, but when
should we -- how should we be modeling prior year development associated with this
going forward?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Tom thanks for your question, very topical. I'll ask Patrick to share his perspective. But I
think the headline would be immaterial within 12 months given the reporting pattern of
those pre-reform claims.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Absolutely. So, the activity in Q3 as was mentioned really comes from, again, a few ﬁles
and accident beneﬁt dating back to pre-reforms. I will remind everyone that the new CAT
deﬁnition started to apply on all accidents starting in June 1, 2016. So, more than 27
months into it now.
And what we see as a recent development is really psychological impairment, which is the
area of the new CAT deﬁnition that will bring the most beneﬁts in terms of cost reduction.
So, we've been prudent in our reserving approach on those ﬁles lately, we've seen some
activity. And as Louis mentioned, when we look at the development patterns of those
claims from the past, the remaining uncertainty around the total ultimate cost of pre
reform ﬁle is really diminishing rapidly and will reach negligible level within 12 months.
But it could also go the other way. I think that's an important thing to mention, because of
our prudent approach, when we look at the process for claims to become CAT there's a
ﬁrst step, which is we receive a clariﬁcation from clients. And as I was saying since we're
more than 27 months into the new reform, the number of new CAT applications that we
expect to receive is really slowing down. And in fact the ultimate number might be lower
than what we project based on recent activity.
Second, the number of those ﬁles that were received CAT applications, which will be
considered or end up in the CAT zone, we assume and project that they would be in line
Page 9 of 26

FINAL

with historical levels. But the recent ﬁles that are coming in are more stretch cases in the
sense that they have a lower likelihood in our view of reaching the CAT deﬁnition
threshold.
And ﬁnally, from a severity perspective, we reserve those cases at face value, meaning we
look at past average severity, but given they are more psychological in nature, we know
that there's a likelihood that those remaining, pending ﬁles could end up at a lower
severity average.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay, thanks. And a question with respect to your tax rate. The last couple of quarters
you've been running on an operating basis in 18% and 19% tax rate. I think your guide was
somewhere around 21%. How should we be thinking about the tax, operating tax rate
going forward?

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

So that -- you're right. We do expect it to be between 20%, 21%. The -- it's always the
same story the tax free dividends, the portion of tax free dividends is higher than what we
would expect on a normal run rate basis. And we're seeing a bit of favorable impact from
the U.S. operations.

Bloomberg Transcript

The OneBeacon operations added there, which takes the rate down a bit. And I give you a
20% to 21% it's combined. What's really driving now the fact that we're below that rate is
the proportion of tax free income to total operating income.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

So you want to stick with the 20% to 21%, or do you expect the trend that we've seen of
late to temporary --

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

I will stick there Tom, because I expect earnings to shift back into the underwriting side
and that the proportion of tax free dividends will be lower in future quarters.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. And if I could just squeeze a quick one here, if you talk about a mid-90s run rate by
the end of 2018 for personal auto, if we had in 2019 no cash and no prior year
development and no impact from pools, then we should expect a reported rate of mid90s?

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yeah, we'd be disappointed if that would not be the reported rate on the basis that you're
describing deﬁnitely. In particular given the rate momentum and some of the actions that
we've taken that would be disappointing to us if that would not be the case now.

Your next question comes from the line of John Aiken of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

Q - John Aiken

{BIO 6329080 <GO>}

Good morning, Louis. The capital MCT ratio is actually now below where we were right
after the year OneBeacon acquisition. And I know we're still well above the cap -company action level, but does a MCT ratio below 200% actually give you any limitations
on what you may or may not want to do with capital?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No, no. Absolutely, not. We're -- we actually monitored the total capital margin which
captures the excess capital in Canada and U.S. and our other companies as well as the
holding company. And that's really, there is a bit of a shift between the Canadian
operation and the Holdco cash and we use the cash to pay down the debt. But I would
not read more into it. And I would be very comfortable running anywhere in the 195 to
200 range for Canada. This is a minor noise on a quarterly basis and does not limit in any
way our capacity to deploy capital.

Q - John Aiken

{BIO 6329080 <GO>}

Okay. And then, if I can follow-up with a question on the distribution income. Your
guidance for the fourth quarter does imply that we're going to be well below the 10%
annualized growth rate. I completely understand with what's going on in the marketplace.
Are you comfortable with looking at 10% growth for 2019? Or do you expect the pressures
that you're seeing this year to carry through into 2019?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

So I think it's a bit early to talk 2019, John. But I think we're -- we're seeing some pressure
this year because of the environment -- the market environment we're in. I think given our
outlook for next year, there's no reason why we should not be able to rebuild that
distribution income to growth rate -- to that growth level.

Q - John Aiken

{BIO 6329080 <GO>}

And as a quick -- sorry, go ahead.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Plus acquisition activity in 2018 certainly goes to feed that up.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith of UBS. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Charles and Louis. Just question here. You all talk about, large loss kind of
non-cat weather on a year-over-year basis and what the impact it was in the underlying on
the commercial and the homeowners. But I assume you're always going to have some of
this in your results. What was kind of the normalized kind of number you were thinking
you would have this quarter and where were we what's the diﬀerence? So we can kid of
get a better run rate.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So Brian will zoom in on commercial lines. I think this is where the issue reside. So I will let
Alain give you his perspective on that both CATs and large losses, I think.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Okay. Well, thank you very much for the question Brian. When we focused on the Q3
result of commercial lines in Canada 94.9 that's clearly above expectation and was
aﬀected by two element CATs and large losses, when we look at CATs close to 8 points in
Q3, this is about 4.5 points above historical average.
And let me remind you, a CAT for us is any large event in excess of $7.5 million. So the
major one that aﬀected us or the biggest one is Q3 was the tornado that went through the
Ottawa Gatineau region. And unfortunately, that tornado went through a path where -- we
had more commercial lines exposure and that really drove the eyelevel of CAT at 4.5
points above expectations, or above historical average.
On the large losses, you know when we look at the large losses, we saw in Q3. We are
about 1.5 points to 2 points above historical average. Those losses includes, ﬁre a bit of
liability bonds, but ﬁre is basically the main contributor there. When we looked at that we
could not found any pattern in the type of loss, the cause, the region, the line of business.
So far we have no evidence that would suggest that the number and extent of large losses
in catastrophe is increasing. So when I take those into consideration excess CAT and
excess large losses, while the normalized combined ratio for Q3 would be more in the
88% to 89% zone and this is in line with our view that the line of business operates close
to low 90.

I think if I can add color Brian, we were giving on a hard time with the mid-90s result in
commercial lines. But you know, if you take a broader perspective, I look at ﬁve years of
combined ratio all in and commercial lines you get to a 91-ish combined ratio.

FINAL

I look at the rate momentum, where we're writing rate return in commercial P&C in
Canada's close to three in Q3 and slightly above four in commercial auto. The
outperformance from a loss ratio point of view with the industry is north of 10.
So it's a massive outperformance. And the market is tightening up. So I'm pretty bullish
about the value creation proﬁle of commercial lines in the context of Canada. And I would
say not overly bothered by CAT and large loss activity at this stage even though we'll keep
giving you a hard time with the bad luck here.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay great. So you're saying that you think that things are going to continue to ﬁrm up
here in the marketplace in Canada?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. I mean the momentum in the past six weeks, six months has been quite surprising.
And we started to realize that the ﬁrming up is greater than anticipated, because the thing
that came here to us is our outperformance was actually much greater in commercial lines
than we thought 18 months ago. And that all, I think the market tightening up makes more
sense in that context. But I think the franchise is running low 90s.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

But what's driving the ﬁrming market? Are you seeing rising loss trend or what's
happening?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

I don't think we're seeing loss trend. I think there was really rate reduction for a long time
in the commercial lines market and now that's picking up, if you look like troll was leading,
if you look at our outperformance at the end of Q2, which is about North of 10 points and
you look at our combined ratio that puts the industry well above 100%. So this is for me
really economics driving the needs for improvement in the pricing situation there.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think Brian, when I look at the work that Alain and team have done in the past three years
there were real bad classes or segments of the Commercial Lines marketplace that we
tackled head on starting about three years ago.
Where we really worked on about 5% to 10% of the of the portfolio, which touched a
number of segments and the market is really starting to focus on that because those
segments where we deemphasized in our portfolio have become quite unproﬁtable in the
Canadian marketplace.

Natural disasters as well as been a source of pressure in the past seven, eight years and I
think people are focused on home insurance and not as much on commercial lines. And I
think you're starting to see some movement there as well.

FINAL

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great, can I squeeze just one more quick one in. Charles it's curious on the improvement
you're seeing in your personal auto book, you talked about improving severity and
frequency. Is there a way to dissect how much of that frequency improvement is your own
underwriting actions and initiatives versus just general industry frequency perhaps
trending downwards?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Too early to tell Brian because the drop in frequency started to appear earlier this year
and the level of granularity that we can get at the industry level will become available
when -- Darren?

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Later this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Later this year. So it will be tough for us to diﬀerentiate between the two. That being said,
when we measure the quality of the portfolio, which results from the underwriting actions
that we've taken there is a clear improvement in the quality proﬁle of the portfolio and
quality tends to be associated to a greater extent with frequency than severity because it
is about underwriting. And in that regard we've made good progress as part of the action
plan, and Darren maybe you want to share your perspective on that?

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

No, that's absolutely it. So when we look very much coast-to-coast, every province, both
channels, when we're looking at what we call our rate adequacy index, meaningful
reductions in terms of improvement in quality, very much consistent in the last 12 to 18
months, which is as Charles said, we believe really ﬂowing into the frequency impact.
We also see it in terms of the mix change that we see within the portfolio as well as to the
quality of the new business that we're attracting, the quality of the retention of our existing
customers that we are retaining is driving a mix change towards better quality, which is
ultimately driving those quality metrics, which we believe is ﬂowing into the frequency
that we're seeing today.

Q - Meny Grauman

{BIO 15238080 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon. Question on the legislative front, the private members bill in the
entire legislature, Bill 44 was defeated. But I think Bill 42 is still alive and kicking. So,
wondering your perspective, what you expect from the legislative process? How you
expect the legislative process to play out? And then what would be the impact of this bill
be based on your reading of it?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Let Darren give his perspective. He is closest to the legislative process in Ontario.

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Thanks for the question. So you're right. There was two private members bills, one
sponsored by NDP, one sponsored by the Conservatives. As you rightly mentioned, the
NDP bill was defeated in the house on Friday. Now in terms of the Conservative
sponsored private member's bill, we believe that we understand that the ﬁrst debate on
that bill is expected to be in March of 2019, so there's still quite a bit of time in terms of
when that when that particular bill will come before the house.
I think overarching statement; we don't believe they're restricting segmentation whether
its location based rating or other forms it's in the best interests of drivers and consumers.
However, there's one element of the bill that we are quite favourable towards, which is
around the scene in the current ﬁscal bulletin regarding the ability governing territories
and the way that we can use territories in ratings. So that's an important piece of the bill
that we very much support.
Longer term, I mean, we ﬁrmly believe that lessening the regulatory burden is important,
it increases more price points in the market, drives further competition, and ultimately
drives lower premiums in Ontario and elsewhere in the country as we continue to push
towards less regulation.
We're obviously, working very closely with the Ontario government in terms of the
particular member's bill, but ultimately, what we see is private members' bill sometimes
don't proceed and can sometimes pivot towards government policy.
So, we're working -- as Intact, we're working as IBC to ensure that the government really
understands in terms of what is the possible ramiﬁcations of restrictions of segmentation.
And we're quite conﬁdent that we can illustrate the beneﬁt to consumers of more options
and more competition in the marketplace.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think that my view of the current government, there's two things they're focused on in
my mind and it is reducing fraud and then unleashing competition, so that Ontarians get a
Page 15 of 26

better deal. And with that sort of mindset in my view, you get a better outcome in the
market. I've conﬁdence that those principles will guide their decision-making pattern.

FINAL

If you zoom in on Ontario, Ontario historically limited the number of territories that you
could use to 55, when you look at other jurisdictions. You're in the hundreds of territories,
but Ontario for some reason at this artiﬁcial constraint on the number of territories, the
private bill on the table today is killing that country, which is a good thing.
Then, of course, you want to make sure that there are no unfair pricing or underwriting
practices that's totally reasonable. And how that will be enforced or implemented, I think
it will be done in a way to increase competition and make the Ontario marketplace one
that is more vibrant than a marketplace that at all sorts of constraints on pricing and
segmentation.
So we'll see where that goes I think that'll materialize later in 2019. But I think we're well
equipped from a segmentation point of view with all the tools we have in the toolbox to
do well in that environment.

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Just on personal auto, trying to think about I guess the levers on what
you might be able to do over the medium-term of reducing the combined ratio from the
kind of the mid-90s that you've talked about if you're able to do it. Given rates probably
something need to be a little bit careful though, given what we've seen so far in the
industry. Is there an ability to grind that kind of mid-90s down a little bit over time
whether or not it comes from telematics or some of your investments in technology that
may help in terms of risk selection and other factors?

FINAL

Well, I think if you go back in time, Geoﬀ, you will see that we have run the portfolio for a
number of years below mid-90s. Okay? You go back to 2013, combined was 93.2. Go
back to 2014, 94.5; 2015, 95. And if you go back in time, those who have followed the
stocks since the IPO, there were years where a combined ratio was actually sub-90.
I wouldn't want people to think this thing will run sub-95 quite frankly, because it's been a
diﬃcult process to break the trends we've been observing. There is a lot of momentum
building in rates, but I think when the industry tightens up, one has to be cautious about
the future rate increases, you think you can get.
And I think for me once, we'll run that business clean at 95, I will see this as success. If the
market conditions allows us to go below that you can be sure that we'll be focused on
going there. But I wouldn't want people to think along these lines, because it's been a
rough 18 months to 24 months, we'll get it to mid-90s. We have good momentums of
actions, and that's what we're focused on at this stage.

Q - Geoﬀ Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay. And just the second question I had was -- there was that thing in the news around
the HST lawsuit. I'm wondering if you have any comments on that front? And also given it
was just I believe pertaining to Ontario, is there any potential for that to pop-up and then
in the other provinces?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think what you're seeing in the Ontario marketplace and this relates to the PYD as well as
this class action lawsuit, is the fact that, the reforms of June 2016 have really brought back
sanity in terms of how much is available for recovery. And it really diminishes the
opportunities of people who are in the car accident business to take advantage of this
marketplace.
And by that I mean, entrepreneurs who ﬁnd a business out of injuries. And I think what
you're seeing now is people agitating, trying to drum up CATs that really shouldn't be
CATs and claim for CATs and put in place all sorts of lawsuits of that nature. And so I think
it is a sign to me that the reforms that have been put in place are actually focused on the
right things. I'll let Patrick give a perspective on the lawsuit itself, and hopefully this will
answer your question.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yeah. So brieﬂy on the class action that was announced last week, each of Intact and
Belair were named in that lawsuit that's related to the treatment of HST. Following its
introduction in 2010, we have been reviewing in details the allegations made. But I can
conﬁrm that at Intact we are paying the HST and we're counting in -- we're not counting its
sorry towards the limit of the AB (ph) as per the ﬁscal guidelines, so really not an issue
from our perspective. In terms of how this could eventually get outside of Ontario, I think
it's more the environment that Charles was mentioning, and we don't see any materiality
with this bill put.

Hi there. Good morning.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Hi.

Q - Brenna Phelan

{BIO 20108118 <GO>}

So going back to the question on the legislative front, is there any particular state in the
U.S. that you can point to where you think they've done a good job regulating rate
increases to allow for the necessary proﬁtability improvements to be made that you're
using when you're advising the RBC?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. I mean the U.S. marketplace is interesting, in that, it is a mosaic of great regulatory
environment ranging from what is called use-and-ﬁle which is basically what we have here
in Quebec where you put in place your rating -- your rate change, increase or decrease it
quickly as you as you can.
And then you ﬁle it with the regulator, right up to, what it's called, prior approval, which is
what exists, for instance, in Ontario, where you need to get your rates approved before
they can actually be used. And that process in the case of Ontario can last six months.
So I would say Brenna that, all the states that use a user-and-ﬁle system in the U.S.,
Midwest State in particular would be a very good example that we have used in the past.
And market here in Quebec, which has a use-and-ﬁle system, it's the market that's has the
best outcome for consumers, because this is the market for companies are most
aggressive, because they know that if they're too aggressive they can self-correct, which is
not the case in other markets. So every use-and-ﬁle states in the U.S. we tend to use as a
group as an example for well performing market.

Q - Brenna Phelan

{BIO 20108118 <GO>}

Okay. That's really helpful. And then if we're thinking about a return to unit growth over
the next 12 months, how should we be thinking about that geographically.
Are there any particular regions that you think you're better positioned to return to
growth?

FINAL

So when we look at the market across the lands, in the last six months there is a
dichotomy in terms of growth performance. Markets like the province of Quebec, both
channels are growing mid-single-digit. The pressure is really in Ontario, ﬁrst, and in
Alberta, second, because the regulatory regimes are heavier and we move much faster
than our peers with increases that were more meaningful.
And therefore, the pressure is very much in these markets. These are the markets where
there is capacity tightening at the moment. These are markets where companies are
pushing to get rate increases. And this is where I see the biggest delta in terms of growth
in the coming nine months to 12 months.

Q - Brenna Phelan

{BIO 20108118 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. And then last one from me, just in terms of the claim side, companies
reporting, most recently in the quarter in the auto space, referring to labor shortages with
auto, auto body shops, is there anything that you're seeing here that could potentially
derail some of the proﬁtability improvement components on the claim side?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think when I review what is being reported in the U.S. now in terms of physical damage
inﬂation, labor shortage, integration of technology that's what we've been talking about
and acting upon for the last 12 months to 18 months. And therefore, I think what you're
hearing in the U.S. more and more is what we've been on now for over a year. Patrick,
anything you want to add?

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

I think its right in on the labor shortage per say, I think with the relationship we have with
our Relay Network is one of the places where I think we might have some advantage
compared to our peers. And from all those actions, we've been working around that
Charles you're referring to. We're really seeing traction and it's contributed to the fact that
we've been a few months now seeing severity going down.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And labor shortage broadly in the context of Canada has a direct impact on cost of
repairs. It has a direct impact on the cost of leasing vehicles for our customers. When we
started to see towards the end of 2016 and into 2017 some bumps in relationship with
that, we've put a number of claims actions in place to help on that front. And I think
Patrick you might just give brief comments on that, but also talk about customer
satisfaction in automobile insurance in the last year which talks to how we've dealt with
those shortages and delays.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yeah. Yeah. One of the key indicator is that we are getting traction in our action plan is the
fact that cycle times on total loss and also the average time that we pay for rental is -- has
gone down compared to last year after some of our actions were taken. From a customer

satisfaction, this is also good for customers. It's good for our customers. It's good for
customer when we close those ﬁles fast and we've seen our net promoter score gain
three, four points overall Canada wide in auto, despite all the actions we're taking on that
front. So a good outcome so far, but -- and we're keeping the focus on continuing to the

Good morning. Just wanted to go back to just the reforms in Ontario, and I -- hopefully
this is a quick question, but Charles the 2016 reforms. Are they holding, I mean, besides
the pre reform claims moving into the CAT bucket are you seeing any other leakage from
that reform? Or frankly, have you seen any other leakage outside of just the reforms that
were being put through that you have any concerns with in Ontario?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Patrick?

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

No. The really -- the last development or activities on prior years was seen in Ontario was
really all coming from ORMs, the end what make us conﬁdent with the new reform, and if
it does not been fully tested. That's when we'll look at the deﬁnition that was introduced
in June. It's really tackling the exact same source of activities that -- that is causing some of
the noise, we see right now. And we're starting to see the ﬁrst few ﬁles, like a
psychological impairment cat application, we usually will take two years to develop. So,
from June 1st 2016 or just passed now are starting to pass the ﬁrst few claims post reform
that are testing that limit and the few that we've seen are holding. And that was more of
that in the coming quarters. But it looks good so far.

Q - Doug Young

And can you?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Doug, we -- the other thing that matters here, we talked a lot about CAT because it's been
a source of PYD, but minor injury are an important part of the equation and there have
been reforms over the past few years. There's been a reform in the spring of 2016 around
the mediation and arbitration process, you will recall in Ontario and the outcome of the
new system better known as the LAT are actually holding very steady at this stage.

FINAL

We're spending, both Patrick and myself, lot of time with adjusters on that very question.
What are we seeing? How has the environment changed? And we held discussions with
tens of adjusters a couple of weeks back on that very topic. And it really boils down to pre
reforms psychological damage, attempt by the legal community to get CAT, which, as
we've said, we're reserving as is, but our view is these things won't really -- I will not turn
into CATs at the same rate as CATs. I've turned in to CATs historically.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

So -- and my view always has been, it takes about two to three years for these individuals
to ﬁnd a way to kind of -- ﬁnd a hole or kind of put a wedge in somewhere. But you're not
seeing any of that. These reforms are actually kind of holding ﬁrm at this point in time. Is
that a fair characterization?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

It is a very fair characterization. And I think, Doug, the fact that people are going back in
old claims to attempt to claim CATs on the basis of psychological damage, to me, is a sign
that the door with the reform has shut.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And can you put a ﬁner point on that like, how many claims, like, are eligible, that are
sitting there pre 2016 that could actually move into that bucket. I mean, I would imagine
it's a lot less than it was, call it, a year ago. But can you put a ﬁner, like, how many of these
claims are still out there that could attempt to move into that area?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think when you see -- I imagine that it is a lot less than the year ago. I would say, that is a
true statement. And the other thing I would say is that, the uncertainty that comes from
that, that has translated in a point or two of PYD for quarters in the past two year, we
expect that uncertainty shut down by half within the next 12 months, at which case it
becomes really immaterial. Patrick?

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

That's it. In terms of a number of cases I can quote a number, but obvious it's a small
number. It's just that each of them have a high severity. We will preserve them at face
value. Like we said, it could go up to a million each. So it's only a few cases less and when
we talk about the uncertainty that remains until this is fully behind us. This is why there's
uncertainty. It's just a handful of cases of diﬀerence compared to our projection.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

I would say probably more than a handful, but there's a ﬁnite shelf to this and we expect
that this will drop in the coming year.

Thanks. Good morning. I'll try to keep this quick. First question, regarding OneBeacon,
just want to understand the nature of the hurricane exposure a little bit better. Because if I
recall correctly, there wasn't any material hurricane impact in 2017 despite the fact that
those are bigger industry events. So just want to understand the change here?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. I think the nature of the exposure. First of all, we talked about large losses or large
events in addition to the hurricane that Louis has referred to, but we could think about the
exposure there. Ocean, marine, marine, marinas and then special property exposure
where we would have a commercial building or tranche of a commercial building which
tends to be less expose to the natural disaster. But in the case of Michael have been
instead of a hit there.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

So just a point of reference, Paul, you're absolutely right, when we say, when you start

increase their rates, regulators get a little more nervous. We started to move rates in
Alberta over two years ago, and feel like we're in a good shape. But I'll let Darren share

FINAL

Thanks, Charles. So indeed Paul, so the rate increase cap in November was it just recently
extended? In other words, a further 5% cap has now been granted by government. So like
2017 cap, we took the 5% both companies. We intend to do the same. But to Charles'
point in terms of getting ahead of the marketplace, if I look since say early 2016, we're
good 11 to 12 points ahead of the market place in that period of time.
And if I extend even further back than that I could probably add another 5, 8 points on
top of that again. So even before the rate cap came in place at the end of 2017, we were
well ahead of the marketplace. The 5% rate cap was pretty much inline with what our
plans were for 2018.
And now that there is a another increase or another 5% available, we'll take that. The
market itself is well exceeding a 100%. There's tremendous inadequacy in the
marketplace. We're obviously hold our better position, when we look at our
outperformance gap, meaningful double-digit outperformance in Alberta versus P&C. So
we're very, very well-placed in terms of rate action.
And what we also see from an inﬂationary standpoint, signiﬁcant progress Patrick and
team on the bodily injury site containing costs, but also on the physical damage side as
well too. So very much favourable view from a severity standpoint and also a favourable
view from a frequency standpoint in the province of Alberta as well too.

Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Great. Thank you very much. Just two really quick questions. One, was there any reserve
development for prior years in auto besides the pre-reform Ontario AB charges?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Not much. No.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. And you talked a little bit about seasonality impacting the OneBeacon expense
ratio. Is there any trend besides that as the business mix shifts or should we just look at
let's say, last four quarters has a good guide to seasonality?

So that's a good question. On the expenses, there is a bit of seasonality in Q3 particularly
because of some of the growth in the U.S., 30 for example has driven some of an expense
ratio. But looking back 12 months I think is a good way to analyze the seasonality. That's
really the main factor and I wouldn't read much more into it.

FINAL

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

To Meyer question, the segments that are under proﬁtability are shrinking. The remaining
10 segments are growing double-digit, any shift and the mix as a result of that driving a
diﬀerence in expectations for expenses you think.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well, long-term we're still seeing you know a downward shift in the expense ratio because
of the synergies and expenses we're driving, saying in this quarter particularly we had the
mix impacted a bit higher than we had anticipated. But what we're referring to is a yearto-date around 375 is what we would have expected for the whole year. Just a blip in Q3
for that mix part. There's a bit of the tuition reimbursement business as well that drives a
bit of seasonality which is a bit more elevated. But I would go for a 375 annual run rate as
the expected level.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

And update on synergies?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes, 7 million realized in the quarter that takes our run rate higher than the 25 million
target we had established. So that's going well and you keep on pounding on expenses
and trying to expand -- improve the expense ratio in the U.S.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Perfect. Thanks so much.

Your last question comes from the line of Jaeme Gloyn of National Bank Financial. Please
go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi. Thanks and good afternoon. First question on the Hurricane Michael guidance
three to ﬁve points of impact, is it best to think about that as an increase from the Q4 2017
levels of 60.5% for the claims ratio?

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

No. So, just to be clear Hurricane Michael I mentioned just because it's part of the activity
we've seen. It is not the only activity. So, it's not -- sound like we have a huge hit from

Michael. It was just one big event that impacted the U.S. and as part of the activity we've
seen in October so far.

FINAL

Then we think this activity will drive roughly three to ﬁve points of additional combined
ratio points in the quarter. But we would--

For U.S. commercial line.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

For U.S.

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

For U.S. commercial lines, thank you. And I would use the most recent sort of run rate
combined ratio as your starting point and add these three to ﬁve points to be our
expectation for the Q4 U.S. commercial.

Bloomberg Transcript

Got it. Thank you. And last one for me. I don't think this has been touched on yet is
around distribution income, some commentary around how that's tracking and any
outlook for 2019.

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Yes. So, we shared about (ph) the expectation for Q4 suggesting that it would be equal to
what we reported last year's Q4. So, that's a bit lower than what we had anticipated at the
beginning of the year. We had given 10% expected in 2018. What we're suggesting is
there's no reason why we should not go back to this kind of growth in 2019. It's still early
in our minds, but that's what we're thinking for next year, because we expect the activity
to come back, the results to improve and that will improve distribution results.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Great. Thank you.
