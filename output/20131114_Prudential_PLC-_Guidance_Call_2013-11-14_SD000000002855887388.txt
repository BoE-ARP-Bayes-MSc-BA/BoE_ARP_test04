FINAL

I am pleased to report that Prudential has continued to make good progress in the Third
Quarter with a particularly strong performance from Asia. So let me take you through the
highlights for each of our main business units, starting with Asia.
In Asia, new business profit in the first nine months grew by 20% to GBP990 million. And
APE grew by 15% to over GBP1.5 billion. Our Asian business had a strong Third Quarter,
delivering sales of GBP513 million. And new business profits of GBP331 million. Nine of our
businesses grew sales at double-digit rates, in local currency terms, in the Third Quarter.
Thailand more than doubled its sales, up 120%, due to a strong contribution from our new
venture announced last year with Thanachart Bank.
China was up 62%; India was up 27%; Hong Kong was up 23%; Indonesia and our Takaful
business in Malaysia were both up 22%; Vietnam up 17%; Singapore up 16%; and Taiwan
up 12%.
Our business continues to be primarily driven by several favorable long-term structural
trends. To name a few; GDP growth; high savings rates; a growing middle class that has a
strong appetite and need, not only for savings products but also for protection of their
health and that of their family; low penetration of protection products; and a limited
welfare state.

Bloomberg Transcript

These positive long-term trends are not significantly affected by short-term economic
fluctuations, as evidenced by our performance in the Third Quarter.
Moving now to the US from Asia; Jackson's[ph] new business profits were up 11% to
GBP756 million, reflecting three main positive factors. First of all, higher sales of our new
VA with no living benefits Elite Access, which has really become material this year; pricing
and product actions that we have continuously taken and talked to you about; and the
beneficial impact of higher long-term interest rates.
Leaving now the US to focus on the UK. In our life business, new business profits were
GBP204 million, 10% lower year over year, due to lower bulk annuity volumes mainly. Retail
new business profits were actually up 2% over 2012.
Our asset management businesses have continued to perform well with external funds
under management up 18% year over year to GBP143 billion, largely driven by positive net
flows.
Overall, we believe we're on track to achieve our two remaining 2013 growth and cash
objectives.
So that will be the highlights. Let us now take a closer look at each of the four businesses
in turn, starting with Asia.

Our businesses have delivered a very strong Third Quarter, leading to a strong year-todate performance with broad-based growth across our key sweet spot markets. And
across both our core distribution channels, agency and bank partnerships.

FINAL

What we call our sweet spot markets are Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam, an area with close to 600 million people and more
than $2.5 trillion of GDP, which would make it a G5105[ph] (inaudible).
In the standalone Third Quarter our sweet spot markets delivered APE of GBP428 million
on a local currency basis, which is 22% higher over our prior year. This strong volume
growth has helped drive year-to-date new business profits up 22% in local currency terms
again.
Our multichannel distribution platform continues to be a unique advantage in the region.
In the discrete Third Quarter, agency APE grew by 22% on a local currency basis with
strong contributions from all our businesses except Korea, where APE fell 43%, reflecting
our discipline in not offering low margin guaranteed products in that market.

Bloomberg Transcript

On a year-to-date basis, agency APE growth was 16%, driven by a continued increase in
the number of active agents, higher case sizes and higher number of cases per active
agent.
The bancassurance channel delivered discrete Third Quarter APE growth of 27%. All of our
top five banks recorded double-digit growth, with Thanachart delivering a particularly
strong performance after coming on stream in May 2013.
So I'd like just to run you through a few key markets, six actually; Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Singapore, Malaysia, China and Thailand.
In Hong Kong, we delivered year-to-date APE growth of 23%, led by sales of our popular
Evergreen Growth Saver and PRUmyhealth lifelong crisis protector products. Our Hong
Kong agency force has had a particularly strong year, with productivity in this channel up
by 25%, mainly driven by higher case sizes.
I would like to spend some time on our performance on Indonesia as it is a market that
has attracted a lot of interest, as concerned in previous year about emerging markets.
And particularly Southeast Asia.
Our year-to-date sales in Indonesia, on a reported exchange rate basis, have increased
by 15% with new business profit growing at 16%. Please note that, on a local currency
basis, both APE and new business profits grew by 22% versus the 15% and 16% I just
indicated. So that demonstrates, we believe, a continued strong underlying performance
of our business in that country.
The continued growth in Indonesia is supported by mainly three drivers. The strong
underlying demand for protection products; our expansion outside Jakarta; and our
Page 3 of 31

Company Ticker: PRU L N Equity
Date: 2013-11-14

exceptionally strong and growing distribution.

FINAL

Taking these in turn. First, the continued growth of the middle class, the increased
availability of medical services, the absence of a welfare state and the lower penetration
of savings and protection products means that demand for our regular unit-linked savings
and protection products remains robust.
Sales of these products were up 28% in the Third Quarter in local currency terms. We
continue to invest in understanding our customers' needs, which underpins our ability to
innovate and sell products which are always well suited to meeting our customers'
requirements.
Second, our strategy of expansion outside Jakarta is progressively bearing fruit with nonJakarta APE up 31% in local currency terms, comprising now almost half of our total
Indonesian sales. This evolution is typical of what we have seen elsewhere in the early
stages of the development of an emerging economy.

Bloomberg Transcript

Urbanization leads to the growth of the main cities. But also. And as importantly, to the
growth of a number of medium sized and smaller cities where business opportunities are
significant. Companies only neglect this at their expense and, as always, there is
effectively a sizeable first-mover advantage by country that we have much talked about.
But also by town. And we expect this to continue to play out over many years to come.
Third, our agency channel, which is central to capturing the significant profitable growth
opportunities available across the archipelago, showed continued strong momentum with
the number of active agents significantly up over the year. Our agency recruitment,
onboarding and training model remains a core competitive advantage. And is instrumental
in driving sustainable, high quality growth.
Moving now from Indonesia to Singapore, next door. Sales grew by 18% for the year, with
broadly similar contributions from both our agency and bancassurance channels,
illustrating the benefits of our multichannel approach.
This is a strong level of growth in a market that is sometimes, we believe wrongly,
described as mature. What I would call the wealth effect is particularly strong in Singapore,
which is a wealthy country where the population keeps getting wealthier. Not a bad place
to be.
So our agency channel in Singapore delivered 21% APE growth, led by both a continued
increase in the number of active agents and higher productivity. In the bancassurance
channel, overall APE grew by 17%, led, once again, by a strong contribution from new[ph].
Our long-term track record in Singapore underlines the quality of our execution in
delivering additive growth, from both our agency and bancassurance channels.
Moving on to Malaysia. In Malaysia, we saw strong demand for our flagship PRUlink One
product, a protection product with savings riders, as part of our actions initiated in the
Page 4 of 31

Third Quarter of last year to refocus the business away from high volume, lower value
products towards low volume, higher value protection products.

FINAL

For a few quarters, this produced a drag on our published sales growth number, as we
were comparing a period where sales were lower but higher value, this year, to a period
where sales were relatively higher but lower value last year.
The beneficial impact of our new approach can now be seen more clearly in the figures
from the Third Quarter of last year, as they are truly comparable with the Third Quarter
figures this year. On that basis, APE was up 13% year over year. And NBP over the same
period was up 18% in local currency terms, validating this refocused strategy.
Moving now to China. Our strong start to the year in China was confirmed in the Third
Quarter and we're really pleased about this. Year-to-date APE sales are up 48%. And NBP
is up 44%, reflecting increased levels of cooperation with our JV partner, CITIC. And
rewarding us for our long-term approach to that market and our patience.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the discrete Third Quarter, reported APE was up 62%. This growth had been broadbased, with APE in the agency channel growing by 85% while the bank channel grew by
61%. In the agency channel, growth was led by higher productivity. And in the banking
channel by an increase in the number of branches where customers could buy our
products.
So let us finish this tour of Asia that took us to Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia
and China, by talking about Thailand. We have been operating with Thanachart Bank since
May this year. I am pleased to report that we have made a strong start to our new
relationship with Thanachart, which has achieved GBP15 million of sales in its first five
months of operations.
To put this in perspective, Thailand overall achieved total APE sales of GBP37 million for
the whole of 2012. So Thanachart has produced GBP15 million in five months this year. As a
result, as mentioned at the outset, overall Third Quarter sales more than doubled over
the prior period. And we have been able to activate over 90% of Thanachart's branches
since May so that most of these branches are now contributing to our sales.
Our bancassurance model is our core expertise and has been perfected over many years
of cooperating with our banking partners across the region. Our experience has allowed
us to work closely with Thanachart's pre-approval so that, with an approval on May 3, we
sold our first policies the next day on May 4. And all that means we were very pleased to
take the PLC Board to Bangkok for its annual meeting in Asia in September; a very
successful visit.
But speed of execution has become the core skill of our Company, as demonstrated in
the UOB partnership and now in the Thanachart partnership. This allows us to convert
quickly and effectively new distribution opportunities into tangible value, delivering
valuable products for our customers and meaningful returns for both our banking partners
and Prudential shareholders.

FINAL

Looking further ahead, the favorable structural trends of low insurance penetration,
significant demand for savings and protection products from a rapidly growing and
wealthier middle class, are not affected in any major way by short-term investment market
volatility. And continue to underpin our long-term prospects in the region.
The quality of the execution of our team in Asia, combined with the unique nature of our
multi-product, multi-distribution agent franchise, with top 3 positions across 8 out of our 12
markets, made us confident that we remain well positioned to deliver sustainable growth
in IFRS earnings and cash generation over the medium to long term.
In summary, our business in Asia has delivered strong sales and new business profits in
the Third Quarter. The quality of our execution, our ability to drive additive growth through
our bank and agency channels. And to sustain strong customer demand for our products
which meets real and important needs, were all key to delivering this performance.
We continue to see strong activity levels across our distribution channels. And remain
confident in our ability to capture the significant, long-term, profitable, organic growth
opportunity in our chosen market. And we remain on track to double Asia's 2009 new
business profit by 2013.

Bloomberg Transcript

Leaving Asia now for the US. The US market, we believe, continues to offer good longterm growth opportunities, due to the transition into retirement of a baby boomer
generation, which will create 10,000 retirees per day for the each of the next 20 years.
In that context, new business profits grew by 11%, to GBP756 million, benefiting from
higher volumes of our non-guaranteed variable annuity Elite Access, from pricing and
product actions. And from higher long-term interest rates.
We have continued to manage our volumes and product mix proactively in this highly
competitive market. As a result, Jackson reduced its sales of variable annuities with
guarantees by 15% to GBP12.5 billion. In parallel, sales of Elite Access grew to almost $3
billion in premium from $630 million last year.
Sales of variable annuities without living benefit guarantees, of which Elite Access is a
significant proportion, now represent 30% of our total variable annuity sales, up from 15%
at the same period last year, further evidence of a successful implementation of our
diversification strategy.
We continue to pull[ph] the same levels, adjusting pricing and product features as
appropriate, to achieve our target profitability, while remaining within our risk appetite.
Both hedging and policyholder behavior continued to track in line with our expectations.
In summary, in the US, we have continued to execute discipline, our strategy of optimizing
the balance of risk and value[ph].

FINAL

Moving now to the UK. Retail new business profits were up 2% ahead of last year at
GBP193 million, offsetting a 9% fall in retail sales volumes. This is an illustration of our value
over volume approach. Overall, new business profits were GBP204 million, reflecting
lower bulk annuity sales in the current year.
In retail annuities, I would like to underline the performance of our with-profits and
guarantees[ph] annuity product, which showed continued strong customer demand, with
volumes growing by 15% to GBP66 million.
In our internal vestings business, a positive impact of higher fund values was outweighed
by increased levels of customer deferrals, leaving overall annuity volumes 3% lower year
over year.
In other products, investment bond volumes fell, as expected, as a result of
implementation of a retail distribution review, while corporate pension volumes reflect our
selective participation in this market.

Bloomberg Transcript

While we remain well positioned to operate in the RDR environment, or post-RDR
environment, we expect the short-term disruption to persist, as both distributors and
customers adjust to the new regulatory landscape.
Looking now at our bulk annuity business, we completed one bulk annuity transaction in
the Third Quarter, worth GBP12 million of APE. Our approach to this market reflects our
disciplined capital allocation process, where we allocate capital only those transactions
that meet our high hurdles, in terms of return on capital and payback periods, as we make
all of our businesses across Europe compete for capital.
Lastly, I mentioned to you at the half year that we were reaching the closing stages of a
project to domesticate our with-profit business in Hong Kong. As announced in
September, we have now received approval from the UK and Hong Kong courts on the
timetable for the completion of this project.
We are aiming for the domestication to become effective from January 1, 2014. So overall,
the UK continues to perform well, in line with its stated strategic objectives.
Turning now to asset management. Our asset management businesses have delivered a
good performance with net inflows of GBP10.9 billion in the first nine months of this year.
And third-party funds under management growing by 18% this year to an historically high
level of GBP143 billion.
In our Third Quarter, M&G external funds under management of GBP124 billion were 19%
higher over last year, with year-to-date net inflows of GBP8.9 billion. This represents the
eighth consecutive year of net inflows for M&G. M&Gs diversification, by geography, by
channel, by fund and asset class. And its strong investment performance, differentiates
our business from most of its peers. And has helped it deliver a strong performance over
a long period.

FINAL

Eastspring Investments, our Asian asset management business, saw a 12% increase in
external funds under management, with positive net inflows in the Third Quarter offset by
adverse investment market movements.
Let's say a few words, at this point, about our balance sheet. We continue to remain
defensively positioned on the asset side of our balance sheet. At the end of September,
our IGD surplus remained a robust GBP3.9 billion, which is stated after deducting the 2013
interim dividend. And is equivalent to a cover of 230%[ph].
To finish, I'd like to give you our outlook for the remainder of the year. Our strong
performance for this year. And in particular, our strong Third Quarter, continues to be
driven by Asia, with the US and the UK also making material contributions. The
macroeconomic context is improving, with advanced economies showing signs of
recovery.
Asian emerging markets are forecast to continue to grow at faster rates than developed
economies. And will continue to account for a significant share of future global growth. We
believe the Asian economies fundamentally have enough policy flexibility and leverage to
perform well across the cycle[ph].

Bloomberg Transcript

The underlying drivers of our profitable expansion in Asia, rapidly growing and wealthier
middle class with significant unmet savings and protection needs, remain intact. Our
leading market position in our chosen sweet spot markets. And our excellent execution,
allow us to provide valuable products and services to our customers. And generate
significant shareholder value.
In the US, we remain focused on meeting the retirement needs of a growing baby
boomer population, while in the UK, our with-profits annuity and asset management
business in M&G are profitably serving the better relation[ph] and savings needs of an
aging population. We are confident of delivering our 2013 objectives.
We can now move on to Q&A.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Blair Stewart, BofA Merrill Lynch.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Three quick questions. Firstly, maybe a few words on the business in the Philippines. And
how that's been affected by the unfortunate events of late.
Secondly, with the US separate account assets up strongly. And the business mix
improving, seems inevitable that that business will be capable of returning significantly

Page 8 of 31

more cash to the Group. I just wondered what shapes management thinking in terms of
whether to return that or to keep it within the local entity.

FINAL

And thirdly, just on Eastspring. I noticed that flows were somewhat flat, in Q3; I just
wondered if there was anything going on there. Thank you.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, Blair. On the Philippines. And again I wanted to renew how sorry we are
about what is going on there, we have been extremely proactive. To give you some
numbers, we have 7,401 agents. And 486 staff in the Philippines. So it's a significant
business.
What we do in those cases we really have a well-established process, unfortunately, to
handle this because typhoons are a feature of life in Asia. We have a well-established
process. So we account for all of our staff. In the worst place, which is Tacloban, we have
about 60 agents. Unfortunately, out of the 60, 28 have not been yet accounted for. And
we are working actively to find them.

Bloomberg Transcript

In addition to that, we always work with NGOs, you know we have a very extensive
cooperation, particularly with Save The Children, in the region. And I was in contact with
Justin Forsyth yesterday. And we have made funds available to them to alleviate some of
the situation. we have also committed to matching all our staff donations across the world.
In our experience. And probably (inaudible) and the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, is
that our staff are very generous. And that will lead to material amounts.
So at a high level, that's what we're doing. And frankly, at this point, the business is low on
our list of priorities. It's first of all human tragedy. And we need to deal with that.
The US, yes, look we've had a strategy which has been very clear of growing the funds
under management. In the end, that drives our earnings; you've noticed the operation of
earnings, which is very pleasing.
That will allow me to make an important comment on the cash. What we're focused on,
especially in the new post crisis world, is cash generation, rather cash remittance. So what
I can tell you, Blair, is that the cash generation will remain extremely healthy. And will grow
very significantly.
Remittances are a different matter, because we live in the new world where there's dialog
with regulators around that. And we really have three concerns; one is to continue to
rebuild.
The business gets bigger, which is what we keep telling everybody. Everybody's pleased
with our growth. And so are we. But if your business is growing at 15%, 20% the balance
sheet grows too. So part of what we generate has to be retained.

Page 9 of 31



Company N ame: Prudential PL C
Company Ticker: PRU L N Equity
Date: 2013-11-14

And if you just want to keep the same capital strength, you have to retain a proportion of
that. You have to reinvest in the business, because we're writing at extremely attractive
IRRs.

FINAL

I'm not sure everybody realizes that. But VAs currently have the highest margins ever.
After all the pricing actions. And the turning the cycle, we are writing at extremely high
margins. So it's a very attractive business.
And finally, you have to remit. And really you know we don't hold cash; we don't keep cash
any more than is prudent in the businesses. But after that, the level of remittance has to
be agreed with the regulator and has to be prudent.
But over the long term. And I wouldn't commit over a six months period, or one year
period, over the long term, meaning two, three, four years, yes, with growing cash
generation you can expect growing remittances. But there may be time lags at different
points in time.

Bloomberg Transcript

And Eastspring, you're right, that's the one place, possibly, where you can see the impact
of the so-called Asian crisis. Because it is, of everything we do, the most exposed to
short-term economic effect and market volatility. So yes, Eastspring had flattish flows in
the Third Quarter. And that was expected; there's nothing untoward. It's just a
consequence of what's going on in the markets in the region that have been quite
agitated.
But I'd just like to make a comment there on interest rates, because I think there's
sometimes confusion. As you know, our exposure to interest rates is to long-term interest
rates. And it remains geared positively to interest rates.
Fundamentally, if you think about Asia's two businesses, interest rate guaranteed
products and protection, on the interest rate guaranteed products, higher interest rate
are positive. And on the protection business it's in an EV[ph] world, not only the cash flow,
in an EV world, (so maybe it's) negative, because it's discounted at a higher rate.
But net/net. And we give you sensitivities now and disclosure it's[ph] positive. So higher
interest rate between what we gain, if you look at Hong Kong you've seen that the NBP
really increased more than 60%; that's interest rates. And net/net, it's a positive in Asia.
So long-term interest rate will give positively. And really the short end we're not really
exposed to. And a lot of the market chattering[ph] is cautious about the short end of the
yield curve, which really has a limited impact on our economies[ph], very limited impact.
And actually, if interest rates in the short term go up to defend the currency, that's a very
positive for us. And if they go up to control inflation, that's very positive for us, too,
because inflation is bad. And no long-term inflation is good[ph]. So that's how we look at
the whole interest rate question in Asian market and market volatility.

That's great. Thank you very much.

Operator
Jon Hocking, Morgan Stanley.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

I've got three questions, please. On the US, I just wonder if you could comment on how
long this mixture from guaranteed to non-guaranteed products could continue? How far
can you take this. And are you seeing any push back from distributors on that front? This is
the first question.
Second question, wonder if you could comment a little bit on M&G, what's happening in
terms of the types of products you're selling? Are you seeing a shift out of fixed income
into equity strategies. And what's happening geographically in terms of distribution?
Then finally, I just wondered whether Jackie had any initial views on Pru UK, versus her old
shop[ph]. And what's she thinks the opportunity might be for the business? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Thank you, Jon; thank you very much.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

I don't expect her to answer the compare/contrast. But I thought I'd ask.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

I didn't expect anything less from you. US, we have (inaudible) Mike on the line; so Mike,
do you want to take the first one?

A - Mike Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Yes. I think, Jon, we're obviously -- the mixtures that we talked about in New York. And the
attempt here isn't a full transition from one product to another, its products that work
across the cycle; the lead access is focused on diversifying the client's asset.
So your question about the BDs and the distribution, the broker dealers, they actually like
the product a lot. They're looking to us for a lot of training in branches and with the
advisors. And we've spent a lot of time prepping the wholesalers. And as we discussed,
about a year before we launched, getting their skills up to deal with third-party
constituents in this. And actually, we're bringing some real value here.

Page 11 of 31

FINAL

And that's the feedback we're getting. So zero push back from our distribution partners. If
anything, they've more time in the offices, more time on the product.
The one thing you are seeing is, the S&P[ph] in the US had a huge run this year. And so I'm
exceptionally pleased with the numbers of lead access, given the fact it's an alternative
asset. But the S&P, which is having quite a dramatic year. So no issues there at all. We're
going to continue to drive the mix of products away from guarantees. But as Tidjane
mentioned earlier, the margin on our core P2[ph] product is excellent. So we're not
unhappy with the sales there, either.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

So the distributors don't feel in any way backing away from the guaranteed product and
having to go to competitors to fill those sales needs?

A - Mike Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, different question. We're doing activities right now, similar to what we did in the last
year, where we're not accepting 1035s for a period managing capacity. And it's a very
different set of conversations this year than the last year. Part of having done it once. And
returned to the market successfully. And we've done everything we said we were going
to do, which last year we had a lot of competitors breaking against us that were going
away and all sorts of silliness.
What you're hearing from competitors is, they'd rather us maintain the product quality.
And a proper balance between consumer pricing and stakeholder pricing, versus raising
the fees again to manage volume. And having a less quality product.
So any time you disrupt a sale process, somebody's unhappy with you. But the number of
calls. And the tone of the calls, are materially different than last year.
I'm not going to tell you, Jon, that everybody was happy. But we're not getting the -- they
appreciate the integrity issue on the product. And I'm hearing that more and more. And
I've talked to a dozen retail reps this year that do a lot of business for -- this week, I'm
sorry, do a lot of business for us. And that's the tone of the calls.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. That's very clear.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Okay? So M&G, first thing I'd like to say about M&G is that the result we've had have been
absolutely outliers[ph], completely exceptional by any historic standards. And so is the
level of flows have been just stunning.
And you should expect some mid reversion there, because historically the flows were
GBP2 billion, GBP3 billion, GBP 4 billion, not GBP8 billion, GBP9 billion, GBP10 billion. And I

Page 12 of 31



Company N ame: Prudential PL C
Company Ticker: PRU L N Equity
Date: 2013-11-14

expect that over time, it's going to go and rise[ph].

FINAL

Looking at this year, really structurally we've had very strong flows in Europe. And negative
flows in the UK. It will be volatile month by month; an improvement recently we've seen in
the UK. But overall that's the net picture.
So if you think that retail is about GBP5.9 billion[ph], you've got something like GBP6.5
billion, GBP6.4 billion[ph], of positive flows outside the UK. And minus GBP0.9 billion[ph] in
the UK, roughly. That gives you overall[ph] balances EPNS[ph] and in the US only small[ph].
So the feature, the structure, has been that. If you look at products, as the equity flows
are higher, period for period they're about 23% of the flows now. And they were 13% last
year. So there's been a -- unsurprisingly, you only see that[ph] cyclical shift towards equity.
And that transition is going to pay out; we're quite relaxed about it. Money will flow out of
fixed income and will go into equity. It's underway. And it's going to continue in the coming
quarters.
So Jackie, we've given you enough time to think about your answer.

Thank you, Tidjane. And morning, Jon. So by way of opening, really I should just highlight,
obviously I'm two months into the new role. And I have been saying to all who will listen
that I do get a bit of a honeymoon period. I'm still looking at parts of the business. And
forming some views. Initial observations --

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Not just the honeymoon.

A - Jackie Hunt

{BIO 16204866 <GO>}

Initial observations, you wouldn't expect me to do a significant compare-and-contrast. But
clearly the strategy for Pru UK is very different to Standard Life strategy. It's a much more
risk-based business, as opposed to the asset-gathering model. And really, plays to its
strengths I think in that risk space.
So if you look at the areas. And what attracted me in part to the role, we have an
immensely strong retail brand. But we differ from some others which are largely
intermediator brands. I think that gives us the resonance; we're still the man from the Pru.
And Prudence. And all these things, in the consumer arena. And I think that has paid
actually hugely to our benefit over the course of the last four, five years.
If you look at our with-profits fund performance, clearly that has been strong against
backdrop of a product that hasn't sold in large quantities elsewhere. And that is driven,
really, by the customer performance that there's been off the back of those with profits
funds.

FINAL

So again, when we talk in December I'll share with you some of the analysis, many of you
will have seen it, how strong Pru UK's with-profits performance has been, relative to other
similar funds out there.
And finally, I think the thing I would highlight is around annuities; obviously, it's a key
strength of our business. It is a growing part of the market. There are areas where we
have what I would see as market-leading propositions. So something like the income
choice annuity. You've seen a significant uptick in the sales of income choice annuity
products over the course of the last nine months. And that's because it's the perfect
customer proposition, inasmuch as it gives a secure income with some opportunity for
upside as well.
So we will come back, I think, to this broader question of observations on December 10.
But maybe that gives you a little bit of a sense, Jon.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

I wanted a couple of follow-up questions, one for Jackie. Has she reflected at all on the
linkage between life companies and fund management groups in the asset-gathering
space? Because that was an area which I think Standard were exploring a lot. And it's
where I[ph] think a different strategy has been taken.
And secondly, I wanted to follow up on what you were talking about in terms of capital
generation, cash to Group, in the US. The implications seem to be that here was a one-off
uplift in the regulator's requirements for capital for you in the United States, where you
wouldn't be able to remit cash back to Group from the US business in 2014. Was that a
wrong deduction?

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Everybody here is shaking their heads. It is a wrong deduction, if I may[ph]. But maybe I
was too cautious in my comments. I'm just very reluctant to commit to very short-term
remittance, to make shorter remittance[ph] commitments, because it is just not smart,
frankly. It's not the way things work.
We have a very good relationship with all the regulators involved. But the dialog is always
ahead of us. And we shouldn't preempt that dialog. But the rules are very transparent.
And our remittance work is very transparent. So no, we think that the level we have
achieved is a sustainable level. So I'm not plugging[ph] any concern. Sorry if I created the
wrong impression.

FINAL

Jackie, life fund management?

A - Jackie Hunt

{BIO 16204866 <GO>}

Yes, I think again, Andrew, it's an area that I have felt and continue to feel strongly on,
where you can actually drive value across the Group. Where you do find, obviously large
companies often in a better place to distribute and asset managers effectively to drive
some of that retail growth performance. And elsewhere, it has been a strategy that has
begun to pay off.

Bloomberg Transcript

When it comes to where we are today, I believe strongly that you place your strengths, in
the first instance. And clearly as I said in some of my earlier comments, our strengths here
are on the annuity space and in the with-profit space more generally. So to my mind,
that's really where we need to make sure we remain very focused, where we continue to
actually generate the right financial outcomes for shareholders. And Tidjane's talked a lot
about capital and cash generation; that will continue to be a significant focus of mine in
the UK business.
I do think where the opportunity is to potentially broaden our approach we will look at
those, make sure that we're not leaving any opportunities on the table. But it feels to me
that that particular one is further down the list of priorities than some of the areas you
would expect me to be concentrating on, things like enhanced annuities, those sorts of
parts of the market.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Absolutely. And also, as you know, there is, even today, a very strong relationship
between our life business and M&G. They work very closely together and we encourage
them to do a lot of things together. We're getting a lot of the synergies already today.

Operator

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

I wondered if you'd comment on the Omnibus II agreement that's just come out.
Obviously, we don't have a lot of details, apart from hearsay. But it seems like a bigger
volatility balance, provisional equivalents, etc., etc. How do you feel about it, in terms of
your Group. But also how does it potentially change product strategy? That's question
area one.
Question two, going back to John's question about the mix of non-guaranteed and
guaranteed annuities of VAs in the US. So am I right in thinking that you're still potentially
Page 15 of 31



Company N ame: Prudential PL C
Company Ticker: PRU L N Equity
Date: 2013-11-14

likely to increase the non-guaranteed portion, therefore there's still going to be a
countercyclical element to your growth rates? Or, do you think, given the really strong
margins, you could possibly start pushing the guaranteed side a lot more and maybe
change from your recent approach?

FINAL

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Thank you. On Solvency II, as you said yourself, we're getting emails as this call is ongoing
on the agreement that has been reached. My first reaction is to say that I am pleased that
there has been an agreement, because we all know that businesses and markets don't
like uncertainty. And 13 years is enough.
So there's a bit of relief that we are moving towards closure. And really on our big, big
issues, which you know, are pro-cyclicality[ph] having countercyclical buffers, I think we won
the intellectual agreement within the industry. And we got so much in adjustment, there
are technical issues there. I haven't seen the text. So I think that BBB (inaudible) worried
about. I'm not sure what the resolution has been but I have every reason to believe that
it's positive because suddenly the UK treasury and the UK regulator have all been well
aligned now for what is necessary for the long-term health of the UK industry.

Bloomberg Transcript

So overall, in short, I think it's a good package. But I have to wait until I see the detail. And
what we're hearing on equivalents sounds positive also. I've heard 10 year mentioned, I've
heard provisional equivalents, 10 year renewable; that's what we hear from a (break)
point. That's also great progress compared to where we were a few years ago. So
suddenly, as the leadership of this Company, I probably have never felt better about
Solvency II certainly my years here.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

That sounds very positive.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Yes, product strategy it's too early. We don't even know what it is. So it's too early to talk
about that. But we'll come back to it. But from what I say you can deduct that there is no
earthquake, no drastic change, because we basically have been able to -We've always argued that keeping it about -- we are a long-term business. So the
premises of when you fail[ph] is that you liquidate all your liabilities instantaneously
doesn't make sense for an insurance company. Even in a failed insurance company you
liquidate the liabilities as they come due. That is the orderly way to do it and that's how
every insurance failure has been handled.
So with the one year bar[ph] approach which is completely banking based, well that's
wrong. It was very difficult over the years to get people to recognize that. I think we got
over that.

FINAL

We are happy with any solvency regime as long as it takes into account the specificities of
our industry and it doesn't lead us to do things that are damaging to the customers,
damaging to the economy, the long-term growth potential of the economy, through the
savings rates linked to investment rates. And employment and growth for instance, by
stopping us from investing in infrastructure or from financing the corporate sector beyond
five years. Or for that possibility[ph] in financing the government beyond five years. There
are very few AAA countries these days.
Anyway, I'll stop, because my list of my issues with the old framework is long. So we make
good progress.
VAs, a follow-up for you Mike? Do you want to -- ?

A - Mike Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No. I think it's a good question. The things we look at is, we're looking for the quality mix
of our earnings and the strength of the balance sheet. So you have product mix in that,
you have the appetite for with-guarantees. We don't have a materially different view of
that year over year, even with the improvement in interest rates involved; again, those
short-term looks. The book looks outstanding, just from a quality point of view, both the
level of guarantee and as was mentioned earlier, in the performance the consumers have
enjoyed.
We think we have a really good product that works for the retirees. We think Elite Access
is a really good product; it diversifies[ph] away from complete equity in bond exposure
for the retirees and potential retirees. And I think that what you're seeing is to do with the
balance sheet and earnings issues with the consumer demand need issues. Those are
going towards an appetite for a range of products and guarantees. That's what the
industry's producing now as well, as a number of competitors have decided they like this
business again.
We're watching what each of them are doing carefully and we don't have any material
increase at all in our appetite for with-guarantee. We think we're writing a pretty good
level now and I think that's demonstrated by a slowing down of sales here at year end.

Q - Farooq Hanif

Okay. That's really clear. Thank you.

Q - Alan Devlin

{BIO 5936254 <GO>}

Just a couple of follow-ups on the US. The impact of higher interest rates is very positive
on your new business margin. I just wondered if you could give us some kind of color on

Page 17 of 31



Company N ame: Prudential PL C
Company Ticker: PRU L N Equity
Date: 2013-11-14

FINAL

the impact on the in-force. And possibly VA business on the supplier based[ph] business.
Should we see similar impact on net profitability there?
Then, second, just following up from the last point, if you could give us a bit of color on
the competitive environment in the US? I think one of your competitors, Lincoln National,
has got some reinsurance capacity to help them grow. One of the things you mentioned
IRRs are at a record high there. Do you think they'll start to come down as the competitive
environment increases? Thanks.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Thank you, Alan. Maybe I'll ask Nic to take the first one and Mike the second one.

A - Nic Nicandrou

{BIO 15589153 <GO>}

Morning, Alan. The impact of higher interest rates is positive. But when you think about the
Vas, that manifests itself in the high discounting of the obligations that we have, the very
long-term obligations for any policies that are In the Money. So a higher interest rate
discount[ph] those that are lower, or the discount effect is lower. So it's positive in terms
of the economic exposures that we have on obligations.

Bloomberg Transcript

In relation to earnings, you're right, that does come through on the fixed account. You
would have seen that the business that we've written in the course of Third Quarter,
because of the higher interest rate base, we've locked into a higher spread. It was up by
around 55 basis points compared to this time last year, or 50 basis points compared to
the first half.
So it comes through in the economics that we're securing on the fixed account business.
But we are writing, of course, the back book. It's cash flow matched at the point of writing
the business. So there is -- the in-force book the impact of the current rise in interest rates
is not that significant.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Thank you, Nic. Do you want to give some color on the competitive environment, Mike,
please?

A - Mike Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Yes. The Lincoln deal is interesting; it's a subsidiary of Wells Fargo that's doing the
reinsurance on their withdrawal benefit. We haven't seen the actual agreement. But I think
it's generally positive when you see large financial players backing the space, backing the
products.
As you guys know, we never left it. So I see it more as an industry endorsement, no
different than you're seeing some of these other competitors now come back to the
market, with obviously much higher appetites for VAs with guarantees.

Page 18 of 31

FINAL

But the environment is interesting. I think the competitors are -- the trends, as we
discussed in New York, continue. You're seeing a lot of these attempts to -- the risk
management overlays from vol only -- vol-controlled funds to forced allocations to these
sorts of models. And they definitely have some advantages for the writer and for the
consumer, if used correctly.
The disadvantage is, when the S&P is up materially, they're not going to participate in that,
the same way a portfolio of value centric in the more diversified funds are going to do.
So each of the strategies has strengths and weaknesses. Pru US has got a new product
this year; they're pushing hard, which is focused -- it's a VA with effectively a bond-only
portfolios in it that's kind of interesting.
But again, these all go to individual firms' agendas and what they're trying to accomplish
with their own balance sheets, as well as trying to find if there's a consumer need for what
they're putting out there.
But it's a pretty good crop of products right now. I think that's healthy for us as an industry.
I think you're seeing it reflected into the earlier part of your question, the interest rate and
accurately reflected in the valuations of the US sector in general.

Bloomberg Transcript

And some of our competitors are much more geared -- or need higher interest rate
levels for their back books to be effective.
As Nic mentioned, we've hedged interest rates, as we told you, for a long time. So that's
not a particularly material issue for us right now.

Q - Alan Devlin

{BIO 5936254 <GO>}

Thanks very much.

Operator
Oliver Steel, Deutsche Bank.

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Two questions. One is actually just really more of the same on the last question, I'm
afraid, which is how do you see the outlook for US margins from here? Because you
actually raised your pricing earlier in the year and it's coming through in the margin. But
equally, you're also saying it's the best margins you've ever seen, I think, on VAs.
The second question is, the comments you make about the review into policy behavior
you've done is a little vague. You talk about generally in line with assumptions; I wonder if
you could just expand on that and particularly where it isn't in line and to what degree?

Page 19 of 31



Company N ame: Prudential PL C
Company Ticker: PRU L N Equity
Date: 2013-11-14

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Thanks, Oliver. And I did in my remarks comment on how high the margins are, because I
think that's not always understood.

FINAL

And the policy behavior, of course, is an important point. We spent a lot of time on that at
the Investor Day last year. So Mike, I'll let you take both.

A - Mike Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

I've got Chad sitting next to me; I made him get up. Do you mind if I have him do the
policyholder behavior one? (Laughter). Chad, why don't you go ahead on that second
piece. And I'll do the margin piece?

A - Chad Myers

{BIO 2234559 <GO>}

Sure. So on the policyholder behavior side, I think as you're aware, we do an annual
refresh of the experience studies, which we tend to complete in middle of the year,
portions of which will get reflected at midyear and portions of which get reflected at the
second half of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

And so you'll see the net result come through at the year-end results. But from what
we've seen, broadly speaking, lapse rates, utilization rates, the main things that drive VA
are continuing to be in line with long-term assumptions.
We make minor tweaks every year as the experience warrants and this year is, I think, very
much like what we've seen in prior years, which was that our guesses are reasonably
good and we're not seeing any major shifts in policyholder behavior.
I'd say the only interesting part there is it's still on the very extreme cases, we just don't
have a lot of experience. As Mike mentioned, most of our book is well Out of the Money
and we do have some experience through the financial crisis to try to extrapolate from.
Trying to set assumptions and the scenarios is still a little bit tricky. But we've been very
defensive there, as I think we've shown in multiple venues in terms of just how adverse
we assume the policyholder behavior to be in those scenarios.
But in terms of everything we're seeing that we have available information for, we're very
much in line with where we've been in the past.

A - Mike Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Then, Oliver, on the margin piece. I think the clearest way I could explain it is, we have the
number one product in the space. So we have now as I told you[ph] a couple of weeks
ago that we have the 1, 3 and 5 product now with Elite Access in the independent broker
dealer space and they're all top 10 in the US industry.
We like the pricing on the product. We can sell more of it than we're interested in selling in
a given year. So I think that demand is there, telling me that we priced correctly in the

Page 20 of 31



Company N ame: Prudential PL C

Date: 2013-11-14

FINAL

consumer and advisors' view. It's clearly benefiting from the higher interest rates. And I
think one of the questions on margin would be your own opinion on where you think US
rates are going, long term.
But we don't anticipate any need to -- we certainly don't need to reduce margins to sell
more; that's not in the plan. And we think that the quality of the product for the consumer
is very high. So I think we're at a very good balance of the different stakeholders' issues
there.

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Thank you very much. And just to follow up on the first answer, does that mean basically
that there shouldn't be any material changes to assumptions at year end on a net basis?

A - Chad Myers

{BIO 2234559 <GO>}

That's correct, yes. Let's just say, on a net basis, it's going to be in line with what we've
seen in prior years. I guess maybe I can answer it this way; we're not looking at anything
like we've seen what our competitors come out with in terms of major announcements on
profit or[ph] (inaudible) revisions.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

That's a key point really. You shouldn't expect anything from us (inaudible).

Q - William Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

I've just got two quick questions left. First of all, could you just give a sense of how the
statutory capital of the US business has developed over 2013?
And secondly, just on the Elite Access product, could you give us a bit more color in terms
of how your competitors have responded in that space?

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Okay. Chad, probably one for you, stat capital.

A - Chad Myers

{BIO 2234559 <GO>}

Sure, I think as I mentioned last year in New York a scenario like we've seen with equities
up as much as they are this year is not -- from a statutory perspective our reserves are
getting to floor type of levels as I mentioned. So we're getting some asymmetrical
Page 21 of 31



Company N ame: Prudential PL C
Company Ticker: PRU L N Equity
Date: 2013-11-14

accounting on the statutory side. But irrespective of that, we're still seeing pretty strong
capital formation through the first nine months and we see --

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

FINAL

Sorry Chad, can I stop you. We're hearing someone typing on a keyboard, if you can go
on mute maybe?

A - Chad Myers

{BIO 2234559 <GO>}

So we've seen, despite the fact that the capital formation has been held back somewhat
by the market being up as much as it is and the asymmetrical accounting at this point in
time, we're still seeing a planned level type of capital formation. And with the strong fee
base that continues to build as markets go up, that's obviously a short-term positive;
REALIC's been a very good capital formation tool for us over the last year.
Let's say, with equity markets being up as much as they are, that's again depressing
capital formation somewhat but still, despite that, we've managed to be, let's say, in line
with plan.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Next question was Elite Access with competition, really for you, Mike.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mike Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Yes. There's about a half dozen products out now from various firms and some in the
process of launching. We never anticipated we'd have the space to ourselves. So I think
it's, again, a validation of the success of the product. And I think you've seen from the
numbers we're about GBP4.3 billion through September on the launch. That's about as
successful as anybody's launch in the VA that's profitable. So I think it's drawing attention
from our peers.
Proper competition will broaden the dialog, increase the dialog, broaden the market
space. Right now, the firms that US industry research would suggest are the three top
brands in wholesale[ph] are BlackRock, Jackson and Fidelity. So I don't think it's a bad
thing if we've got more people out there talking about the correct use of that.
I'm not real concerned about the competition in the space of this point candidly. It's a
pretty sophisticated product to wholesale and I think you'll see the impact of the quality of
our distribution team relative to peers in these numbers. When you lay these products
side by side with ours over similar time periods, launched x number of quarters and see
how everybody does.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

And just to build on what Mike said. And he's made that point. But just keep in mind all
these products are also -- the sales are market dependent. Can always underestimate

Page 22 of 31



Company N ame: Prudential PL C

the impact of something like the S&P (inaudible). And the S&P has probably been in the
last 12 months the single best investment anybody could make on a risk adjusted basis.

FINAL

So alternative (inaudible) have returned less and you see yourselves being impacted by
that and that's just normal and that's why we talk of diversification. As you go through
cycles and markets move, it's good to have several options what you can push at different
points in time. And Elite Access gives us a really very, very useful diversification.

Operator
Greig Paterson, KBW.

Q - Greig Paterson
Just three questions. One is just on the Eastspring outflows; I wonder if you could just talk
to the potential for assumption changes on the Asian EEV, for persistency at the year end
here[ph]?

Bloomberg Transcript

Second just basically the same question; can you talk about the US in terms of assumption
changes at the year end, just considering that Eastspring weak persistency? I was just
trying to see if there was a change.
And the other thing is, did I hear correctly that Jackie said she was looking at enhanced
annuities? I thought you, Tidjane, stood up at the half year and said you didn't like it
because of the cannibalization, etc., etc? I suppose when you're answering that question
you could give us an update on the FCA investigation into why not as much product is
going open market, how that would have impact on you?
And the third, I was looking over the weekend and looking at my Fourth Quarter numbers
and I realize that the Indonesian currency has depreciated again quite materially in the
Fourth Quarter. And I know it's a key element of your Asian sales. Does that mean that
you've had a major up -- in order to count it and hit the targets for the year have had a
major uptick recently in the Indonesian agency numbers? To me, that's the other thing
that must have moved for you to have confidence.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you for the questions. Nic, do you want to take Eastspring outflow, the EEV?

A - Nic Nicandrou

{BIO 15589153 <GO>}

The outflows that we report in the IMS, Greig, only relate to external third-party business.
So they are not indicative of what's happening to flows on the life side. Flows on the life
side, by way of an update, we've seen no change to the trends that we've been reporting
over the last few years. So there is no new news today in terms of the stickiness of our
Asian life business flows, which ultimately is what gets included and incorporated into our
EEV assumptions. So for third-party business we don't put them on an EEV basis. So
there's no changes.

No. The flows are excellent; that's why I didn't understand your comment about outflows.
The flows on the life side are excellent, as you would expect with the commercial
performance we've had. So those numbers we give are about third-party business,
nothing to do with EEV, okay.
So enhanced annuities, Jackie, do you want to say what our thinking is there?

A - Jackie Hunt

Yes.

Q - Greig Paterson
Just that Jackie mentioned that a new (multiple speakers) half-year?

A - Tidjane Thiam

We're noting the question; we're trying to answer. Jackie, can you?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jackie Hunt

{BIO 16204866 <GO>}

Greig, just by of context we do actually participate in enhanced market, both externally
and internally as we stand today. Although we, in practice, tend to more commonly quote
for and win business with more serious medical conditions, we tend to be more
competitive there. I think my comment. And clearly Tidjane can clarify what his comments
were around. But my comment was much more the market is moving increasingly towards
individual underwriting in various forms, or individual risk assessments of some form.
So while I wouldn't be saying we would aggressively compete to win business in a very
narrow niche space, I think, as the largest annuity writer out there, we do need to have a
very clear strategy around how we defend and how we continue to compete in the open
market more generally. And clearly, some of the products that we've developed and also
the thoughts within the business are focusing into that market change that's underway at
the moment.
You asked then, I think, about the --

We do postcode pricing and we do some other enhanced around medical conditions as
well. I think something like -- I've seen stats of probably about 8% of enhanced annuities
are coming through Prudential in some form is the market level I've been seeing more
generally. So it's part of the product suite out there. I think there's potentially more we can
do, as much around defensive positioning as well as offensive.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

But I think your fundamental point is one Jackie just mentioned, she hit the nail on the
head, we're moving towards individual pricing. And you will see us, in our language, get
away from all those definitions. At the end of the day, the pricing has to be based on the
personal risk assessment. That's what we're working on and refining and aligning our
systems to do. That's the direction we're taking.
Sorry, you were asking about the FCA investigation?

Q - Greig Paterson
You guys are probably the biggest example of success in internal vestings. The FCA is
doing a major investigation into why clients are not getting the best terms, i.e., they're not
shopping around. Just want to talk about what level[ph] you seem to be most vulnerable. I
just wonder if you could give an update.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Jackie go ahead, of course, yes.

A - Jackie Hunt

{BIO 16204866 <GO>}

I think, Greig, both prior to the implementation of the ABI code and now subsequent to
further refining our processes around the code, we're very clear that we are encouraging
out internal customers to shop around and to make sure they are getting good value for
money.
We do see some of our products. And I talked a bit about the income choice annuities
actually being market leading. So in some parts, the fact that vesting levels are holding
consistent with where they've been previously, to me is not necessarily an indication they
aren't shopping around, or they aren't aware of it, it's an indication that we do actually
have a very strong product out there that meets the customer need.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Another issue[ph], you probably noticed that the ABI announced today a review. So there
is a lot of work with the ABI Board yesterday afternoon, there's a lot of work at the
industry level around all that, to make sure that the customer gets the best deal. We are
active participants in these reviews; we don't see them as a threat. They're things we
absolutely support and want to be involved in. So quite relaxed about it. We have a good
dialog with the FCA on all these issues.

FINAL

As you can imagine, we have a lot of research. The reasons why people stay with us are
actually the right ones. They understand that an annuity is not just about price. That it's
important when you're 85 that your provider is still there. That it's important that the
commitments are kept. So they're actually quite smart. They go differently from the
direction the press is pushing them towards, which would be to just be to go for the
highest price. They make a considered judgment to stay with a company they believe[ph].
The way we work now, we go out of our way to get them to shop around and look. But
when you have a GBP20,000 pot, you just feel it's not worth it. You're very happy where
you are. And in spite of all the efforts we make, they stay. There's been no change in our
vesting rate.
What you've seen, the decrease in annuities is pure deferring. But there's been no
change in the vesting rate, no discernible change. Anyway, it's an interesting area. But
sometimes people are quite rational. It is quite rational for people with those types of
products to not waste time shopping around and stay with their provider if they're happy.

Bloomberg Transcript

Indonesia, it's an important question. We do not -- okay, our investment proposition is
simple. There is a lot of evidence that FX, over the long term, is highly correlated to GDP
growth. We are winning in markets with structurally higher GDP growth than the west. I
think the prospects that Europe will start growing faster than Asia are limited.
Our long-term belief is that the Asian currencies will appreciate, compared to the
European currencies. That is the strategy. And thank God we don't run the business with
an eye to short-term exchange rate. We are a locally based business. We're locally
matched in terms of currencies, our assets and liabilities. And we run the business to
generate the best result in local currency. We're very confident that, over time, that will
translate in a higher result in western currencies because the Asian currencies can only
appreciate. We have not turned up the recruiting in Indonesia because of pound/rupiah
parity moves; that's not how we run the business. The business is up 22% on a local basis;
that's what we maximize.
Within the year, as we've told you in the past, the flows are hedged. Inter-year, they're not
hedged at all because we think one of the big attractions of our stock for investors who
believe what we believe, is that FX appreciation will flow into our results, over time. So we
do not run the Group in function of short-term currency movements. That's really (multiple
speakers).

Q - Greig Paterson
What I was trying to do, Tidjane, is you said you've got confidence in the -- I'm just thinking
about the Fourth Quarter number and your share price correlation to the sales. You said
you'd got a lot of confidence. And as I was going through all the little product
developments and everything you've done. And I came unstuck when I was looking at
Indonesia. Once I adjusted for the currency to date, I went, in what light[ph] in the Fourth
Quarter. I was just brainstorming and thinking well maybe there's been a surge in agents
or something like that to counter it.

FINAL

I can help you. Take the Fourth Quarter of last year, I know you're very focused on NBP,
actually I probably have time to just say a few words about NBP again, because I think I
said at the half year I really don't like NBP because I know the community's very focused
on it. One it's an EV-based measure metric and I don't like EV; I'm on the record as that.
It's very much interest rate-sensitive because of the NPV aspect.
So talking about protection, which is a great business, it's pure cash. It's not interest ratesensitive. It's made interest rate sensitive by NBP, which is really, really stupid. So NBP tells
you about the great growth in[ph] premium you're getting in Indonesia are less valuable
when the Indonesian interest rate goes up and we don't believe that. There is some of it
but on a cash basis, it's just not true. There is some of it that is misleading.
It depends on a lot of things that we don't control. It moves up and down depending on -we've been on the record saying that our forward target is the one we like to list. That all
being said, take the Q4 NBP and look in 2012 and look at how much it has to grow for us
to hit the target in Q4 this year. So you do GBP1,426 million, which is the target, minus
GBP990 million, that's GBP536 million[ph] if my math is correct. And you compare that to
the Q4 NBP and you'll see what kind of growth we need in Asia to hit the target. That's
why we're confident. Having 13 countries and 11 life[ph] business to play on that we can -and we will hit the target in sales in Indonesia, no question.

Question on UK annuities, please. Could you expand upon your comments? You said that
you're seeing people defer the decision to annuitize. Are you referring specifically for Q3.
And what are you seeing in Q4 in that respect?
Then I had a follow-up on what you said just now on augmenting your IT systems to cater
for underwriting medical-enhanced annuities. What exactly are you doing? Thanks.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

I'll let Jackie start on that one.

A - Jackie Hunt

{BIO 16204866 <GO>}

Sure. In terms of the deferral behavior, the ABI code was implemented, as most of you
would know, around the Third Quarter time, just pre-Third Quarter. The big things that it
really drove was previously when packs were sent out to people who were coming to
annuitization point, the application form would go along with it.

FINAL

The process has now changed so it's actually a two-stage process that takes about six
months. There are opportunities and further conversations with customers along the way
to say, have you done what you need to do around shopping around. Now what we've
seen as a consequence of that. And I think it's an industry-wide trend, I certainly saw it in
some other announcements that have been made the last few weeks, is that more
annuitants are coming to this point of vesting and they are deferring their decision.
I think there's some question as to whether that deferral is because they are waiting for
advice or whether it's because they're looking at annuity rates and thinking they might get
a better rate as interest rates rise, or whether it's just that they are finding it actually quite
confusing. And, as a consequence, not really making a final call.
When it does come to the vesting itself, as Tidjane said earlier, the vesting rates have
held steady. So we know we're not losing the business to other providers, in large part.
The same percentage roughly that was converting to Prudential contracts prior to this
change has continued to convert. We are seeing a large number of customers delaying
the decision for whatever the driver might be.

Bloomberg Transcript

It is early days in the process as the whole code embeds. And clearly, some of the media
speculation and focus, I think, is driving into consumer behavior as well. We've seen a
similar continuation of that trend into the Fourth Quarter but I would expect that, over
time, it would stabilize. But it's still pretty early days. And Tidjane did talk a bit about the
ABI announcement that was made earlier.
In terms of the personal underwriting, again it's something that's probably more suitable
for us to come back to in December to talk a bit about. Where we see supplementing our
individual risk assessment will be necessary, as we go forward, to remove this very blunt
distinction between standard and enhanced business. So I think we can pick it up in a
more thoughtful way in December, if that's all right with you, Fahad?

Just a follow-up question from an earlier question. Just on the US, can you give us a sense
of how much of the rise in the VA margin was from rising yields. And how much was due
to pricing actions? And can you give us an indication of whether you expect to continue to
take pricing actions in Q4? Thanks.

{BIO 2234559 <GO>}

mix from if you look at the Third Quarter[ph] in 2012.

We haven't filed or are anticipating any pricing action in Q4. Those that require an SEC

A couple of questions. First of all, can you give us some color on the Malaysian regulator
now looking at the allocation rates? It somewhat differs to your allocation rate. But any
color on where we are on that one. And what are your thoughts on that, on the
investment-linked solutions?
Secondly is, can you give us some color on hedging costs in the US? It looked to be pretty
low at this point, mainly because of low volatility and partly rising rates. So where does it
stand versus your average expectations? These two questions. Thank you. In the US, I
mean.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

I'm afraid on Malaysia we're drawing a blank here. What do you have in mind here?

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Sorry. Basically, there's been recently a consultation being started by the Malaysian
regulator on the allocation rates on the investment-linked solutions, i.e., the charge you
take up front over next 10 years or something. So there has been a recent consultation on
that. So it was regarding that.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

We'll come back to you on that. I saw (multiple speakers) the regulator one month ago.
And that didn't figure in our conversation. So I don't know; we'll give you more detail when
we know.

sold as on a protection (multiple speakers)

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

It's a protection chassis with a saving riders. So basically, you buy your protection and if
you want to save also you can. But it's fundamentally a protection product. So we wouldn't
be very close to that[ph].
The hedging, Jackson's.

A - Mike Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

There's nothing newer, therefore, the hedging budget, or strategy. We're continuing to
be very defensive at this point in the cycle with the hedging. But there's no material
difference in our spend versus the fees we take in specific for hedging at this point.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

So just to follow up on that, are you still spending around $1 billion which, I guess, is what
you mentioned is your hedging budget?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mike Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Yes. We're spending the majority of it. And as we've talked before, over a cycle we
anticipate spending all of it. And if we needed to we would spend more than that. But
obviously, at this point of the cycle, we don't need to do that. But yes, that's a good
approximation of the budget at this point.
