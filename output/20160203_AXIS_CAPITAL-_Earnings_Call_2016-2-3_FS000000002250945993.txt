Thank you, Linda, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us
today. Last night, AXIS reported fourth quarter operating income of $120 million, or $1.23
per diluted share, and annualized operating ROE for the quarter of 9.2%. For the full year,
we delivered operating earnings per share of $4.02, ROE of 7.7%. Net income was $6.04
per diluted share.
We ended the quarter and year with diluted book value per share of $54.08, an increase
of 6.8% over the year. Adjusting for dividends, diluted book value grew 9% over the last 12
months. During the year, we increased our dividend by 21% and returned $447 million to
our shareholders through common dividends and share repurchases. This continues the
trend that we've established for quite some time. Over the last five years, we returned to
our shareholders 110% of aggregate operating income including the breakup fee earned
from PartnerRe.

FINAL

2015 was a busy year for AXIS and featured many successful initiatives that steered the
company towards the future of enhanced profitability and stability. Despite the
competitive market environment, noteworthy for its pressure on pricing and
overabundance of capital and low interest rates which affected much of our industry, we
made rewarding progress against our objective to be a global leader in specialty risks. I'm
extremely pleased that in the face of this challenging year, AXIS emerged stronger,
leaner, and more focused.
Joe will walk you through the highlights of the quarter and year. But I wanted to begin by
sharing with you my perspectives on the full year, and all quarters including this one tend
to affected by adjustments up and down, and full year results eliminate some of that
noise.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our franchise and market positioning continued to improve. Absent the impact of FX and
discontinued operations, we achieved good growth in selected markets. Our efforts in
analytics are helping our underwriters target exactly the business we want and even as
the markets are increasingly competitive, we are winning desirable business. Importantly,
we are executing well on the right initiatives for the current market conditions.
In our insurance segment, which accounts for 56% of our gross written premium and 49%
of net premiums earned, we reported a combined ratio of 97.8% for the year as
compared to 95.7% in the prior year. However, the current accident year combined ratio
ex-cat was essentially flat at 96% compared to 95.6% in the prior year. We achieved that
result notwithstanding the fact that we experienced this year a highly unusual frequency of
mid-sized losses mostly in the energy lines. Mid-sized losses contributed close to 7 loss
ratio points for the insurance segment this year, twice the average of the prior three
years.
We are comfortable that our share of the unusual frequency of energy losses this year is
in line with our leading presence in the energy market and not a reflection of any change
in our underwriting discipline. Thus, when we normalize for the higher frequency of midsized losses this year, our attritional combined ratio for insurance improved by 3 points,
even while we absorbed close to 2 points of adverse rating trends. I am very proud of this
impressive progress achieved by our insurance team.
In our reinsurance segment, which accounts for 44% of our gross written premium but
51% of our net premiums earned, we reported a full year combined ratio of 86% as
compared to 81.3% in the prior year. Again, if we look at the current accident year
combined ratio ex-cats, that ratio increased almost 6 points to 95.2% in an increasingly
difficult reinsurance market.
Importantly, over half of the increase is due to mix. Given the significant declines in pricing
for property and catastrophe risks our writings for these lines are down almost 20% in the
year. The lower percentage of premiums earned represented by property and
catastrophe lines, with offsetting growth in longer-tail lines with higher target combined
ratios contributed about 3 points to the increase of the segment's combined ratio.

FINAL

I feel it important to repeat that this is not an indication of a deterioration in underwriting.
It merely reflects that at current terms, we believe it is best to reduce cat business as a
percentage of our overall portfolio. The remaining increase in the reinsurance combined
ratio reflects more competitive pricing and higher acquisition cost prevalent in reinsurance
market, as well as a prudent approach to reserving in the transitioning market.
We've been able to partially offset these negatives by taking underwriting actions to
protect the quality and profitability of our book, targeting larger shares of the more
attractive treaties, reducing the overall volatility of our reinsurance book, and building a
stronger group of strategic capital partners with whom to share our risk and earn
attractive fees. Our team is executing well on the appropriate responses to the market
challenges, all the while getting closer to our clients and getting meaningful shares of
their better business as a result of our customer-centric approach.
2015 has been the year of continued progress on our various initiatives. Improving the
quality of our book of business, growing and enhancing the profitability of our recent
initiatives, expense control and capital efficiency which have contributed to improvement
in 2015 and create more value to our shareholders in 2016 and beyond. I'll report more of
these as well as market conditions in our outlook for 2016 after Joe covers the details of
our financial performance. Joe?

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we generated good
results which included operating income of $120 million and an annualized operating ROE
of 9.2%. Our net income for the quarter was $135 million compared to $164 million in Q4
of 2014.
Our results this quarter benefited from a low-level of catastrophe and weather-related
losses, continued favorable prior year development in our loss reserves and a decrease in
our general and administrative expenses. Other factors impacting our results this quarter
included an increase in our ex-cat and weather current accident year loss ratio, which I will
discuss shortly, and an other insurance related loss of $15 million which was driven by
realized losses and mark-to-market adjustments on our reinsurance weather derivatives
portfolio following unseasonably warm weather conditions in Europe. Our book value was
also favorably impacted by an increase in unrealized losses on our available for sale
investment portfolio, which reflected the increase in U.S. interest rates, the widening of
credit spreads in non-government bonds and foreign exchange volatility.
Moving into the details of the income statement, our fourth quarter gross premiums
written increased by 5% or 6% after adjusting for foreign exchange movements with an
increase in our reinsurance segment partially offset by a decrease in our insurance
segment. For the fourth quarter, our reinsurance segment top-line was up $50 million
compared to the same period in 2014. The increase was mainly driven by an increase in
multi-year contracts written, primarily in our liability lines. Our liability lines also benefited
from new business and favorable changes to treaty terms.

Our insurance segment reported a decrease in the top-line of $12 million. The segment
premiums this quarter were impacted by the profitability enhancement actions we
announced during Q3 where, as we discussed with you last quarter, we decided to better
align and deploy our resources into areas that provided the most attractive opportunities.
This resulted in a reduced focus on certain markets most notably Australia and has led to
a modest decrease in our insurance top-line. In addition, our insurance premiums continue
to be impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar. After adjusting for these two factors, our
insurance gross premiums increased by approximately $23 million, driven by new business
primarily in our accident and health, credit and political risk, and professional lines. These
increases were slightly offset by continuing difficult market conditions in the property
markets.
Our net premiums written were up 7%, 8% adjusted for FX, in the quarter, compared to
Q4 2014 and reflect variances in the level of gross premiums written as well as a change
in the mix of premiums written between our segments, with a higher proportion of
premiums written in our reinsurance segment which has a much lower ceded ratio.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our net premiums earned decreased by 4% in Q4 2014 compared to the same period
last year. Net premium earned decreases, 1% on a constant currency basis primarily reflect
reductions in the reinsurance segment due to lower business written and certain lines of
business, most notably catastrophe in recent periods, as well as an increase in the
premiums ceded reflecting increased catastrophe retrocessional covers.
Insurance net premiums earned net of FX was flat with the growth in business written in
recent periods offset by the increases in the level of our ceded premiums, primarily due
to increased reinsurance coverage purchased on our professional lines.
Our fourth quarter consolidated current accident year loss ratio increased 3.6 points to
65.2% compared to the same period of last year. During the quarter, we reported $10
million in losses related to catastrophe and weather events, which compared to $21 million
of such losses reported in the same period of last year.
Our ex-cat and weather current year loss ratio increased by 4.8 points to 64.2%, with
increases noted in both segments. Our reinsurance segment current accident year loss
ratio net of cat and weather increased by 6.1 points compared to Q4 2014, primarily due
to the changes in the business mix. As we have reported in prior quarters, we have
continued to take actions aimed at reducing the volatility of our book of business,
primarily by reducing the level of business written in the catastrophe lines where industry
conditions continue to remain difficult. We have also increased our writings in more stable
longer tail lines of business such as motor and liability. which while less volatile do attract a
higher loss ratio.
Q4 2015 reinsurance results were also impacted by higher losses incurred in the credit
and surety lines, which was partially offset by improved quarter-over-quarter loss
experience in our property reserving class which includes our agriculture and engineering
business. The insurance segment current accident year loss ratio ex-cat and weather was
higher by 3.1 points at 62% (sic) [64%] compared to the same period in 2014 due to the

Page 5 of 27

FINAL

increased mid-size and attritional loss experience in the marine lines, which was driven by
an above average number of large industry events during the year and the liability lines as
well as the impact of lower rates.
These were partially offset by improvements in the loss experience in the credit and
political risk and property lines as well as professional lines, which continue to reflect
improvements following efforts aimed at reshaping this book of business. Changes in the
business mix also partially offset the increase in the loss ratio.
For the full year 2015, the group current accident year loss ratio was 65.6% compared to
63.2% in 2014. We reported catastrophe and weather related losses of $100 million
compared to $93 million last year. After adjusting for these events, the current accident
year loss ratio increased by 2.1 points to 62.9%, primarily due to the change in the
business mix, the impact of lower rates and the increase in marine insurance and credit
and surety reinsurance loss experience during the year partially offset by loss experience
improvements in property and other lines across both segments and in the insurance
professional lines.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to loss reserves established in prior years, our results continue to benefit from net
favorable loss reserve development, which aggregated to $77 million during the fourth
quarter. Short-tail classes in both segments contributed $40 million of this balance,
primarily reflecting better than expected loss emergence. In addition, we continue to give
weight to actuarial methods that reflect our favorable experience for liability and
professional reinsurance business, which contributed a further $21 million of favorable
development for the quarter.
Favorable prior year loss development was also reported in the motor and credit and
surety reinsurance lines of $9 million and $8 million respectively, and insurance
professional lines of $2 million. These favorable loss developments were partially offset
by adverse loss development in the insurance liability lines of $3 million, reflecting an
increase in the loss reserve for one specific claim as well as increased loss provisions
related to a higher frequency of large auto liability claims.
During the fourth quarter of 2015, our acquisition cost ratio increased slightly by 0.1%
compared to the same period in 2014, driven by increases in the reinsurance segment.
These increases were driven by variance in accruals for loss sensitive features in
underlying contracts, primarily due to prior year reserve releases, changes in the mix of
business and higher acquisition cost paid on certain lines of business. Our insurance
segment acquisition ratio decreased this quarter compared to the prior year driven by a
federal excise tax adjustment following a change in the application of certain cascading
tax rules by the Internal Revenue Service. Higher ceding commissions received and
changes in the mix of business partially offset by higher commission cost in certain lines of
business.
Our expense ratio in Q4 was 15.2% versus 17.3% a year ago. Our year-to-date expense
ratio was 16.2% versus 16.1% a year ago. Focusing solely on dollars, we've reduced
expenses by $25 million in the quarter and year-to-date. We did however have some

FINAL

unusual expenses in Q4, 2014 such as severance cost, increased IT cost due to sourcing
and certain system write-offs and lease abandonment charges which made the drop in
our expense ratio relative to 2014 appear larger than it really was.
In addition, expenses in the current period also decreased due to a $7 million and a $13
million reduction in incentive compensation costs in Q4 and year-to-date 2015
respectively compared to the same periods in 2014 reflecting our 2015 financial
performance. As you know in 2014, we targeted $50 million to $60 million in expense
reductions by the end of 2017. So far we've identified $40 million of that, with $30 million
of that to flow through results in 2016 and a further $10 million to come in 2017. These
savings in 2015 have been partially offset by normal inflationary increases, investments
we've made in analytics over the past two years and resources to support the growth of
the organization. We expect to continue to invest in the growth of the franchise during
2016 and believe we will be successful in continuing to leverage our expense base,
scaling attracting new initiatives. While we cannot predict exactly where our expense ratio
will be in 2016, we expect improvement in the 1% range from the full year 2015 expense
ratio. Overall, the company reported underwriting income of $88 million and a combined
ratio of 91.6% for the quarter.
Net investment income was $79 million for the quarter, an increase of $33 million from the
previous quarter and comparable to the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase from the
third quarter of 2015 was primarily due to the contribution to net investment income from
our hedge funds, which benefited from the realty and equity markets in Q4 following the
declines experienced in the previous quarter. In the aggregate, the total return on our
cash and investment portfolios for the quarter was negative 0.1% or flat excluding the
impact of foreign exchange. The total returns in the quarter were impacted by the decline
in pricing of our fixed maturities as a result of the increase in interest rates by the Federal
Reserve.
As previously discussed with you during August 2015, we entered into an accelerated
share repurchase agreement or an ASR, to repurchase an aggregate of $300 million of
our ordinary shares. During August, we initially repurchased 4.1 million of our shares under
this agreement. This ASR agreement has formally terminated on January 15, 2016 with 1.4
million of additional common shares delivered to the company.
During December 2015, we announced that effective December 31, 2015 the share
repurchase authorization program was increased to $750 million of the company's
common shares effective through December 31, 2016. Following the expiration of the ASR
agreement, we have reinitiated our share repurchase program and expect to maintain our
goal provided that market and financial conditions remain the same, and we do not
identify any attractive investment or growth opportunities of returning at least 100% of
our annual operating earnings to our shareholders in the form of common dividends and
share repurchases. At February 2, 2016 the remaining authorization under the share
repurchase program approved by our board of directors was $734 million.
We continue to make strong progress on the strategic goals and expansion opportunities
we have discussed with you in prior quarters. The initiatives designed to support
profitable growth and enhance shareholder value announced during the third quarter of

FINAL

2015 have already made an initial small contribution to our results this quarter. However,
as a reminder, we do not expect the full benefit of these initiatives to be reflected in our
results until later in 2016 and into 2017.
We also continue to make progress on the other on-going expense reduction initiatives
and expect to see benefits of these initiatives to start impacting our results in 2016. Our
Lloyd's unit continue to make progress in the London market; and during the quarter, we
also announced the establishment of an underwriting division in China which will focus on
three reinsurance business on the Lloyd's China platform beginning from the first quarter
of the current year.
We also have recently opened a new representative office in Dubai which will initially focus
on accident and health reinsurance business and during the quarter, we have continued to
expand the capabilities of AXIS Ventures our third-party capital vehicle.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Albert.

Thank you, Joe. Before opening up the call to questions, I'll provide an update on market
pricing, our January 1 reinsurance renewal and a progress report on our 4 point profit
enhancement plans. As with the rest of the market, we experienced continued pricing
pressure in most lines of markets during the year and in the fourth quarter, but while the
overall average market changed our insurance book of minus 3% in the fourth quarter is
higher than the minus 1% experienced in the fourth quarter of 2014. It was nevertheless a
bit better than the minus 4% reported for the third quarter of 2015.
Consistent with prior quarters, the greatest pressures in catastrophe exposed property
and London based global specialty lines. Large accounts are more competitive than
smaller risks.
In our U.S. division, the overall average rate of decline was minus 1% much better than the
minus 4% experienced in the first three quarters of 2015. The improvement is primarily
driven by rate increases in excess casualty, where we are observing pricing corrections
associated with the recognition of poor industry results with lower (25:16) auto related
liability. Pricing in U.S. casualty lines was up 6% on average in the quarter, while U.S.
property was down 8% due to an abundance of capacity and a lack of catastrophe events.
In this market, we continue to grow our casualty business and shift our property business
towards smaller accounts in order to achieve a better, more stable attritional experience
with lower severity.
In our international division, overall the rate change was minus 7% for the quarter in line
with last quarter. The toughest conditions are in global property, energy and terrorism
with double digit reductions. Other lines are more reasonable with generally low- to midsingle digit reductions. We have taken a number of actions in 2015 in an effort to address
challenges in the international marketplace, including winding down our retail insurance

operations in Australia, reducing our business volume where necessary and increasing our
writings with smaller, less volatile risks.
In our professional lines division, overall rate declined 1%, a bit better than the minus 2%
observed in the third quarter. There was a fairly widespread of pricing conditions.
Aggregate E&O rate change was positive 3% for the quarter with higher rate increases
driven largely by cyber coverages. D&O lines were down 4% with primary layers
essentially flat while excess and Side A experienced ongoing declines.
Within this overall insurance market environment, we are focusing our energy on lines of
markets that remain adequately priced or continuing to deliver price increases, providing
opportunities for profitable growth. This includes accidents and health, capital risk
solutions, casualty and certain targeted professional lines among others. We're satisfied
with our new business production for the quarter and its quality was consistent with that of
our renewals.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving onto reinsurance, at the January 1 renewals, the trading environment remained
competitive as has been widely reported. Multi-year commitments are in great demand
broadly impacting all lines of business. We participated in a number of multi-lines
transactions where it made sense to do so. Brokers continued pushing up for increased
brokerage and opportunistic buying was on the rise.
We observed property and catastrophe pricing declines in the range of 5% to 10% with
the U.S. at the lower end of the range and international markets at the upper end.
Professional lines and liability exhibited fairly modest reductions with a modest increase in
ceding commissions. Credit and surety and motor were essentially flat. Among the more
favorable trends we saw, reinsurers panels are getting smaller in some instances,
increased retentions are no longer working for all cedents and Solvency II driven
purchases introduced opportunities into the mix. These factors combined with AXIS'
customer centric approach provided opportunities for us to grow.
For the 50% of AXIS Re's 2015 expiring premium renewable in January excluding
agriculture, we grew premium by approximately 7%. We maintained discipline and good
relationships ensured continuity. We were able to successfully mitigate some of the price
declines through shift of business mix and rigorous risk selection.
Most of our growth came from lines of business that experienced very little if any margin
deterioration such as motor where Solvency II constraints increased the opportunity set.
Due to our portfolio construction, discipline and strong relationship with clients and
brokers, we believe that our price technical ratios increased by only a bit more than 1
point, but with less portfolio volatility. We estimate that the deterioration of the various
lines in which we participate was higher than our point of deterioration for the overall
market. Overall, our team did a commendable job in protecting the risk-adjusted
profitability of our portfolio.
Now, I would like to give you an update on our four point profit improvement plan we've
previously discussed with you. You will recall we are targeting a 4 point to 5 point
Page 9 of 27

FINAL

incremental margin improvement in our combined ratio off the 2014 levels by the end of
2017 excluding the impact of rate change. The four pillars are: improvements in
underwriting to achieve lower and more stable loss ratio, growing our newer initiatives so
that it makes strong positive contributions to income, eliminating at least $50 million in
expenses, and optimizing our capital structure and risk funding alternatives. We made very
good progress on each of these four goals.
As I noted in my introductory remarks, our insurance current accident year loss ratio ex-cat
and mid-sized losses improved by over 2 points in 2015, even after we absorbed 2 points
of adverse rate and trend (30:12). We believe that as mid-sized losses revert to historical
averages; this trend should be more clearly reflected in our results. This improvement was
driven by our underwriters using data and analytics to target better performing business
including smaller, less volatile risks and take corrective action on underperforming sectors.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are continuing to embed analytics in our culture and to drill down deeper and wider
into data, both our own data as well as market data. We are confident as we continue to
do that; we will continue to deliver improvements in the level of quality of our insurance
loss ratio. As to reinsurance, while our ex-cat loss ratio has increased 3.4 points for the
year, this was in the face of adverse pricing and a shift in the mix of business to include a
greater proportion of long tail into less volatile business that improve our overall risk
adjusted return.
We are using analytics to better segment and target opportunities and build a more
efficient portfolio. In reinsurance, our use of data and analytics is not limited to our own
book, and we are increasingly sharing our findings with key clients and this creates a winwin situation, where we can help them improve their own results and as a core reinsurer,
we benefit from participation in a better book of business. The deterioration of
reinsurance pricing we have seen over the past couple of years is affecting every
participant in the industry, but through it all, we believe our current book of reinsurance
business is more stable and more capital efficient than it was in 2012.
The second pillar of improvement is to bring our newer initiatives to appropriate scale, so
they can begin to contribute meaningfully to the growth and profitability or take corrective
action as we did with our Australian retail operations. In that regard, 2015 was a year of
strong progress. As insurance initiatives including accident and health, grew premiums
30% in the aggregate and lowered their aggregate combined ratio by 4.5 points.
As a result, while new initiatives added over 2 points to the 2014 year insurance combined
ratio, that impact was less than 1 point in 2015 insurance combined ratio. We believe these
initiatives are positioned to be net positive contributor to insurance results in 2016 absent
usual events. And as we do this, as Joe noted, we are still investing in new initiatives,
opening up new offices and looking for opportunities to expand the AXIS franchise.
As to expenses, we targeted the elimination of $50 million in expenses by the end of
2017. As we discussed in our last conference call, the actions announced in October to
better align our resources to our profitable growth opportunities and enhance operational
efficiency should generate annualized savings of $30 million by the end of 2016. In

addition, with savings of approximately $11 million resulting from actions initiated late in
2014 as well as an additional $10 million of savings that should come online in 2017, we
have identified and put in place savings of $50 million.
We remained focused on identifying and delivering on additional saving opportunities to
free up resources that we can invest in a more effective and efficient platform, enhance
analytic capabilities, and expand our underwriter force to better serve our clients and
distributors and accelerate the growth of profitable premium.
Finally, as to capital efficiency, we're increasing our use of attractive reinsurance as
evidenced by our increase in ceded premiums, as Joe mentioned earlier. Our efforts to
develop a group of strong and aligned strategic capital partners allows us to do more for
our clients and provide high quality to our risk partners.

Bloomberg Transcript

To illustrate the points, in 2015, our reinsurance business ceded $105 million of premium,
a 17% increase over the prior year. Of that amount, over 70% was ceded to our strategic
capital partners. We received fees and profit participations which favorably impacted
various components of our income statement. We intend to grow our roster of strategic
capital partners and to provide them with a high quality and well balanced portfolio of
risks because it is good for our clients, it is good for our strategic capital partners, and it is
good for our shareholders.
We have been responsible and disciplined towards the capital. In the absence of
meaningful opportunities to reinvest our capital at acceptable levels of profitability from
2011 through to 2015, we've returned $2.4 billion to our shareholders in the form of
dividends and share repurchases, and as I noted earlier, that represents 110% of
cumulative operating income inclusive of the PartnerRe breakup fee.
As Joe noted, we're back in the market after completion of the $300 million ASR we
launched last August. We are committed to further progress along each of these vectors.
While we are building our company for long-term success, we also believe strongly that
the actions we're pursuing will deliver enhanced profitability in the near-term. I remain
extremely optimistic about our company as we build AXIS for the 21st century.
Our mission remains to help our clients manage their risks, to provide creative solutions to

Q&A

Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from
Mike Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Thanks so much. I guess one question, Albert, just looking at the results and kind of trying
to parse the points, maybe starting with reinsurance. Joe gave some reasons as to the
change year-over-year. But it sounds like those are changes that are likely going to
persist, so mix changes and competitiveness. How should we think about that profitability
in that segment, both the loss and the expense side – it looks like ceding commission's
probably a little bit higher too? Is it possible for that sort of 99% underlying (37:36) to
revert back to levels that we're more accustomed to seeing in the past or should we
assume that these changes that you've made and conditions will cause us to remain at
around this level?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, reinsurance is a cyclical business, and so I think we've seen periods where the
industry delivered high combined ratios and very low combined ratios, and there is no
question that currently, we're following three years of price declines. I am not of the view
that it will stay this way. For one thing, I think as you've heard from ourselves and other
people, I think that we are getting close to the point where we're earning our cost of
capital, and in some lines of business, we are not even being offered our cost of capital.
And so I think there is an absolute limit to what it is that we can do. And so I think rather
than watch declines in profitability, you will probably see us write less. And if other people
do that, then that of course becomes a market event where we will start to see more
improvement.
I think with regards to what we've discussed earlier is the fact that when I look at our book
of business and I look at our individual lines of business, I do not see deterioration in each
of our lines of business that you see in our portfolio. And what do I mean by that? The
reality is that when you look at the ex-cat ratio, there is a flaw in the formula, because it
keeps all of the cat premium and then it reduces – and then it eliminates the cat losses,
which means that if you have a very high cat component in your portfolio, you're always
going to have a low ex-cat loss portfolio, and then you take the excuse that it was a bad
cat year, so we should ignore it and go back and look at the ex-cat loss.
The truth is that what we are doing right now is creating a more balanced book, a more
efficient, capital efficient book. And so we are protecting the returns on risk, the returns
on capital, in a way that are much stronger than what you see in the reported combined
ratios. I think over time again you will see pricing on cat improve and, if not, then we will
write less of it. I think we will take the right actions to ensure that our capital is profitably
utilized. I am not the only CEO to be saying that we think we've reached pretty much the
Page 12 of 27



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2016-02-03

floor of what we can tolerate in many lines, and if we don't see changes, we'll simply write
less of it.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

FINAL

Got it...

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Mike, it's Joe... go ahead. Why don't you ask your question first, and then I will come back.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Sure. So, it sounds like just absent a change in the market, I mean, in terms of you
changing, everyone changing, tolerance for lack of profitability goes down, absent a
change in the market, there isn't something one-timey, there isn't something about this
quarter, you know, that we should think that this is not indicative of where this business is
currently running. Is that fair?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think where it's priced today is where it's priced today. I think that we however will
continue to look for ways to optimize the profitability and the efficiency of the portfolio by
making judicious mixes – changes in the mix of business, looking at different ways of
structuring and frankly differentiating ourselves and demonstrating to our partners – our
clients and our partners that we are adding value, and that we need to be adequately
compensated for that value.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

But I'm sorry – yeah. Go ahead, Joe.

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Yeah. Let me just jump in here. So, there is about a point in our reinsurance segment
combined ratio related to loss sensitive features. This is hard for you to see, but basically
because we release reserves from prior years, and you know that we've had $75 million
worth of prior year releases in the quarter, that actually increases our commissions and in
some cases ceded premiums due to the fact that we have loss sensitive features on a lot
of our credit and our motor reinsurance agreements. So I would say, there is some
unusual, if you will, acquisition cost impacts due to the release of prior year reserves due
to these loss sensitive features. So I just want to point that out.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. Got it. And sorry, just to follow-up there. If you're reducing exposure to property
cat, which even with deteriorating pricing is still probably on a notional basis among sort of
the more profitable business, and you're replacing with long tail casualty business, that's
maybe more stable but carries a higher loss ratio, how does that mix shift provide a
tailwind to margins from here?

FINAL

Again, I think the issue that we're looking at which is not reflected in current quarters is
that in the last couple of years, we've had very, very favorable cat activity. And our view is
that when we look at the composition of our portfolio, we need to take a look at it in
terms of the expected cat results. And I think that if you look at the expected cat results, I
believe that we've made the right decisions of reducing the cat exposure in our portfolio.
The value of the strategy, as I've said before, really needs to be viewed in the context of
multiple quarters and years that include cat results so that you can see whether or not
we've delivered a more profitable, more balanced book of business. I continue to be of
the view that when we look at the reduced volatility, the enhanced diversification that
from a return on risk perspective, from a return on capital perspective, our book of
business today is better than it was in 2012.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. And then just one last one on the expense ratio in insurance. Joe, what was the
impact of that tax item and – just trying to get an idea of sort of what the normalized
profitability looked like in 4Q? Thanks.

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Yeah. It was $8 million for the group, $7 million to insurance and $1 million to reinsurance.

Our next question is from Amit Kumar of Macquarie. Please go ahead.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Thanks and good morning. Just maybe a quick follow-up to Michael's question on the
discussion of losses. So, if I understand this correctly that the losses, the attritional and
mid-sized losses in both segments, that was more a function of changes in business mix,
external events, and hence no corrective actions are needed specifically in the AXIS book.
Did I understand that correctly or I missed the point there?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think that are really two different issues, if you would, and in fact one of the benefits of
being at AXIS is we have both insurance and reinsurance, so we have the ability to hop
back and forth. I think with regard to insurance, and we should look at the two issues.
Insurance, we discussed with you earlier the fact that we believe there are significant
improvements that we can make in our underwriting. And in that case, we talked about a
number of corrective actions in our underwriting, including using data and analytics to
better target risks and identify sub-performing classes that we can exit. We talked about

Page 14 of 27



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2016-02-03

bringing our businesses, our new initiatives to scale. And in that area, we've seen
progress in all of those.

FINAL

And as we discussed with you, we say that that progress has been masked in 2015 by the
highly unusual frequency of energy losses in 2015. And we believe that with a more
normalized loss experience that is more consistent with history that that result would have
been more evident in 2015 and our expectation is two-fold.
Our expectation is two-fold. One is that the actions that we're taking in insurance, we will
continue to take and they will deliver further progress in the underwriting loss ratios for
the insurance business. And secondly, even with the way the book is today, if we return to
a more normalized mid-sized loss environment, we should see enhanced profitability.
That is the insurance action plan, it's an action plan that we've been dedicated to. And
that given some of the metrics that I have just discussed with you certainly are delivering
very, very encouraging results.

Bloomberg Transcript

The issue with the reinsurance book is different. We always believe that our reinsurance
book was very attractive, very well underwritten, and very well constructed. We did not
believe that our reinsurance book required quote corrective action. The issue with our
reinsurance book is simply making sure that we respond in an intelligent way to what is a
difficult market for reinsurance. What we are facing in reinsurance is a significant increase
in available capital; we are seeing strong pricing competition, and frankly some
irresponsible behaviors by some participants in the market.
In that environment, what we are doing in the reinsurance book is making sure that we
position ourself to defend our best relationship in our best business and changing the mix
of business as we can to make sure that on a return on risk perspective, we continue to
protect the profitability of that business. So, I think when we talk about whether we need
or don't need corrective action, I mean, I think that does not reflect the specific conditions
of each of our two businesses and the appropriate action that each of our two businesses
are taking to optimize their profitability. And as I mentioned at the end, I remain optimistic
that we are as well positioned as anybody in this industry and that we have a real tailwind
of momentum in terms of improving this organization given the work that we've been
doing over the last few years.
And I will add that with all of the dislocation happening in the industry, which I don't need
to name, but that you're very well aware of, we're actually in a better position because
we've gone through our reviews, we've gone through our book of business, we've gone
through the way we approach our portfolios. And we know where we want to be, we
know what we're doing, and we're very comfortable that we do not – that we're going to
be an island of stability in an industry that is really going severe dislocation.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Got it. That's helpful. Maybe the next question is for Joe. In terms of the reserve release
in the reinsurance segment, I think you talked about methodology. And can you just
expand on that or maybe give more color on the lines or time periods where those
releases came from?

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. Amit, first of all, it's just about all lines of business, I mean, as I mentioned a lot of it
is on the property and short-tail lines, but it's really releases across all lines of business
and almost across all accident years. Clearly, the emphasis is on the earlier years, but
we've just seen very positive development both on all lines of business and virtually all
accident years.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Got it.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

And I think you mentioned that, I think you know the longer tail are pre-2010 type of
releases. And to the extent that we released any reserves in the years post-2010, they've
essentially been associated to the shorter tail lines where we've now seen enough
maturity.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Got it. And then just final question on the buyback. Obviously, you talked about returning
100% of earnings and you have a meaningful buyback. How should we think about sort of
the timing of that buyback? Is that more front end loaded for 2016? Any thoughts on that
or is it more sort of following the past patterns? How should we think about that? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yeah. No. It would not be front end loaded, Amit. As you know, we look at this on a
quarter-by-quarter basis, we're committed to returning our operating earnings and more
than our operating earnings, if again, we do not identify anything that make sense from a
bolt-on type acquisition or frankly opportunities in the business itself.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Got it. Thanks.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Just to add to that, we have been subsequent to the expiration of the ASR buying back
shares through a 10b5-1. So we are in the market.

FINAL

Thank you. I want to – you had a question about your PMLs. I mean it sounded like you are
talking about reducing risk and it seems like your cat and property exposure is down, but
when I compare your – the disclosure we saw last night on your PMLs versus three months
ago, it appears that on the – it's like a Southeast hurricane or for a California earthquake
that, particularly on the high end of the one in 250 event, that the exposure is up, it looks
like it's up about 15%. Could you talk why that is?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Sure. I think the simplest way to say is we got to look at gross in that. I think what you find
is that when you compare this to 1/1/2015, you will find that they are still down, and so in
fact on a gross basis we are writing less. The very simple fact is that we had a level of
protection that expired on 1/1, which we have not yet renewed. And so you'll notice there
was a reduction in the PML between the 1/1 date and the end of the first quarter last year.
And we are currently reviewing our various options to buy additional cat protection for our
book, but we haven't finished our deliberation on exactly what approach we will take.
So this is simply the fact that we are between the expiration of one level of coverage and
the replacement. We felt that we could afford to do that since as you pointed out, much
of that exposure is a typical U.S. hurricane exposure that will not really come online until
the second quarter. So we believe that we have a window of opportunity just like we did
last year to visit all of the options that we have and we will make a decision and then we
will act on it.

Q - Cliff H. Gallant

{BIO 1854853 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Actually as a follow-up, you mentioned growth in your cyber line of
insurance, and I was curious as to, if you could talk a little bit about what exactly is being
covered in that? Is that more sort of, what you call it, a data breached type of protection?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

We have different kinds of protection that we provide and they are really meant to meet
the needs of our target clients. Most of our book of business is aimed at small-to-mid
market accounts who are looking to respond to data breaches and address any kind of
corrective action. We do have some exposure, but not lot of exposure that relates to
third-party liability in the event of those, that tends to be more in our – in the larger
account crowd. But the AXIS PRO division which offers our cyber policy is essentially a
small-to-mid market account division.

Our next question is from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you. First question on your sort of the outlook for the margin
improvement, 4 basis points to 5 basis points – about 100 basis points through 2017. I just
want to clarify that margin is based on the underlying margin of the ex-cat and the reserve
releases. Is that right?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yeah. It certainly is ex-cat and reserve releases. I think that at the end of the day, we
believe that – we believed when we made that statement and there were significant
actions that we could do to improve the underlying profitability of the book. And as I
mentioned to you earlier, we're already seeing a significant out of that. In fact, you could
argue that if we had normalized mid-sized losses we would've seen a 400 basis point
improvement in the insurance loss ratio just in 2015, to show you the power of what we've
been doing in terms of improvement.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, we will continue to do that. I think, overall, part of our long-term profitability of course
is to make sure that as we continue to improve our attritional losses that we don't take
unreasonable catastrophe exposures, so that all of the progress on the attritional losses
is wasted and offset by excessive cat losses. So we want to make sure that the attritional
loss ratio is steadier and lower and we want to make sure that our exposure to the
volatile cat lines and volatile cat risks are appropriate for our portfolio and add an
appropriate level of volatility not an excessive level of volatility.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's great. You also mentioned that the target is excluding any pricing pressure. I just
wonder given that we'll continue to see on the pricing side, do you see part of that
improvement will be offset by continued pricing pressure?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Well, I think it is. And the reason we differentiated it is we didn't want to talk about pricing
improvements that could be helped simply by the markets or areas that we don't have full
control over, which is the pricing. What we can do is determine what risks we write. What
we can do is determine how to appropriately price our risks and our overall portfolio
composition. So it's important for us to make sure that we do that.
And again using the insurance results as an example, we've had 400 basis points of
improvement in the loss ratio given normalized mid-sized losses, but we only showed 2
points because we absorbed 2 points of losses. So yes, of course, to the extent that rate
and trend continues to be adverse, it would offset some of that benefit. But we at least
have the opportunity to have our own improvement based on what we do, no matter
what happens in the market.

Great. And second question on energy, I mean, it's getting a lot attention in the market
basically. Could you tell us a bit more detail about both on your investment portfolio side
as well as your underwriting exposure to the energy sector?

FINAL

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, we do have a large presence in the energy area. We write all forms of energy,
whether it's onshore or offshore or renewable energy. As you know it is an industry that
has significant properties at risk and we've been a leading participant in that line of
business for a long time. It's also true that the industry has seen a significant amount of
additional losses this year. Our share of the losses is not in consistent with our share of
the market, so we're not disturbed by that. And again, as I've mentioned, whether you go
back three years, five years, 10 years, energy has been a very attractive line for us and will
continue to do so.

Bloomberg Transcript

I will say that we expect the growth in our energy underwriting will – that our premiums will
come down a little bit, because we fully expect that as with the price of oil these days,
there are many, many fewer construction projects and new construction projects. So, we
would expect that one of the components to demand for energy which is construction
projects would probably come down. We expect, however, that we will see growth in our
renewable energy division as that picks up a slack, as that starts to move on. So, we have
been I believe very good participants in the energy markets. I believe that we have a
recognized and differentiated expertise in energy line, upstream and downstream and I
think we will continue to be a leader in that area. The next question is with regard to
investments and Joe, you may want to talk about that.

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Yeah. Kai, it's not material. Our investment team actually has been de-emphasizing
energy as a class in the investment portfolio for a while. At the end of the year it's about
$250 million.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's in like alternative investments or in like in bond portfolio?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

No, it's more in the bond portfolio.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay, great. And lastly if I may on to follow-up on the buyback, it looks like authorization
remaining $734 million is much bigger than your earnings for the past few years and I just
wonder is that upper limits or is that, you plan to fully execute on that?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I find the authorization is really an administrative issue because our board is very
responsive and shares our commitment to good capital stewardship, so we increased the

Page 19 of 27



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td

Date: 2016-02-03

authorization whenever we see that it's been used up. I wouldn't take the $750 million as
a strategic number that once we do $750 million we stop, that hasn't been our case. We
updated our authorization at least three times since I've been here, and as we continue to
buy back stock, when we need more authorization, we will get it.

Our next question is from Meyer Shields of KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, good morning. Albert, I guess as an underwriting question. Is it just coincidence
that the same year that energy crisis and projects plummeted, you saw an increase in this
type (01:00:21) losses?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

It is in my mind a total coincidence, I mean we could go back and take a look at some of
the events that have happened and they are truly fortuitous and we feel comfortable that
they are not a reflection of the underlying economics. I will bring up that. In energy, we
deal very much with some very large buyers who have significant primary exposure to the
losses before we kick in. We're talking about our clients losing hundreds of millions of
dollars before we kick in. So we're comfortable that there is a strong alignment of interest
between ourself and our energy clients. But obviously, we are monitoring it. To-date, we
haven't seen anything to that effect.
I will tell you that over time we have absolutely monitored our behaviors, the behaviors of
our clients and to the extent that we've ever noticed that a client was reducing
maintenance and CapEx and so on and so forth, we would discontinue them, and I can tell
you that I have personally seen a number of cases where we've non-renewed large
accounts, where we started to have concerns that maintenance and CapEx was being
reduced.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, thank you, that's very helpful. When you talk about moving to smaller casualtyfocused accounts, does that require a material change in distribution strategy, in other
words, do you have to write (01:01:58)?

FINAL

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

That's an excellent question. And in fact, we do have access to multiple sources of
premium, and here I'm speaking on our insurance side. It's true that if you look at the retail
operations of the large top three they of course do a lot of large accounts, but even the
large top three have increasingly been focusing on expanding their mid market
distribution capabilities and we're taking advantage of that. It also means that we are
working more with smaller brokers who tend to be more regional and more specialized in
the middle markets so that we can access that. As you know in our insurance business, we
have a very strong E&S franchise, we're one of the leading E&S writers in the United
States and that business comes from E&S brokers who do tend to give us both small and
large accounts, and we also have access through our program division to MGAs and
MGUs that provide opportunities for select smaller portfolios.
So, we continue to use multiple sources of distribution. In fact I think you know this, a little
over a year ago we added a new division in our insurance area which is really about
distribution management, broker and distribution relationships, and we've had some very,
very good early response to these efforts and we are clearly monitoring that. We are
increasing our access to small and mid-sized accounts and when we monitor the
percentage of our premium, the percentage of our policies that are coming from smaller
and mid-sized accounts, we're seeing progress there. And we've got divisions that do
only that, so as I was mentioning earlier, our AXIS Pro division only does small and mid
market and in our E&S division, we do a fair number of small accounts too.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Meyer, it's Joe, I'll just add two things to that. We have re-engineered certain of our
operations, you mentioned – Albert just mentioned AXIS Pro. Some of the things we've
done there have increased productivity of our underwriters by 30%, and in addition to
that we've made some significant IT investments which will enable us to handle smaller
and mid-sized accounts more effectively as well. So, I think we're well positioned from an
underwriting standpoint and well positioned from an operational standpoint to handle it.

Page 21 of 27



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td

looks like it's probably costing you 2 points to 3 points on your loss ratios to-date, is that a
fair assumption?

FINAL

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yeah, I'd say there's about a couple of points, I'd say a tad under a couple of points todate, but again when I look at our book, I think that we're probably in line with the rest of
the industry. I don't believe that there is anything unique in what we're doing. I think what
we have again is the fact that we now have a running start and real momentum in digging
into our portfolio and looking for ways to optimize it even in the declining rate
environment.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you, got you, good. And then the next question, I'm just curious. If I look at your
reinsurance division, you talked about reducing your cat exposure there, is there some
way that we can kind of quantity that as we look at kind of projecting out a cat load, or
something we can think about?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well obviously, I think we give you a – you know we do disclose though the property and
cat writings and so you can always put in a target ratio against those numbers. What I will
say is that when I look at our historical average cat loss over the last 15 years, you know
we've made a commitment that we would reduce our average cat loss load over time
and that continues to be an important component of our efforts. And the reason for that
again is, I think we have an outstanding group of underwriters who do a very good job of
servicing clients on a daily basis and building good portfolios, and what I don't want to
see, all that progress negated by an excessive market share of cat losses. So you know
we've said all along, we are very happy to have industry average volatility, I think that's the
business we're in and we should do that, but we will make sure that we do not have
excessive volatility versus the industry.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay great. And then last quick question here, I'm just curious, the mid-sized loss activity
that you experienced this year, is there anything you can do from a reinsurance
perspective to mitigate that or do you think it's just not worth it, doing it?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Look, we could certainly have had, we can certainly, ex post facto, create a reinsurance
program that would have provided cover for that, but the issue that I would make to you
is that we do not believe that that is an economically good idea. Because as I've
mentioned before even if you take a look at the last five years, the last 10 years of results
including every single loss that we've had, including the losses we've had this year, this still
remains a very attractive line of business. It's a line of business that generally gives you
good results, but every once in a while you may have a bad quarter, or in the case of 2015
a bad year.

That is a good example of the kind of volatility that I'm very happy to take because it's the
right call to make over an extended period of time, the net risk that we are keeping
delivers very attractive results to us. And that's just the nature of our industry that every
once in a while you're going to have a bad year in a line of business. But for the moment,
we don't see anything in the energy line that causes us to believe that we need a
different risk mitigation, a different risk management profile. Obviously, if we see losses
continuing to stay at a high level, we will revisit that, but for the moment we are taking the
position that this is just a very unusual frequency of losses and we're obviously monitoring
to see if it goes back to a normal level or not.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. Thank you. And then last question just quickly, as you move more into some of
the more casualty lines and the mix shifts that way longer tail, what are your thoughts on
interest rates and how are you kind of thinking of the kind of return on capital for those
lines versus the property lines?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Certainly, I think we face the same issues that everybody else does, which is that low
interest rates have not been beneficial to the insurance industry and we certainly would
like to see that improve. I think that some of the casualty pricing has responded by – since
we can't make as much money on the investments, we've had to make more money on
the underwriting and in fact casualty lines in recent years have actually delivered very
good underwriting profits. In the old days, the industry was happy to write casualty at
substantially above 100 because they would make their return on the investment income.
To the extent that we don't have that anymore, we've seen pricing improve and even at
these low interest rates, we are very satisfied with our casualty book that we are making
some very good returns. The ROEs on casualty frankly are among some of the best that
we have in our book. So that is not preventing us from writing good casualty business
today.

Our next question is from Vinay Misquith of Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you. So first is on the reinsurance business. The accident year combined ratio excat's 99% for the fourth quarter. We shouldn't be looking at that as a run rate for the
future, correct. Shouldn't we be looking at it more on a full year basis?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think you should look at it from a portfolio basis and you should look at it again on an
annual basis because reinsurance by definition tends to be a little bit more volatile, and as

Joe mentioned, we did have a couple of large losses in the fourth quarter. So you'll have
that. So when you look at that 99%, I remind you of two things, one is there are some
large losses in there and two is the comment that Joe made which is that there is over 1%
of acquisition expense which is really tied to the prior year releases. So if you really want
to take a look at the true underlying profitability of that book of business, you're going to
have to reduce the acquisition expense ratio by over 1%. And then the other thing that I
would say to you is that we have not changed our level of prudence with regards to initial
reserving. And so, I'm actually quite comfortable that the level of prudence in our book of
business is such that it would assume trends that are worse than we are seeing in the
industry today. And if we're doing our job right, I believe that it's more likely than not that
these loss ratios that we're putting up will prove very resilient.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. The second question was on share repurchases, my sense was, this
year you guys had about $300 million if I'm correct? And that seems to be sort of in line
with earnings and you received the breakup fee. I'm just curious why there was more
share repurchases not done this year?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah Vinay, its Joe. Under the terms of the ASR it really, you know, we were precluded
from buying more than that. So it was strictly more a contractual issue than anything else
and frankly prior to instigating the ASR we didn't want to be active buying back because
we basically were negotiating against ourselves. I'll just say, just give you an indication. We
bought back about 328,000 shares since the ASR has expired just in the last couple of
weeks.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure. Now you know but the fact that you guys got about $280 million more last year than
your earnings, shouldn't we be expecting that that sort of gets returned back to
shareholders too?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think we – look, I'll go back to the statement I made earlier. If you look back over the last
five years we've always given back 110% including via the breakup fee. Again we are active
in the market. There is a limit to what we can do on a daily basis. We have to maintain an
orderly market for our shares and we will continue to be in the market buying as much as
is reasonably available to us. I think it's a question of execution, Vinay, and I think if we
were to stop this might be a conversation we're having, but we started immediately upon
the termination of the ASR and we're already in the market. There is a limit to how much
we can buyback without affecting the price of the shares, and as Joe said, you know
competing against ourselves.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

So, fair enough, thank you.

Operator

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Great. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just had some questions on the reinsurance
book going back to that, again from remixing the underwriting this year, it was kind of a 3
point headwind to the underlying combined ratio. Is the remixing done, again I am just
trying to figure out, should that be a pressure again heading into 2016 and if it is, would it
be the same similar type level?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I don't think so, I mean look, we start with the statement that every renewal is an
opportunity to create the best portfolio that we can. And I think, we have to let our
underwriters build the best portfolio that they can at every point in time but the truth is we
already are writing a lot less property cat than we were before and so I think that when
you think about where we are as a percentage of overall portfolio, I think that to the
extent that the business remains at current levels, then we think it would make sense to
sustain the kind of exposures to cat that we have right now. If pricing improves, we may
take more but certainly if pricing is less then we will have to write less of that because it'll
be the right decision at the time.
I am sorry, but I can't give you a more definitive answer. I can tell you that I am very
satisfied with the mix of business that we have. And so, I am not looking to proactively
reduce that the mix of cat in our portfolio but we do have to respond appropriately to
conditions in the market.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Okay, great. Thank you. And I just have – one last one from me, the weather derivative
book seems to adding a level of volatility to your earnings. I am just wondering if that is – if
you're comfortable with that level of volatility and maybe just get your thoughts on that
obviously, it was a very warm winter so far.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think one of the issues with that is that yes, because it's a book that just have a lot of
derivatives than the mark-to-markets and those – these things do add volatility.

And if you don't mind, Ryan, I would like to maybe just take a step back and talk
philosophically about it. At AXIS, we have no problem with individually volatile lines. That's
what we do. Our job is to absorb the volatility from our client and our job is to then take all
of those volatile lines and create a less volatile portfolio through with diversification. So at
any point in time, we're going to find a line of business somewhere that pops. What
matters to me is not that a line pops. It's that the portfolio is well constructed and
balanced. So you have a situation where the conditions this year were so warm that you
had significantly less winter storms in Europe and so on.
So we had favorable experience in terms of European cat and we had some unfavorable
experience with regards to the weather portfolio. I view that as a nature of our business.
At AXIS, we recognize that our job is to assume volatility on behalf of our clients and that's
something that we are willing to do. The book of business that we write in weather is one
that does have some inherent volatility but if you look at what happened last year, we had
a same situation in the fourth quarter where had a 14% where we had a warm winter and
then we made back a lot of that in the first quarter of 2015. So there is some quarterly
volatility. What we experienced in the fourth quarter is literally what our modelers are
telling us is the three sigma event. There are going to be situations where we have losses
of that type but we still think that weather is increasingly being seen by a number of
businesses, governments and different entities as a real risk to their enterprise and we
think that over time it's going to be an important line of business and we are building a
strong franchise in that area.
