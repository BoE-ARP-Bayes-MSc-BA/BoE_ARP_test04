Welcome to this call on Sampo Group's Third Quarter 2020 Results.
I'm Jarmo Salonen, Head of Investor Relations at Sampo. And with me at this call, I have
our Group CEO and President, Torbjorn Magnusson; Group CFO, Knut Arne Alsaker; CEO
of If, Morten Thorsrud; and Chief Strategist, Ricard Wennerklint.
We'll have a short presentation by Torbjorn, Knut Arne and Morten to begin with. But
before handing over to Torbjorn, let me just remind you that you can follow this call on
Sampo.com/results and a recorded version will later be available at the same address.
With these words, I'll hand over to Torbjorn. Torbjorn, please.

Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everyone. Sampo Group reports strong results for third quarter of 2020.
The largest proﬁt contributor, If P&C, continued to deliver excellent underwriting
combined with healthy top line growth. It's pleasing to see the payoﬀ from our long-term
investments in web and multi-channel, and equally gratifying to see that the Nordic
market is as rational as ever implementing rate increases where necessary. The 82.4
combined ratio is also rather stronger than the ﬁrst impression as it contains more large
claims than normal, a discount rate change in Finland, and working in the other direction,

a 2% COVID-19 reductions in claims. And the total eﬀect of all of this is that a normalized
combined ratio would be some 2% better than the last year.
The oﬀer to acquire Hastings Group that were made together with RMI in August is
proceeding according to plan. The oﬀer was approved by the requisite majorities. So,
Hastings shareholders in September and all approvals regulatory and antitrust ones have
now been received. We look forward to welcoming Hastings to our group after the court
hearing which is expected to be held on the 13th of November. Including Hastings, as you
can see from the bottom left side of this slide, P&C insurance now makes up roughly twothirds of the proﬁt of the group against only some 40% of the capital. Another measure is
the high quality earnings in the underwriting proﬁts, which we have grown quite
signiﬁcantly from 2015 to 2019 and 2020 and which is now more than 40% of Sampo's net
income. The numbers on this slide are not an exact science, but the idea is important to
us. Topdanmark then, Topdanmark share price fell back to levels a little below where it
spent most of the summer. The Company reported stable current year results, gave their
usual outlook for the coming year, and I'm very conﬁdent that they will continue to focus
on underwriting proﬁts as their main target.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning then to Nordea encouragingly. The Company produced a solid set of numbers
and increased both eﬃciency and market shares. The bank exceeded investor
expectations on virtually all lines and remains committed to their 2022 ﬁnancial targets.
Everyone in the new management team is now ﬁnally in place and I'm personally very
impressed already at the team's determination to increase both customer work and
reduce unnecessary costs at the same time. As is visible from the numbers, this is now
four quarters of good progress and I'm as committed as ever to contributing to the
Company's development as Chairman of the Board.
Nordea has a strong balance sheet. Also means that it's well positioned to pay out
dividends and the bank intends to pay a dividend for the ﬁnancial year 2019, given the
necessary regulatory approvals. In addition, ﬁnally then to Nordea's dividend statement, I
note that If P&C this week has decided to distribute EUR600 million in December of this
year. Topdanmark has also repeated its early commitment to paying the remainder of the
2019 dividend. And ﬁnally, Mandatum having canceled its dividend in the spring is now at
a solvency ratio of 206% which in total gives me conﬁdence that Sampo has no cash ﬂow
issues with a dividend in the spring in accordance with our dividend policy. Knut?

Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Thank you, Torbjorn and good afternoon, everybody. A few words about the balance
sheet as of the end of third quarter. We want to operate a prudent but disciplined capital
management regime without large buﬀers. This means that we aim to maintain solvency
and debt leverage at robust levels, with buﬀers above regulatory and rating agency limits
that reﬂects our risk proﬁle. However, we do not plan to build in large buﬀers beyond
what we need to manage our risks, nor will we create a big war chest for M&A. What we
have reported today based on Q3 numbers is a Solvency 2 coverage ratio of 214% which
is in itself, a record high level. But as we have described in our reports, we respect -- with
respect to impact of the Hastings consolidation, this ratio will drop to 185% based on Q3
numbers, given that this transaction is closed later this month. What we show you on this

slide is a pro forma number also including an accrued dividend at a level equal to what
we paid out earlier this year, as a distribution of proﬁt for 2019. This should not be
interpreted as an accrual of this pro forma -- it should only be interpreted as accrual for
this pro forma calculation purpose should not be interpreted as a dividend decision for
2020. 173% is a robust level and indicates that our solvency strength is currently not a
limiting factor in our ability to pay a dividend for 2020 in line with our dividend policy,
which as you know, is at least 70% of earnings. However, our solvency coverage should be
seen in the context of the market risk exposure we have particularly through our
ownership in Nordea. Hence, we need to maintain some prudence in our solvency ratio.
Our debt leverage remains within rating agency limits but is higher than historical levels.
We have no plans to increase our gross debts nor our debt leverage from the current
levels. To the contrary, we will work to bring down debt leverage on what we have today
over the next couple of years. As already mentioned, our solvency strength is currently
not the limiting factor in our ability to pay an attractive dividend of at least 70% of EPS this
year. With the dividend of If -- from If of EUR600 million which Torbjorn also referred to a
minute ago and which we announced today. Sampo's insurance operations is on a good
track to deliver dividends to our holding company of at least EUR1.5 per Sampo share,
which was the dividend we paid in June.
If's solvency also remains post the dividend announced today at a robust level.
Mandatum's solvency has clearly improved since the Company's dividend for last year
was canceled. And we also expect to receive a dividend from Topdanmark in the
beginning of next year. In other words, we are in a position where we think that we can
pay a reasonable dividend, for this year, even if Nordea does not contribute. Although we
obviously hope that it will. Paying an attractive and predictable dividend remains a key
focus for us. We believe the best way to deliver this is by further improving the quality of
our balance sheet and by basing our dividend on paying out at least 70% of group
earnings which we aim to make even more predictable going forward.
Over to you, Morten.

(Technical Diﬃculty) and then, has a combined ratio of the 82.9% reported for the third
quarter isolated. However, when adjusting for the eﬀect of reduced discount rate in
Finland, the third quarter combined ratio isolated would end up at a record low 78.3%. As
Torbjorn already mentioned, the year-to-date combined ratio is 82.4% and again when
adjusting for the discount rate changes in Finland, these ﬁgures -- ﬁgure would end up at
80.5%. So very strong insurance performance indeed.
The proﬁtability in If is clearly improved during the year as a result of our continuous work
on pricing sophistication and risk selection. At the same time, large claims outcome is
about planned level, whilst there is a net positive COVID-19 eﬀect, which is about 2% on
year-to-date and 3% is our best estimate for the third quarter isolated. We show a strong
growth of 5.2% both year-to-date and for the third quarter isolated in a market where we
did have some headwind from low new car sales and negative volume eﬀect from

FINAL

reduced business activity in certain industries as a result of the ongoing COVID-19
situation.
We continued to increase the number of customers and had their stable retention rates
throughout all segments. And I think despite now being in the middle of a crisis, we really
experience a record high customer activity level, in particular in the private segment
during the third quarter. For instance, Nordic new car sales in the third quarter isolated
was actually back at 2019 level. We saw record high used car sales levels. We also saw a
peak in the sale of number of both insurances, pet insurances, risk life insurances. So a
very high activity level among the Nordic households. If continued to be well positioned
as the largest P&C insurance player in the growing P&C market that is becoming more
digital. The growth that we see in year-to-date has been supported by a very strong
performance in digital channels. And already by the third quarter, we have sold more than
SEK1 billion in new sales purely through the web shops in our private business area. So,
the Nordic P&C market is clearly becoming more digital in this environment.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our cost ratio ended up at a record low 20.7%. And we beneﬁt now from both the high
and top line growth and continued eﬃciency improvements in the operations, as well as
low cost spending in certain areas as a result of the COVID-19 situation. We have revised
our outlook to an 82% to 84% combined ratio for the full year, reﬂecting a strong
performance for the ﬁrst nine months and a continued strong underlying earnings
momentum. Then, I thought I should give also just a quick update on the current
operational situation in light of the recent development on COVID-19. During the third
quarter, we started slowly to move people back to the oﬃces. And in many geographies,
we had about half of the workforce back in the oﬃce at the peak during third quarter.
However, now with the second wave setting in, we are now moving people back again,
more to home oﬃces and currently about 80% of our workforce work out of home oﬃces.
Still, customer service levels remains high also through the third quarter. We see a high
level of customer contacts, strong net promoter score, and really a high customer loyalty
in all customer segments. As already mentioned, there is a strong shift now towards
digital channels, both for insurance sales, services where we see 15% increased logins in
my pages and online reporting of claims, we also see a similar 15% increase in number of
claims reported online. The capital market has been benign in the third quarter. We have
had strong earnings power which results in a strong result and an improved solvency ratio
to 176% after deducting for the planned dividend of some EUR600 million or SEK6.3
billion. Finally, in the third quarter, we saw some normalization of claims weaknesses. And
this, of course, adds to the complexity of really separating the COVID-19 eﬀect from
underlying improvements. But again, our best estimate is that, we have a positive impact
of about 3% in the third quarter isolated and about 2% then year-to-date.
So, with that, I hand back to Torbjorn.

Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

operationally and strategically, despite the turbulent times. And we plan to give a full

Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Firstly, you've been quite
aggressive in industrial as peers have been pulling back. And even if I strip out the large
claims being worse than expected year-to-date, the combined ratio in industrial still just
above 100%. Just wondering what's causing this and is it more than just simply a large
loss issue?
And secondly, your comments on dividends suggest that you can just about reach the
70% payout ratio entirely from insurance dividends. If the ECB review next month does
results in Nordea being able to pay a dividend. How should we think about Sampo's
payout ratio this year? Would it be higher than if you just had dividends for insurance
entities? Or would you be looking to increase the cash at the payout fee level? Thanks.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

On the dividend issue, I think we shouldn't speculate, but rather wait for the ECB
development of COVID-19. Industrial, Morten?

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

So can really be attributed to the large claims only, we see a good development on
frequency claims. I think it's good to bear in mind that both the large claims, of course,
impact industrial and also the change in discount rate, is to a large extent also something
that hits industrial assets, typically aﬀects workers' comp reserves in Finland. So, we do
see a good frequency development in industrial and then more the volatility that you
once in a while have on the large claims side. I think it's also fair to comment that a very
large proportion of the growth is actually rate increases. So, we see a hardening market in
the industrial market which we, of course, will then beneﬁt from going forward.

Our next question is from Michael Huttner from Berenberg. Please go ahead. Your line is
open.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Fantastic. Thank you very much. Actually, only one question, which is the cash payment
from If? So if I look at -- I'm not sure my numbers are correct, but 2016, EUR586 million;
2017, EUR620 million; 2018, EUR675 million; 2019, EUR710 million; and 2020, EUR600
million. And I'm kind of thinking, why? Why is it down given that we've had such an
unbroken trend of rising dividends from If? And maybe you can give us a feel for what it
says about how you see If or how you see group cash? I'm really puzzled by that ﬁgure.
Thank you.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Thanks for the question, Michael. We don't necessarily have any target to have from one
speciﬁc subsidiary an ever increasing internal dividend as such. We manage If's balance
sheet on an individual basis and group liquidity on a holistic basis. If's -- I would say,
though, that If's dividend is a little bit on the conservative side because we felt it made
sense to leave If with a strong solvency, which is what we did, which means that we took
up a little bit below 90% of last year's earnings, while we last year reduced the solvency a
little bit more than reported earnings for the year before. So, that's the answer to the ﬁrst
one.

FINAL

On the second question, in terms of cash ﬂow from the insurance operations, if I heard
you correctly, obviously, If just talked about, the solvency in Mandatum is strong at the
end of the third quarter with 206%. There is nothing currently that doesn't make me think
that we can take up a good dividend from Mandatum as well. And also with
Topdanmark's results and solvency. And of course, the fact that they only also have paid
50% of last year's dividends so far in '20, we expect to have a good cash ﬂow also from
Topdanmark in the beginning of next year.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

So I can understand, when you pay the dividend, so your 2021 -- sorry, sorry about that.
Your 2021 cash payable -- so 2020 dividend, is it funded out of the -- which part of money
is it funded out of? Is it -- should I think of the If payment you've just made plus the
Mandatum and Top that is going to come in Q1, is that how you look at it?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Well, obviously, If's dividend as such will be paid in December. Mandatum normally,
which it will this year, next year as well, everything else equal, pay in the beginning of the
year, and so does Top. So we -- we've...

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Then obviously, we're hoping for an ECB, a positive ECB decision before that as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

From Nordea, yes.

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

So I was more referring to the insurance dividends, which I understood was your
correction -- was your question. But that's right. Of course, Nordea usually pay its
dividend at the beginning of the year as well. So, we don't look upon it in any special way.
There is no speciﬁc need in the holding company in December, which makes us take up
this dividend from If, at this point in time. The dividend payment for If has for some years
been at the end of the year instead of the beginning of the year. But there is nothing
special in terms of holding company's needs this year, which means that it sort of will
consume parts of the EUR600 million for any particular purpose, other than being a part
of the dividend for next year.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Super. Thank you.

Our next question is from Blair Stewart of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is
open.

FINAL

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you very much, and good afternoon everyone. I've got a couple of questions. Can I
just clarify the pro forma solvency ﬁgure if we pro forma it for the completion of Hastings
and also accruing a dividend at EUR1.5? Was that the 173% ﬁgure that was quoted in your
comments? And I have some follow-up questions, but maybe just take that one ﬁrst?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Thanks, Blair. Good to clarify those numbers. What we have in the report with the pro
forma of Hastings is 185%. That's up 10% from what we indicated as a pro forma solvency
level, in Q2. It has nothing to do with Hastings, it's improvement in the solvency ratio of
the rest of the Sampo Group. The 173% is in addition to pro forma Hastings, we also
accrue a dividend. As you know, sort of under Solvency 2, you don't accrue dividend in
terms of your regulatory reporting on a quarterly basis. So, we have just done that for this
illustrative purposes by basically accruing last year's dividend, which is how banks reports,
for example, on a quarterly basis to accrue a quarterly dividend based on last year
payments.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thank you. So the 173% is pro forma for Hastings and the accrued dividend at
the nine-month stage. So that takes my the second question -- takes me onto the second
question then. Given that you've said that you don't want to hoard capital or build war
chests, should we then assume that should Sampo receive a dividend from Nordea this
year or indeed next that, that would then be available for payout via a dividend to Sampo
shareholders?
And my ﬁnal question is, we're another quarter on after the initial announcement of
Hastings. I just wonder, is there anything you can say that you've seen in the last quarter
with regards to the performance or otherwise of the Hastings business over that period of
time? Any new news? Thank you.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Let me start with the Hastings. There is very little we can say other than that, of course, a
pure play car insurer in the UK. We would assume that they ﬁnd life a little bit easier, for
sad reasons, but still than normal. That's that. And then, if we speculate in Nordea being
allowed to pay a dividend, that would certainly be nice. And what should be done with
that? That would, of course, depend on the exact reasons why they were able to pay it,
what we expect the future to be and what our situation is then. So, if I can -- if I may
abstain from speculating further.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

But you have said that Sampo will not maintain capital over and above what you need to
run the business, right?

Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Haywood of HSBC. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good afternoon everyone. Obviously, following up on the Solvency
II own fund, aside from the EUR1 billion debt increase, the own fund increased by an
additional EUR700 million. And can you tell me what was the big driver of that? Because
the proﬁt is obviously not pointed at that level for the quarter. That's the ﬁrst question.
The second question is on your running yield on ﬁxed income portfolio in the If P&C
business is at 1.4%. Now, can you clarify if that ﬁxed income portfolio covers the -- or
include the covered bonds as well? And if it doesn't, can you tell me what the running
yield is on the covered bonds part of your If P&C investment portfolio? And then, the last
question from me is on reserve releases. And I'm just trying to understand that EUR136
million for the nine months. This is a net reserve release. Is it net of the EUR51 million
change in the discount rate or is it completely separate item to think about? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

On the drivers of own funds, obviously, proﬁt is a part of it. In addition -- reported proﬁt,
in addition to that, we had positive market value changes in our investment portfolio,
which goes into the total comprehensive income. And we also had the positive
development in the Nordea share price, which doesn't impact neither the reported proﬁts
or the total comprehensive income. But it does impact our own funds, given the shift we
did in our solvency calculation or the regulatory solvency calculations last year, going
from a ﬁnancial conglomerate to a Solvency II insurance group. So, proﬁt market value
changes in total comprehensive income and positive share price development of Nordea
is the drivers of our own funds in Q3. When it comes to the running yield, not sure if there
were two parts of your question, but the reason why If's running yields went down in the
third quarter was that the cash portion of the investment portfolio increased. Then the
running yield is including our covered bond portfolio as such. It's a part of the report that
running yield. And your third question was whether -- where you can ﬁnd the cost of the
reserve strengthening in Finland. That is included in the net prior year result.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Just following up on the last point there. So, the prior year gains you give for the third
quarter of EUR33 million. If you gross that up, remove the Finnish discount rate change,
you get to a very high EUR84 million. Can you talk about where these are coming from at
all?

anything to that?

Our next question is from Jan Erik Gjerland of ABG. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you good afternoon. I have three questions as well. The ﬁrst one is related to
premium growth. What kind of outlook would you think about when it comes to premium
growth not only for the remainder of the year, but also into the 2021?
Earlier, you had said that you sort of calculate back to the 7.5% ROE which you require and
end up with a sort of a wanted premium for the customers? How should we read into 2021
when it comes to growth? Would you go back to have a lower ROE and then grow your
market share? Or would you sort of grab the opportunity you have in the insurance
market on the Nordic to increase your ROE going forward and that also hiking your
premiums more than claims inﬂation, just thinking very loudly.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

That's for Morten. But just initial remark is that, of course, say, two-thirds of the growth is
rate increases. So, that's adjustments in areas where we feel it's needed. And we will
always do that. There's no change, of course. Morten?

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Yeah. Then, Jan Erik, I can say a little bit about the growth. As Torbjorn already pointed
out, the growth that we see year-to-date is to a fair extent fueled by price increases, so
roughly two-thirds being price increases and about one-third being more underlying
growth in number of objects insured. When it comes to the outlook, of course, it's diﬃcult
really to speculate. I think it's quite uncertain times. However, what we have seen is quite a
high activity level, particularly in the private segment. So, if you look at new cars sales in a
number of the countries, you see a sharp increase suddenly in the third quarter. And
some countries also have reported now new car sales in October being very strong. So,
the households investment levels seems to be fairly high at this point in time. So, of
course, that's a positive when it comes to the future outlook.

FINAL

On the negative side, of course, there is still a lot of uncertainty in particular sort of
commercial and industrial, to what extent ongoing crisis will impact diﬀerent industries
and then sort of impact on premium's income. So, I think it's a bit more uncertainty and a
bit harder to sort of predict really how will the growth going forward. I think when it
comes to price increases, we still see that the market is disciplined. There are still some
pockets where we need to see certain price increases. So, I think that's the comment on
that.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Then, secondly, on your Hastings acquisition, is it so that you should
implement it after the court hearing? Or is it sort that you will do it from the January 1? Or
how should we think about your implementation of the Hastings into your group? And
how would you do it? Will you do it like Topdanmark or how should we look at it going
forward? That will be perfect. Thank you.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Thanks, Jon Erik. That is a good question. Appreciate -- able to comment on that. We
expect the closing later this month, let's say, in the middle of November. And given that
we still have one and a half months left of '21, that means that we need to consolidate
Hastings in 2020 as a subsidiary. So, you will have full consolidation of Hastings in the
balance sheet as of 31st of December. And in the P&L, you will ﬁnd Hastings included as a
segment for 1.5 months, when we report the Q4 and full-year result.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. Very clear. Then just ﬁnally, on the life side, you seems to have sort of taken down
your risk, especially in the segregated accounts, quite nicely. How should we think about
the buﬀers going forward in this kind of high levels of guarantees post-2022? How is the
buﬀer situation looking after 2022?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

The discount rate in Mandatum -- the discount rate reserve in Mandatum as of the end of
Q3 is around EUR180 million -- EUR170 million, Jarmo corrects me to EUR1 million. That's
covering the 4.5% guarantee down to 3.5% for the lifetime of the contracts. And as you
say, a lower discount rate up until 2022. There's a couple of things here. One is that we're
making every year, which we'll also do in Q4 an assessment or the need for increasing the
discount rate further. Then the pace of run-oﬀ has increased further, which is positive,
because it means that when we come to the end of '22, which was your speciﬁc question,
we will have a little bit lower sort of portfolio liabilities, that needs to be reserved for, than
what we previously had assessed. But it is an assessment we do mainly once a year and
we'll do so in Q4 as well.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

And if I could just follow-up on the last one, these sort of buﬀers, will they be taken from
your mark to value reserve? Or should we think about you taking them out of the P&L
somewhere?

FINAL

If we reserve additionally for a discount rate and reserve in Mandatum, it will be out of the
P&L. It would basically be an adjustment to the reported investment, AFS investment
result. That's been the practice for some time, and we will follow that. Now, I didn't say
that we will do an additional reserving, but if we do, that's how it will be accounted for.

Thank you. It was just a quick follow-up question on kind of deals. You know you have
these strategic or non-strategic stakes, like ﬁnancial stakes. And I think recently, there was
an announcement -- I'm going to get this wrong, that Nets is merging with something.
And in exchange, you're getting shares which are listed, but there is a lockup period. And
I just wondered if you could give us a little bit more color on this, just to get a feel for -- if
you should decide to sell, when you would be free to do so? And is there any additional
kind of things we should be thinking about in our portfolio? Thank you.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

We don't comment on individual investments. It's not something, individual investment,
we spend a lot of time on a daily basis. But we do, as you recognized, that it looks like the
Nets investment for diﬀerent reasons might turn out to be a really good one. And it's an
investment, which as with all investments, we make sort of decisions when the time is right
to sell. And that would go for Nets and that we go for all other investments in both the
Sampo plc and the insurance operations as such. There is nothing new in Sampo plc's
investment portfolio, sort of to talk about, at this point in time.

Hi, good afternoon. Just one point of clariﬁcation for me, please, on Knut's slide at the
beginning talking about leverage. You said you had no plans to increase debt leverage or
gross debt. And you've worked to bring down leverage over time, if I heard you correctly.
And can you give us any more detail on whether you have a target ratio for leverage or

sort of a timeframe in mind here? Or maybe what sort of leverage levels you might be
comfortable with if you don't want to stipulate to particular target? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Thanks. We'll plan to do a bit more update on that particular point at the Capital Markets
Day in February. But I think you could have as an indication that we would look to bring
down the leverage to levels it were prior to us raising the subordinated debt for the
Hastings acquisition over time.

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Thank you for taking another question from me. I noticed that you're talking about an aim
to grow organically and target organic underwriting growth. Obviously, trying to increase
underwriting P&C business going forward on an organic basis. Can you give us some idea
of how you'll be doing this? What your strategy here is? Are you focusing on customer
numbers? Are you focusing on rate increases? Are you focusing on regional expansion?
Anything -- not taking away too much from your forthcoming Capital Markets Day, but
anything you could give in this proposal to target organic underwriting growth, would be
helpful.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Let me save the fascinating insights into P&C insurance details to the Capital Markets Day.
But, Morten, feel free to add. But I want to give you a simple answer. Our target has
always been and will always be underwriting proﬁts, to increase the underwriting proﬁts.
That's number one, two, three for us. Then we look at growth in a diﬀerent way than some
other companies. We look at it the way that we invest in improved customer service, not
least then omnichannel web services. If that produces better customer satisfaction, more
customers, we're very happy, and that's of course the target for that. But the prime target
is underwriting proﬁts and will remain so.

FINAL

Hello, thank you for taking my questions, sorry for -- I was on mute. If I could shed some
light into the market situation in diﬀerent countries. If you could do some more
speciﬁcation on how you see the competitive environment in each market and who you
see as the main competitor currently? And that will be very good to understand the P&C
market further from here. Thank you.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Morten? We have Morten in a diﬀerent location that has worked well until now. Let's see if
we can get hold of him.

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Yeah. Now, is it better?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And I think the competition is largely unchanged. So, it's still sort of mainly the three, four
main players that you will ﬁnd in each and every market that we compete with. So, it's
really no big change on the total perspective, sort of in the Nordic P&C insurance
landscape.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. So, because it looks like the -- as some of the sort of the price pressures are out of
the market being forced on weak combined ratios to reprice as well, it looks like it's a
good ability for you and say for other major players to sort of increase your thinking and
increase your pricing. So, how do you see these kind of smaller players and price
pressures being -- when could they return to the marketplace, so to speak, to be more
irritating competitors going forward?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

It will happen tomorrow, is it?

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

The market that continues, I would say, to be disciplined. So, we do see that sort of -- in
the few areas where there is a need for price increases, we see that it's possible to get that
through as sort of most players are disciplined in Nordic P&C insurance market. I think,
yeah, they've seen a bit of consolidation lately, but not to a large extent. Perhaps a bit
more in Norway than on the other countries. Of course (Technical Diﬃculty) that becomes
more digital. Scale is quite important in order to aﬀord investments needed, in order to
have (inaudible) customer services.
