Presentation
Operator
Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the M&G PLC Half Year 2021 Result Q&A. I will
now hand over to Luca Gagliardi to begin.

Luca Gagliardi

{BIO 21290241 <GO>}

Good morning and welcome. I'm here today with John Foley, our Chief Executive and
Clare Bousfield, our Chief Financial Officer. John will be giving a short introduction and
then we'll be happy to take your questions. Over to you, John.

John Foley

{BIO 4239156 <GO>}

Thanks, Luca. Good morning, everybody, thanks for joining the call. Today's result having
show very good progress on our actions to reposition the business for sustainable
growth, while we continue to generate strong capital. Institutional assets under
management, reached a record GBP89.7 billion, following net client inflows of GBP2.2
billion, mostly from Europe, and we're very happy about that.

In retail Asset Management, net client outflows more than halved as investment
performance improved with 63% of funds in the top two quartiles over one year. In July,
we launched PruFund Planet, the UK's first smoothed savings proposition that offers
positive societal and environmental outcomes. Today, we are announcing an interim
dividend of 6.1 pence per share taking our cumulative payouts since listing in October
2019 to 40.1 pence per share. And thanks to that dividend policy and share price
performance we have delivered total shareholder returns of over 30%, since demerger
versus 6% for the FTSE100 index. We still have much work to do to set up the business for
sustainable growth, but I do believe these results show, we are making good progress.
So I'm happy now, to hand over to Lucas to take the questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)

A - Luca Gagliardi

{BIO 21290241 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We had a couple of questions submitted from online before the start of the conference.
So the first two are for you, John. How comfortable are you that the action that you have
taken on Retail Asset Management and what the outflow and what the -- would expect
those flows to return to positive. The second one is whether we can have an update on
PruFund in Europe, and expectations around launch.

A - John Foley

{BIO 4239156 <GO>}

So, on the retail asset management side, obviously we made good progress there and
we are -- in this for the long-term. So it's about shaping the activity. So that we've got
long-term sustainable capable performance in the front. So there will inevitably be a little
bit of volatility.
So, if the question is around, specific date. When will we be sort of be definitively in with
all of our funds in the up two quartiles, obviously that will depend on the market and
performance. But generally, we are heading in the right direction. This has already had an
impact on flows. Some of those flows out, flows being one off, so the picture from my
perspective looks even a little better than you've said today.
So I guess, I would be a bit choppy as we go through the period towards the end of the
pandemic, but directionally we're going in the right place and actually, more importantly
from a organizational perspective from a management perspective it is absolutely the
right, I think, I would characterize it as it is working.
On PruFund in Europe, so we continue to talk to the regulators on this. As I've said before,
we are operationally ready to do this, our clients came to -- have this proposition certainly.
The partner banks in Europe are very keen to be selling this product to their customers.
So, but I think from a regulatory perspective, it's how I'd say it is a potentially, a very large
Page 2 of 21

FINAL

opportunity. We certainly see it that way and I think quite rightly the regulators want to be
very clear about what the growth rates of this product might be, what the impacts might
be in their environment. So, it's reasonable that they are taking their time to analyze this
product. So I'm not going to give time scales, I've done that before. But we're working
hard on the proposition.

A - Luca Gagliardi

{BIO 21290241 <GO>}

Thank you, John. And, here I'd leave two for you Clare coming before the session. The
first one is with regards our annuity capital generation, the underlying one. So noticing that
there was a little bit of possibly miss versus consensus, I'm trying to understand what
drove that, how is the longer-term expectations?
The second one is about our total capital generation target 2.2 billion and the question is,
why didn't we simply revise the target rather than being a new in the 2.6 billion target for
2021 to 2023. And then the position mean anything for how we think about, short-term
dividends, such it is more like three questions on there.

A - Clare Bousfield

{BIO 16746072 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Luca. So on the first question, around the underlying capital, you are absolutely
right. The key driver in terms of why, the underlying capital is bound driven by the annuity
book. And there were two reasons why that underling capital is lower than prior year and
in terms of consensus. So firstly, we looked to basically pass all of the excess capital up
from the operating company up to M&G Plc, and so there were significant dividends up
from the insurance company up to M&G Plc as part of the strong returns in 2020.
And as a result, the portfolio that we operated M&G sales level is basically on a more
conservative basis, so the returns are lower, in terms of, so that is one of the key drivers.
The second one is driven by the way Solvency II effectively operates. So if you think about
the opening yields that is the position that we basically put into the underlying capital
return in terms of, so the yields is low at the beginning of the year. If you look at the yield
now and it is obviously higher, that has quite big impact in terms of actually assets returns
on the surplus and the annuity portfolio.
So those are the two drivers. Obviously, when you look at where yields are today, we're in
a much stronger position. So, in terms of actually thinking about that going forward, but
obviously also depending on where yields are at the year-end. The second question
around operating capital generation, so as part of that long-term incentives that are
basically delivered in, at the end of this year. What we do is positive, is one of the key
measures is capital generation.
Historically, we basically view total capital generations as one of the key measures and
that's because we want to be completely aligned with our shareholders. For the years '21
to '23 predominantly driven by the pandemic and the fact that it's very difficult to basically
say that market moves over a three-year period, we've gone with an operating capital
generation target 21 to 23. So every year that we basically issue another tranche of long-

Page 3 of 21



Company N ame: M &G PL C
Company Ticker: M N G L N Equity
Date: 2021-08-10

term incentive plan, what we will have is another capital generation target for the next
three-year period.

FINAL

What that basically does is drive to sustainable capital generation for us from a
management team perspective in terms of how we incentivize. So that is how we think
about it rather than actually adjusting the original target because they are obviously linked
to the original issuance of a long-term plan.
As far as the capital position guidance, yes, balance sheet is very strong. We're very
pleased in terms of the financial position, and from when we stand back and look at that
in terms of how we think about capital management, excessively have to remember that
we are still in a pandemic. The government is still providing a lot of support to the
economy and therefore there is uncertainty around volatility.
We've only got to look back at what happened in the first half of 2020, verses what
happens in the first half of this year. You've got two very different periods in terms of
volatility, so from that perspective we are mindful of that, and we need to make sure that
we've got a strong balance sheet and we've retained flexibility.

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, we're obviously looking to basically invest in the business to generate growth,
but also to drive an operate model in terms of the -- in terms of what we are doing. And
you can see that in terms of seeing price point in terms of what we are expecting to do
around the 2022 capital target. We have no interest in keeping excess capital and cash in
this business, we've said that consistently, but we also need to maintain a degree of
prudence and we're thinking about the current situation in terms of pandemics.

A - Luca Gagliardi

{BIO 21290241 <GO>}

Thank you, very much Clare. Now we can move on to the live Q&A from sell-side analyst.
The first one on the list is Dominic O'Mahony from Exane

Q - Dominic O'Mahony
Hi folks. Hope you can hear me?

A - John Foley

{BIO 4239156 <GO>}

Yes. And we can see you as well.

Q - Dominic O'Mahony
Very good. Nice to see you. And thank you for making the time to answer our questions.
Three for me, if that's okay. And first you just want institutional asset management, you
showed a chart on Page 12, with a very nice trajectory upwards of the revenue margins,
albeit with a small blip this half. I think because of the mix of the business. Are you
confident that that trajectory will continue? I mean, as you continue to emphasize the real
assets where you see a lot of growth in the market? And I suppose, the other part of that
question is, a lot of asset managers would like to be big in real assets and maybe you
have an advantage there. But you might have thought that there would be competition
Page 4 of 21



Company N ame: M &G PL C
Company Ticker: M N G L N Equity
Date: 2021-08-10

FINAL

there which then puts pressure on the margins that you can achieve. Is that something you
recognize or would you disagree?
And second question on management actions. Page 27 shows an extraordinary track
record of delivering these and you are being very confident about delivering these going
forwards. If you provide some of the categories of types of management action on the
right hand side of this slide, I was curious what proportion would you say is down to the
asset trading and the reason I ask is, it strikes me that that's a bit that actually should have
created lifetime cash, while it sort of accelerates it. So if you can give me some sense of
what proportion comes from that'll be very helpful.
And the third question on PruFunds UK. In the press release, you reiterate the point about
the economic environment for the lockdown by making it difficult for advisors to operate
on a business as usual basis. Basically, you also point to a shift towards platforms and
consolidation amongst the advisory firm as being a factor that might sort of weigh on
flows. I wonder if you could flush that out and then the future the other thing you can
address that. So, for instance, maybe consider the offering -- on third party platform and
it's not a one-off ? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Foley

{BIO 4239156 <GO>}

Okay, thank you for those. I'll take first, Clare will second and then we'll do a combo for
the third, I think. So, on the institutional business, confidence remains strong, because
we've talked about the pipeline of new business. And we've talked about that
consistently, since we've been a separate company. So, we talked about the pipeline of
new business, for which we're looking for assets, is in the range of 4 billion to 5 billion
that's -- that remains the case.
And I talked about this funnel type of approach, where it gets topped up with the assets,
are found and the capital deployed, the other thing is the medium sized wins. So those if
you are like slightly further out, wins that we have yet to see sort of in the contracts time,
so, there's a good pipeline and that is still strong. We've also won more mandates just as
we are very pleased about. So again, all the size -- in terms of the competition. Yeah of
course, I mean we are not complacent on this business, we're very strong. We happen to
be strong in private assets. We have a very good network of people around the world
looking for these types of assets, for these strategies, that you cannot be complacent.
The thing is though, this comes back to the combination of being asset manager and
asset owner, where we deploy these sorts of techniques for the asset owners and that
then gives confidence to our institutional clients to more just mandate because they've
seen the track record that we've been able to achieve over a very long period of time.
I think that, again, I'm definitely not complacent, but if you are somebody who is seeing
that, this is a good opportunity. You want to get and you do have to put quite a bit of
capital in. And you do have to establish a track record. So it's isn't that easy to do. So that
would be our answer for that question. And then, you also ask that pressure on margins.
And we've talked about margins before in this business where, we bring on the new
client, new products and sometimes typically as we get to know them, that's certainly
Page 5 of 21



Company N ame: M &G PL C
Company Ticker: M N G L N Equity
Date: 2021-08-10

more vanilla strategies, so we can't charge the sort of things that we would hope to
charge later on, when we're doing more interesting things for that.

FINAL

So we would see that this was the wave effects, but generally going up and again
pressure on margin, in that world, it's all about that negotiation, there is kind of a market
stand so. And if we are good at what we do, people will -- for doing, I think I've covered
that question Clare you want to pick the second one..

A - Clare Bousfield

{BIO 16746072 <GO>}

So on the management action, in terms of the proportion of asset trading, so I think
we've talked about -- in terms of assets trading, think of some sort of range 50 million to
100 million in terms of what we would expect generate on an annual basis. If you look at
the numbers for 2021, it's just over a 100 million. It basically gets that trading and that's a
combination of where we are buying higher yielding assets, and in terms of maximizing
that return versus the capital and leveraging private asset capability.

Bloomberg Transcript

But also, sales of real estate, which I think you'll notice, we sold one of the properties that
generated a positive result in terms of that asset trading. The other thing, I would say is in
terms of those management actions, so treat, has an exhaustive list. There are also other
areas that we would love to drive rather than they're just good examples of what has
been historically in terms of the track record in terms of where we are at. So, other than
but we would necessarily say that asset trading would be only one that basically talks
about changes in terms of long-term of the total timing aspect. But you're right that is one
of the core strengths in terms of that asset trading and leveraging private asset capability.

A - John Foley

{BIO 4239156 <GO>}

Along first part -- yeah, so we talked to you before about the impact of pandemic on
Page 5, that is a clients -- in talking to our colleagues in the channels. It's clear that -- that's
still the case. And that we're finding, it's difficult to go to do it to clients. Obviously, the
PruFund product itself, is still the MG product. I mean, almost it has been outstanding.
And we have, as you've seen launch PruFund Planet that we think will be -- will really
resonate with parts both here and overseas. And it will be interesting to see how that I
mean, we haven't got any sales that's just yet and we only launched it last week, but that
will be a very interesting proposition because again, that proposition, it's got all the sort
of the hallmark characteristics of the conventional PruFund.
So, we wait to see, still good inflows. I mean 5 billion on an annual run rate is still, is still
strong. I think it's 2.1 or 2.2 in the first half, but, there is still an impact on the IFA channels
and we know that we have our own group and that's what causing the issue.

A - Clare Bousfield

{BIO 16746072 <GO>}

Your price -- platform and platform consolidation, so that was the big driver to the
Ascentric acquisition, is effectively being able to effectively leverage that platform both in
terms of all the -- but also in terms of PruFund and today we do offer a PruFund on that
platform although what we're working to integrate that further in terms of the solution.

FINAL

When you look at PruFund in Europe that is actually absolute PruFund on some other
people platforms in Europe that's how it works in terms in institutional side. So, absolutely
we have known and there's nothing here about saying that it's specific to us in terms of
our platform. But one of the things that's really important when you get a platform play
linked into an advisors business, is you naturally get flows. So it does take longer, because
you're firstly embedding that platform into business. So it's important in terms of how you
get those flows.
Historically, we've been really successful especially a transactional process, because the
proposition is so strong. But what we're seeing is that gradual shift towards platforms and
that is definitely putting a bit of pressure on flows from a PruFund perspective.

A - Luca Gagliardi

{BIO 21290241 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Next, one up is Andrew Sinclair from Bank of America.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 3232978 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, hi, good morning. I want to ask -- three from me if that is okay. Firstly with on
annuities going again to asset trading, not citation, but this time on the IFRS side, I know
you gave it, this was going to be lower this year, but I think 4 million was quite
exceptionally low. And in your script, I think you mentioned an accounting loss of property
disposal, just why don't you give us some color on, how much was that accounting loss
and if any color on what we should look at from the IFRS, so it's going forward.
Secondly, sorry to go back to capital deployment but I mean, you've got 1.7 billion of cash
of holding which is somewhat you euphemistically said, is more than one year of central
outgoing. But I think it about 1 billion, more than one year central out going, not to mention
the strong solvency, I get prudence, but it kind of looks excessive. And we have seen
more companies across Europe, putting capital to work, as we emerge from the
pandemics, really fought those to trigger, to start putting that capital to work.
And third question for me, is on the asset management cost-to-income ratios in creeping
up a bit. I realized about it seems like the cost to income ratio has been creeping up.
When will your cost management action see that, that peak in and potentially come back
down again? Thanks.

A - Clare Bousfield

{BIO 16746072 <GO>}

So on the annuity product and in terms of the property. So this is a -- new -- with the our
way accounting works in terms of the liability and what basically -- we basically sold a
property pretty much at market value and if you can see that from capital benefit that
we've got in terms of the asset traded in optimization. Then on an IFRS basis, you end up
taking an accounting hit as a result of that. So that's the reason why you get this loss that
basically net stands at 4 million in terms of the other.
From a capital deployment perspective,

Page 7 of 21



Company N ame: M &G PL C
Company Ticker: M N G L N Equity
Date: 2021-08-10

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 3232978 <GO>}

So yeah, just check, how much was that property loss?

FINAL

A - Clare Bousfield

{BIO 16746072 <GO>}

Yeah. I was going to say it was around 20 million. Luca is telling me it is 17 million in terms
of loss. So on the - on the capital deployment, in terms of the strength of the balance
sheet absolutely rigorously in terms of the strengths of that. I think it is important and they
take it back to the press conference 2020, when we had about 700 million loss with
results of volatility in the market versus what is being in the first half of '21, I think anybody
would say that you've got to acknowledge that, that volatility is still out there in terms of
the context of where we're sitting in the pandemic and the fact that the government is
still supporting the economy.
So, we need to make sure we think about the balance sheet over the medium and long
term, rather than necessarily purely the short-term, absolutely are we committed in terms
of investing in the business in terms of generating growth and you can see in terms of the
strength of the institutional composition in terms of what we've been able to deliver.
We've also repatriated about 25 billion of assets under management, and built teams in
Asia and the U.S. in terms of actually what we've built out.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, there's some examples in terms of actually where we are putting money to work.
We're also being investing in terms of actually improving the efficiency of the business of
generating the right operating model, leveraging technology and that's been a big focus
in terms of investment over the last two to three years.
So that is fundamentally what we're looking to do. It is capital light that strategy that's how
we operate so, we're not expecting to deploy significant volumes of capital, but it is
important in terms of actually making sure that we're driving growth across the business
but also efficiency in terms of what we're doing.
So, I wouldn't describe it as overly cautious or overly prudent. I would say right now we are
taking the right approach but we're very much on a wait and see in terms of and
constantly monitoring and thinking about what do we believe have to position the
business should be. In terms of the cost-to-income ratio, you'll see in terms of the Slide
on Page 33, you can see in terms of the cost base on what we're expecting the cost
number to -- what was delivered in the first half of '21. And you can see that we have
delivered significant cost savings across the business.
You need to recognize that on the asset management side, there are number of places
where we are investing. So as talked about the two teams in the Asia and U.S., but also,
we've added capability on the private asset side. So, what you're seeing in that, so the
bottom green, asset management cost base is efficiency, but also investment in terms of
future business. So, yes we are very focused on the cost income ratio, but it's also a
reflection of the revenue -- as much it is the cost, and we do need to think about effective
driving growth at the same time as driving, scalable efficiency.

{BIO 21290241 <GO>}

Okay, thank you very much, Clare. Thank you, Andy. The next question should be Andrew
Crean from Autonomous.

FINAL

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. I've got three questions. Firstly, the coverage ratio today , there
is clearly, there has been a significant move in revs since June? And secondly, I think in
terms of deployment capital, you say that you want to deleverage that -- with 300 million
debt from June 2024. By the end of 2022, do you want to a fully cater to that or just pro
rata amount?
And then thirdly coming back really to add to these questions -- and companies can really
see where we are -- capital in the future, are you really saying that you will not make any
decisions about capital returns until you hit -- December 2022. Well, there any marketing
conditions as we recover for the pandemic where you prepared to take a slightly more
closer bridge. Thank you.

A - Clare Bousfield

{BIO 16746072 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

. So, you are right, interest rates have dropped a bit than June. If you then see these in
the appendix, the fact that will give you a reasonable property in terms of what's
happened to us on this -- just dropped off a little bit, but it's not, it's not significant, The
second question, I didn't really fully capture all of it -- so you're talking about because it's
the tranche, you've set, that it comes up to call it, 300 million in 2024.
And clearly, in terms of, when we hit that 24 days, that gives us an opportunity in order to
be able to actually deleverage but ahead of that would depend on economic conditions
and the commercial position in terms of whether we did anything. But can I just check what
was the remainder of the questions that you are asking on leverage?

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

It was really -- you've got to pay down 300 million in 2024. At the end of 2022, do you
want to be holding 300 million over -- couple ready to do that. All of the pro rata alright
say, 200 million and then you will build up to 300 million in the yield.

A - Clare Bousfield

{BIO 16746072 <GO>}

Okay. I mean, I think what we need to I think certainly from my perspective, the way I look
at the capitol position is, I'm looking at it overall and I'm looking at the sensitivities in terms
of market movements to make sure that we're in a position that we can actually take
advantage of that call option at that relevant point in time.
But I'm certainly not building up on that and holding it and put the marketing it in terms of
what we're doing. We're just looking at the overall cap number in terms of that fact. And
then in terms of market uncertainty, and absolutely, I think there is market uncertainty, and
that's why, I get back to 2020, compared to '21. I don't think we're adjusting, that we're
basically going to hold till the end of '22.
Page 9 of 21



Company N ame: M &G PL C
Company Ticker: M N G L N Equity
Date: 2021-08-10

FINAL

I think what we're saying is, basically, we need to recognize that short-term volatility in
terms of things in the balance sheet but continue to monitor it in terms of the context of
the sensitivities we have hedging, is also an element in terms of this. But also thinking
about the investment opportunities that we have, in terms of investing in the business,
obviously, generated return in terms of those opportunities.
And then post that, we then say, right have we got excess capital when you thought
removal of that and that is something that we're doing on a in a day-to-day, monthly basis
in terms of -- the reason some kind of trigger point at a future day, it's really just looking
at all of those elements for macros, the opportunities and then saying, right what do we
want to do from a capital perspective. But as I said, we have no interest in retaining
excess capital, excess liquidity and improvement. Doesn't make any sense in terms of
where you go, but we need to take into account all the different elements.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I'll take your point in terms of volatility of market, so obviously in the normal cycle those
volatility of markets, managements teams and boards need to make up their mind around
what they can do to deploy capital that will affect the strategy or find some mechanism
due to share holders. And that debate, of course we have, but I would take the issue with
you that, this is a pandemic we are coming out of and it is an unusual time. And I think that
our shareholders would expect to serve a degree of caution around it both in terms of
what we do -- and that's the strategy we are deploying. So we can maybe agree to
disagree on that. Okay. Thank you.

FINAL

first of all, this 2.6 billion capital generation guidance for next three years. I mean, it's
good that it is clean of macros, as at least visibility is there, let's say, 2.1 billion over three
years. So that's 700 million a year. I mean, is that a simple way that you are thinking as
well, is 700 million is what you're trying to do deliver year-after-year. Or would you say
that it includes lots of, okay. There are some one-offs which you have planned for there
are some recurring item within that. So what's your thinking process in summing up with
this 2.6 billion pre-tax or let's say 700 million a year post that number? That's the first one.
Second thing again. Sorry to go back on the capital point, I mean, your solvency ratio is
around 200%. If I look at the peers like Lego and Aviva which are have much higher asset
when compared to yours, they are running at about 180, if I look at peers like Phoenix and
Just Group who are a bit more similar to your business model, they are running at about
160. So you have about 30, 40 points of extra capital compared to your peers set.

That's about 2 billion of extra capital. If I look at the asset risk, you have versus others. I
mean annuity is in the only a place, where you have asset risk because your risk profits, I
would say is pretty, pretty much protected from like even extreme macro scenarios. So
what macro scenario should we worry about from your annuities business perspective. I
mean that, would make you hold this much capital for more than 6 months to 12 months.
So any thoughts on that? Would be very helpful.
And third question would be if, if I think about the underlying capital generation, Clare you
mentioned, very clearly partly, because of the way, Solvency II mechanic work is we need
to take into account the beginning of the year Solvency II interest rates or macro. Where
would that number be, if we are talking about current rates current macro, I mean, would
it go up again 20%, 30% or would it be maybe like what you reported in first half plus,
minus 5%? Is it like a small difference or what do you say? The numbers will go back again
up to a reasonably higher member. Thank you.

A - Clare Bousfield

{BIO 16746072 <GO>}

So Ashik on the capital generation in terms of the way that we think about that is and this
is partly why we originally had tonnes of custom generation? Because one of the things
that's really important for us is to make sure that the balance sheet is robust. So, if you
look back, 2020 particularly in the first half of 2020, you pulled the lever on management
actions in order to compensate some of the volatility that we saw in the market in that
first half of the year. And that's why we saw slightly higher than normal, kind of capital
generation through the first half 2020, and to a certain extent in 2020.
So, you've got to think about we're not thinking about just managing the capital in terms
of --. What we're thinking about is it holistically in terms of making sure that we've got a
robust balance sheet. Clearly, the overlying capital generation is much more driven by the
underlying business performance in terms of what we're doing. And that is -- it's pretty
easy to predict in terms of actually what we're looking at in terms of the -- but when we
get management action and the market movements, we're obviously looking at the
overall solid position in terms of what we're doing.

FINAL

So, we don't necessarily think about it 700 million per year, what we're thinking about is
just like - back to the position we're trying to get to. And to a certain extent, the hedging
strategy plays into that and how are you -- your own rule managing the balance sheet?
The second question you had around the capital position. So the one thing that I would
say that, was missing from your analysis was on the shareholder transfer with profit loans.
So we have got an annuity portfolio, but it position us relatively conservatively but the
position that we've taken as a clear strategy that we've had.
So yes, there is volatility from interest rates, I guess there is exposure to credit and sand
grades and diesel. But as I said it can put it conservatively position portfolio. But the with
profit share all the transfers they contain underlying asset risk basically based off the
underlying assets that are in that portfolio. We do hedged some of that exposure through
the hedging but the profit fund is investing in a very, very wide range of assets. Now does
that create diversification, but it was a great volatility. So that's quite different to our peers
in terms of the companies that you quoted.

Bloomberg Transcript

So when we look at the overall -- position, what we've talked about is 170% at the point in
time that we went through the merger and being at solvency level in those market
conditions that we felt comfortable with. What we're saying today is we're at a pandemic
and basically that they've been a lot of volatility over the last 12 to 18 months and that we
need to make sure that we see through that in the short to medium term before we're in
a position. So right, this is where we want to be that's all we are saying nothing more than
that.
In terms of, in terms of underlying capital generation, so the difference between the
yields at the beginning of the period and the yields, were basically flow in the market
movement. So whatever the market portfolio is the difference between what you put in
these, underlying capital generation the difference goes into market movements, that's
how it works in terms of it. But in some ways, those have blown up, if we are taking yields,
on an average monthly basis in terms of the opening position if that makes sense.

Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I've got three questions, if you don't
mind. I think you mentioned that 4 billion pipeline of the institutional AUM. And you said
there was 5.5 billion of mandates through principles. For me if I don't understand how
long it takes for it to be coming to your invested AUM. Could you give us a bit more color
on when this is coming to your AUM that would be very helpful.
Secondly, on the UK PruFund business, obviously it might be a bit disappointing in the first
half, but have been using - certainly improved in the last couple of months and economies

have opened up, and some of your peers have obviously had a fund fact, let's say six to
nine months in terms of getting -- demand and high level of deposits in bank savings
account. And then finally from the -- on your operating capital generation targets of 2.6
billion. And, confirm this is a pre-tax target. And is not tax and therefore, she might be
looking at the 309 million or 309 minus 8 as future tax rate. Thanks.

A - John Foley

{BIO 4239156 <GO>}

Steven thanks for those. On the institutional question. I'm afraid I can't be precise. It
depends on the strategy that we are working on parts and it depends on where we can
source the assets. We have -- we had deployed more resource internationally to find
assets in other markets, private assets in other markets. And when we talk to potential or
existing or potential institutional clients about their portfolios and about the strategies, we
have brought into the computation much more about international opportunities to
acquire assets. So it depends, is the long and short of it and it could be a couple of
months. It could be a year and as I say it will depend on the strategy, but we're talking
private assets, it is a public asset transaction and obviously quickly.

Bloomberg Transcript

So and that really whether it's the, I mean, the teams are low in the sense that if they're
talking to clients and the signs are positive, then of course, we're looking for the assets
almost immediately. But, if they're not available, that could be. On the UK PruFund, the
economy has opened up a bit. Absolutely, agree with that. But in terms of the target
market for that product, it's still people who are making kind of right decisions in
retirement. And we haven't really seen that come to life so to speak.
We know there's pent-up demand there, but I think to your suggestion that others are the
jump on us. I don't think that's right. It's a different segment of the market and there's a
different requirement of customer capital which you are looking at. So my view is that, this
is still a very strong proposition and particularly, so now we've got PruFund Planet of being
available, but I'm not going to sort of hold out for storms on that.
Clare do you want to take these?

A - Clare Bousfield

{BIO 16746072 <GO>}

So on the operating capital generations target, pre-tax and 309 million is obviously from
that. In terms of, so those are comparative numbers.

FINAL

Sure Luca. I will keep it to two then. And so my first one is on the crew money. So you
captured about 25 billion of assets for prudential, how much assets under management is
left to win back and what assets classes are these tent to be invested in. And then my
second question is around expenses. So firstly, how much of the GBP145 million of
annualized cost savings target you have to deliver and can you remind us that this is gross
or net organization.

A - John Foley

{BIO 4239156 <GO>}

Your first question is the bulk of the assets sort of moved. So there's pockets of small
pockets between the two companies but not at all significant. So I think of the 25 billion to
-- that is a significant shift, those assets were deployed into various, which is why we have
teams in North America and in Indonesia. So, Asian equities and fixed income, multi-asset,
North America into predominantly fixed income and some equity.

A - Clare Bousfield

{BIO 16746072 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The only expenses we're around about two-thirds of the way, we are in terms of actually
delivering against the 145. One of the things we've always said, is that the cost savings
were very back-ended, just by the nature of what we were doing, for a lot of it is about
investing in technology and infrastructure. And really driving the under investments that
have been in the business over the last 10 to 15 years.
So, we were always expecting that it would be a much more back-ended deliberate than
front ended. And the 145 is growth and inflation in terms of, in terms of the target that we
that we set, I think there's a chart that we included a couple of investor presentations that
that's show you the plans of how you get to the 145 -- inflation --

A - Luca Gagliardi

{BIO 21290241 <GO>}

Perfect. Thank you very much Rhea. Given that -- I believe Deutsche which was also asked
question here online, wonder whether we should take also Oliver's question yet to. The
first one is looking at future management actions and how do we expect these to split
between genuine value accretion versus acceleration of future cash flow. And the second
one is -- of the black movement in the first half of the year and to what extend these
translate into future cash --

A - Clare Bousfield

{BIO 16746072 <GO>}

So in terms of the management actions, there are is very difficult to give a kind of like in
terms of whether their acceleration or pure value creation. Obviously, the ones that -pure value creation is the more attractive opportunities, and we certainly need to
prioritize those in terms of the opportunity. But also what we're trying to do is manage
ultimately, what the type of cash flow is across the book.
And make sure that we've got fairly consistent earnings and a reasonable view in terms of
the best estimates. So, that's what we are ultimately trying to do in terms of over those,
four, but what does it generate -- we could clearly apparently. And then in terms of, in
terms of market movements, the vast majority of the market movements, arise in the
insurance company. And in terms of actually the ability to basically dividends up so those
Page 14 of 21



Company N ame: M &G PL C
Company Ticker: M N G L N Equity
Date: 2021-08-10

cash flows up to M&G plc. There's no issues around the cash and the capital that comes
up in terms of from the insurance company up to M&G plc.

FINAL

Obviously what we're looking at is both capital and liquidity in the insurance company
making sure that we're comfortable with both of those, but the philosophy is that we get
the excess up into M&G plc and so that we've got maximum flexibility across the business.
And then should the markets go again there isn't sufficient, within the insurance company
than what we would look to pay back down to the insurance company to make share that
look at the capital position. And that is how we think about it in terms of the philosophy
around cash and capital.

A - Luca Gagliardi

{BIO 21290241 <GO>}

Thank you, Clare. And next on line would be Louise Miles with Morgan Stanley.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Louise Miles

{BIO 20765435 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll just take two as well Luca.
My first one is on the capital position as well. I'm not sure if you can say too much, but I
believe you've got the hearing for there and then I need to transfer because I would say
in November if this is successful would we expect the -- there could be about a GBP100
million of capital relief by the end of 2020. While, I think that's what you guided to before,
I'd come and check if that is still correct. I think that's about six points of the capitol and if
you'd just confirm that would be great. And then just another question on PruFund, and I
mean, it seems like you're trying to kind of shift the distribution channel mix a little bit as
well. And by going all digital and moving it onto the platforms in Europe as well. I mean
longer-term I mean presuming there to be some costs increases shorter-term but longerterm, would you expect the cost base of PruFund to actually decrease because of this.
And also should we expect any shifts in the -- shift in mix and -- i.e. should there be a 20
bps shift towards -- more than that have been previously. Thanks.

A - Clare Bousfield

{BIO 16746072 <GO>}

So on behalf of the position around the annuity trends. You're absolutely right, there was
the courts or the court case to lead -- and for the transfer in November and yes, the
release capital if you remember 100 million which is, which is around about six percentage
points in terms of solvency condition.
So on this PruFund, I think, the first thing I would say, Louise, is that for the UK proposition,
this shareholder base we gets one ninth of the impact of performance. So it's actually that
with profit funds that is basically taking the expense risk in terms of the ongoing cost of
delivery of PruFund in the UK, subject to one new business, actually making sure that the
product is profitable. So what we are releasing in Europe, we're writing that on EUR100
basis, so just like any other asset management product.
So absolutely, it's been part of that that it's relevant. The scale is obviously important
without any one of these propositions in terms of what we're looking to do, but certainly
we still see a significant opportunity across Europe and to be able to drive that scale, it
Page 15 of 21



Company N ame: M &G PL C
Company Ticker: M N G L N Equity
Date: 2021-08-10

terms of what we're able to deliver. Yes we are looking at digital technology, that's what
we've been effectively putting through in the UK solution, based in terms of to improve
the customer experience, the buying experience, but also as an -- in terms of what we're
trying to deliver. And we will be leveraging that in the delivery of PruFund in Europe.

FINAL

A - Luca Gagliardi

{BIO 21290241 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Clare. Thank you Louise. Next question is from Andrew Baker, Citi.

Q - Andrew Baker

{BIO 3694545 <GO>}

Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So two from me. First from capital generation and
really it's goes back to the slide that you showed at the full year showing 10 billion of
underlying capital generation over the life of the annuity broken with profits book.
Obviously the return on surface points created, some volatility being laid out, has that
view on this, whatever the amount over the life of the book is that 10 billion changed
materially based on what we've seen in the first half. And then, secondly, just on
expenses. And you mentioned in your comments that the asset management expenses
were roughly in-line with 2019 after adjusting for someone one offs? 2019 saw secondhalf expenses significantly higher than first half. Should we expect that to be the same as
well in 2021? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Clare Bousfield

{BIO 16746072 <GO>}

So, in terms of the capital generation no, I wouldn't expect the 10 billion to materially
change Andrew in terms of the profile. Because obviously, that's over the long-term, and
obviously interest rates do have a potential impact, but it wouldn't see the need for it to
being materially, seeing that thoroughly fundamentally changing in terms of that 10 billion.
And in terms of the asset management expenses, yes, historically, we have typically seen
lower expenses in the first half of the year and higher expenses in second half of the year,
largely driven by some of the -- in terms of how they operate? That clearly that links into
revenue because that's one of the key drivers in terms of where the revenue is stronger,
what typically then happened is obviously the bonuses and incentives, but that for the netnet practices actually informative in terms of where we go.
So we have been doing a lot more work to affect to try to make sure that we get the in
kind of a corporate credit balance between two periods, in terms of half one and half two.
So, I wouldn't expect to see the same level of disparity between first and the second half
of the year, but it obviously, does depend on what happens to the revenue in the second
half of the year.

A - Luca Gagliardi

{BIO 21290241 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Next question is from Trevor Moss, Agency Partners.

Yep.

A - Clare Bousfield

{BIO 16746072 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah we can.

Q - Trevor Moss

{BIO 1741504 <GO>}

Okay. This is three questions, three questions, one very long question depending on how
you like it. It strikes me Clare that within the 2.6 of capital generation target, the new
target, there's probably about a billion of other capital generation kind of management
action stuff, which will take the total management action, capital generation to about 3
billion on a six-year view.

Bloomberg Transcript

Sorry 3 billion on the six year view out of a portfolio of about 20 billion on annuity side
which strikes me is a lot. Okay. So I'm not quite so sure that you're going to reach a cliff
edge in terms of not be underlying cap, in terms of the operating capital generation from
management actions but you're certainly coming to a conclusion where there's not much
left. So it strikes me, you're going to be much more reliant on the underlying performance
of the business to generate capital beyond that point and to satisfy given the
expectations now.
Coming back to one of Andy's original questions. On the asset management side, which
is clearly going to need to be one of the big drivers, for the last three years since 2018.
The revenues were down a 150 million and your costs were up 30, taking your cost-toincome ratio from 58 to 71. I think, we need to start thinking about what that trajectory
looks like and I quite, I'd be quite interested in any guidance you might be willing to give
on that trajectory over a three-year view on the cost to income ratio on revenues or on
costs.

A - Clare Bousfield

{BIO 16746072 <GO>}

Yes. So, one of the things Trevor that I think is important, is the track record that we've
built up in terms of management action is strong, as you can see from that, from Slide 27.
It's not purely about M&G plc portfolio, those there are management actions there that
we're driving around and chat, will be transformed with profit funds. And so I think that we
do in terms of what we're doing in terms of how we look at an important components
around together with some of the underlying assumptions around that book. So, so I
wouldn't not necessarily say it's purely about your new portfolio. So, one thing I would say
though, is you newest portfolio have a long run-up. So, in terms of actually being able to
manage and managing cyber assets illiquidity premium, that also some of the assumption
changes were sometimes, mortality, is also an important incentive that context. So yes,
they're not, they're not going to be infinite because the book has been run-off, but I still
would challenge your premise that they're going to run off any time soon in terms of, in
terms of our ability to kind of drive that piece?
Absolutely, in terms of core underlying results, is a strong focus. And you look at what
we've done in terms of the institutional broken stones of continued growth, good steady
margin again, very long term business 60% typically pension schemes and insurance
Page 17 of 21

FINAL

companies in terms of what we're delivering. Retail Asset Management, we've obviously
shown really good green shoots in terms of flows, but also the core underlying
performance in terms of what we're doing.
We are creating more efficient business model in terms of what we're driving across
business, but we are also investing in terms of growth, in terms of expansion of the
institutional book across Europe, talk about the Asian and U.S. capability that we build now
in terms of where we're at. So, I'm not going to give you any kind of you future view
around cost-to income ratios or revenue, but some of what you will have seen over the
last 18 months is a combination of our -- driving clear value and addressing the size and
sustainability in terms of what we're doing. But also in terms of broadening out the
product, in terms of what we're offering, so we've now got a lot of what I would say new
sustainable innovative product, that basically allows us to diversify in terms of some of the
big funds that we draw.
So from my perspective we are on that route to growth, in terms of where we're going
and you're right, we will then end-up less for management actions in terms of where you
go. But that is our key focus, that's what we're trying to drive.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Foley

{BIO 4239156 <GO>}

And importantly performance is a key area in that and we know we've been over the
period you talk about. We've been in the -- on performance and that's why we've had to
address that since -- with a company. That's why, we see doors open the wrong way, in
terms of the cost to income ratio. So that is something, we really had to address, but
again is no quick-fix because you clearly are set against the market that judges by one,
three and give five year time period. So this time periods that we have to show that we
have improved performance trajectory, is the right one to grow.

A - Luca Gagliardi

{BIO 21290241 <GO>}

Thanks John.

Q - Trevor Moss

{BIO 1741504 <GO>}

Okay. The one thing -- if I could come back on that. On the cost side is very difficult to get
a clear view of how much investment cost has gone into that costs line for the asset
management side. So, I mean it's obvious when you look at all the narratives and you talk
as you do, that in a lot of things going on. So, the challenge I think, for me is
understanding, whether the door is opening in the future, is going to be from holding the
cost line relatively flat from this level, or whether it's going to be driven by revenues. You
may say, well it is kind of both, but clearly on the costs would be, will be a starting point
because I have no idea how much is better than going into that cost money.

A - Clare Bousfield

{BIO 16746072 <GO>}

Yeah. So, I am going to give you the answer that's a bit of both Trevor because
fundamentally what we're trying to do is generate growth across both kind of books of
business, recognizing the margin dynamics quite different and even within the institutional
book, you have obviously got public fixed income and private but you've not quite
Page 18 of 21



Company N ame: M &G PL C

Date: 2021-08-10

FINAL

different dynamics and the mix of business is also relevant in terms of that. But it's also
relevant in total cost basis. Well, because private assets during -- more costs, just by the
nature of, in terms of value add and the quality in terms of what we're doing. So yes, we
have put in a fair degree of investment in terms of building our capability in the U.S. and
Asia, but we have also invested quite significantly and generated efficiencies in terms of
the operating model in terms of how we deliver.
So, it is very difficult to say, it's all costs and it's all revenues -- we wouldn't expect us to do
that because you want us to grow the business. But also, what you want to be able to do
is grow the business without a cost base growing incrementally on the same basis.

Thanks Clare. Thank you, Trevor. Moving on Farooq from Credit Suisse. We should be
heading straight to you.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi, everybody. Thanks very much. Personally just a quick one on the 2.6 billion of
underlying capital generation. Can we just assume that the vast majority of that can be
remitted and that's what we should be expecting now given your capital position? And
then secondly, going to retail performance of quick, I suppose the retail performance, you
talked about that you are going to be judged now one to three-year basis. I know from
my own history, as working the -- it tends to be more three to five on the institutional side,
but on the retail side, how quickly do you expect that to respond? And what can you say
has been driving the outperformance. So what would you between luck and process, what
can you tell us about that? Thanks.

A - John Foley

{BIO 4239156 <GO>}

Our process and marketing -- so they are working over that one. Look the sent -- the one
year is very important in European market, so when you're looking at the, so we don't
have to wait three to five year performance metrics to come through. If you're looking for
inflows in Europe -- the European market responds to the one-year, the one-year number.
So that's the heading in the right direction through three and five years will obviously take
time to more the UK market.
On institutional, yep and as you rightly point out it is a these are fairly sticky asset classes
and they just they just tend to feel. So demand I should say, and they just tend to build.
So, we remain positive about those. Otherwise, I think that, what, we're trying to say here
is that within these markets and directionally we're making progress. Clearly, we've taken
some fairly bold actions in terms of how we address the management of funds. So,
whether that's more of a team-based approach, we do risk based deep-dives on a
number of things that others may do.
But we then do you perhaps not as before so we've inculcated these sort of disciplines
into the group which is come down extremely well. The fund manager is obviously a
person who at the end of the day makes calls on his funds. But it is a lot more tools at his

from Barclays.

Q - Larissa Van Deventer

{BIO 21570130 <GO>}

Good morning, just two quick questions from me. The first one, obviously is the recent
changes in the fee charging structure in the last year. Are those done or are we in a move
that we should consider coming up? And then the last one, very big picture, but you just
on sustainability in your wording in today's release, three years from now, how do you
believe you were able to differentiate yourself from your competitors as just very hot
space at the moment?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Clare Bousfield

{BIO 16746072 <GO>}

Thank you. So yeah, so on the free structure Larissa when we basically, we've done three
separate risk changes in fee around the portfolio, one in '18, one in '19 and then again in
2021. The 2021 was the only range and what we have tried to position with the changes
that we've made is a possibly a long-term sustainable price that would be kind of
underlying strategy in philosophy. And you can never say there will never ever be more,
but that was our underlying philosophy, is that we want to address this head-on rather
than necessarily have a continual reduction in fee.

A - John Foley

{BIO 4239156 <GO>}

On the sustainability, there is couple of things. And I don't want to give you a try answer.
Because in one sense, it is in the competitive thing at all. When you look at what's
happening around the globe today, we want everybody to be moving sort of sustainable
solution because that's what planning obviously means not just from a environmental
perspective but also from a societal perspective. So we actually, really believe this. And
we believed in it, which is why we watch carefully, which we've talked about in the
previous session. We've launched PruFund Planet, we're moving our seek out range to
assess.
Yes, these are all very important things, we've joined any number of groups that are
moving powering against coal, for example. Because we want to send out that very
strong message to the whole organization with them due but also to the wider universe
as well that of course, we're in a competitive and dynamic environment and we want to
have a sustainable funding in the next, but actually it is like that we all have really good
sustainable funds because that's where we need to go as an environment, another
planet.
