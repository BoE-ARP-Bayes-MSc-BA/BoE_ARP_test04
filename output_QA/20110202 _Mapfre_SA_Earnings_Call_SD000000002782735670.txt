Presentation
Esteban Tejera

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to MAPFRE's full-year 2010 results
presentation. As usual, I'll give you an overview of the results and the main business
developments during the last year. Later Mr. Lubelli will explain the financials in greater
detail. Finally, we will take your questions.
Please let's move to slide number two. 2010 has not been an easy year from a macro
economic standpoint nor was it in the capital markets. Against this backdrop we consider
our results for the year as very satisfactory. I wish to note that MAPFRE achieved an
increase of nearly 9% in both revenues and premiums, a positive growth in funds under
management despite a substantial (inaudible) in asset values.
In the second half of the year, they grew by EUR0.5 million, excluding CATALUNYACAIXA.
Once again, understanding a combined ratio even if we take into account claims arising
from the Chilean earthquake in (February). And also an increase of nearly 1% in profits,
which is remarkable even though earnings per share contracted by 3.6 because of the
(inaudible) of the final dividend for 2009.
These results underline the growing international diversification of our Group, its
consistently proven approach to underwriting. And its financial strength.

FINAL

Please let's move to the following slide. For the fifth consecutive year our international
and reinsurance operations have grown faster than our Spanish business, raising even
further the contribution to our consolidated figures. If this pace continues, this year
MAPFRE may obtain most of its premiums and insurance profits from abroad.
I would like to highlight that the Spanish business has also recovered, despite a very
unfavorable operating environment. Recording premium growth up to 1.4% against
(inaudible) up to 2.2% in 2009. This performance has allowed MAPFRE to further engage
its market share to nearly 15% because the market contracted 3.9% in the same period.
MAPFRE pays great attention to its distribution power. Evidence of this is the creation of
Verti, an online Company for the Spanish market, the acquisition of InsureandGo, a
leading British Internet insurance portal, the agreement with CATALUNYACAIXA and a
long list of new distribution agreements with Bank (inaudible) in Latin America.
The combined ratio remained basically on balanced. Even accounting for the Chilean
earthquake, which caused the largest losses in MAPFRE's history. Excluding this, this ratio
actually fell by 1.3percentage points.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you know, MAPFRE's known for its financial strength and this year provided further
evidence of it. Equity grew nearly 10% since to retain profits and the dividend by
investment plan. This allowed us to absorb the payment of the largest amount of
dividends ever and substantial mark-to-market losses as we (consolidate). At the same
time, cash balances increased by over EUR600 million to EUR1.5 billion.
Leverage has fallen further with an increase to the equity to debt ratio to 3.7 times.
(inaudible) contributed to profit growth underscoring at the same time the prudence of
our approach to asset valuations.
In the next page you can see the evolution of the net results in earnings per share, which I
have already commented on.
Moving to slide six, we will take a look at the non-recurring items in these periods. Page six
is familiar to you I suppose because we have showed during the last quarters the impact
of the Chilean earthquake. This is actually the update of this figure. The latest estimate of
these losses EUR106 million. In this slide, as usual you can see it's break down by both
high (inaudible) and -(subsidiary) and as is logical, MAPFRE RE took the largest loss.
Moving to slide seven, here is our reconciliation of the largest non-recurring items in both
years. It is (inaudible) to start by highlighting that our core insurance business maintained a
very healthy profit growth in both unadjusted and adjusted terms, underlining the strength
of recent model in a difficult year.
As we always say, as long as our insurance machine keeps delivering, all other challenges
should be manageable.

FINAL

(inaudible) the main non-recurring items in 2010 are the Chilean earthquake and the
(inaudible) gains, which I have already talked about. Some new items were added in the
last quarter, including two large but non-recurring tax gains in Brazil. And our write-down in
the value of our shareholding in Cattolica due to the persistent fall in the share price
compared to our book values.
As you may recall, 2009 results also included some non-recurring items. On a like-for-like
basis, the adjusted result for our insurance operation shows a healthy 20% growth. Even if
we (inaudible) without realization gains, growth would still be 12.5%. In (inaudible) results
(inaudible) primarily additional losses at Banco de Servicios Financieros Caja MadridMAPFRE due to mandatory provisioning requirements.
In 2009, the other entities in cost consolidation adjustment line included two large
positive items, that were not repeated this year obviously, were the gains on the
purchases of our subordinated bond and the release of the provision for economic
environment that we -- a provisioning at the end of 2008. Adjusting for that, we have a
net loss of probably similar amount in both years. Taking into account all these items, the
adjusted profit grew 11.4%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's move to slide number eight. Here you can see that the bar we proposed last year a
final dividend payment of EUR0.08 per share to the annual general meeting of
shareholders. This figure, as well as the total dividend is the same was paid in 2009, which
is consistent with our broadly stable net result. The total amount of dividends paid out
grew 5.9% in 2010, reflecting the increase in the number of shares following the dividend
(inaudible) capital increases.
In slide number nine, you can see the key highlights of the year. We, as you know from our
former presentations, we reached an agreement of the bancassurance agreement with
CATALUNYACAIXA in March. In October we acquired InsureandGo in UK. In October we
realized the reorganization of MAPFRE's real estate activities and (stopped) the run of the
real estate of the development projects.
In October also a new management and operating structures for the Group were
approved. In December, we launched Verti, the direct sales company for Motor and Home
Insurance of MAPFRE FAMILIAR. And finally, at the end of the year we reached an
agreement for selling QUAVITAE, our operating unit in care for the elder people.
The next page, as usual our -- we show the figures and I would like to highlight our
solvency ratio that it's improving. It reached this year 285.7%, which is remarkable in these
tough conditions of the market and the economic environment.
I will now hand over the call to Mr. Lubelli, who will explain our financials in greater detail.
Then we will take your questions.

Thank you, Esteban. Good afternoon to everybody on the line and on the Internet. With
no further delay, let's move onto slide 12.

FINAL

Here we have the usual breakdown of premiums and profits by geographical area. As
already -- as was already noted by Mr. Tejera, the foreign business activities continued to
raise the contribution to the total Group figures. We have introduced a new presentation
for the contribution to profits, which we hope you will find clearer.
On slide 13 we show premiums growth by the main unit. As was already noted by Mr.
Tejera, foreign business activities and reinsurance provided most premium growth for the
fifth consecutive year. I would like to add that Brazil contributed EUR460 million to such
growth, which the US added EUR160 million.
As was previously mentioned, Spain shows a turnaround with a net positive growth of 1.4%
over the previous year, which raises to 3.2% if the figures are adjusted for the voluntary
reconciliation of loss making policies with civil servants.

Bloomberg Transcript

Acquisitions contributed about EUR360 million to total premium growth, split as follows.
CATALUNYACAIXA EUR186 million, Grupo Mundial EUR147 million. And Finibanco EUR25
million.
Let's move on to slide 14. Here we find the breakdown of premiums by channel in Spain. In
the agents channel we see a contraction that was motivated by very successful sales
campaigns in the life business in 2009 that were not repeated this year. And the
previously mentioned voluntary reconciliation of loss making health insurance policies with
civil servants in 2010. Adjusting for these, premiums actually grew 1.6%.
Conversely, the bancassurance channel turned in a very strong performance, thanks to a
strong recovery at Caja Madrid, whose premium grew EUR260 million or 30%. And the
already mentioned consolidation of the insurance operation of CATALUNYACAIXA, which
contributed EUR178 million to life sales and EUR8 million to non-life sales.
On slide 15, we find the evolution of combined ratios. As was said, the combined ratio
evolved extremely well, remaining virtually stable on an unadjusted basis and falling
1.3percentage points once the Chilean earthquake and weather related claims are
excluded. As was said before, the Chilean earthquake was the largest claim ever incurred
by MAPFRE.
What is this performance owed to? It basically reflects a significant improvement at
MAPFRE America, which benefitted from a much better loss experience in the motor
business and at MAPFRE Empresas, thanks to lower frequency and severity.
The deterioration in MAPFRE Global Risks and MAPFRE was mainly due to the impact of
the Chilean earthquake. MAPFRE INTERNACIONAL and MAPFRE FAMILIAR were affected
by weather related claims. Excluding these their combined ratios barely varied with
respect to 2009. Overall positive impacts are broadly equal to negative impacts, leaving
Page 4 of 23



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity

FINAL

the combined ratio virtually unchanged on an unadjusted basis and lower on an adjusted
basis.
On slide 16 we find the non-life account. We've already seen the reasons for premium
growth against 2009 as well as for the stability of the combined ratio. Noteworthy on this
page is the amount of realization gains, which exceeds by about EUR120 million the figure
for the previous year. In addition, the non-life account includes foreign exchange gains of
EUR46 million in 2010 against the loss of EUR4 million in 2009. This on a net basis implies
a decrease in financial income if we -- that is, if we eliminate the items I just mentioned,
which basically is due to lower average returns in Spain.
Let us move on to the next slide, where we find the life account. The page explains the
main variations, premiums growth, basically reflects larger issuance in bancassurance in
Spain and the continued growth abroad. The underwriting and financial results also
improved strongly, thanks to very strong technical results in Brazil and the good
performance of the loss experience in Spain.

Bloomberg Transcript

I already mentioned the figures for CATALUNYACAIXA and Finibanco, which provide a
positive contribution to premium growth. Basically 40% of premiums growth and 30% of
the result growth come from these entities.
On next slide we find the other business activities. This is traditionally a complex account
and I will explain it piecemeal. The operating revenues and expenses decreased due to
the fact that QUAVITAE was, as we've reached an agreement to sell it, was reclassified as
a discontinued operation. In addition to that, if we look at the operating expenses, the
figure for 2009 included on one hand the release of the provision for the economic
environment for the amount of EUR56 million and a negative balance of the appropriation
of restructuring provisions for the healthcare business of MAPFRE Familiar of EUR18.8
million.
Adjusting for these items, the net balance, that is revenues minus expenses, shows a
significant improvement in 2010, which comes primarily from MAPFRE VIDA, thanks to
better results in MAPFRE (inaudible) and to the consolidation of the pensions business of
CATALUNYACAIXA.
Net financial business in 2009 included EUR53.8 million of gains on the repurchase of
subordinated bonds and in 2010 includes the write down of EUR34.5 million for the stake
in Cattolica. So a large positive item in 2009 and a large negative item in 2010.
Adjusting for these, we have a net financial expense in both years and the figure is larger
in 2010, basically due to negative mark-to-market adjustments to MAPFRE S.A.'s interest
rate and equity swaps.
Results from minority interests correspond to our share in the results of Banco de
Servicios Financieros Caja Madrid-MAPFRE. The increase in losses versus 2009 reflects
mainly the most stringent non-performing loans reserving regulations that have come into
force in the Third Quarter of 2010.

Other net revenues include the property stock depreciation provisions at MAPFRE
INMUEBLES, which were EUR11.7 million this year and EUR25.7 million the previous one.

FINAL

Let's move on to slide 19. There are two subsidiaries that stand out clearly in their
contribution to profit growth and that is MAPFRE AMERICA. Due to large business volumes
much improved technical results and the series of non-recurring items totaling EUR75
million and MAPFRE EMPRESAS reflecting primarily a much better combined ratios.
In other two subsidiaries we called it losses. MAPFRE INTERNACIONAL, due primarily to
the write-down on not losses, reduction in net results. MAPFRE INTERNACIONAL, due
primarily to the write-down of the shareholding in Cattolica and MAPFRE FAMILIAR due to
a higher combined ratio and the series of expenses, including the cost of the launch of
Internet subsidiary Verti.
On slide 20 we find the bottom line. The -- as was said before, the underlying results
grossed 11.4%, excluding the effect of Chile's earthquake, extraordinary results and
realization gains.
The pre-tax result includes a negative impact of EUR15.1 million from the restatement of
financial accounts in Venezuela, which was EUR18.5 million in 2009.

Bloomberg Transcript

We see that taxes decreased and that is due to the utilization of tax loss carry forwards at
MAPFRE AMERICA and MAPFRE INTERNACIONAL.
Minorities, as was the trend throughout the year, have increased due to the larger
contribution of bancassurance JVs and to the international operations in which we have
minority interests.
On slide 22, we find the balance sheet. There are several variations here. Things really do
not change compared to previous quarters, at least they don't change much. We have on
one hand the positive impact of the appreciation of the currencies of the countries in
which we operate. Then we have a negative impact from the mark-to-market of the
investments, due to the higher risk premiums for the peripheral countries, including Spain.
And that's rather the end of the year.
In addition to that, we have the consolidation of the insurance operation of especially
CATALUNYACAIXA, which is a large one and then to a lesser extent Finibanco and Grupo
Mundial.
On slide 22, we find the first of three slides of the breakdown of our investment portfolio.
Compared to the previous year, the breakdown by asset class has not changed materially.
The most notable change being a lower weight of government paper, which fell by about
4percentage points.
On the next slide, number 23, we do not find other substantial changes either, except for
the larger weight of financial institutions and the Spanish government, which are mainly
Page 6 of 23



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2011-02-02

explained by the consolidation of CATALUNYACAIXA and the new business written by the
life unit. We also show you our exposure to those asset classes that have received a fair
bit of scrutiny lately.

FINAL

We feel it is important to highlight that circa 50% of our exposure to Spanish paper is
much matching our life reserves and hence our capital is partially buffered by shadow
accounting, as we will see in a few slides.
Slide 24, there's the main breakdown. So the fixed income portfolio, the main change is
the full end weight of AAA rated paper, matched by roughly equal increase in AA rated
paper, which is due to the downgrade of the Spanish government.
On slide 25, we find the variations in equity. The net increase is EUR702 million and that
includes the result for the year. The negative impact of the volatility in financial markets, in
here you see what I was mentioned two slides ago. The effect of shadow accounting,
which compensates in part, to a large extent I would say, about 60% of the negative
impact of the mark-to-market.

Bloomberg Transcript

Positive translation differences, as I said before, the American at large currencies
appreciated in 2010. Then we have other items, which basically includes the incorporation
of the minority interest in the insurance operations of CATALUNYACAIXA and the funds
obtained through this Group dividend.
Finally on slide 26, we have capital structure in coverages. We continue to have an
extremely strong interest coverage ratio, which has improved materially compared to
2009, where it was already very high. Leverage also fell in the year. The main change in
the capital structure is the slightly larger weight of equity. But by and large the
composition doesn't change much.
And that would be all on my side. And I'll hand the conversation back to Mr. Esteban
Tejera.

Q - James Quin

{BIO 3878205 <GO>}

Three numbers questions please. The first one is. And I know this is something that's
come up on previous calls. But I'm going to ask you anyway, is just could you give us a

Page 7 of 23

FINAL

sense of what the prior releases contribution is to the 2010 combined ratio? And if you
could give us the number for 2009. I know there's been some debate about the
reinsurance combined ratio, for example. So if you could help us understand some of the
moving parts in there, that would be helpful.
The second question, just looking at Latin America in Q4, seems to have had a very
strong combined ratio, about 98 that came on the back of a not particularly good
combined ratio in Q3. So I'm just wondering if you could perhaps help us with the ups and
downs there.
And the third question is just then on the phasing of investment income. If I take the nonlife business and I back out the financial income -- I'm sorry, the realized gains from the
financial income, I end up with quite a volatile number. And I'm just wondering what is
driving that? Are there sort of unrealized elements going through that that we should be
aware of ? Or is there something else? Thank you.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Good afternoon, James. Let's see. Prior year release. As you know, we have traditionally
not given that figure. What we do give is the triangles and they will come out in the annual
report that will be filed tomorrow. Unfortunately it's in Spanish. But as far as triangles go,
it's pretty self explanatory. So it should work for you. There's -- I'm afraid there's not much
more I can tell you and I know the question comes up in all conference calls.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - James Quin

{BIO 3878205 <GO>}

I mean just on that point, I guess preempting what will be there tomorrow, I mean will we
see a change year-on-year in the amount of reserve releases?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Once again, we are not giving the reserve releases. What we do give is the triangles.
What you will see in the triangles is that we have positive run-off for another year. So we
have a -- I was actually looking at those triangles myself and it's basically a continued trend
of positive reserve developments.

Q - James Quin

{BIO 3878205 <GO>}

Okay. And there's nothing in those triangles that is misleading or distorting in any way. So
we should take that as a fair representation of what's going on.

A - Jesus Amadori
James, just -- this is Jesus here. Remember that the triangles that we do publish our
direct insurance triangles and this year they will be significantly biased by the Chilean
earthquake. That as you know was taken -- was done in fronting by American global risks
and then we proceeded. Right? The information, or obviously as you know, we have said
in the past from the Chilean earthquake is only given on a net basis. If we were to strip
this out the run-offs from previous year would be lined with '08, '07. And '06. As you know

Page 8 of 23



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2011-02-02

also, '09 was a bit biased by the disintegration of global risks at EMPRESAS. We have this
cost out in the past. Right?

Q - James Quin

{BIO 3878205 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay, I might have to give you a call after tomorrow then. Okay. Thank you.

A - Jesus Amadori
You're going to have to take our word on this because (multiple speakers) said in the past
publishing the run-offs on the triangles for every quarter and on a net basis gives away
pretty sensitive information. We have debated that and we have decided to keep our
reporting policy on that matter as it currently is.

Q - James Quin

{BIO 3878205 <GO>}

Providing we can have a conversation with you about the triangles, then that's no problem.
So.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

So the ups and downs in America. Indeed there was an increase. The fact is if you look at
it on a quarter-by-quarter basis, there have been some swings, which we have explained
in the previous quarter. Really there was rather a very low expense ratio in the Second
Quarter. The other expense ratios are more or less comparable. What you saw was a
spike in the claims ratio in the second and Third Quarter, which you, as you know in that
area are characterized by a higher incidence of weather-related claims. That's actually
what happened. So it was roughly around 70%, the loss ratio in the second and the Third
Quarter.
Then in the last quarter, which is what possibly has struck your attention, the loss ratio fell
considerably and that's because there were no such weather-related claims in the -- at
least not in a comparable amount in the last quarter. And that was compounded by very
strong underwriting performance in some countries.
It's explained today in the presentation. But the loss ratio went very well in Columbia, it
went very well in Venezuela. In Mexico there were several countries in which the loss
experience was especially favorable in the last quarter. And by comparison that has
caused a decrease. I wonder if this answers your question?

Q - James Quin

{BIO 3878205 <GO>}

Yes, I mean I guess I'm just trying to work out if there's any change in the overall
expectation of a combined ratio of somewhere around about 101% level. But --

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Well we've always said that this is actually a common question and it's worth to answer it
again. Never forget that you are talking about emerging markets. You on one hand do not
have the same stability in currencies as you would have elsewhere. And you have higher
Page 9 of 23



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2011-02-02

FINAL

financial returns in these regions than you have in more advanced markets. That does
create some structural differences compared to Spain.
Then another structural element, if you look at the -- at how the combined ratio of Latin
America is composed you will see that traditionally the loss ratio is lower than it is in Spain.
They have normally 3, 4percentage points left. But their expense ratio is twice as large.
And there's a strong element, one of scale because even the larger operations that we
have in Latin America are not as large as we are relative to the Spanish market. So there's
a scale element in there.
Then distribution is not as advanced as I would -- and by that is not as competitive as it is
over here in Europe. So distributors charge higher tariffs for selling premiums on one
hand. And secondly, we have been traditionally comparatively much more reliant on
brokers in Latin America than we have been in Spain.
We've been changing that. We've enlarged our own distribution network and then another
initiative we have taken this year, which is actually detailed in the presentation, is that we
are pressing the pedal on distribution agreements with non-insurance, non-banking
distributors. That is, supermarkets, department stores, car dealerships, other distributors
of this kind. Does that answer your question, James?

Q - James Quin

{BIO 3878205 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, I think more or less, yes. Thank you.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Then the -- probably on your third question, the volatility in the non-life account if you strip
out the realization gains. As I was mentioning when I explained the figures, don't forget
that ForEx is a big component in our accounts. So last year we had a negative EUR4 million
and this year we have a positive EUR46 million. So that does create volatility in the result.

Q - James Quin

{BIO 3878205 <GO>}

And is that why Q4 investment incomes were a lot lower than in Q3?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Oh, that I -- is it?

A - Jesus Amadori
Yes. If you look at the quarterly effects gains go down significantly. If you were to strip out
the non-life and other activities financial income from FX unrealizations gains actually the
yield is quite stable.

Q - James Quin

{BIO 3878205 <GO>}

Okay. And what is the yield, just roughly speaking?

Good afternoon, gentlemen. Couple of follow-up questions please to disclosure you
provided on your asset mix. First of all, in terms of the financial debt. And particularly to
the Spanish institutions, can you give me a breakdown, please, between how that splits by
classification of debt? Because I think on subsequent slides you do talk about cover
bonds. And I just want to make sure that the figures that you're presenting on that first
slide, just be clear exactly that you're talking about there.

Then secondly, if you can maybe give some color about again maybe any financial
exposure in your equity portfolio as well, please. Thank you.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Hi, Marcus. Good afternoon. I'm afraid I have a problem with both of them. That this is the
disclosure we have given. I -- and that -- and we don't give more disclosure in the annual
accounts that will be published tomorrow either. So I'm afraid I don't have the information
to answer your question. Public information, that's what I mean.

Q - Marcus Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Fair enough. Would the covered bonds that you disclose on slide 12, would they be
wrapped up in the financial institutions data that you include on slide 23?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Absolutely, cover bonds are only issued by financial institutions.

FINAL

Yes, good evening. Just can you give us another look on Spanish P&C and in particular
property (inaudible) lines for this year? What are you seeing now in the first few weeks of
the year? Then again, on slide 22, I was wondering what the component of the Spanish
(cars) would be within the 42.6% of corporate fixed income, if you have the number?
Thank you.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Hi, Federico. Now not much of the year is run yet as to speak about trends. We have an
impression of some, just some firming up in (motor) on the tariff. Let's say not massive
increases that say perhaps a bit more discipline by writers in the motor business.
And the -- in the other lines, we're not seeing any especially clear trends. There had been
some pickup in competition in household insurance. But it has somehow retrenched
towards the end of the year. And nothing much to report on health.
Corporate remains very tough and actually the trading environment is a difficult one. The
performance of our subsidiary in commercial insurance is actually pure muscle. That's
been the commercial efforts by the Company, the good work done in terms of
distribution because the trading environment remains a very competitive one.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second question was on how much of the corporate fixed income in (inaudible) I'm
afraid is the -- the answer is the same one I gave to Marcus just a while ago. That's, I'm

I have a few questions. First one, just a clarification on the non-life running investment
income. I think am I right that some distortion in Q4 comes from the fact that you move
out the property assets, which are sitting in FAMILIAR and you move them into the
INMUEBLES? So part of the reason why the financial income ex-ForEx, ex-realized gains is
actually falling relative to Q3 has to do with the fact that the rent income has been moved
out of the P&C segment? Is that correct?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Hi, Giulia, sorry. I was expecting a further question. I don't think so because there was
actually the asset transfer was carried out really at the end of the year so it -- the impact is
not material.

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

In that case though then it's very difficult to square what you were saying before about
running (inaudible) in the sense that the ForEx, they are 46 at the full year but they were
about EUR33 million at the nine month. So there as an extra EUR10 million positive coming
in Q4 and there were some positive gains as well coming in Q4 and in spite of that the
financial income has dropped quite a lot. So but perhaps it's easier if I take this question
off line because it's quite a lot of numbers.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think there's some number crunching, yes, in this question. Yes.

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

All right. My second question is on slide 22. You're getting quite a lot of questions. Just
one clarification. You showed that 18.6% of your assets are valued with something, which
is not provided through profit and losses or to maturities, not AFS treatment. I assume it
can only be cost basis and if you can clarify if it's mainly the property portfolio and some
loans or if there is something else.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Yes. The -- you're absolutely right. But this actually -- mostly that you find they are treasury,
that's why. The other one, you're absolutely right. The categories in (inaudible) are what
they are. Fundamentally of the cash and world --

A - Esteban Tejera

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Yes, property.

Property and cash.

Properties, yes. And can you confirm on CATALUNYACAIXA, is it now at the market value
or you took an impairment but it's not fully aligned yet with the market value?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

FINAL

We took an adjustment comparing the average price of the stock over a certain period
with that carrying value and that's what we provision in agreement with the auditors.

Q - Giulia Raffo

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

No.

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

And when you showed the unrealized gains in that slide that only refers to property,
doesn't reflect the unrealized loss position left in the stake. Is that correct? If I look at slide
76.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Slide 76 is equity debt and leverage.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Yes. But you show an unrealized gains (line), right? Which in the past has always been
property.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

And that's what it is.

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Does it include Cattolica as well? Because presumably you had an unrealized loss there.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

No, Giulia, this is always only real estate. Bear in mind that whatever valuation differences
we have in Cattolica, that's in equity. It's fair value through equity. So it's recognized in the
equity, the only thing that changes is that it goes through a P&L when you do the
impairment. But it's recognized in equity.

Q - Giulia Raffo

Yes. All our investments except for property and the few held to maturity, they are markto-market, mostly through equity and a few through P&L. So --

Q - Giulia Raffo

I didn't know if you were using an equity accounting because it's a (multiple speakers).

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

No. It's not a strategic, it's classified as a financial investment. It would be an equity.

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. Again on the asset side, you disclosed how much of your
debt is hybrid on page 24, which is 5%, which is roughly between EUR1.3 billion and EUR1.4
billion. Can you disclose how much of that, if any, is Spanish savings banks?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Giulia, I'm sorry but as many times as I'm asked this question, I will always give the same
answer. I'm afraid that's the disclosure we have given. So I cannot give you the amount.
Bear in mind that we are not just invested in Spanish banks and (inaudible), we also own
bonds issued by non-Spanish banks.

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Yes, fair enough. And a final question, which is more strategic. I mean clearly there has
been quite a lot of changes in the Spanish banking system. And I was wondering whether
for your final dividend, are you in a position now to say that 100% certainty the EUR0.08 of
will be paid in cash? Or do you foresee a scenario where the current consolidation to
Spanish banking system could open up opportunities for you that might -- reinvestment
choice, right, like we did 12 months ago?

A - Esteban Tejera

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Hi, Giulia. As you know, the changes in the Spanish saving banks map is starting. We don't
know how it will finish and when it will finish. So I don't foresee at this moment what will be
in the agreement of the general assembly of the shareholders propose. But the more of
the directors after will be whole the day before. I am talking about the five of the -- the
5th of March.
At this moment. And as you know our policy is to pay in cash and only use the
reinvestment policy if it's necessary. And honestly I think that it's very, very early to know
Page 15 of 23

Date: 2011-02-02

FINAL

this at this moment. I suppose that the final situation of the different savings bonds will be
more clear at the end of the first half of the year, more or less. But this is very early to say
something that this -- that must be approved by the Board. In any case, I think that it's
early and in any case you know, because I have repeated several times, our policies to
pay in cash. Only if maybe we would reinvest.

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

But just one quick follow-up on that. Considering how much your leverage has come down
and how much your solvency improved over the last three years, how much would -- and
in investment -- how big would a new investment need to be for you to consider not to
pay the dividend in cash? I mean I'm trying to assess what is your internal firepower if you
are comfortable on before you start considering paying the dividend in shares.

A - Esteban Tejera

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Well if it was not which kind of opportunity you'll face at the moment and it's a question of
the amount of cash needed for this kind of opportunity. At the moment, we haven't any
opportunity and our policy is to pay in cash. It's not a question of the reaching an amount
of the -- of money and then start reinvesting in -- investing again in a new target. The
process is just the opposite. If we have an opportunity we analyze from a strategic and
business model approach and then we look for the money and the money comes from
different sources. It's not a question of reaching an amount of cash and investing. It's just
the opposite feeling.

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

This is clear, I'm just trying to have a feel on what you consider as your internal firepower.
(Multiple speakers)

A - Esteban Tejera

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

I think that I have displayed our policy, Giulia. And I know because we have talked several
times about this that your approach is likely different from ours. And it's very difficult to
convince you about this matter. But our policy is paying in cash and only if an opportunity is
at the moment present we will change this policy.

Hello. I have a couple of questions. First one is a follow-up on this strategy, if I may. I read
your Chairman in the press conference this morning said MAPFRE would eventually

become shareholder of Caja Madrid and potentially of any other Caja. If you could please
elaborate on this strategy conditions for MAPFRE going forward.
And second question is about the known insurance businesses. First one is the real estate
MAPFRE INMUEBLES. If you could please explain a bit the reorganization. I know that you
already sent a statement with details. But if you could please update with the final figures
what you have done with the stocks that have fallen sharply. What else we have on the
asset side. How comfortable you feel with the value of these assets, why type of
impairments, how you reduced the debt on the equity. So there are enough data MAPFRE
INMUEBLES, please.
And also on the bank, if you think that the provisions you have already taken into
(inaudible) you feel comfortable with the type of coverage that you have for the
(inaudible) and expect the losses you think they are already fully covered or not. And what
type of outlook we have for 2011 in the banking unit.

A - Esteban Tejera

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I will answer your first question and part of the second and the third. And Luigi and Jesus
will complement the fillers.
This morning when our Chairman talked about investment in Caja as shareholders was in
an ironic way saying that if the saving banks become banks and they are listed it's clear
that at the end we will have in our portfolio some investments in these banks like we have
investments in other banks in Spain and abroad. And industrial list of companies and so on
because we invest more than EUR30 billion and obviously we have our very diversified
portfolio.
It was a way of telling the journalists that we are not interested now in one special
participation in a new bank or new joint venture in the saving banks' new situation in Spain.
It was an elliptic way of doing that. But it was just this was he was talking about, not about
taking a participation in a bank.
From the point of view of the other questions, your question about the real estate. Well as
you know we have to -- we started the run off of the real estate activities. And we have
put together the assets of MAPFRE INMUEBLES and the real estate assets of our
insurance companies. This implies some changes in the classification of figures and the
figures that appear before us (inaudible) now appear like the real estate investment. So it
explains the change in the figures.
In any case, I think that Luigi and Jesus can complement these figures. And in any case in
the next presentation we will change the release of figures according to the new situation
that will be the situation of our investment portfolio in real estate more than our Company
that is working real estate.
And in the case of the bank, even if the solvency ratio is bigger, even if the figures are
improving, the situation of this kind of the business continues going bad and we are

working with our partners to improve the situation. A position probably now related to
(inaudible) the situation of the former quarters. But we will continue working this way.
I don't know if --

Have we answered your question or do you need more details?

Q - Francisco Riquel

{BIO 3050316 <GO>}

Yes. If you could please give more details from the MAPFRE INMUEBLES. I see the stock
has fallen from EUR650 million to EUR250 million.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Yes. That's because the land that was on the books of MAPFRE INMUEBLES has been
reclassified as an investment.

Q - Francisco Riquel

{BIO 3050316 <GO>}

Have you taken any impairment on that land?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Well we given the other activities account that's written in the presentation. There was an
additional charge of EUR11.7 million this year in terms of write-downs. What has happened
-- you will see it in the accounts when the -- once the accounts become public, which will
be tomorrow. There's two movements. One is that the existing stock of write-downs has
been transferred from stock to investments. It's just an accounting reclassification. Then in
addition to that there are further write-downs, which are all EUR11.7 million, which have
been taken on the stock this year.

Q - Francisco Riquel

{BIO 3050316 <GO>}

And could you also detail what type of financial income have you removed from the
insurance companies and will be now accounted in this new company as well?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

That I'm afraid I cannot give you because that's another figure that we have disclosed. We
actually have some figures for the -- and you will find them in the annual report for the
revenues from real estate investments. But we have not given that disclosure.

It's not affecting the accounts for the year 2010. Well you will not see the consolidated
accounts of MAPFRE affected by this because on the consolidated accounts you have no
impact. What you will see is an impact on per company. A slight impact per company,
which of course ends up in MAPFRE INMUEBLES. At the consolidated level the transaction
is transparent.

Q - Francisco Riquel

{BIO 3050316 <GO>}

Sorry, the last question on the bank? Caja Madrid said that it already covered the
expected losses in the loan portfolio. Does it also apply to this unit and therefore we
should expect lower cost of risk next year?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

It should because Caja Madrid, if I'm not wrong, has said that they've provisioned 80% of
the loans and this bank stands at 77.4. So it's not -- it's basically in line with what is the
provisioning level for the Caja as a whole.

(Matze Wasil), Morgan Stanley.

Q - Matze Wasil
Matze from Morgan Stanley here. I've got two questions. I'm just wondering first of all I
realize it might be too early to comment. But I'm just wondering whether you can take us
through the possibilities and the probabilities coming out of the Caja Madrid
developments. And in particular the Banco de Financiero, the equity raise they need. Are
there any operational impacts that you see that sort of could occur at this stage that we
should be aware of ? Or alternatively are there any sort of changes to the relationship with
Caja Madrid that could be possible out of this arrangement? Or perhaps even some
opportunities if it broadens your distribution channels somewhat, it would be interesting
to know that.
Second thing is your reinsurance business recorded very strong premium growth, 15.5%. I
recognize that a lot of that would be internal reinsurance, not that your own strong
premium growth would seed a lot of that growth. But nevertheless, it comes against a
backdrop of very soft pricing and steep competition in the reinsurance industry as a
whole. I was just wondering how do you reconcile the strong growth in that for a RE
against what is essentially a pretty weak growth in the rest of the reinsurance sector?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

I think the first part of the question will be taken by Esteban.

FINAL

I don't think that the current situation at the Caja Madrid will take any problem with our
current situation of commercialization agreements. In fact this year 2010 the situation has
been very, very good.
In the near future obviously one clarification should arise from the point of view of who
partners will be in the future partners. We are very proud about being the main partners
for Caja Madrid and we will continue.
From the point of view of the property of the bank, we are insurers and we haven't any
vocation about in the common bankers. Save that, in the near future the map will change a
lot in Spain. And we don't foresee to take (inaudible) in any bank from the point of view of
the partners and main shareholders. As I said before, in the same way that Mr. Martinez
said this morning. So we are not planning any kind of operation of this kind.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, Matze, the -- as a matter of fact -- well, there's a simple answer although it sounds
jokingly. Possibly we've grown so much in reinsurance because we're good. The -- if it was
not the MAPFRE originated business in the back pages of the presentation you will find
the split by seeding company and it's basically spot on the same as it was last year. So the
growth has been roughly the same on both the MAPFRE originated business and the third
party originated business.
And the reason for that as what we put in the presentation is just we've won new
business. Usually here the business comes more from taking more business from existing
customers, even though we also win new customers in the year. And there's also sessions
from the Group's Companies. But as I say, the growth is more or less the same in both
third party and Group business.
There's been some growth in life assurance and personal lines this year to note
compared to the previous year. So it's basically sheer growth from new business.

Q - Matze Wasil

I have two questions. The first one is that if you can give us an idea of the marketing effort
that MAPFRE's going to make with Verti. And in line with that, if you can give us an idea of
the sort of negative contributions of that Company will have for the Group in 2011.

FINAL

Then the second question is regarding Brazil. You mentioned that MAPFRE has recorded a
capital gain in the Fourth Quarter. If you can elaborate a bit on what is the capital gain
coming from. Then if you can give us an update on the JV with Banco Brasil. Thank you.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

I don't quite understand what you mean marketing effort. But I might give it a shot. I think
what you're referring to is what expenses we're going to incur this year with Verti. We
have not given that figure nor a budget. But logically this is a startup. So at the beginning a
start up has an expense. This is a Company that needs comparatively more advertising
the way traditional company will need. So that will have a bearing on the account in the
year. But I cannot give you the budgeted figure and then we'll have to see how in practice
this evolves.

Bloomberg Transcript

What we can say and was said today by the general manager of the unit heading this -the chairman of the unit owning Verti is that the initial three weeks of operations of this
Company are going extremely well. Company's selling about 200 new policies a day and
it's actually surprising on the positive side in terms of performance. But as I say the
expenses I cannot give you. But of course there will be such expenses because it's a
startup.
Does that answer your question?

Q - Luis Pena

{BIO 15131020 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

We actually have no capital gain in Brazil. In Brazil what we recognized was two elements
essentially, a tax credit, tax loss carried forward basically and then there's been a chain of
sentences regarding a certain tax that was levied on financial income in Brazil, which was
taken to the courts by the financial industry and the financial industry has eventually won.
So what we have recognized is the fact that these financial gains are subject to a lower
tax than they were before. But we have no realization gains, no capital gains in Brazil.

Q - Luis Pena

{BIO 15131020 <GO>}

And can you give us an update on how the JV with Banco de Brasil is evolving?

A - Esteban Tejera

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

The Banco de Brasil is -- we have now the first authorization of the authorities. And we
expect to have the second one that will be the last one within this quarter according to
the conversation we have had recently with the authorities in Brazil.

Michael Broom, Berenberg Bank.

Q - Michael Broom

{BIO 1868182 <GO>}

Mike Broom from Berenberg here. I just had I think a straightforward question. Maybe you
could help with what I'm missing. I'm looking at page -- slides 23 and 24. If you look at
slide 23 on the right hand side you've got 53% and 47% of those portfolios you're saying
are matched with life assurance reserves. So if you add the government and the financial
institutions together you've probably got about, what, let's say roughly 50% matched with
life assurance reserves.
If you now go on to slide 24 in the bottom right hand corner, now I may not be comparing
apples with apples. But bottom right hand corner of slide 24 you're saying that 37% of the
entire fixed income book is matched portfolio. Now if that -- I don't understand how the
37% number can be calculated in the same way as the 53% and 47% from the previous
slide. So I'm just hoping you can help me reconcile how those numbers, the 53% and 47%
on slide 23, how they reconcile with the 37% on page 24.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Hi, Michael. Thanks for asking that question so it helps clarify those for the other listeners.
