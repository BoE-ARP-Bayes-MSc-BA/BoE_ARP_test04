Good morning and welcome to Fairfax's 2015 Second Quarter Results Conference Call.
Your lines have been place in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a
question-and-answer session. For time's sake, we ask that you limit your questions to one.
Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at
this time.
Your host for today's call is Prem Watsa, with opening remarks from Eric Salsberg.
Mr. Salsberg, please begin.

Eric P. Salsberg

{BIO 1552007 <GO>}

Good morning, and welcome to our call to discuss Fairfax's 2015 second quarter results.
This call may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ, perhaps
materially, from those contained in such forward-looking statements as a result of a
variety of uncertainties and risk factors, the most foreseeable of which are set out under
Risk Factors in our Base Shelf Prospectus, which has been filed with Canadian securities
regulators and is available on SEDAR.
I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Prem Watsa.

Dave Bonham, our CFO, for additional financial details.
In the first half of 2015, book value per share increased by 0.6% adjusted for the $10 per
share common dividend paid in the first quarter of 2015. Our insurance companies had an
excellent first half with a combined ratio of 91.6%, with excellent reserving and significant
underwriting profits of $263 million. In the second quarter, all our operating segments had
combined ratio below 100% with an overall combined ratio of 91.9%. OdysseyRe again
had an excellent combined ratio of 88.1% and Zenith had a combined ratio of 88.4%.
As shown on page 37 of our quarterly report, we realized gains on our investment
portfolio of $612 million before the equity hedges. Excluding all hedging losses and before
mark-to-market fluctuations in our investment portfolio, we earned $900 million in pre-tax
income in the second quarter. Including all hedging losses and mark-to-market fluctuations
in our investment portfolio, we reported an after-tax loss of $186 million in the second
quarter of 2015.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our insurance and reinsurance business premium volume was up in the second quarter by
7.4%. It was down 1.9% if you exclude the Brit acquisition, which is therefore approximately
a month. While the combined ratio, as I mentioned to you for insurance and reinsurance,
was about 91.9%.
Now, by subsidiary, the change in net premiums written in the second quarter of 2015 and
the combined ratios were as follows: OdysseyRe had an 18% drop in premium, and an
88.1% combined ratio. OdysseyRe's drop in net premium was because it had, in June, a
non-renewed significant property quota share reinsurance contract that resulted in the
return of the unearned premium to the cedents, and this resulted in $101 million decrease
to gross and net written premium. More from Dave Bonham.
Crum & Forster had a 19% increase in net written premium with a 97% combined.
Northbridge, a 7% increase with a 94.5% combined. Zenith with a 9% increase, 88.4%
combined. And Fairfax Asia was up 16% with an 89.6%. If you exclude the acquisitions that
Fairfax Asia had, our premiums were down about 9%. So overall, our underwriting
performance was excellent.
As we have said before, very low interest rates and reduced reserve redundancies means
there's no place to hide for this industry. Combined ratios have to drop well below 100%
for the industry to make a single-digit return on equity with these low interest rates. On
the short term, as always, you have to predict fundamentals will eventually play out.
Going on to page 2 in our press release, net investment losses are $661 million in the
second quarter consisted of the following. As I said, please refer to page 2 of the press
release.
Net gains on equity and equity-related investments were $87 million resulting from net
gains of $96 million and a $9 million net loss on our equity hedge. We have realized gains
of $586 million on our equity and equity-related holdings in the second quarter. Also, we

Page 2 of 15

FINAL

had bond losses of $657 million primarily on our treasury and municipal bond portfolios
because of the impact of rising interest rates.
Over the last 5.5 years, since 2010, this unrealized loss in our bonds is the second largest
quarterly loss we've had. Cumulatively though, over that same period, that 5.5 years
beginning in 2010, we have realized $1.8 billion in gains and $38 million in unrealized gains
on our bond portfolio. So we expect this unrealized bond loss in the current quarter to
reverse over time as it has in the past.
As we have mentioned in our annual meetings, annual reports, quarterly reports, with IFRS
accounting, where stocks and bonds are recorded at market and subject to mark-tomarket gains and losses, quarterly and annual income will fluctuate widely and investment
results will only make sense over the long term.
Our CPI-linked derivatives with a notional value of approximately $108 billion produced an
unrealized loss of $52 million in the second quarter. The majority of these contracts are
based on the underlying U.S. CPI Index and the European Union CPI Index. Further
information is available on page 3 of our press release where we have included a table on
our deflation swaps. On average, we have seven years to run. These contracts are very
volatile. As I've said to you before, our CDS experience comes to mind.

Bloomberg Transcript

When you review our statements, please remember that we own – that when we own
more than 20% of a company, we equity account and when we own about 30%, we
consolidate, so that mark-to-market gains in these companies are not reflected in our
results.
As you can see on page 12 of our quarterly report, the fair values of our investment in
associates is $1.8 billion, which has a carrying value of $1.5 billion, an unrealized gain of
$300 million not on our balance sheet. Investment gains have been an important
component of our returns over time. Since we began, we've had over $11 billion in realized
and unrealized gains.
On June 5, 2015, we closed the purchase of Brit PLC for approximately $1.7 billion,
acquiring 97% of the shares. On June 29, we completed the sale of just under 30% of Brit
to OMERS and by July 8, repurchased the remaining 3%. I would like to welcome Mark
Cloutier, Matthew Wilson, and all the Brit employees to the Fairfax family.
In April, Crum & Foster acquired 100% interest in The Redwoods Group for $20 million.
Redwoods is a full-service, national managing general underwriter, and produces
approximately $50 million of gross premiums written annually from property casualty
packaged insurance business focused on YMCAs, community centers and day camps.
Again, I would like to welcome the Redwoods Group to the Fairfax family.
In June, Kennedy-Wilson announced the completion of the sale of 50 multi-family
buildings located in Japan. Through our investment in the Kennedy-Wilson partnership we
should receive the cash distribution of $125 million and recognize a gain of $78 million.

In June, we completed the sale of our 73.6% ownership in Ridley for CAD 40.75 per share.
We received cash proceeds of $313.2 million and recognized the pre-tax gain of
approximately $236 million. Ridley was initially acquired at an average cost of CAD $8.44
and has paid Fairfax a dividend – cumulative dividend of $5.50.
Subsequent to June 30, 2015, Fairfax India agreed to acquire approximately 74% of
National Collateral Management Services Limited, NCML, in short, for a purchase price of
approximately $126 million which is ₹8.1 million. This transaction is expected to close in the
third quarter of 2015. NCML is a leading private-sector agricultural commodities storage
company in India.
Also in July, Fairfax India announced an open offer to acquire up to 26% of the outstanding
equity shares of IIFL formerly India Infoline Limited, for a price of approximately ₹195 per
share for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $250 million. This transaction is
subject to receipt of regulatory approvals in India expected to close later in 2015. IIFL is a
diversified financial services holding company in India which we have known for many
years.

Bloomberg Transcript

We continue to be very concerned about the prospects of the financial markets and the
economies of North America and Western Europe accentuated as we have said many
times before by potential weakness in China and the emerging markets. As we have said
for some time, in a number of meeting, we believe there continues to be a big
disconnect between the financial markets and the underlying economic fundamentals.
As of June 30, 2015, we have $6.8 billion in cash in short-term investments in our
portfolio, which is about 25% of our total investment portfolios to take advantage of
opportunities that come our way. As a result, in the short term, our investment income will
be reduced.
Now, I would like to turn it over to Dave Bonham, our CFO, so he can give you some more
information on the underlying financials. Dave?

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Thank you, Prem. First, I'll focus on Fairfax's consolidated results for the second quarter of
2015, then we'll move on to the operating company results, then we'll finish with the
consolidated financial position.
For the second quarter of 2015, Fairfax reported a net loss of $186 million or $8.87 per
share on a fully-diluted basis, and that compares to the second quarter last year when we
reported net earnings of $364 million or $16 per fully-diluted share.
Year-to-date, Fairfax has net earnings of just under $40 million or $0.71 per fully-diluted
share and that was a decrease from 2014 when we reported year-to-date net earnings of
$1.1 billion or $52 per share on a fully-diluted basis.

FINAL

Underwriting profit at our insurance and reinsurance operations in the second quarter and
first six months of 2015 increased to $136 million and $263 million with combined ratios of
about 92% in both periods. And that compared to underwriting profits of $110 million and
$209 million last year when the combined ratio was about 93% in those respective
periods. Quarter-to-date and year-to-date, underwriting profit is up by $26 million and $54
million, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.
Our combined ratios benefited from somewhat higher net favorable reserve
development in the second quarter and first six months of 2015 of $84 million and $152
million, and that translated to about 5 combined ratio points in each of those periods.
That compared to net favorable reserve development of $76 million and $131 million in the
second quarter and first six months of 2014 also representing about 5 combined ratio
points in those periods.
Current period catastrophe losses were lower in 2015 and totaled $36 million or 2.1
combined ratio points in the second quarter, and $64 million or 2 combined ratio points in
the first six months. By way of comparison, cat losses in the second quarter and first six
months of 2014 were $56 million and $86 million, respectively, and representing 3.7 and 3
combined ratio points in those periods.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net premiums written by our insurance and reinsurance operations increased by 7.4% in
the second quarter 2015, and by about 6% in the first six months. And that reflects the
consolidation of Brit's in net premiums written of about $151 million, and that was partially
offset by the impact of a significant transaction at OdysseyRe that I will describe in a bit
more detail in a moment.
So, turning to our operating company results and starting with OdysseyRe, in the second
quarter and first six months of 2015, Odyssey reported underwriting profit of $71 million
and $129 million at combined ratios of 88.1% and 88.6%. And that compared to
underwriting profits of $70 million and $146 million last year at combined ratios of 88.6%
and 87.3%.
Catastrophe losses in the second quarter and first six months of 2015 totaled $33 million
and $56 million, which translated into about 5.5 and 4.9 combined ratio points at
OdysseyRe. That compares to catastrophe losses of $49 million and $71 million which
translated into 7.8 and 6.2 combined ratio points in the second quarter and first six months
of 2014, respectively.
OdysseyRe's combined ratios in the second quarter and first six months, included the
benefit of $29 million and $40 million of net favorable prior reserve development. That's
about 4.8% and 3.5% combined ratio points. And that development was principally related
to casualty and property catastrophe to loss reserves.
Odyssey wrote $554 million and a little over $1.1 billion of net premiums in the second
quarter and first six months of 2015, respectively. And that reflects decreases of about
18% and 8% in the second quarter and first six months after making adjustments when we

FINAL

look back to the first six months of 2014. And those adjustments are to the manner in
which Odyssey recognized premiums written in respect of its U.S. crop insurance business.
So looking at those decreases, 18% and 8%. They principally reflect the return of $101
million of premium to a cedent in respect of a significant quota share reinsurance contract
that did not renew in the second quarter of 2015. All these adjustments that I just referred
to are set out and discussed in more detail on page 43 of our second quarter interim
report.
Moving on to Crum & Forster. Crum & Forster's underwriting profits increased in the
second quarter and first six months of 2015 to $10 million and $15 million with combined
ratios of 97.2% million and 97.9%, respectively and that compared to underwriting profits
of $4 million and $5 million at combined ratio points of about – or at combined ratios of
about 99% in the second quarter and first six months of 2014. There is no net favorable or
adverse prior year reserve development in either 2015 or 2014.
Current period catastrophe losses at Crum & Forster were modest at $2 million and $7
million in the second quarter and first six months of 2015, and they were lower than the
catastrophe losses that we experienced last year of $5 million and $12 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Crum & Forster's net premiums written increased by 19% and 15% in the second quarter
and first six months. And that primarily reflected growth across several of its specialty lines
of business. It reflected improvements in pricing at casualty reinsurance purchased and
reductions in purchases of quota shares and facultative reinsurance, and all that was
partially offset by planned reductions in the legacy CoverX business.
Turning to Zenith. Zenith reported underwriting profits in the second quarter and first six
months of 2015 of $22 million and $62 million, with corresponding combined ratios of 88%
and 83%. And that compared to underwriting profits of $18 million and $34 million last
year, where combined ratios were about 90% in both of those periods.
The improvement year-over-year principally reflects a lower estimated current accident
year loss ratio for the second quarter and first six months of 2015, that's about 5
percentage points lower year-over-year due to favorable loss development trends for
accident year 2014 that are starting to emerge in 2015.
Secondly, price increases were equal to estimated loss trends for accident year 2015. And
these two factors were partially offset by lower net favorable development of prior year's
reserves in 2015, but which still represented 8 combined ratio points in the second
quarter and 14 combined ratio points in the first six months of 2015. And that reflected net
favorable emergence on the accident years 2012 through 2014.
Net premiums written by Zenith of $164 million and $474 million in the second quarter and
first six months increased by 9% and 8% year-over-year. And that principally reflected an
increase in exposure and moderate premium rate increases.

FINAL

Northbridge reported underwriting profits of $12 million and $19 million at combined ratios
of 94.5% and 95.7% in the second quarter and first six months of 2015. And that
compared to underwriting profits of $11 million and $12 million last year at combined ratios
of 95.3% in the second quarter and 97.5% in the full six months of 2014.
Northbridge's underwriting results in 2015 included the benefit of net favorable prior-year
reserve development of $20 million in the second quarter, $19 million in the first six
months, representing combined ratio points of 9 and 4. That favorable emergence was
principally arising on accident years 2010 and prior, across most lines of business at
Northbridge.
Last year in 2014, Northbridge had a net favorable development of $27 million and $42
million representing 12 and 9 combined ratio points in the second quarter and first 6
months of 2014. There were no material current period catastrophes in either the second
quarter or first six months of 2015 or 2014.
In Canadian dollar terms, net premiums written by Northbridge in the second quarter and
the first six months of 2015 increased by 6.9% and 6.5%. That reflected increased new
business at Northbridge Insurance, modest price increases across the group and a lower
amount of casualty reinsurance purchased in 2015.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to Fairfax Asia, Fairfax Asia reported improved underwriting profits of $8 million
and $14 million at combined ratios of about 90% in each of the second quarter and first six
months of 2015. And that compared with underwriting profits of $5 million and $9 million in
combined ratio points of about 94% in each of the comparable periods in 2014.
The combined ratios in the second quarter and first six months of 2015 included 8 and 7
combined ratio points of net favorable prior-year reserve development. That's about $6
million and $11 million, respectively, and that was primarily related to commercial
automobile and workers' compensation loss reserves. Net premiums written by Fairfax
Asia increased by 16% and decreased by 10% in the second quarter and first six months of
2015, respectively.
Excluding the impact of the acquisitions of Union Assurance and MCIS in 2015 and Fairfax
Indonesia in 2014, net premiums written actually decreased by 9.2% and 25.6% in the
second quarter and first six months of 2015. And that reflected planned reductions in
commercial automobile writings at Falcon; the unfavorable effect of foreign currency
translation at First Capital and Pacific Insurance; and an increase in written premiums
ceded to reinsurers, related to a new intercompany quota share reinsurance agreement
between Group Re and First Capital, which was effective January 1, 2015 in respect to
certain commercial automobile business.
Our insurance and reinsurance other segment produced underwriting profits of $8 million
and $19 million with combined ratios of about 92% in each of the second quarter and first
six months of 2015, and that compared to underwriting profits of $2 million and $4 million
last year when the combined ratio was about 98%.

FINAL

The improvement in underwriting profit in the second quarter and first six months in 2015
principally reflected the increased net favorable prior-year reserve development and
lower current period catastrophe losses. Now, the second quarter results also reflect
improvement in the non-catastrophe underwriting margins in the current accident year
and primarily at Polish Re in Fairfax Brasil.
Net premiums written by the insurance and reinsurance other segment increased by 15%
in the second quarter of 2015 and 34% in the first six months of 2015. That increase
reflected the impact of the QBE reinsurance transactions at Polish Re with the majority of
that assumed gross premium written was retained and also reflected the other side of
that new intercompany quota share reinsurance agreement that was mentioned during
the recap of the Fairfax Asia results.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to Brit, in the second quarter of 2015, Fairfax completed the acquisition of Brit and
commenced consolidating its balance sheet and operating results with effect from June
5, 2015. In the second quarter, and first six months of 2015, so really just representing a
one-month of activity in the case of Brit. Brit contributed $151 million of net premiums
written to the consolidated total and produced an underwriting profit of $5 million at a
95.9% combined ratio.
Runoff reported operating income of $25 million, $12 million in the second quarter and first
six months of 2015, that compared to operating losses of $29 million and $50 million in
the same periods in 2014. The year-over-year improvement reflected net favorable prioryear reserve development and European runoff in the second quarter of 2015, compared
to loss reserve strengthening in the second quarter and the first six months of 2014 U.S.
runoff.
Moving to some of our consolidated figures. Consolidated interest and dividend income
increased from $120 million and $211 million in the second quarter and first six months of
2014 to $147 million and $261 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2015.
That reflected higher interest income earned on increased holdings of higher-yielding
bonds year-over-year. That was partially offset by lower dividend income earned on lower
holdings of preferred stock investments year-over-year.
The share of profit of associates totaled $117 million and $148 million in the second quarter
and first six months of 2015, respectively. And that primarily reflected Fairfax's share of
profit related to its investment in the Kennedy-Wilson real estate partnership that
recognized a significant gain on disposition of apartment properties in Japan, and also
Thai Re, another associate of Fairfax, recognized a gain on the partial disposition of its life
insurance subsidiary.
Fairfax recorded income tax recoveries of $194 million and $100 million in the second
quarter and first six months of 2015. And that resulted in fairly high effective rates of
income tax recovery in those periods as the base of pre-tax losses was fairly low. The
higher effective rates of income tax recovery principally related to the gains on the sale of
Ridley, where we had an accounting gain of $236 million, and the Cara acquisition where
we had an accounting gain of $205 million.

Page 8 of 15

FINAL

The gain on Ridley was principally recognized in Canada where only 50% of that gain is
taxable. And in terms of Cara, for tax purposes that transaction resulted in a rollover of
the original tax basis for the majority of the instruments that we exchanged for multiple
voting shares, so that event was largely no-taxable. Any taxes that remained payable on
these two transactions were offset for the most part by previously unrecorded losses in
the jurisdictions where those gains were recognized.
We ended the second quarter with an investment portfolio inclusive of holding company
cash of $28.9 billion compared to $26.2 billion at the end of 2014. The majority of that
increase related to the consolidation of the portfolio investments of Brit and Fairfax India
partially offset by net unrealized depreciation and bonds and common stocks and the
unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.
Moving to our financial position. Our total debt to total capital ratio decreased to 23.3% to
June 30, 2015, from 24.6% at December 31, 2014, and that was primarily due to the
increase in our total capital outpacing the increase in our total debt. The increase in total
debt reflected the consolidation of the embeddedness of Brit and Cara which was
partially offset by the repayment of $125 million of OdysseyRe senior notes in the second
quarter.
So, with that, I'll turn it back to you, Prem.

Thank you, Dave. Now we're happy to answer your questions. Please give us your name,

Operator
Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And please be
reminded to limit your questions to one. Our first question is from Tom MacKinnon of
BMO Capitals. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Question for Dave. Maybe Dave will
respond to this. I noticed that you moved $314 million of Greek common shares from
Level 1 to Level 3 in the quarter. And is this all of your Greek exposure? Were there any
write-downs taken on that? And I understand that there's some talk about the Greek
Exchange being – the Athens Exchange being opened as early as next week, would that
be an event that would trigger a move back from a Level 3 to Level 1. And what sort of
events would trigger that movement back? Thanks.

Thank you. Thank you, Tom. I'll take the first crack at it and then pass it on to Dave. Just on
Greek investments, I think we've disclosed that in our annual report. But just to tell you, at
the end of the second quarter, that's June 30, in total we had about $809 million of
Greek exposure. And our big one that we've had and the one that people are focused on
is Eurobank where we have approximately $240 million. And our cost on that, Tom, was
about $590 million, close to $600 million. At the end of June, it was marked at $240
million. So, we've taken a 60% write-off on that already mark-to- market valued at, I think
about $0.11 even though on June 26, I think it closed at $0.14-plus, right, Dave?

A - David Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

That's correct.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

And so, that's the Eurobank. And the next – the other large one is Grivalia, which is a real
estate company, some of the highest quality commercial buildings in Athens, very strong
management and you might have also met the management at our annual meeting. And
that company even here, it's basically Grivalia is sell above our cost and under almost any
circumstances, we'll make money on that. But of course, it's subject to mark-to-market. It's
listed in the Athens Exchange and they're planning to open the Athens Exchange next
week.
Just a few comments on Eurobank. Eurobank, we've said in our annual report, has very
strong management. Greece is now stabilizing. The banks are opened, they're open for
business. The capital controls are slowly being phased out. They have a very strong capital
position. Eurobank, almost two times the requirements. And we just think that Greece and
the bank will recover as time goes by. But of course, only time will tell on that. Our
exposure, though, is about $239 million, $240 million all-in on Eurobank.
Dave, you want to add to that, Dave, in terms of Level 1, Level 3?

A - David Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Yes. The only thing I would add there is I think you're right Tom when the Greek markets
open again, those Greek stocks will get reclassified back into Level 1 assuming there's an
active market with regularly quota prices. Sorry, go ahead.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

What was the value of Grivalia? You had Eurobank at $240 million. What was the value of
Grivalia?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

Grivalia at – well, do you not remember what the price was, Dave?

Anything else, Tom?

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

No. That was great. Thank you.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Thank you very much. We'll move on to the next question, Yuki.

Operator
Yes, sir. Our next question is from Mark Dwelle of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now
open. Please go ahead.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. A couple of questions. First, just following up on that last discussion
related to the Greek assets. Are all of those – are all of the mark that were taken primarily

within the equity and related investments or are any of these actually held within
associates part of the balance sheet where they're not being marked?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

FINAL

Dave?

A - David Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Sure. The only one that is an associate that's not getting marked is Grivalia. So that's the
$330 fair value that we mentioned, and that was priced at the June 26 closing price.
Everything else that we have is mark-to-market through P&L.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Got it. Thank you. The second question I had related to the OdysseyRe quarter quota
share agreement that you discussed on a couple of places. I understand $100 million in
the quarter related to the return of premium. Are there impacts on forward quarters as
well on a kind of quarter-over-quarter basis? Is there a way we can kind of quantify that
just to get a sense of how the loss of that or the exit of that contract will impact some of
the comparisons in the upcoming quarters?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - David Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

I think in some of our prior disclosures, there's probably some information that you can
glean, kind of the volume of that contract. It was a significant contract. And the impact that
will have in the orders going forward is just we just won't have that earned premium going
through in the related incurred losses.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. Okay. A third question. The – let me re-queue. I'll come back. Thanks.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Fair enough. Thanks, Mark. Is there – Mark, if you want to ask a question because there's
no other questions on the call, please feel free to follow-up on your question.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

I recall what it is if I'm still on.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Do you recall what it is? Yes. Go ahead.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Yes. The question I have related to the portfolio you've picked up related to Brit. Most
likely it's a somewhat different portfolio than the one that Fairfax currently has. I guess, I
was just trying to get a sense of what type of changes, if any, you might be contemplating

related to that portfolio if we might expect to see any notable realized gains or anything
as that portfolio has repositioned or maybe there isn't much to do on it?

FINAL

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

So, no, there is – that's a good question, Mark. We are very sensitive to credit spreads,
and the fact that they're very narrow. And so, we basically reduced – eliminated credit risk
in that portfolio. There's some portfolios, some money managers, they didn't manage it
internally. They managed it externally in the main. So, some managers have gates so that
it takes like two months, three months before you can get the moneys back. We basically
kept it in cash in our U.S. treasuries and that eliminated credit risk. And by the end of the
year, there will be very little credit risk just like in our portfolios. We've got 25% cash.
We've got lots of optionality in our portfolios. And so, it'll – over time, it'll be very similar to
our portfolios.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Great. Thank you. That's all my questions.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, Mark. Yuki, any more questions?

Yes, sir. We have our next question from Howard Flinker of Flinker & Company. Your line is
now open. Please go ahead.

Q - Howard Flinker
Thank you. Hello, everybody.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Good morning, Howard.

Q - Howard Flinker
Hi. Prem, I've got a big question, a big-picture question for you, even though you and I
generally agree. Are you seeing improving economic conditions in Europe and temporarily
reduce deflationary pressures in Europe?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Well, perhaps, Howard, you would've said that a few months ago, but more recently last
year, you noticed that the price of oil is below $50, $48 and change. You've noticed the
price of copper breaking to $40. You've noticed iron ore prices coming down. Yes. You've
noticed long treasuries coming down. They went right up to 3.50 and $.20. Now, they're
below 3, as you know. They're at $.93.

So, it seems to us that the pressures are coming back to bear on the deflation end.
Howard, as we're going forward, the U.S. is still tepid. China, we've seen what's happened
in their stock markets and that's what we can see, Howard. You can imagine what it is in
terms of what we cannot see.

FINAL

Q - Howard Flinker
Yes. (39:19) chop suey in the stock market is in China, but it does apply.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

But anyway, so, our thinking is that pressures are amounting now, again, Howard. And as in
all of these things, it's only in the long term that you can...

Q - Howard Flinker
No. I agree. But I was speaking narrowly in a focus on Europe. Are the pressures in Europe
still building? You're talking bigger picture and I agree with that, too. Are you...

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

In Europe, we don't see much change in Europe in terms of the – the economy might be
picking up a little more. But the deflationary pressures are still very prevalent, Howard.

Q - Howard Flinker
