{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to the Allianz Conference Call on the Financial
Results of the Third Quarter of 2021. As you may have noticed already, we have changed
the setup for this call. Among other things, we no longer have an external operator.
Therefore, it is up to me to remind you that this conference call is being streamed live on
allianz.com, and YouTube and that a recording will be made available shortly after the call.
(Operator Instructions)
All right. That was all from my side for now. And with that, I turn the call over to our CFO,
Giulio Terzariol.

Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Thank you, Oliver, and good afternoon or good morning to everybody. And we can go
straight to Page 3 of the presentation where we show the numbers for the nine months.
And as you already know, we had a very good quarter and also very good nine months
results, and this applies to all segments and also to all KPIs. As you see, the growth in
revenue was 6%m and this has driven by all segments. Operating proﬁt is 27% higher
compared to the level last year. Clearly, last year, we had the COVID eﬀect, but even if you
adjust for that, the growth rate to the operating proﬁt will be 9%. All segments have also
contributed positively to these developments. The combined ratio is 2 percentage point
better compared to last year.

Here, I would say it is more important even to look at the normalization of the combined
ratio. We have a combined ratio of 93.9%. The NatCat load is 3.7%. If you adjust the 3.7%
to the 2 percentage point that we usually expect in the combined ratio will be basically
slightly north of 92%. So there is also a clear sign that if you adjust the numbers for the
NatCat, we are very much in line with our 93% combined ratio target, if not even relatively
better of that.
On the life side, you see a nice operating proﬁt and also a nice new business margin.
Then when we look at the asset management, the operating proﬁt for the nine months is
2.5%, with a cost-income ratio well below 60%, and also ﬂows of EUR90 billion, thereof,
EUR36 billion are coming from AGI, which is a very good number, EUR54 [ph] billion are
coming from PIMCO. So a very good picture for the nine months.

Bloomberg Transcript

And when you go to Page 5, you can see also that in the third quarter standalone, we had
very good numbers. Here, you can see also momentum on the revenue line for PropertyCasualty, with a growth rate of 7%. When you look at the operating proﬁt, we have a
double-digit growth in operating proﬁt. And when we look at the KPIs by segment, you
can see a slight deterioration of the combined ratio by considering the NatCat load of
4.9% is a very good combined ratio. And then in the other lines of business, you can see a
very healthy level on the business margin, a very good level in the life side, a very good
level of cost-income ratio. In Asset Management, also positive ﬂows. But I'm going to
come back on these numbers later on in the presentation as I go through the segments.
On Page 7, the solvency ratio is 207%, which is stable compared to the level that we had in
June or at the beginning of the year. And when you look at the sensitivity, it's pretty much
unchanged compared to what we had in the prior quarter.
On Page 9, we are showing, as always, the waterfall. And you can see that the organic
capital generation is continuously strong with a 7 percentage point number. When you
adjust for the dividend accrual and also for taxes, we have an organic capital generation
of 2.5%. The market impact is minus 1%. It's relatively minor, that's coming from a twisting.
If you go onto the curve, especially the credit spread curve, then capital management in
total basically, neutralizing itself and then we had negative impact of 5% in tax and other.
2 percentage point of the impact is due to taxes, and then 3 percentage point is due to
sort of miscellaneous or small items that accumulated to this 3 percentage point negative
impact. Overall, we have a strong solvency ratio, stable solvency ratio of 207%, which is in
line also with the level that we had in the prior quarters.
Now, if you go to Page 11, coming to the segments, we had a strong growth in P/C of 7.2%.
Clearly, Allianz Partners has contributed to this growth with a growth rate of about 50%.
But even if we adjust for the numbers for Allianz Partners, we have about 4 percentage -4% of growth. So, overall, a growth -- a good growth rate for the segment.
Overall, we see growth in Germany, we see growth in Australia, in Eastern Europe, in Latin
America, Turkey, AGCS, Allianz Partners, as said before, and also Euler Hermes. We have
adjusted a few entities, where we are now growing at the moment, and usually, the reason

can be pressure on the motor side or in some cases, we are doing pruning in commercial
lines. The rate environment is stable with -- and I would say benign with the growth rates
for the renewal of 3.8%. And as you look at the diﬀerent line -- diﬀerent countries, you can
see also that in all countries, the development is either stable or positive. So also from
that point of view, we are in a good situation.
Now, if we move to Slide number 13, the operating proﬁt is relatively stable compared to
the level of 2020. When we look at the combined ratio, you can see a slight increase of 20
basis points. Here, we need to consider that we had more than 4 percentage points
deviation compared to the prior period because of the NatCat. On the other side, last
year we had about 50 basis points of negative impact because of COVID, and then this
year, we have about 2.4 percentage point of better run-oﬀ.

Bloomberg Transcript

So when you anyway normalize the numbers for these eﬀects, we still have an
improvement compared to the prior period of about 1 percentage point. Most of this
improvement is coming from also lower weather-related losses, but there is also a little bit
of the underlying improvement. But again, when you normalize these numbers, and you
get very easily to a combat ratio, which is well south of 93%, it's also for the quarter, again,
a conﬁrmation that we are well on track for the 93% combined ratio on an underlying
basis.
When we move to Page 15, on the picture by OE, we see that clearly a few subsidiaries
have been impacted by the NatCats. Germany, clearly with a 14 percentage point impact,
mainly because of the ﬂoods, but there were also some storms impacting Germany. So
overall 97.9% combined ratio which is a very healthy combined ratio considering the
impacts from the NatCats. Also, a very good combined ratio in England, France, Australia,
Eastern Europe. Italy, we have a combined ratio, which is a little bit higher compared to
what we are used to, but also the NatCats impact was higher compared to what we usually
expect to see in Italy.
And then AGCS has a combined ratio of over 100%, but considering the NatCat impact of
16.3%, this is a very healthy combined ratio. So we are very conﬁdent that AGCS is going
to get to the 98% combined ratio by the end of the year. And then, we have a very good
performance in Euler Hermes. So when you put together, overall, a 94.7% combined ratio,
again considering the level of NatCat of the third quarter, I would say these are very good
results, proving a very strong underlying performance.
On Page 17. On the investment income, we see a decrease of 6%, but this decrease is
mainly due to swings in the net harvesting and other, which is basically a swing in the F/X
eﬀects. Otherwise, when you look at the development of the current yield, it's is stable.
When you look at the interest and similar income, it is even a little bit higher compared to
what we had last year. So summarizing for the segment, I would say a very strong quarter.
Yes, we had the impact of the natural catastrophe, but the underlying performance
continued to be pretty strong.
Now, we come to Life. On the Life side, I'm very pleased about the development of the
new business. First of all, you see a growth rate of the present value in the business

Page 3 of 23

FINAL

premium of about 50%. Here, we have also the impact because of a contract -- of an
insurance contract that we -- assumed an insurance contract that we had done, but even
adjusting for that, the growth rate will be about 30%.
And now, we can see basically growth across the board. Germany is down, but just for the
quarter. When you look at Germany on a nine months' basis, in reality, we're growing also
in Germany. Then you look at the business mix, it is deﬁnitely developing in the right way.
Even if you adjust the numbers for the transition for the -- assume the insurance
transaction, you see that -- you will see that the mix is deﬁnitely going in the right
direction.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, moving to Page 21. On the operating proﬁt development, we see an increase of
about 12%, and this is explained by the increase in loadings and fees, in investment
margin, and also in technical margin. So I would say all proﬁt sources have contributed to
this increase. Clearly, you see also high expenses, but that's also the consequence clearly
of higher production. So, in total, EUR1.3 billion, if you round it the operating proﬁt, which
is well above the EUR1.1 billion expectation that we have for the -- usually for the quarter.
We will also say that we are at a point where we believe that our rate is a little bit higher
than the EUR1.1 billion that we have usually communicated.
And with that, when we go then Page 23. On the value of new business, it is clearly very
healthy with an increase compared to prior-year period of 80%. Part of it is also explained
by these contracts on the insurance side, but even if you adjust the numbers for that
contracts, you see a 45% increase in the value of new business. And I would say that's
basically almost all countries have contributed to this development. And also in the new
business margin, you see a very strong picture across the board, and the same applies in
general to the operating proﬁt. So overall, a strong performance in the Life segment and
also a widespread strong performance.
Moving to Page 25. On the investment margin, you see a growth rate of 13%, and that's
clearly the combination of two drivers. On the one side, we are increasing the policy
reserve, so there is a growth rate of 4%, and on the other side, we're also improving the
investment margin, and the investment margin is better compared to what we had last
year. This is an increase by about 8%, and I'm referring here to the margin expressing at
present. [ph] And clearly when you combine it to F/X, you get to a growth rate of -- which
is double-digit.
One thing which is also important, we are growing on the reserve basis. But when you
look at the Solvency II evolution, there is basically no increase in SCR because of the
growth on the Life side. So from that point of view, I would say there is really a capital
eﬃciency, which has come into play, so we have more reserves, not more capital. And
when you look at IFRS numbers, you see an improvement in the investment margin.
Also here, you see that the current yield is much higher compared to last year, and that's
because last year, the dividends were pretty low, where now we see a normalization of the
dividend payment. And on the other side, you also see that we are continuously reducing

FINAL

the guarantee. So that's a very nice eﬀect because clearly, this development is going to
give stability to this ratio as we move forward.
Now, coming to Asset Management. We have now more than EUR2.5 trillion of assets
under management. And when you look at the growth of our assets under management,
compared to the beginning of 2020, you see a 7% growth rate. If you look at the growth
compared to September last year, you see a 12% increase in assets under management.
Part of this increase is due clearly to the market development, but in these 12 months, we
have been able to record EUR120 billion of inﬂows. So that's also a very important number
to remember. So this increase is not just due to market, but also to a very strong
generation of the inﬂows, which was also pretty consistent quarter-over-quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, if we move to Page 29, speaking speciﬁcally about Q3, we see ﬂows of EUR26
billion, thereof about EUR20 billion is coming from PIMCO, and then we have about EUR7
billion coming from AGI. When you see the split by asset classes or by regions, you can
see that basically there was a contribution coming from almost all asset classes and
coming from all regions. And then also when you look at the split between mutual funds
and separate accounts, you see that the ﬂows are coming from mutual fund, which is also
where we have higher fee margin.
And now coming to Page 31, you can see clearly that the revenue up compared to last
year by 16%. When you adjust for FX, and both PIMCO and AGI are growing nicely. And
on the fee margin, you see also an increase of the fee margin of about 1 basis point. This is
coming from PIMCO, and that is also the eﬀect of basically having a higher mix in mutual
fund compared to the separate accounts. So overall, a good revenue growth for the
segment, and also when we look at the segment, a stronger fee margin level.
This means when you go to Page 33, that our operating proﬁt is clearly growing. This is
the eﬀect of the growth in revenue and also of the operational leverage that you have in
Asset Management. So overall, we had a growth rate of 30%. And when you look at the
single entities, you see that PIMCO grew the operating proﬁt by about 20%, and I will say,
very noteworthy is the development at AGI with a growth rate of 72%.
Also, the cost-income ratio is clearly going in the right direction, especially at AGI. You see
a reduction in the cost-income ratio by more than 10 percentage points. When you look at
the nine months number for AGI, you see the cost-income ratio of 60 -- of about 61%, also
with an improvement of 10 percentage point compared to last year. So overall, very strong
performance in Asset Management and PIMCO, but also I would say, an exceptional
performance at AGI. So we are very happy with this development.
Page 35, on the Corporate segment, there is not much to say. It's basically a little bit
better compared to last year and in line with our expectation.
Now, I turn to Page 37. Here you can see that the non-operating items about EUR300
million lower compared to last year. This has to do with the amount of realized gains,
which has been lower compared to what we had last year. When you put all together, we
have EUR2.1 billion of net income, which is 2% above the prior period levels, also a good
Page 5 of 23

FINAL

number considering the development of the operating proﬁt, and there we had less
realized gains below the line.
So summarizing, a very good quarter and also very good nine months with a growth in
revenue, a growth in operating proﬁt. Again, even if you adjust for COVID last year, the
growth rate in operating proﬁt was almost double-digit, a good increase. Very healthy
increase in net income. Our solvency ratio is stable and much above our target. We have
paid between dividend and buyback EUR4.7 billion of remittances to our shareholders.
And as you know, considering the strong underlying performance, we have also revised
the outlook from upper half of the range to the higher end of the range, or I would say
that based on where we are right now, we are very conﬁdent about our operating
performance in the third quarter.
And with that, I would like to take your question.

Questions And Answers
A - Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Giulio. Perhaps before we start with the Q&A session, let me just quickly
remind you how you can raise your hand in the new setup. (Operator Instructions) And we
will take our ﬁrst question from Andrew Ritchie. Andrew, go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hello. Hi there. Good afternoon. Giulio, I wonder if you just give us an update on what
you're seeing in terms of frequency and severity trends in your key non-life markets, I
guess, in the context of activity returning to normal and also in the context of any sort of
inﬂationary trends?
The second question was the media call this morning, you suggested an answer to a
journalist that, I think, you could take a reserve related to the Structured Alpha situation
before the year-end. I was surprised you are willing to say that. So maybe could you just
give us some color why you felt the need to say that? Is there anything you can say in
terms of timing where there is a bit more clarity? Thanks.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yeah. So thank you, Andrew. So starting from the ﬁrst question on the frequency severity. I
would say regarding frequency, we basically see a normalization of frequency. That's
almost across the board. There might be a couple of countries where frequency might be
slightly lower the level that we had pre-COVID, but in general, we see frequency pretty
much normalized in the pre-COVID level.
In the case of severity, I would say it's -- or if your questions about inﬂation, I would say,
we don't see a widespread increase in inﬂation, so that is not the case. So -- and then
clearly, it is always a diﬀerent situation country-by-country or line of business by line of
business. I would say moto TPL, in general, we don't see increase in inﬂation, and that's
Page 6 of 23

Date: 2021-11-10

FINAL

also because, as you know, for the time being, there is no real wage inﬂation kicking in. So
from a moto liability point of view, we don't see that. As you know, we don't have
exposure -- a meaningful exposure to workers compensation, but also for workers comp,
there will be the same line of thinking. As long as we don't see wage inﬂation, we are not
going to see necessarily an increase in severity.
When we look at other lines of business, which could be also moto and (inaudible)
damage, or maybe property. In some cases, you can see a little bit of an increase in
inﬂation, but again, I wouldn't say it is widespread. So if you ask me do we see any impact
in our numbers as we speak, no. Do I expect to see any impact in the fourth quarter
numbers, not really.

Bloomberg Transcript

Clearly, we are monitoring this development very carefully. So I would say we have very
proactive in monitoring and then we are going to be also extremely reactive. Let's put it
this way. If we see that inﬂation is really picking up and to this point where we are thinking
is clearly you can always do tariﬀ increases to oﬀset inﬂation, but we're also thinking what
we can do on the claims management because that's also an area where we can try to
oﬀset some of the inﬂation that we might eventually see. So bottom line, no, not
widespread but in some regions, in some countries or lines of business, deﬁnitely, we see
a little bit of a pickup in inﬂation. But for the time being, it's not having any impact on our
number. So I think we are overall well positioned that we see what is coming in our way.
On the other question which was booking before year-end. No, I didn't say that. So ﬁrst of
all, we are going to do a booking when we had the information to do a booking. I cannot
envision that we are going to be capable to do a booking before year-end, but you never
know. I -- what I said is, I believe that we are going to do potentially a booking for the
fourth quarter when we close the numbers, that's -- but that's also something that I cannot
tell you that it is going to happen.
So what I can say is that clearly, we are giving high priority to the resolution of this case,
and also we would like to put the uncertainty behind us as quickly as possible. On the
other side, clearly, we want to be very, very cautious because we want to get to the best -to a good outcome from an economic point of view. So if you ask me, I cannot tell you
when we are going to do a booking. I don't see us doing a booking before year-end. But
deﬁnitely, before the year-end closing, we need to think very, very hard about if we can
put a number, what kind of number we can put there. I hope this clariﬁes the topic.

FINAL

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much, and ﬁrst of all, congrats on the great results. And I had three
questions, please. And the ﬁrst one, probably predictably on the AGI cost-income ratio,
just wondering if you can help us understand how sustainable that might be? I mean, you
seem to be pointing us to the nine months because just now Giulio, rather in Q3, so
maybe that's part of the answer. But even for the nine months, I guess, if I compare the
divisions to your outlook, Asset Management is the one that's performing by far the best.
And I know you said that the outlook was probably most conservative for that division in
the part of the year. But I'm just wondering how much of it surprised you? Or whether it's
all in line with what you expected after the actions you took? And it's all, so that would be
great. [ph]

Bloomberg Transcript

And the second one was, I was just wondering how the whole Structured Alpha Funds
issue aﬀects your thinking on your ability to do share buybacks or other ﬂexibility, M&A or
whatever that you might use money for? I mean, even though you haven't disclosed any
scenarios for the ﬁnancial inﬂations as of yet, I mean I guess, you've got some idea on the
back of your mind. And I'm just wondering, do you sort of think of the position net of
those? Or do you think now you can gradually allow for them over time? Now, I'm
wondering whether the solvency ratio might become more of a binding constraint. So just
how you're thinking about that, that would be very helpful.
And then thirdly, I just wanted to ask about cyber insurance actually, because obviously,
prices have rocketed up recently and it's being attributed to increased frequency and
severity of losses there. And I know we covered that inside Allianz -- there as well, but I
was just wondering if you could update us on your sort of assessment of the risk there,
just given that it's a very young and volatile business. Yeah -- so that will be great. Thanks
so much.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Thank you, Peter. And starting from the ﬁrst question, AGI. Yes, the reason why I pointed
out the 61.3% was just to say the right expectation. So I wouldn't say that 57.3% should be
the cost-income ratio that we should expect moving forward for AGI. I believe that AGI
can operate at a 61% cost-income ratio clearly because that's where we are already. Now,
in reality, I don't know whether this is going to be the real target that we are going to have
for AGI because to a certain degree, we want always to allow also for the possibility to do
additional investments.
So I would say that 62% to 63% could be a cost-income ratio of target that we have for
AGI, and this would anyway mean that we have the ability to operate lower than this. So
that's the important thing. So it is like for PIMCO, right. PIMCO, we have basically -- and at
the end, then we'd like to ramp PIMCO as not above 60%, so slightly below 60%. We
know that if you really want to just go in savings moat, we can run 55%, maybe so 56%. So
there would be a little bit of philosophy that we are going to run also with AGI. So I
believe we're going to ﬁx at 62% to 63% cost-income ratio target, knowing that this can
invest -- either a possibility to invest in good times or some protection in the case, you
know, we go through the periods where revenue could be lower because, as you know,
Asset Management can be also a little bit volatile.

FINAL

What I can say, we are in a good spot, so that's really a good spot to be. We made a major
step change. If you ask me, I would deﬁnitely say that's been a step-change in the costincome ratio of AGI. You can see also the inﬂows are really, really good, EUR35 billion of
ﬂows, that's something that AGI never had before. I can tell you, it was October, we had
positive ﬂows of EUR2 billion for AGI. So I believe this company is now performing at a
diﬀerent level, so from that point of view, I think we are starting from a position of cost
trend. That's on the AGI question.
On the Structured Alpha, whether this is changing our thinking regarding capital
deployment? I would tell you, not really. I don't see that we have a constrain on the
Solvency II ratio for the kind of investments or deployment or buyback that we want to do.
So at the end of the day, clearly, we want to input some numbers around Solvency II and
adjust our Solvency II ratio down. I think you can do the exercise that where you would
like to do. I believe, you are going to come straight to a Solvency II number, which is well
above our 180% level.
And I would tell you just since you're asking buyback, let's say EUR1 billion buyback is a
couple of percentage points of our Solvency II ratio, so I don't feel that there is any
constrain. When we think about EUR1 billion buyback, EUR1.5 billion buyback, I don't see
that. If we start talking our capital deployment of EUR5 billion, EUR6 billion, that's a
diﬀerent story. But as long as we are speaking of the normal steady capital deployments, I
would say there is no constrain at all, so we feel we have all the ﬂexibility that we need to
have in order to pursue the course of action that we had before Structured Alpha, and
also stay tuned because we might also do back book transaction in the course of the next
six to 12 months, and that can also somehow provide additional Solvency II ratio. But even
in the absence of that, I'm very conﬁdent we have all the ﬂexibility in the Solvency II stage
[ph] that we need to continue with our strategy like before Structured Alpha came into our
life.
And the last question on cyber insurance, I tell you I -- we are very cautious. I'm personally
very cautious. I know that price is going up, but I don't know who is going to win between
price frequency, severity, all these kind of eﬀects that you need to consider. So we are
extremely cautious. So we give -- we do some cyber but in very limited amounts, and this
means that we have a very low capacity risk and also, we have a pretty strong reinsurance
program around it. So which means we are not really going strong in this market at all. So
from that point of view, if you ask me, do I see cyber to be an engine of growth and
proﬁtability for Allianz in the next two, three years, the answer is no. This also means
anyway there shouldn't be an area of risk because we are taking a very cautious
positioning on cyber.

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Fantastic. Thank you so much, and yeah, well done to these results. And my ﬁrst question
and I'm really puzzled -- I mean, it's getting on the same topic. How much of your time is
spent thinking at the Board level or personally, or when you have general with somebody
on Structured Alpha? And -- because clearly, it's the only topic which I believe investors
are thinking about at the moment. So I just wondered how big the disconnect is?
And then the other more kind of boring question. 93% you used to mention that as a
target for the combined ratio for the year. I haven't heard it in this call, but maybe I missed
it. We're talking about underlying which may not be quite the same (inaudible) And you
said something about buyback deals or backﬁll transactions. Just wondered if you could
give a little bit more of an update.
And then the ﬁnal question is on Italy. I was really surprised. I know it's NatCats and stuﬀ,
but I have been ﬁguring [ph] to see 88% or 86% combined ratio. Just wondering are
these value drivers? [ph] Thank you.

Thank you. So starting from Structured Alpha, no, I don't talk to my wife about Structured
Alpha. She would divorce me. She is a saint (inaudible) when we're talking about
Structured Alpha. But otherwise, clearly, that's something we're as a Board or
management we're spending time. But the reality is we spent a lot of time also on
underlying performance, and as you will see, the underlying performance is very good.
And I'd like to highlight also again the underlying performance, speciﬁcally of AGI is very
good. So we let this -- yeah, we let this for Structured Alpha.
Now, coming to your question regarding the combined ratio. I think your question was
how we look at the combined ratio in the 93%, and how we look at the combination
normalized? So I'll just tell you, so as of now, I would say that if we just take a normal
course of action, our combined ratio by year-end is going to be above 93%. And if you
were to ask my number, I would say this should be about 93.5% based on a normal level
on NatCats in the third quarter, and you know, we have also an aggregate which is going
to kick in. So that will be my expectation.
Yeah. Can we go to 93% if we really want to? Yes, that would be possible because we have
clearly the balance sheet strength to get there. But I believe it makes more sense to focus
on the underlying. And so I will say is going to be very clear that if we close the 2021 with
a combined ratio of about 93.5%, with the NatCat load of about 3 percentage point,
you're going to see that the run-oﬀ is very normal. I think everybody is going to be -- is
going to have a very good picture about the fact that we are in the 93%. In the Capital
Market Day, we are going to anyway talk about the target for the combined ratio moving
forward, and also consider that overall, we are having very good results in Asset

FINAL

Management and also in Life. So I think we are very happy with our operating
performance and so I don't see the need to push the combined ratio, and as you can
appreciate, the combined ratio is deﬁnitely at a very good underlying level. So that's on
that topic.
On Italy, because you were asking, I believe about the combined ratio of Italy. First of all,
usually in Italy, we would expect a couple of percentage point of NatCats. Now, we had
about 4. [ph] So if you normalize for that, you are 89%. And then I would say there is some
pressure on Italy on the moto side. The competition is pretty tough there, so -- and we are
also a little bit cautious, most likely as we think also about reserve inﬂation, the pickup in
severity that we might see in the future.

Bloomberg Transcript

So from that point of view, there is a little bit of that too, but also I just tell you and we -- I
think we talked about that already in the past. We should not expect Italy always to
perform at 83% or 85% combined ratio. So we need also to understand that the
combined ratio of Italy is still going to be very, very good and very healthy, but it is not
going to be 83% that we have seen for a few years in the past. But that's always been part
of our line of thinking, so from that point of view, there is no news here.
On the back book, we are continuously looking at where it makes sense to do some
transactions. You saw that we did a transaction in Switzerland just a few weeks ago. We
are potentially close to do a very small transaction in France, and we are looking at other
opportunities, always there. In the case of France and Italy, we are not necessarily just
doing back book transition in the sense of doing reinsurance contracts, but we are also
looking at reworking some of the contracts or to do transfer from legacy products to new
products. And also we are looking at opportunity, I would say, in other countries about
how we can clearly optimize our capital situation on the Life side.
Keep in mind that our RoE in the Life is about 12 percentage points. So we have
fundamentally a healthy business, so that's something to keep in mind. But clearly, as we
see opportunity to make RoE in ANCI [ph] transition, we are going to do so. And to give
an idea of Switzerland. In Switzerland, we had over the last year, an RoE of 10%, which is
not a better RoE, by the way, for Switzerland, very stable market, 10% now based on the
transaction that we have completed, whilst we are going to get a capital upstreaming,
which is going to happen in 2022. Then by 2023, we expect the RoE in Switzerland to be
13%. So that's I think a good example of how we can lift the RoE from 10% to 13% through
a transition. And I would say that if you have a 13% RoE in the Swiss operation, I believe,
it's a very stable Swiss operation. I think that's a very good number.

All right. Then. We take our next question from Fulin Liang. Fulin, go ahead. We will open
your line now.

FINAL

Q - Fulin Liang

{BIO 21126177 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you very much. Three quick questions. The ﬁrst one is you
upgraded your normalized capital generation again from 10 percentage points to 12
percentage points, and then your quarterly capital generation is like 2.5 percentage
points or 3 percentage points in the last two quarters, despite very heavy NatCats. Can I
take this like 2 -- 2.5 percentage points, 3 percentage points as a new norm quarterly cap
gen? So that's the ﬁrst question.
And then secondly is, your Euler Hermes, if I remember correctly, you kind of guided that
the -- we should expect to see a higher operating proﬁt after the government scheme
ﬁnished. But if I look at the operating proﬁt from Q2 versus Q3, they're very similar. So am
I missing anything there?
And then the last question is, I just wanted to understand what is your liquidity capacity or
limits in terms of if you agreed on some kind of settlement with (inaudible) Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yesh. So on the organic capital generation, I would say yes, you could say that the new
normal is to have a capital generation of 10 percentage point per annum. Now, there is
always one thing to consider. So, in reality, there is also a capital strain in P&C, so if we -- it
makes a diﬀerence if you go 3% in P&C, if you 5%, 6%, 7%, 8% in P&C. So from that point
of view I would always say that there is that element that can depend subject to the
growth rate subtract to this 10%.
The good news is on the Life side, we don't see basically any increase in SCR and the
business evolution because even if you're growing pretty strongly on the Life side and
new products are very eﬃcient and then we had a release of SCR coming from the in
ﬂows. So from that point of view, I think that's a very good news that we are not so
basically increasing our SCR for Life.
And then on the P&C side, it depends on the growth rate, you might have more business
evolution or not. So, for example, if you see in this quarter, the business evolution is 0.2.
This is coming from P&C. I believe last quarter, the business evolution was about zero. So
fundamentally, yes, if you ask me to give you a rough indication of our Solvency II organic
generation, we will point out to a 10 percentage point.
The other question was Euler Hermes. I would say, ﬁrst of all, technically speaking, you
have a slight increase in operating proﬁt in Euler Hermes in third quarter versus Q2. Now,
the point is also that in Q2, we had a substantial release of run-oﬀ, and this quarter, we
have also some release or run-oﬀ in Euler Hermes, but to a lower degree compared to
what we had in Q2. But if you look at the number of third quarter for Euler Hermes, it is
EUR130 million. If you annualize that number, we are speaking of EUR120 million, and

Page 12 of 23

before COVID, Euler Hermes was running at about EUR450 million of operating proﬁt. So
that looks pretty good indeed.
And the last question, can you please --

FINAL

A - Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

Liquidity capacity.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

The liquidity capacity. Okay. We have ample liquidity. So really, you should never be
concerned about our liquidity position because we have a lot -- plenty of liquidity. And I
would say, ﬁrst of all, we have liquidity, let's put it this way, from a -- we think like a -- from
a corporate holding point of view, but you need also to consider that our holdings also
the reinsurance company at the same time. So from that point of view, we have also
access to liquidity from the insurance portfolio. But we don't even take into account for
that. We just ﬁrst run with a healthy level of liquidity at the corporate holding level, but we
can always access other liquidity sources if needed. So liquidity, we have ample amount
of liquidity.

Good. Then we will take the next question from Will Hardcastle. Will, you are next.

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 22230376 <GO>}

Afternoon, everyone, and hope you're well. Two questions from me. The ﬁrst one
Solvency. Is there any possibility you can help us to understand the 5 percentage point
move in tax and other? I'm sure it's a lot of small moving parts, but any color there might
be helpful. And the second component is just on AGI. I guess, one risk is that consultants
Page 13 of 23



Company Name: Allianz SE

may look to, I don't know whether the word is downgrade opinion or recommend clients
to switch away from AGI at some point, that's always been the tail risk I guess. Have you
experienced any of this year-to-date? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks.

FINAL

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yeah. No, thank you. So starting from Solvency II, when you look at the 5 percentage point
of impact on Solvency II, 2 percentage points, about 2 percentage points is coming from
just tax, so there you need to reallocate to the operating earnings or market impact, which
in this case, has been zero. So the rest is basically about 3%. And so when I look at the
split of the 3%, I can tell you that about EUR200 million, so let's talk about EUR200
million, right, 0.5 [ph] to EUR200 million. EUR200 million is basically coming from the tax
oﬀset, so we have less tax oﬀsets compared to what we had before.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, just to give you an idea, the tax oﬀset is over EUR5 billion, so now that you have
EUR5.2 billion of tax oﬀset, or EUR5.4 billion tax oﬀset, that's really coming from where
you run the model and what kind of -- which companies are going to contribute in the
given scenario to our SCR. So there is really noise, but this already explained basically
about 1 percentage point or the 3 percentage point you were referring to. Then, we have
also some minor updates -- assumption updates. Then, we have an expose update that
can be also about 50 basis points. And the point is when you calculate the Solvency II
SCR, you need to make basically a projection about what you expect your premium
exposure to be next year. So if you are planning for -- with premium growth, this is going
to lead to a high SCR right away. So that's what we put in other.
When we do the business evolution, we put under the business evolution, the eﬀective
increase in premium. But when you run a Solvency II model, you need already to consider
for the expected premium increase. So that will be about 50 basis points. The
diversiﬁcation is a little bit less, then you get other 50 basis points. And then if you want, I
can bother you with some other very technical stuﬀ, but really, we are speaking of very
minor amounts and they accumulate in the same direction. But, for example, the exposer
update, that is very simple to understand. This means that we are anticipating the next
year, we are going to have a higher level of premium compared to what we currently
have, yeah. This helps?

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 22230376 <GO>}

Yeah. It does. It does indeed.

(Multiple Speakers) more losses because then you will see certain losses -- yeah, expected
losses in quarantine, [ph] and clearly, it's -- you know, you have EUR42 billion, EUR43
billion of SCR, so you just need small movement here and there, and this can -- this is
really just a small noise.
On AGI, on your question about the consultants. Yes, there could potentially be a risk. We
didn't see this yet. As I was saying before, we had EUR2 billion of inﬂows, that's AGI in
October, and we had also positive inﬂows in September. Please keep in mind that in
reality, the AGI institutional business in the US is not really crucial, let's put it this way, for
AGI, and also keep in mind the Structured Alpha is really a speciﬁc strategy. So from that
point of view, I cannot exclude that we might see some consultants suggesting to the
clients to go somewhere else, but it's not something that we saw such therefore it was a
very speciﬁc strategy and in any case, the institutional invest -- institutional business in AGI
is not the -- by far not really the primary source of revenue for AGI.

A - Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

All right. And then we will take our next question from Will Hawkins. Will, we will open
your line now

Q - Will Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hi. Sorry. Can you hear me?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, we can.

Q - Will Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

All right. Thanks, Giulio. And you've already said useful stuﬀ about the ability to do
buybacks, which I think was mostly focusing on the kind of ﬂow that you're generating
each year. Just -- with regards to capital management on the balance sheet, I have seen
some of the big volatility that we know could be around the corner. What's your intended
direction of travel for this Solvency II ratio because the diﬃculty for me, as you know, the
only ﬁgure you put out, there is a target of 180%, and you're massively above that. And so
I don't know if we should always be considering a massive cushion, or if -- you should be
running your balance sheet more eﬃciently? So given the around 210% at the moment,
structurally is the intention to keep it at that level to get the ratio back down to a more
eﬃcient level? Or maybe even to be building the cushion up? I mean, when you used to
have a ceiling, I think it was 220% or something, but I know you dropped the ceiling.
That's question one, please.
And question two, forgive me if I missed it and tell me if I do and I'll go back and read the
transcript. But when you were talking in detail about back book transactions, I don't think
you refer to the US, which clearly is the market that's most in focus at the moment. Can
you just remind us, you've always been really committed to your US portfolio and I'm
proud of it, and what is the size and nature of the kind of business that you may be
looking to exit from in US Life?

And then lastly, just very brieﬂy. You've done another RT1 debt issue. You've already been
very clear about your conﬁdence on liquidity. But what's the overall direction of travel for
debt leverage from here? Are you at a level that you want to maintain? Could you be
issuing more debt or bringing it down again? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Thank you, William. So on the -- maybe starting from the last one, or from the amount of
leverage that we have right now from amount of hybrid. I would say, we are planning to
be stable, you know, then clearly over time, the idea is to increase the level of hybrid
based on the increase in the size of the business. But as we go into, let's say, next year, the
idea will be to keep the amount of hybrid ﬂat, which means since the business is going to
grow automatically, that would also mean in reality, a lower leverage ratio. So from that
point of view, you should expect stability on the amount and leverage ratio, which is
slightly decreasing. And then, you know, we usually wait a couple of years, and then we
do again a bump in the hybrid in order to to keep a certain level. So that's the way we are
thinking about our hybrid issuance and our leverage ratio. But as you think about the next
12 months, so you can expect that we are not going to be particularly active on increasing
the amount of hybrid.
On your question about the USA, as you know, fundamentally, and as you said the
business is high quality, we might be looking at the insurance, also of ﬁxing this annuity
and also VA, so both. That can be depend clearly on what kind of oﬀer we get. We can go
down both routes, but we are also believing that there is a possibility to monetize value
on ﬁxing this annuity side. So that's deﬁnitely an area where we are taking a look if we can
do anything there. So that's something that we might have also some news in the not far
future.
And then the other question was on capital eﬃciency. Sure, if you talk to our CFO, our
CFO is always going to be for capital eﬃciency. So the idea clearly is not to around with a
solvency ratio which is -- look, if you ask me, I'm really not in the camp of let's advertise
the solvency ratio 220%, 230%. I don't think this is healthy. So I'm not in the competition
to add a higher solvency ratio of the industry. There is no other way I think about solvency.
I believe capital is something that you need to add enough capital to be sustainable, to
be resilient, but you want also to add the least amount of capital in order to be as eﬃcient
as you can.
So from that point of view, as we are working to also reduce volatility of the ratio, if we can
bring this -- our target level down or the axis that we keep over the target level down, that
is something that I would deﬁnitely say will be a success, and that is also something that
we are working on. And some of the back book transaction might help in that direction.
Not necessarily any transaction in the US would not necessarily help from a volatility point
of view, but transaction in Europe, that can bring down the volatility and then they can
also help us to bring down the target level, to bring down the axis that we keep on top of
the target level.

All right. Then we will take the next question from Dom O'Mahony. [ph] Dom, go ahead,
please.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Dom O'Mahony
Hi, folks. Thank you for taking the questions, and a couple from me. One, just turning
back to the Asset Management business, and I guess this is a broader point about
performance. And you might have thought from the outside that the reduction in bond
yields, notwithstanding the recent increase, might make ﬁxed income a bit more
challenging to play as an active manager, given that the fees consume more of the yield.
That hasn't seemed to [ph] happen to you. You have very strong mutual fund ﬂows and
ﬁxed income. Is that the sort of pressure that you're seeing across the industry? Or you're
just avoiding through up -- very good performance of funds? Or are there other factors to
think about in terms of why we should think that both ﬂows and revenue margins there
should be sustainable at this level?
And then the second question, and I hate to ask you a question about Structured Alpha,
and I understand there is nothing you can say about the speciﬁcs. But I wonder if you
could help us understand what the prerequisites would be setting a provision? Are there
any technical things that need to happen for you to be able to set a provision, maybe
requirements from an accounting perspective? Thank you.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yeah. Starting from the ﬁrst question about our performance in Asset Management. Yeah,
it is a ﬁnancial performance clearly. So when you look at the performance at PIMCO, but
also AGI, by the way, it's deﬁnitely a very good performance, and this is deﬁnitely helping
to sustain very healthy ﬂows. And you can think also especially, where rates are very low, it
is really critical to have somebody that can produce some extra yield is even more
relevant. So from that point of view, that's deﬁnitely the component number one. But then

Page 17 of 23

FINAL

I would not underestimate also the distribution reach. AGI has a very strong distribution,
especially in Europe, and also in the US, the distribution strength of PIMCO is pretty
strong. They have also invested in quality distribution.
So it's a combination of performance and that's the primary driver. But then I would not
underplay also this distribution aspect. But that is also the reason why -- as I was saying
before we are not necessarily looking to run these companies at the lowest possible cost
income ratio because we want to invest also in distribution. We want to invest in
technology. So that's part of the equation. You know that you cannot aspire to have a very
strong and positive ﬂows, but then you are going to be basically keeping these
companies under investors. So when you put all together, anyway, you can see a very
strong picture.
On the litigation side, on the Structured Alpha side, at the end of the day, all what you
need is to have more clarity and time in order to get to a better understanding of what
possible range might be that's what we need.

now.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Thank you. Thanks, Giulio, for taking my question. Just -- so one question, just back to -sorry, the AGI. I mean, it is remarkable we're talking about AGI. You said what EUR40
billion odd [ph] ﬂows since supposedly this event took place. But I mean going forward,
do you think that when you said 62 to 63 [ph] kind of cost income ratio, does that
consider the risks of greater compliance cost or other regulatory potential burdens? And
I'm just curious as this thought is somewhat in the number of should we think about that
going forward?
Second thing is on the Life side, and I'm just zooming in on the capital-eﬃcient products
which obviously, the headlines are very appealing, 350 range, [ph] for a while used to be
200 plus, 225 [ph] sort of range of operating proﬁt. But I also note that pre-DAC, the
number isn't that high in the capital-eﬃcient product segment. And now it's two quarters
in a row that pre-DAC was far lower than the headlines, how should we be thinking
broadly about capital-eﬃcient products? And whether we are now at the cusp of this 330,
350 [ph] kind of quarterly run rate? Or should I be reading more into this pre-DAC
number, and then thinking that we've had a few lucky quarters in capital-eﬃcient
products? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Okay. So the ﬁrst question was about AGI. And whether I think the 62, 63 cost income
ratio could be much diﬀerent, if we have to step up our compliance results. I don't think
see so. In the same sense, I don't believe that we have any particular compliance issue or
control issue at AGI. So from that -- I can see that maybe here and there, we need to
strengthen a few things, but I don't believe this is going to be a primary driver for the
cost-income ratio with AGI moving forward. So I would say that 63 cost income ratio
should be achievable, even if we need to step up our compliance eﬀort.

A - Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

Yeah. Yes. And Vinit, if I may just add one comment here. I think it would be rather the
opposite because one big driver for this cost income ratio reduction is complexity
reduction on the product side among other things. And with less complexity, it would be
much easier to keep things under control.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

So -- and then coming to the question about the CR. [ph] First of all, I don't think we had
just a few lucky quarters. So I would say that we should see a good development of our
production, also our operating proﬁt in CR. One thing to keep in mind is there is a special
eﬀect in the way we are calculating operating proﬁt on -- in Germany because basically,
you need to do -- we do a (inaudible) for GAAP. And when you do the (inaudible) for
GAAP, we apply basically 90% policyholder on the (inaudible) but in reality, when you
look at the statutory accounting, you have a 50% policyholder set on the acquisition costs.
So you get basically technically speaking, sort of acquisition cost drag. And since that's
the area where Allianz revenue is [ph] growing then you get this acquisition cost drag into
the numbers of CR.
So from that point of view, as this business, let's put it this way, is maturing, we are going
to see in reality, higher growth of -- even higher growth of the proﬁt in CR. But I would say
that the ratio is pretty clear, so from that point of view, you're going to see how the
contribution of this business is going to grow also in terms of operating proﬁt over time.

Thank you very much. It's a big privilege. So two questions. One is really, really tricky one
and you might have answered that, and then I have another. So, on the tricky one, there
was a lovely dinner yesterday organized by one of your peers, actually. And clearly, or I
could interpret that the investment they made in bringing all their guys together in
London, saying that they're the new Allianz. Is that a potential concern for you that you
know as a result of all these things, your rating might sustainably be lower which would
kind of reduce the pool of deals you can do in all sorts old fashion? I don't know, to build
the consequences, something basically asking for this Structured Alpha.
And then the kind of geek question is that, so you're now into the agreements [ph] for

Sure. And relative to access eﬀectively, my interpretation saying we have a new Allianz.
We have new guys who are going to deliver and look at us, we are shiny when you -obviously, it's going well for us, which basically means that the rating could improve and
they can then consider deals which are more expensive and relative you might like a little
bit, and therefore that could reduce the opportunities you might see in terms of deals you
would. Your cost of capital goes up, so your pool of deals reduces a little bit. Is that a kind
of broader concern considering Structured Alpha?

Okay, got it. So I never talk about peers, so I don't have any comment to make, and I wish
everybody well. And on the other question, the geek question. So reinsurance, I will say
the following. We have been looking at our reinsurance structure because clearly, we
know also that there would be an increase in premium -- reinsurance premium coming
our way. So we have looked at diﬀerent reinsurance structures, but at the end of the day,
we achieved the conclusion, our program is pretty good, so we are comfortable with the
program. We might be doing some tweaking to the aggregate level, so there is more
about the attachment point and the capacity, but fundamentally, we are not changing our
insurance structure.
From a pricing point of view, I would say, we are generally a very good account, so from
that point of view, yes, we expect to see some increases. But in our case, since we have a
good account increase, it should be more moderate. And anyway, these are also
increases that clearly we're going to put into our calculation for our premium.
So from that point of view, the answer to your question is, we have analyzed diﬀerent
options, but eventually, it's going to be pretty much business as usual with respect to our

reinsurance program, just with some tweaking. And right now, we are going by the way
through the negotiation, so let's see what comes out of the negotiation.

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Sorry. Okay. Sorry. I just had two questions which I didn't ask at that time. One is on the
pricing trend. I mean, I was a bit surprised to see AGCS report a lower 3Q pricing. I think
it was about 9% of the 15% advantage. [ph] I mean is it driven by some of the fronting
business noise because otherwise in the market, everybody is talking about some
reduction but not such a reduction. So any comments on that, please?
And secondly, just on the P&C ordinary investment income. The private equity continues
to be a strong complement or supporting complement. And is there are any better view
now whether this is sort of cost sustainable? Or what should -- how should we think about
that? Thank you.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

So starting from AGCS, yes, okay. The growth rate of AGCS was also partially because of
fronting. If you adjust rate anyway, we had a high single-digit growth rate. This is also
consistent by the way with the change in renewal that you see. And your point about
people seeing some reduction in pricing strength, that's to a certain degree true. So if
you see our number is 15% for the change in renewal, that number was I believe slightly
above 20%, last year. So there is a little bit of decrease but it's still a very healthy
environment, and you need to that this rate increase is accumulating, right. So the
accumulate compared to what we got at the end of 2019, what we got throughout the
course of 2020, and then you have also clearly the rate increases we are getting as we
speak. So there is a decrease rate increases, but still, very healthy rate increases, and think
about the accumulation eﬀect, this is deﬁnitely very healthy for the combined ratio.

Otherwise, with respect to the investment income, what we are seeing right now
compared to last year is more dividend coming also from private equity funds that we
have. So this is deﬁnitely helping the interest and similar income. As we move forward
into 2022, '23, we still expect to see some pressure because of the low-interest-rate
environment. But clearly, this pressure is diminishing over time because positive portfolio
has already been turned into the lower interest rate environment.
So from that point of view, I wouldn't say that we have a bottom right now, so we are still
going to see potentially some pressure, but not to the same degree that we saw over the
last three, four years. So if you remember, a few years ago, our investment income was
EUR3 billion. Now we are closer to EUR2.5 billion. We are now going to loss EUR400
million [ph] of investment income in the next three years, so we might be a little bit lower
than the EUR2.5 billion, but not signiﬁcantly lower than this. So I would say that the worst
is behind us.
