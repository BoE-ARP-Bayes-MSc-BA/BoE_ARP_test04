Thank you, Marie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.

Bloomberg Transcript

We had a good Third Quarter from just about every perspective. Earnings were solid,
driven by excellent underwriting results. On a consolidated basis, our premium revenue
grew by approximately 12% on both gross and net basis, although there were noteworthy
items that I will get into in a few minutes.
On an operating basis, we earned $1.10 per share for the quarter, which produced an
annualized 11% return on equity for the Third Quarter. On a net basis -- on a net income
basis, Arch earned $0.80 per share, which corresponds to a 9% annualized return on
equity.
Reported net income was adversely affected by foreign exchange losses. These losses
rose from the quarterly effects of evaluating our insurance liabilities that are settled in
foreign currencies. As you may know, changes in the value of investments used to fund
these liabilities are reflected as a direct change in shareholders' equity, and accordingly,
foreign-exchange movements did not have a significant effect on book value per share.
Our reported underwriting results in the Second Quarter were solid, as reflected by a
combined ratio of 86% that were aided by better-than-average performance on cat
underwriting and continued favorable prior-year reserve development.
Net investment income per share on a reported basis declined to $0.49 per share,
reflecting the effects of lower yields available in the financial markets and our total return
approach to investments.
Our operating cash flow for the quarter was $239 million, a $96 million decrease from the
same period last year, substantially due to higher paid losses, including claim payments on
prior-year cat events.

FINAL

The total return of the investment portfolio was 143 basis points, inclusive of fluctuations
in foreign exchange rates. Our book value per common share increased by 4.2%, primarily
due to our operating performance.
During the Third Quarter, the insurance market continued to attain rate increases,
although they moderated somewhat relative to the first half of this year. In our US
insurance operations, which gives us a good indication because we have more granular
data, we experienced rate increases in the quarter that provided 170 basis points of
expected margin improvement. This is as compared to business return of a year ago.
The movement of business from the admitted market back to the E&S market continued.
On prior calls, we mentioned our expansion into the binding authority insurance business
that caters to small E&S accounts written through the wholesale distribution channel. This
group is off to an excellent start. They are producing an increasing level of business and
have begun to leverage Arch distribution platform and relationships to access more
opportunities.
In our view, on an absolute basis, while most longtail casualty business still require further
rate improvements to meet our return requirements, some segments are approaching
rate adequacy.

Bloomberg Transcript

With regard to new versus renewal pricing, based on our monitoring systems, we saw no
changes on a relative basis from what we have reported in the last quarter.
On the reinsurance side of the business, in terms and conditions we see pressure in three
areas. First, in property cat, alternative capacity is putting pressure on rates. Second,
although the profitability of primary insurance has improved, cedents has -- have pressed
successfully for additional ceding commissions, generally in the range of 1 to 2 points, so
the improved economics remain with the primary insurers. Finally, cedents are moving to
excess of loss instead of pro rata coverage, which increases the risk to reinsurance of
arbitrage by cedents.
Net written premiums of the reinsurance segment grew by 24%, while the insurance
segment increased their net written premiums by 4%. The increase in the reinsurance
segment stems primarily from one significant treaty. As was the case in 202 [ph] and 203
[ph], certain cedents, based on their financial conditions, are looking to the reinsurance
market to provide capital. The treaty I just mentioned fell into this category, and we
recorded approximately $55 million of written premium in the Third Quarter of 2013,
including the transfer of approximately $40 million of an earned premium.
In addition, as you may know from press reports, we entered into a transaction with
Ethniki, the insurance subsidiary of the National Bank of Greece. Although the reserves
reinsure on a nominal basis were in excess of EUR400 million, under US GAAP this
transaction will be accounted on a deposit basis. Due to the long-term nature of the
liabilities, the expected margin will be earned over several years and is not expected to
have a material effect on any individual year.

FINAL

The insurance segment had a net written premium growth, predominantly emanating
from their US operations, which represent approximately 75% of their worldwide volume
this quarter. The US operations grew net written premium by nearly 15%, partially
offsetting strategic reductions elsewhere in the world. The US growth came
predominantly from increases in exposures on existing accounts, new business, including
our contract binding business, and, of course, rate increases.
Groupwide, on an expected basis we continue to believe the ROE on the business we
underwrote this year will produce an underwriting year ROE in the range of 11% to 13%.
Let me now update you on the status of our previously announced agreement to acquire
certain assets of PMI and CMG. We are continuing to work on obtaining the regulatory and
other approvals required to complete the transaction. As part of that process, we are
continuing our discussions with the GSEs in order to obtain their approval of Arch as an
eligible mortgage insurance carrier.
This process takes time. If the required approvals are obtained, it is expected that the
transaction will close near the end of 2013 or during very early part of 2014.

Bloomberg Transcript

Before I turn it over to Mark, discuss our PMLs, it is worth noting that our cat PML
aggregates reflect business bound through October 1, while the premium numbers
included in our financial statements are through September 30.
As of October 1, 2013, our largest 250-year PMLs for a single event increased slightly to
$868 million in the Northeast, or approximately 17% of our common shareholders' equity,
while Gulf PMLs increased somewhat to $736 million, where our Florida Tri-County PML
now stands at $650 million.
I will now turn it over to Mark to comment further on our financial results, and then after
Mark, we will take your questions. Mark?

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Thank you, Dinos. Good morning, all.
The consolidated combined ratio for this quarter was 86% even, with 2.5 points of current
accident year cat-related events, which are net of reinsurance and reinstatement
premiums, compared to the 2012 Third Quarter combined ratio of 90.2%, which reflected
3.7 points of cat-related events.
Losses in the 2013 Third Quarter from catastrophic events totaled $19.5 million, emanating
from a variety of events around the world. The 2013 Third Quarter consolidated combined
ratio also reflected 8.2 points of prior-year net favorable development, again net of
reinsurance and related acquisition adjustments, compared to 7.1 points of prior-period
favorable development on the same basis in the 2012 Third Quarter.

FINAL

This results in a 91.7% current accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats, for the
Third Quarter of 2013, compared to a 93.6% accident quarter combined ratio in the Third
Quarter of 2012. The 2013 accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats, for the
reinsurance segment was 83.7%, compared to 84.3% in the 2012 Third Quarter.
In the insurance segment, 2013 accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats, improved
to 97.0%, compared to an accident quarter combined ratio of 99.6% in the Third Quarter
of 2012.
Approximately 80% of the net favorable development in this quarter was from the
reinsurance segment, with approximately 60% of that due to net favorable development
on short-tailed lines concentrated in the more recent underwriting years. The other 40%
of the reinsurance segment's net favorable development was attributable to longer-tailed
lines spread evenly over all underwriting years 2010 and prior. The remaining aggregate
20% of net favorable development was attributable to the insurance segment and was
primarily driven by short-tailed lines from the more recent accident years.

Bloomberg Transcript

Similar to prior periods, approximately 69% of our consolidated $7.1 billion of total net
reserves for loss and loss adjustment expense are IBNR or additional case reserves, which
is a fairly consistent ratio across both the reinsurance and insurance segments. The
insurance segment accounts for 63% of total net loss and loss expense reserves, and the
reinsurance segment, the balance of 37%.
On a consolidated basis, the Third Quarter of 2013 expense ratio was 32.3%, compared
to the prior year's comparative quarter of 30.9%. This 140 basis-point increase is driven by
a 150 basis-point rise in the acquisition expense ratio, while the operating expense ratio
dropped 10 basis points.
The acquisition expense is a combination of higher ceding commissions on proportional
treaties within the reinsurance segment, along with some lift in insurance segment
premium taxes and ceded treaty commission adjustments on older years.
The insurance segment expense ratio went up 50 basis points from 32.5% to 33%
quarter over comparative quarter, with the acquisition ratio up 120 basis points, while the
operating expense ratio dropped 70 basis points. As stated, the rise in the acquisition
ratio was driven by increases in contingent commissions on ceded treaties, along with
increased premium taxes.
The reinsurance segment expense ratio went up 280 basis points from 28.5% to 31.3%
quarter over comparative quarter, with the acquisition ratio up 180 basis points and the
operating expense ratio up 100 basis points. The acquisition increase was due to a
change in product mix, along with higher ceding commissions on quota share treaties. The
operating expense ratio reflects incremental expenses due to certain platform
expansions, as commented on last quarter.
Our US insurance operations achieved a 4.7% effective rate increase this quarter, which
translates into the margin expansion of 170 basis points that Dinos referenced earlier. This

FINAL

is a 20 basis-point improvement over the 150 basis-point expansion achieved during the
Second Quarter of 2013, driven mostly by changes in mix.
These figures represent the excess of written effective rate increases over estimated
loss trend and provide continuing evidence of improving market conditions. This average
range from having some margin contraction in some units, such as miscellaneous facilities
healthcare and some professional liability areas, to large improvements in our private,
mostly primary executive assurance growth and middle-market operation.
Other areas of note in margin expansion were E&S casualty and our program businesses.
Property lines experienced low single-digit rate increases again this quarter, and
therefore, like last quarter, did not experience additional margin expansion.
Specialty casualty, workers' compensation, and national account businesses have now
experienced 10 successive quarters of rate increases, whereas our executive assurance,
middle market, and alternative asset protection books, along with our retail construction
unit, have each experienced nine consecutive quarters of rate increases. Furthermore, our
excess workers' compensation and umbrella books have now enjoyed eight consecutive
quarters.

Bloomberg Transcript

As always, we make capital allocation decisions based on our view of the absolute returns
and not relative improvements alone. For example, although our insurance property
business did not experience margin expansion this quarter, we continue to estimate
healthy returns for this line.
The ratio of net written premiums to gross written premiums in the quarter on a
consolidated basis was 80.9%, compared to 80.6% a year ago. In the reinsurance
segment, the net to gross ratio was 95% in 2013 Third Quarter, driven by an increased
use of retro covers, compared to 97.2% a year ago.
The insurance segment was essentially unchanged at a 73.5% ratio as they maintain their
ongoing strategy to grow the less volatile, smaller count businesses in the current
environment and reduce exposure in higher-severity businesses.
The total return on our investment portfolio was a reported positive 143 bps in the 2013
Third Quarter, primarily driven by equities, high-yield bonds, and alternative investments.
Excluding foreign exchange, total return was 84 basis points.
It's worth noting that equities and alternative investments account for 14.9% of our $13.3
billion of investable assets as of September 30 of this year, which is identical to June 30,
but higher than the 11.5% allocation a year ago. This allocation on a portfolio basis has the
potential to ameliorate future impacts at our investment portfolio from rising interest
rates and widening credit spreads.
Our embedded pretax book yield before expenses was 2.41% as of September 30, 2013,
compared to 2.43% at June 30, 2013, while the duration of the portfolio shortened
Page 6 of 25

FINAL

slightly to 2.83 years, which continues to reflect our conservative position on duration in
the current yield environment.
Reported net investment income in the quarter was $66.1 million, or $0.49 per share,
versus $73.2 million, or $0.53 per share, in the 2012 Third Quarter. This difference is
attributable to a reduction of interest income from fixed-income securities and an
increase in investment expenses relative to Third Quarter of 2012. During 2013, however,
fixed-income earnings have been relatively flat each sequential quarter, as have
investment expenses.
Our effective tax rate on pretax operating income for the Third Quarter of 2013 was an
expense of 5.6%, compared to an expense of 3.1% in the Third Quarter of 2012.
Approximately 41% of this Third Quarter tax expense, or $3.8 million, is associated with
catch-up of the first two quarters to this higher effective rate. And $2 million of
withholdings on equities, tax withholdings on equity securities.
The September 30 year-to-date effective tax rate on operating income, excluding some
minor discrete items, is 3.3%. Fluctuations in effective tax rate can result from variability in
the relative mix of income or loss reported by jurisdictions.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our total capital was $5.84 billion at the end of this quarter, up 3.7% relative to June 30
and up 4.9% relative to year-end 2012. We repurchased only 1.3 million of share value
during the quarter and 57.8 million year-to-date as of September 30. We have $712 million
of authorization remaining for additional share repurchases.
Our debt-to-capital ratio remains low at 6.8% and debt plus hybrids represents only 12.4%
of our total capital, which continues to give us significant financial flexibility. We continue to
estimate having capital in excess of our targeted capital position.
Book value per share was $38.34 at the end of this quarter, up 4.2% versus June 30 and
5.9% relative to December 30 of 2012. This change in book value per share this quarter is
led by the Company's continued strong underwriting results.
So with these introductory comments, we are now pleased to take your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Michael Nannizzi, Goldman Sachs.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

I guess I just had one question on your decision to pull back on property cat. I know you
have talked about it in the past. We have seen a lot of other folks increasing property cat
exposure this quarter. What do you see as the opportunity set there, and why is it that

Page 7 of 25



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2013-10-29

you're choosing to pull back in that business while maybe others are seeing an
opportunity to grow?

FINAL

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

You know, at the end of the day when we write any line of business, including cat, we look
at opportunity by opportunity, contract by contract, and we have an expectation based on
the volatility of that business what the proper return should be.
And our cat teams determined that in some areas, the erosion was more than we can
stomach, so for that reason, we let some of that business go. But we are still bullish on
the cat business. I don't want to give you a misleading conclusion. We still like it, but we
are cautious about what our expected return should be and we continue to price it with
the expectation that we're going to have very high returns because of the nature of the
business and the volatility that brings. Mark, you have anything (multiple speakers)

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

No, you nailed it. Yes.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Are you seeing pressure from other sources ameliorate now in terms of alternative
capital? Are you expecting that to change between now and 1/1, or how should we think
about that?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

I think it is -- I'm not telling you anything that the market doesn't know. The additional
capital entering the market has put pressure on rates in the 10% to 15% rate reduction.
That by itself has not really changed significantly the prospects of profitability, but in
certain segments, like on the low end of the curve, because especially the unrated
vehicles that they have to collateralize the limits, they are looking for the high rate on line
business, which, of course, is on the front end of the curve.
In that part of the curve, I think, we don't find the returns attractive. Some of those
returns, they have moved into the sub two-digit, high single digits. For some investors,
high single digits for the cat business might be an acceptable return. I can tell you it's not
for Arch, and so if we had business that it was on that low end of the curve and we're not
getting the proper return, that's the business that you let go.
And of course, that will magnify, also, because the higher-rate online business also have
big premium numbers, so if you don't do one or two of those, in essence you are not
using a lot of PML, but you are losing a lot of premium. But the profitability is not there.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Great. Thank you, Dinos. Then, I guess one question for Mark, just on the investment
portfolio. It looked like the turnover was pretty elevated again this quarter. I remember

Page 8 of 25



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2013-10-29

there was one sleeve of the portfolio, I think it was the treasury piece, that was turning
over multiple times, as opposed to the portfolio itself turning over a significant amount.
Can you update us on what might have driven that turnover this quarter and whether that
should continue?

FINAL

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

It's fairly similar, to your observation, to prior quarters. And I think what you are seeing is
taking some realized gains with the expectation of improved yields on those, given where
some of those purchases were made throughout the quarter. But the rate of turnover is
approximately the same.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

And you expect that should continue from here?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

It's hard to say, based on what happens in the markets. Just like in the insurance business,
we are going to react to what is there, so it depends on what happens with interest rates.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And don't forget, our approach to investments is total returns. So if we believe that
turning over the portfolio, factoring in friction or cost in doing it, it will be beneficial to us,
we'll do it.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it, great. Thank you very much.

Operator
Greg Locraft, Morgan Stanley.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Thanks and nice quarter. Wanted to just ask about capital deployment. I think you guys are
pretty explicit on when you like to buy back stock, and at 1.5 book, it doesn't seem that it
fits the grid that well, given prospective ROEs. How should we be thinking about excess
capital as it continues to build, within the context of your corporation and the future
periods?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

The first thing you ought to think is our ability to put that capital to work in the
marketplace, because that's what we have been hired to do as managers. And hopefully,
by year-end we close the MI deal.

Page 9 of 25



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2013-10-29

In addition to that, I don't know if you have been following that space, not only there is
opportunities for us that they're going to come with PMI and CMG, but also there is
transactions in the market that both Fannie and Freddie, they are testing in putting more
of the credit business to the private sector, and we intend to be a participant of that.

FINAL

So the prospects of us actually deploying more capital and utilizing in our business,
including the mortgage insurance space, it's very high.
Also, as you have seen with the two transactions that we have done in the Third Quarter,
the Ethniki transaction, which is significant, EUR400 million of reserves, and the Tower
Group transaction, we are seeing other transactions of similar nature and similar size. I'm
not predicting anything, these things are lumpy. Sometimes you are successful in landing
them and sometimes you are not, but I am optimistic in utilize more of our capital in the
business going forward.
Absent of that, we will refer back to share repurchases and we will not rule out an
extraordinary dividend, if that's appropriate to return capital to shareholders. We will be
good stewards of capital. We don't try to hoard it, but I can tell you when I look into the
future, I see opportunities, so I'm not going to be too anxious to let that capital go right
now.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Okay, okay, very thorough answer. Just one follow-up on that. So it sounds like the core
business is where you want to deploy it and you are seeing good opportunities, so in a
way, we should be growing the core faster, prospectively, (multiple speakers)

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Given the market opportunities -- don't forget, the mortgage insurance space is going to
eat up some of our capital. We've got to fund those, and like I said, the opportunity is not
only with what we are going to write direct through PMI and CMG, it's also these
transactions, the bulk transactions, that the GSEs are putting into the marketplace.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Yes, yes, okay, good. Then, you actually had mentioned buybacks ahead of a special
dividend. Would you reverse that at this particular price? Again, I think you guys are
somewhat valuation sensitive on the buyback front?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yes. We are. We are looking at kind of a light post, a guiding post, that says we will
recover it within three years is the right mix. But we still believe there is a lot of intrinsic
value in the Company, so it will not stop us driven by our stock at 150 [ph] multiple.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Page 10 of 25



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2013-10-29

Okay. Okay. Then last, just on the special dividend, it sounds -- you brought it up. You guys
don't like a regular dividend. How do you compare and contrast a special versus a regular,
and what caused you to do a special?

FINAL

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

A regular dividend is not a way to manage capital, right? This is a capital-intensive
business. In the soft cycle, you have a lot of excess and you've got to return it to
shareholders. And when things get into a very good cycle, you probably -- you can utilize
as much capital as you can get your hands on.
So by introducing an ordinary dividend of 1% or 2%, it is not really going to manage your
capital. It might expand your shareholder basis, because some funds might not invest
unless you're paying a dividend. But we don't think in those terms. We don't try to make
actions because they're going to be a reaction by investors.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our focus is what is the proper way to run the Company. How the capital structure needs
to behave, depending if we're in a soft or in a hard cycle. How much leverage we have in
the capital structure. All those thoughts go into it, and how much excess capital we need
to keep, because we got our high ratings and also we want to have the financial flexibility,
because when the markets turn, they turn very quickly.
This gradual improvement in the market is not what I will call a hard turn to a hard market.
But if you have continuation of pressures as we have seen with some small companies
because of either reserve deficiencies or other issues they have, if that for some reason
accelerates, you're going to see a hard market. We don't see it in the next year or two,
but we always -- our responsibility is to be prepared for it. And we take that all into
consideration before we make these decisions.
So we never believe on an ordinary dividend. Now, if you have excess capital and let's say
you believe that the marketplace is not giving you the right multiple, you might consider
the extraordinary dividend because it's a quick way to return capital to shareholders and
let them decide what to do with it.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Greg, I would just add to Dinos. You get a high-level look at it, but any special dividend
would be the excess over all contemplated uses.
When Dinos says he is more optimistic, it is because marketplace opportunities, we have
higher odds in our minds that these things might close. So a special dividend would just
be any potential uses outside of that, plus the guardian of our high ratings, if there is any
left over, only that would be considered discussion worthy.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Yes, great. Yes, it's very clear that you will be really busy building out the core, as you have
stated -- the core underwriting operations, so that's great. Thanks for the thorough

Arash Soleimani, KBW.

Q - Arash Soleimani

{BIO 18869554 <GO>}

Just a couple quick ones here. First, you had mentioned earlier on the call that you are
seeing better economics on the primary side, so just one question there is to what extent
are you benefiting from the primary economics there and to what extent are those
economics then pressuring your reinsurance side? I am just qualitatively trying to assess
the net impact on the overall business.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

The way I will answer is 60% of our business is primary, 40% is reinsurance. We don't have
any target. It can switch, it depends on market conditions.

Bloomberg Transcript

What we see today, and it's fair to say I think we had phenomenally good results in the
reinsurance market, and that is not deteriorating. What I am saying is basically we're not
getting incremental improvement on the reinsurance sector because when we talk to
cedents, they have seen the improvement on the insurance side, they want to keep it. It is
sticking to their ribs, not ours.
But having said that, it doesn't mean that transactions that do the worst than they were a
year ago. They just don't have the improvement. All the improvement stays with the
primary.
On our insurance group, as you have seen from the numbers that Mark mentioned, we
have seen their margin and their combined ratio on an accident-year basis coming down,
and as the market improves, we expect that to continue.
So on the 6% of our business, we are getting the benefit of it. On the reinsurance, I think
we are remaining steady. The reason that we haven't changed the 11% to 13% ROE, when
you put everything in the hopper, we see improvement on the insurance side, we see
steadiness on the reinsurance, but we are losing a bit on the cat business from a margin
point of view, plus we are losing a bit on the investment income side. So when you put it
all together, I didn't see a reason for us to go beyond the 11% to 13%, because that's what
the numbers indicate.

FINAL

I'll give you the short answer. The FHA is in the process of coming up with new capital
requirements. We know that the capital requirements are going to be somewhere
between 15 times to 20 times value at risk. So we don't know exactly where they are
going to come, but basically we believe the business is still very attractive from the low
end of that range to the high end of that range.
And I don't know how long the transition period is going to be, especially for some of the
existing mortgage insurers who right now, they are not meeting those thresholds from a
capital point of view. So there might be a transition period, a year or two for people to
come within those ranges, but we don't know that yet. We are waiting for the regulator to
come with the requirements.

The first question is on the primary insurance operations. That's grown at a healthy pace
of 14% for the US. Just curious as to what is happening there, and also wanted to know -you mentioned that more lines are reaching adequate profitability. Do you think that you
could open the spigot next year and write more business?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Growing at double digits in the US, that's pretty good growth. And like I said, it's not only
coming from -- first of all, some of our customers, they are seeing a slight improvement in
their business, so the exposure bit goes up, so you get a little more premium. On top of
it, you have the rate increases. That helps.
And of course, we are gaining a bit of a market share. And the market share we are
gaining predominantly is coming in the small E&S market through our binding authority
business and, I think, in our program business. A lot of our program administrators, they
have seen both growth in exposure units and very good rate increases. So the
combination of those gives you that.
Now, we expect that to continue, but you never know. The insurance business has always
been very, very competitive, so I don't know what the competition is going to do. If there
is no changes and the trajectory continues to go, we expect to continue to grow,
especially in the US.
That's not the same story in other parts of the world. As a matter of fact, you saw that we
decided to shrink in some other parts of the world, the UK and Australia and continental
Europe in some lines, professional liability lines and D&O lines, et cetera.

So we will look at it. We will look at the profitability, and then, growth is not what drives us.
I think bottom-line results is what drives us. But we are not bashful. If we see opportunity,
we will seek it and we will go out and write the business. Go ahead, Mark.

FINAL

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Just as a follow-up to Dinos' comments, I would note that there are some similarities in
the two major areas in the US where there was growth, one, programs, and the second,
contract binding, as Dinos pointed out.
First off, they are all -- both smaller accounts. They get a good overall spread. It's more
stable. It's less volatile. As a result, we keep a massive amount of that net, so compared
to other lines of business that might be getting similar rate increases, this will stick to the
ribs more, a lot more, than they would.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure, that's helpful. Dinos, you sounded more bullish about reinvesting the money into
business. And yet, it seems on the P&C side, there are not as many opportunities. So am I
reading this correctly that you're looking more at the mortgage insurance and these
Fannie/Freddie transactions and one-off transactions that we can't really see where you
propose to deploy the capital?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, you got it absolutely right. You continue to do your homework, what can I tell you.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

. All right, great. And one, I think, for Mark. Actually, Mark, the margins are quarter over
quarter in the reinsurance segment. I mean, the loss ratio went up a tad. Just curious
whether that was because of the new quota share reinsurance transaction.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Good question. It had a marginal impact. I'd prefer to look at the combined ratio impact
more than each piece, but happy to address that.
On the acquisition side, as we commented, the acquisition quarter over quarter was up
180 basis points, but if you control for that large transaction, it would be 130 basis points.
It was a 50 basis-point impact on the net acquisition ratio, but you really can't stop there
because you got to look because of the different premium base and what it does on your
operating expense ratio, and that really takes it back to another 60 basis points the other
way.
And there is a point difference because of just pure premium size and where the loss
ratio is on that, as well.

Page 14 of 25



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2013-10-29

So on a combined ratio point of view, it's hardly noticeable. On a component point of
view, it had 50 basis points on acquisition. So depending on where you're looking, that is
the answer.

A couple of numbers questions, probably for Mark. Other expenses were well below
previous-quarter levels, and also, any equity-method investment returns were also -- I
think the absolute return levels were healthy, but also well below prior quarters. Any
guidance on how to think about those going forward?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Mike, I will let Mark answer it, but I know numbers, too. I don't

A - Mark Lyons

Dinos wants to jump in on numbers questions and I want to jump in on underwriting
questions. .

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Go ahead, Mark.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

So first, just a clarification of your question. When you said expenses, are you talking
investment expenses or operating expense?

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

The operating expenses, the other expense line item. I think it was $7.8 million?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Okay. Well you will -- I think the insurance group, it was -- I mean, it was an improvement in
the operating ratio, but that was really driven by the denominator more than anything
else. There wasn't big movement in it.
Where you saw some movement was in the reinsurance group because of some platform
expansions, and as we have said in some other quarters, there is always some

Page 15 of 25



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2013-10-29

differences in quarter to quarter because of equity and how equity is recognized.
Especially with retirement-eligible people, it creates some differences.

FINAL

And there is a little bit, of course, of some front-ended mortgage-related acquisition
expenses that hit prior to receiving the premium would be in this quarter.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

We have no revenue yet from that, but we're building a sales force. We're building -- so
we are a little bit ahead on the MI because when that transaction closed, we want to be
able to hit the road running, not putting our shorts in the locker room.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Got it. And on the equity method investment income?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

When it comes to that, there is not a ton that really jumps into my mind. That stuff from
quarter to quarter can be all over the place. So we do various analysis, of course, on it, like
you might think, but it's really -- there is no underlying causative trends that would be
predictive if you are thinking in a forward sense.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So we should just think of it as alternative investments?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

You should look at it as pretty lumpy. You should expect it -- it is like D&O business. It is
going to be very, very lumpy. On a long-term basis, it's predictable. Quarter by quarter, it's
not.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. And last question. Could you clarify the ultimate size and duration of the Tower
Group arrangements, and is there any elements of first-mover advantage if that business
doesn't renew with the same party next year?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

The business is July on to year-end. So we don't know how much -- because of the
downgrade, we don't know how much they're going to write in the Fourth Quarter.
But in essence, it was the unearned premium reserve coming in, plus what they wrote in
the Third Quarter and then what they're going to write in the Fourth Quarter.
After that, it depends what they want to buy, if there is any opportunities to come into an
agreement on a going-forward basis, all that is up to future negotiations, et cetera. But
this transaction has that finality to it. It's July 1 to December 31 of this year, including the

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

I just wanted to talk about taxes a little bit. I listened to Mark's disclosure. I am trying to
understand what the true-up is, and is tax rate a little higher than it used to be, based on
where you are writing business, or am I just imagining things?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The interesting thing that I found out, once I took over this job, is how tax rates can move
really as a function of either where cats or where prior-period development winds up
being, by jurisdiction.
Now when you -- here is the big picture. The operations in the US on both the reinsurance
side and the insurance side are improving. We have been talking about that because of
the margin expansion, so that's naturally going to gravitate to US-based enterprises on
what remains on shore as being subject to tax.
In the quarter by itself, because of prior-period development, you got to -- you have to
look at more of the skin underneath the onions as to where the prior-period development
was coming from. When we look at -- it is always annualized. We never forecast priorperiod development on a go-forward basis. So when it actually emerges in the quarter
and we have to react to it, be cognizant of where it emanated from by jurisdiction and
give it the appropriate tax rate.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Okay. And so (multiple speakers)

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Let me give you an example. This way, you can focus on the example. If euro cat business
a year ago or two years ago, and for whatever reason, the reserves, they were higher
than needed, and now you're dropping those reserves in this quarter, that business will
show a lot of underwriting profit, and for that reason, you're going to pay the appropriate
tax because it is emanating from the US.
So just an example just to see as to how improvement in results and increased
profitability will increase the tax by depending where you are writing the business.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And so, as a proportion over time, would we expect if you guys are writing less
reinsurance next year that the tax rate is probably going to go up a little bit more?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

FINAL

Quite frankly, I can't really predict that. But let's follow on to Dinos' example, for a minute.
First off, we like to use the cat example, but cat is only a piece of the pie here. It is all lines
of business and what prior years the prior-period development is coming from.
So for example, next quarter, until the analyses are done I can't tell you what jurisdictions,
what lines of business, and what accident years are going to show pluses or minuses. I'm
not being coy. I'm just simply saying until the analysis is done, I can't tell you.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

But directionally, Josh, you are in the right queue because if a US operations, they're
improving in profitability, the tax pie is going to be higher.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. And when I think about mortgage insurance, the taxing arrangements, how is that
going to look on your tax rate going forward?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

No different than anything else we do in the US. We generate a lot of the business in the
US. We got to pay the US tax.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

But I think it will be reinsuring, trying to reinsure part of that back to Arch Reinsurance in
Bermuda?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yes, there is some arrangements with Arch Re and other reinsurance. I mean, we don't
have the entire reinsurance structure in front of us. We got to close a transaction, and
then we will see as to how we are going to reinsure the business.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

But I will remind you, though, since you are asking a tax question, we don't expect it to be
accretive until year three, maybe later into year three. So just keep that in mind.

Just one more follow-up on the mortgage insurer, and how you view that business, where
it could be comparatively to the rest of the business? Do you have lines on -- you would
cap it at certain size? What could it grow to as a percentage of the overall book that
you're doing now?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Listen, our expectations will be somewhere between 15% and 20% of what we do. It can
be as high as one-third. We won't let it go beyond that because, like I said, we're in three
businesses. We are in the reinsurance business, we're in the insurance business, and with
the mortgage insurance business, both insurance and reinsurance. So that's the three legs
of the stool.
It balances a little better. I used to balance on two legs, now I got three. But at the end of
the day, we like to be diversified. We don't like to overload -- I don't care if it's the cat
business or anything else -- and put a lot of our eggs in one basket.
And the way we structure that, if the opportunity is bigger, we have abilities to bring
additional investors into the mix and not own 100% of the mortgage insurance enterprise.
We can own 80% or 70% with other investors that showed interest to come and partner
with us.
So we got a lot of flexibility there. But my projections over the next three to five years,
think of it as 15% or 20% of our business. If things happen the way I envision them to
happen, that's what's going to be.

And would that be both on top line and operating income?

A - Dinos Iordanou

The top line is different than the P&C world. But the operating income, once it gets into
steady state, it's going to be there and might be a little north of that.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yes, I think on that range of the 15% to 20%, there are so many unknowns, but to the
extent that the core business gets harder quicker, of course there is going to be more
growth there relative to mortgage insurance that might be on the lower end of that 15%
range.
As the business stabilizes, though, which is the whole reason we went into it, it should
become a higher proportion of the net income.

Q - Charles Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Just a little different side, in the insurance business, in the professional lines, and
you may have said this earlier and I missed it, two out of the last three quarters, you are
seeing some pullback. Is this on the basis of pricing not being adequate where you guys
want? Is there some sort of change or anything different going on in why we are seeing
the contraction there?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

It's exactly -- it's really what you said and what we said the last couple of quarters. This
was a purposeful pull back out of the UK, continental Europe, and Australia, mostly
because we, through repeated attempts, could not get the rate that we were seeking.
And with that inability to do it, it doesn't make sense. So we purposely decided to pull
back, and you should expect to see that next quarter as well.

I guess in your press release here, you noted that the underlying loss ratio in the
reinsurance segment was helped by the mix of more mortgage insurance business. Is that
something you're going to look to do -- to continue doing next year? I just want to see if
you guys have the appetite -- risk appetite to do it on both the insurance and reinsurance
side going forward?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

FINAL

I don't totally understand your question. The mortgage insurance will be a low loss ratio
business, so as we write more of that, that will have the effect on the loss ratio on the
reinsurance business because that is where we book it.
But loss ratios for us, it depends always on our mix, and since we are a company who
changes mix more often than most, the loss ratios, that's why we focus more on
profitability and combined ratios, because the components of loss ratio, expense ratio,
they're going to be moving around, depending on what we do.
What's coming in for the reinsurance business is the transactions we did with one major
mortgage insurer that we wrote a big quota share for them for two years in a row. And
that, it will continue to have that effect of lowering the loss ratio on the reinsurance sector.
Now, the second part of your question was?

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

I am just trying to figure out if you're writing on the reinsurance side, it sounds -- I guess I
don't know the expense ratio, but it sounds profitable. Is it just the ramp why it will take
three years on the insurance side? Just trying to figure out why (multiple speakers)

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Because you got to build a portfolio, and as you are building the portfolio, it's how you are
earning the premium.
Don't forget, the mortgage insurance duration is about seven years, six, seven years, it
depends. Because these are loans that mandated to buy mortgage insurance that they
have less than 20% down payment, and some of these loans, once the amortization
schedule comes down and they have more than 20% equity in the house, they drop their
insurance because they are not required to have it. And for that reason -- but you're
getting a piece of the premium with every mortgage payment. So it will take you quite a
bit of time to ramp it up.
Now, when you do a reinsurance transaction, you are already reinsuring an existing book
that is already in steady state. That's the difference between the two.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Got you, great.

A - Mark Lyons

Great. Sure, go ahead. Okay, I guess, then just separately, just one numbers item. With
the -- I guess it looks like it's about -- just under $40 million of unearned premium left in
the Tower transaction, just want to figure out how we should think about how that will earn
over the next couple of quarters. Is it mainly for 4Q, 1Q, 2Q, and then a little bit in 3Q/4Q?
Is that the right way to think about it?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yes, the unearned premium depends when they wrote the business. They might have
wrote it in the First Quarter, Second Quarter, maybe even a bit in the Fourth Quarter of
2012.
So the Fourth Quarter in 2012 already earned fully, right? Because by the end of that Third
Quarter this year, it earned, so it earned in our Third Quarter this year. But what they
wrote in the first and Second Quarter will continue to earn until it cycles over to next year.
All the policies that they wrote, they are annual policies. So the earning pattern is 12
months.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

I will be quick. I only have two. First, on the Tower transaction, obviously you have that
downgrade clause. They have been downgraded. Why are you still committed to this
deal? Have you had any change of -- what would make you decide to back out, given they
have been downgraded?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

The business we underwrote, they were already wrote before they were downgraded,
the bulk of it, right? It is the unearned premium, plus what they did in the Third Quarter.
Page 22 of 25



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2013-10-29

We don't know how much they're going to write in the Fourth Quarter.

FINAL

But from an underwriting point of view, we don't expect them to deteriorate. They might
have less volume because some people might not, but they are not prepared as a
company to go and just start slashing rates. In the condition they are, they are going to try
to retain as much business as they have and they try to maintain the rating structures they
have.
So that's our expectation, that's part of our discussions we have with them. But the Fourth
Quarter business, highly unpredictable as to how much is it going to be. We were
originally estimating about $17 million, $18 million for the Fourth Quarter. It might be less
than that, significantly less, we don't know. Only time will tell. But overall, we are pleased
with the entire transaction.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Got it. Then, the other one on the investment portfolio, Mark's comment about the
equities and the alternatives giving you protection from fixed income if interest rates go
up. I guess I'm wondering, is that really the right way to think about it? It would seem -- it's
probably a reasonably consensus view that if interest rates go up, equity markets sell off,
credit spreads gap out. It would seem they would be all fairly highly correlated. So is it
really going to protect you?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

But don't forget, you are assuming our alternative investments is in the equity world only.
We have a lot of high-yield fixed-income stuff that it will be uncorrelated with that. We
have special funds that they invest in special situations.
One that I can mention to you is we do the development and managing of parking spaces
in China. So I don't think that correlates with anything.
So we have some investors -- investments that they are in sectors that we have floating
rates. So the investments will go and follow floating rates. So think about it as more how
much of our asset allocation should be in alternatives before you decide as to what type
of alternatives we're going to do and what the expectation.
Now, a lot of what we do in alternative investments, we have an expectation of doubledigit returns. So we are looking for 10% returns or better when we make these
investments. That, of course, there is -- you can't be a fool. If you are investing on
something with expectation of 10%, you are taking a lot more risk, and we understand
that. But it will supplement the less risky stuff we do that we are getting 2% return.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

And there has already been a couple of quarters of exactly what Dinos just said, about
the performance and the extent of the performance of some of these alternatives as an
ameliorating factor.
