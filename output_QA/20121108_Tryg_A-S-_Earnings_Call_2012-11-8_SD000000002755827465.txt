{BIO 2301941 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone here. Welcome to this presentation of Tryg's Q3 results. As you
probably have seen, it's the ﬁrst time -- it's a long while that we actually published our
results in the morning, so hopefully that's appreciated from your side as well.
This morning, we will -- well, morning; it's almost noon in Denmark but still morning in
London, I guess. But this morning we will spend like 15 minutes, something like that,
where Morten, our CEO, will -- together with the CFO, Tor, on my right-hand side, will take
the presentation, and then afterwards we will take your questions. It's a live webcast we
have here today, so we will also have questions, or the possibility from questions, from
outside.
So with these ﬁrst remarks, then I'll hand over to Morten.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you, Lars, and thank you all for joining us. As Lars said, the ﬁrst time in London and
the ﬁrst time doubling the physical meeting and live webcast as part of our eﬃciency
measures. Next measure will be no meetings at all, but we'll see. But thanks a lot for
joining us.
I think it means, as you said, Lars, that we will do the questions after the presentation so
the streaming is a bit easier, and probably do the questions from this room ﬁrst and then

the phones afterwards.
I think, overall, we can say that Q3 is a quarter where we've done a lot of progresses in
many areas. First of all, we have progressed well in our ﬁnancial result. Secondly, we've
done a number of new initiatives towards our customers. And thirdly, we've done
important structural changes, amongst others selling Finland and doing a new long-term
agreement with Nordea in Denmark and Norway. And we can come back to why not in
Sweden.
If we return to the ﬁnancial questions, as we see it, a strong ﬁnancial result in Q3, of
course carried by a technical result of some DKK650m, which is an improvement of
roughly 35% to the same quarter the year before. When you add to that a high investment
income, you get to a pre-tax result of almost DKK1 billion for the quarter and a year-todate pre-tax of almost DKK2.4b.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, of course we don't expect many points for the investment gain and I guess we all
know that investments will move all over the place also in the coming quarters and years.
But the most important is the improvement of almost 4percentage points in the combined
ratio, which has some tailwind from having fewer weather claims, which helps the result,
on the other hand has some headwind from having more large claims and lower interest
rates, which increases the combined ratio. And as we'll see, this is driven from an
improvement in almost all areas, although not in Corporate where we've seen the large
claims of the quarter.
It's also a quarter where the accounts are impacted by these bigger structural issues. We
show you that the sale of Finland has an impact, both on the actual sales price but also on
the write-down of intangibles on the balance sheet. We have also taken up a reserve for
restructuring in connection with our change program to achieve DKK1b, and in that sense
we've done a number of things to make sure that we are well equipped to handle the
future. But let me get back to that.
As you probably recall, we said back in February 2012 that after 10 years of presence in
the Finnish market we were really not pleased with what we had achieved. We had
worked very hard, but at the same time we had a subscale position where we had no
ability to drive out positive results and positive gains to our shareholders, and therefore
we wanted to revisit our strategy in Finland.
Now, our priority number one, all along, was to sell the Finnish operation. At the same
time, we knew that Finland is a concentrated market with very few players, so we needed
to keep open the option of having to do other solutions than just a straightforward sale.
And we're very pleased now to have achieved a sale of our portfolio to If. It means that we
get a payment of some EUR15m, or DKK112m. At the same time, we write down intangible
assets, which is namely IT assets of roughly DKK100m.
We also have a few transaction transition costs, which means that the total P&L impact will
be slightly negative. But more importantly, we release DKK250 million of capital
supporting the Finnish operation. And even more importantly, we can move our

management focus to Denmark, Norway and Sweden and create a lot more investor value
from that.

FINAL

Of course, it still needs approval from the supervisory bodies, the FSAs in Denmark and
Finland, but that shouldn't really be an issue. And we're pleased that the customers and
the employees move to this new purchaser.
At the same time, we have signed a new ﬁve-year agreement with Nordea in Denmark
and Norway, meaning that they will distribute onwards our non-life products; we will
distribute onwards their life products; we will continue an asset management operation.
But we have not signed an agreement in Sweden.

Bloomberg Transcript

And I guess the story behind that is that both for Nordea and us we have created a lot of
value together in Denmark and Norway, while in Sweden we have created a lot of top line,
but in reality we've never created any bottom line in Sweden. We've had a negative result
in Sweden in our Nordea portfolio from the very ﬁrst day. I think if you accumulate it, it's
more than DKK600 million all together in the negative result. And we quite rapidly came
to the conclusion, together with Nordea, that it made no sense for us to try to continue a
cooperation in Sweden which created no value.
On the other hand, we have a lot of strong belief that the new agreement in Denmark and
Norway will improve our results further. We have signiﬁcantly reduced the upfront
commission to the bank on the non-life sales. We have changed the structure to align
their incentives to our incentives, which means that it is linked to the claims ratio, it is
linked to a proﬁt sharing, which means that when there are strong proﬁts there's a sharing
of that and a signiﬁcantly lower upfront commission.
At the same time, we expect the average distribution costs to be reduced, because we
now have access to the customer database in the sense that if Nordea, for instance, have
sold one product, our outbound call center can contact the customer and sell add-on
products, which means that we can full sell the customer at considerably lower cost than
before. And having aligned the interest and the commission payment and getting access
to cheaper distribution will create more value in this agreement.
At the same time, we have more favorable conditions on our distribution of life and
pension, and we have more ﬂexibility and better pricing on our asset management
agreement as well.
So for us, this is a much stronger value-creating agreement than the old one. Of course, it
means that we will have to revisit distribution channels in Sweden. It means that we will
have to ﬁll a gap when it comes to the top line in Sweden. And it will probably mean that
in one to two years' time we will see a slightly lower top line development in the Swedish
market. But at the same time, actually, our proﬁts in Sweden will improve because we let
go of new negative result contribution customers. And of course we keep the old
portfolio.

In the Capital Markets Day, Tor explained our program for the next three years to take out
eﬃciency measures of roughly DKK1b, DKK300 million plus DKK100 million relating to
costs and DKK600 million in relationship to claims procurement. What we've done in this
quarter is to set aside DKK88 million of restructuring reserve, to make sure that when we
carry out changes in the composition of the headcount we have this pool of DKK88
million to do agreements and packages, for instance with employees who choose to retire
a bit sooner than planned, and for instance to close down oﬃces where we have to pay
extra rent, etc., etc. And we've tried to do a split of how much of that will impact the costs
and the claims. As you can see, there are claims staﬀ in this process as well.
I guess if we return to the actual result, it's very positive to see how all four large business
areas contribute well. Of course, a strong contribution from the big Private lines area, with
a combined ratio of around 84%. Also, this is the business segment where the balance to
the top line is the strongest, and there's a growth of 1.8percentage points in this business
area.

Bloomberg Transcript

Combined ratio of 79% in the Commercial segment, but there is quite a lot of tailwind in
that in the sense that we still have very few medium-size claims. We have positive run-oﬀ
gains. And there are still large structural changes that we need to carry out in our
Commercial business. But after a number of years where we've made almost no positive
income at all from the Commercial business, we have now exceeded DKK400 million in
one year, so deﬁnitely we're on the right track in Commercial.
Corporate you can see is the only area where the combined ratio has actually increased
compared to the year before. If you look within the numbers, the cost for large claims and
weather claims increases from 9% last year to 14% this year, so there's a 5percentage
point diﬀerence alone from that area. And I think, in a quarter where we have high large
claims, still to have a combined ratio of 92.6% shows that our Corporate business is on the
right track as well.
Then I think it's very positive to see Sweden with a combined ratio of 90.8%, clearly the
strongest quarter ever in our Swedish business. Now, if we could just expect 90%
onwards in all quarters that would be fantastic. That will not be the case. Clearly, the Third
Quarter is the best quarter in Sweden. That's where we get the most income from our
boat business and our motor cycle business, and that's where we make a lot of the
income. But clearly the trend to get more and more positive earnings in Sweden will
continue, and this is a strong indicator of that.
And I guess you really see the same in this slide, where we see how the diﬀerent business
areas contribute to the total earnings. And you can see that Private Lines deliver some
62% of the total technical earnings, and then positive to see how Commercial starts to
contribute as well. And Sweden starts to be noticeable, with almost DKK50m. Then, of
course, the negative restructuring reserve with the DKK88m, which will help us in the
coming periods. But I think a strong and positive composition and contribution from all
areas.
Yes, Tor?

FINAL

I think perhaps we should start oﬀ by saying that if you take the former picture, Morten
promised the Commercial organization a party if there is earnings of more than
DKK500m, so I guess they are running hard now to try to reach that level.
Just a few comments here on the retention rate. You can see that it's relatively stable,
actually slightly increasing here in Norway, which we think is favorable. I think also, if you
look at the last quarter here in the Commercial segment, as Morten said, we still have
some challenges in terms of the Commercial segment. We still need to change our
distribution mix. But at least it seems like it's leveling out here in terms of retention.
Also, one key comment here related to the average premium. You can see that there's still
signiﬁcant growth in the house product and also in the motor product in Norway, whereas
if you look at the Danish motor product you can that there is a small decrease in terms of
average premium. And I guess it's worth saying, and this has been commented before as
well, that we do see relatively high new sales of cars in Denmark but we still see that the
customers are changing from relatively expensive cars to smaller and cheaper cars, and
that's a major driver here in terms of the average premium.

Bloomberg Transcript

If you look at the Swedish segment, which Morten commented has a very favorable
development here in terms of combined ratio, clearly you see the eﬀect when you raised
prices, and you can see here on the house product almost 30% over the last two years.
Clearly, that has had an impact here in terms of the retention rate.
It's important to add that when you compare the retention rate between Sweden and the
Norwegian and Danish market, there is a structural change as well, or structural
diﬀerence, because the turnover of products in the Swedish market is naturally higher
than what you see in Denmark and Norway.
If you look at the motor insurance business here, you can see that we have also had
signiﬁcant growth in terms of average premium, but you can see that it's a more -- it's a
curve that isn't increasing steadily like this one. And the reason being that we have
changed the composition of the customers in the motor product, i.e. trying to have a
better tariﬀ for the lower risk customers, and that's reﬂected here in the development you
see.
In terms of the underlying, I think it's worth saying that, as was mentioned by Morten, we
see an improvement in all segments. It's worth making a comment here related to the runoﬀ, the fact that we have a relatively high run-oﬀ on a net basis this quarter. And what we
actually see is that we have had still some tailwind related to the sideways cover that was
established June 1 last year. And you can see that that had an impact of almost
3percentage points on the run-oﬀ on a net basis this quarter.
In terms of large claims, I think that was commented as well. I guess we said -- after Q1, we
said after ﬁrst half there is natural underlying volatility related to the large claims, which
means that we had a relatively low impact here in the ﬁrst half and then we see a higher
Page 5 of 22



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2012-11-08

impact here in the Third Quarter. And this is a picture of a large ﬁre that happened in
Denmark in Q3 and is one of the major contributors to the large claims here.

FINAL

In terms of weather claims, it's fair to say that we have had a relatively low impact this
quarter.
Going back to the savings that was mentioned to Morten initially, it's worth saying that
when we look at what we have achieved here in terms of savings, we are moving in the
right direction. If you compare to this what happened on the average premium in
Denmark on the motor insurance, clearly you see that almost 60% of the savings is related
to the motor product. And clearly you can see here what is happening in terms of the
average repair price, which is moving in the right direction, and of course that is a large
contributor here to the savings we see.
If you look at the expenses, clearly you see that we had a higher impact of savings here in
the ﬁrst half. But of course that is a natural eﬀect, because you will get a higher impact
once you take down the employees, once you take out the FX, and then it will level out a
bit. Then, of course, when you have the next wave of eﬀorts, that will continue to increase.

Bloomberg Transcript

I guess if you look at the nominal expenses this quarter and you compare the nominal
expenses this quarter to the same quarter last year and you adjust for the restructuring
expenses, you will see that there's a signiﬁcant drop in terms of nominal expenses. And of
course it's supported here by the development in terms of number of employees.
In terms of the investment income, clearly there is a relatively high investment income this
quarter. The major driver is here on bonds and on equities. In terms of bonds, it's
particularly related to high yield and emerging market debt, which has contributed
signiﬁcantly. Of course it's also a consequence of the drop that we have had in interest
rates in the quarter, so both are contributors.
If you look at the equities, it's slightly behind our benchmark. Equities has developed
good but it's slightly behind on benchmark. And it's particularly impacted by the fact that
we have a relatively defensive equity approach.
In terms of asset allocations, there are no major changes, but the fact that we have made
some money, the fact that we have had small reduction in our premium reserve has
increased the free portfolio, and that's why you see some changes in here in the
percentages.
In terms of the capitalization, of course it's supported by a strong Q3 result, and of course
that helps the buﬀer situation. We have had another interest rate drop in Norway, which
has increased the pension obligation even further, about DKK60 million pre-tax. The fact
that we have had a good run on the equity portfolio increases the charges related to the
equity portfolio somewhat. But clearly, as you can see, there is a stable build-up here of
the buﬀer over the year. And I guess almost 75% of the result this quarter is attributed to
the capital position, so it's pretty good.

I guess just to do a preemptive in terms of -- because it's natural here to mention the
dividend policy, and there will be -- we will come back with a dividend policy in Q4. As
you can see, we didn't come out with anything now at Q3, but it will be before yearend in
2012.

FINAL

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And I guess, before we open for questions, I guess just to summarize, we think that of
course achieving the best quarterly result in six years is worth mentioning. But more
importantly, the 35% improvement in the technical result shows that we're on the right
track and that there's a broad support of that improvement in all business areas.
We think that selling Finland takes away a focus that is misled and takes away a drag on
our results. We believe that a stronger and incentive improved agreement with Nordea
and Denmark and Norway, taking away a loss developing agreement in Sweden, will also
further strengthen our result.

Bloomberg Transcript

While improving the result, we have also done a number of things towards the customers
in this quarter. We've worked very hard to avoid claims. We have visited a large number of
private customers, giving them what we call a Tryg bolig check, which is oﬀering them a
free-of-charge walk through their house, advising them of how to secure their house and
avoid future weather and water claims. We have visited a very large number of agricultural
customers, going through all of their electricity, because we see that as where the short
circuits create ﬁres and large claims, to avoid that.
We have now created a new house content product, which we will start selling from this
Monday, where -- I guess a product that is immensely important for all private individuals,
where, for instance, we take away the sum insured of that product, because the
cornerstone question for all companies on the content insurance is what is the total value
of everything you have in your house. And the truth is that no-one has a clue, so they just
put up whatever number they ﬁgure out and that number is almost always too low.
We have restructured now completely the product, so that we take on board that
responsibility. But we then ask the customers what are the single items worth more than
DKK50,000 in your house, per item, because people know that. Then we're taking into
account what is the burglary risk, what is the water ﬂooding risk, and a number of the
other increasing risks, we take that much, much more clearly into account. And we
increase the number of parameters used to set the price signiﬁcantly, so the pricing will
be a lot more precise while at the same time being more customer friendly.
And as Tor showed, the initiative to take out DKK1 billion in eﬃciency gains on cost and
claims is progressing well, and that is what should support further result improvements in
the coming three years, because clearly investment will not be as supportive as it was this
quarter.
So all in all, we believe that we are on the right track to sustainably deliver below 90%
combined ratio, not just in the tailwind quarters but in all quarters in general.

I think, by that, we should open for your questions. And Lars, you will try to manage that?

Lars Moller

{BIO 2301941 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

You will take the diﬃcult questions as well?

Questions And Answers
A - Lars Moller

{BIO 2301941 <GO>}

I'll try to do that. Thank you very much, but I think we will start with a question from the
audience inside and then switch to external questions.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Thanks. Can I just ask on the Nordea deal? So when you mentioned DKK600 million was
the cumulative loss on those policies, is it fair to assume that this is a zero sum game, so
Nordea would have made some of -- so Nordea would have got a better deal so far, so
they're giving up DKK600 million of cumulative proﬁt?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well I think it's important to distinguish between the commission element and the claims
ratio element, because in reality in Sweden we've paid a high commission while at the
same time having fairly lousy quality in the pricing and therefore the claims ratio. So in
reality, the fact that we were not mature enough in the Swedish market means that we've
paid a high distribution cost for low quality business. And I guess the majority of the
DKK600 million losses had to do with the too high claims ratio and at the same time we
than paid a higher distribution cost to get the business. So I think that takes care of
Sweden.
I think in Norway and Denmark, if we do this right, I hope that both Nordea and we will
make more money than before, because in reality there's a large number of singleproduct customers who've taken out, for instance, a house mortgage. They were sold a
house insurance policy in relationship to that, but that's it; they have no other insurances.
And of course, for our distribution staﬀ to be able to contact that customer and do add-on
sales will clearly be cheaper; it will give a more strong quality customer relationship. The
stickiness and the loyalty will be higher, and we will make more money from that.
So I think that the -- and if the quality of the portfolio is not strong and doesn't develop
strongly, then the commission just falls. And that's where we like the new commission
structure a lot more than the old commission structure.

And just to be clear, this new potential cost savings is not part of the DKK300m, or is it --?

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

It is not part of, no. No. We try to be very clear that the DKK300 million nominal cost
target is not changed because of Nordea and it's not changed because of the sale of
Finland. These are clearly designed structural initiatives in Denmark and Norway, and to
some extent Sweden.
But I think it's important to say that if we do this right and we distribute more and the
quality is right, I would like to pay more to Nordea, as long as we make a lot more as well.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
And a couple of questions from me as well. On the restructuring reserves, are you trying
to ﬁgure out that this should be enough, or is this just part of the way in terms of what will
happen, actual restructuring costs?
And the second question would be on your 90% combined ratio target on a stable level
and you're saying per quarter. Would that mean that when we reach 2014, if we were to
have the same weather as we had in '10, would you then be able to do 90%?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

I guess I can answer the restructuring reserve ﬁrst. And I guess the approach has been
how many -- as Morten said, there is a clear list of initiatives that will give the savings that
we have stated as a target. And clearly what we have looked at is what number of
employees does this aﬀect, how many employees can we actually solve through, call it,
natural turnover in the organization and how many redundancies will that give, and that's
the attributable basis for the calculations. So there is -- in our mind, clearly, this should be
suﬃcient.
There is also -- I think Morten mentioned that, but there is also we have made an
assessment in terms of oﬃce leases and expenses related to terminating any oﬃce leases
that we see ﬁt, so there is a very clear and good calculation.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And at the same time, we could probably add that while we expect the DKK88 million
should be suﬃcient, we're trying to estimate a process that will take the next three years.
So clearly bear in mind that there is a number of uncertainties as to the position of those
three years, but the expectation is that the DKK88 million should be enough.
Then I guess you're trying to ask, I think, a relevant question on how lousy a weather can
we manage and still be at or below 90%. I think that we're trying to achieve a situation
where we can manage fairly lousy weather and still be consistently below 90%. Clearly, it
will depend upon what happens to large claims at the same time, what happens to
interest rates and their impact to the combined ratio at the same time. But clearly we've
designed a process where the claims procurement, the cost reduction and the eﬃciency
Page 9 of 22



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2012-11-08

in general will generally push the combined ratio in the right direction, being able to
manage more diﬃcult claims development as well.

FINAL

So I don't think I would want to put numbers on how diﬃcult weather we can manage
below 90%, but I guess you can see we're trying to design a robustness to be below 90%
also with bad weather.

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

And I think it's just worth mentioning that -- I guess the question was also about below
90% on a quarterly basis, and I think what we're trying to aim for is a below 90% on a
sustainable basis, on an annual basis, but it will mean that there will be some volatility in
the quarters, among other things due to the seasonality. So it's important to --

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I was -- already four weeks ago, when I was in Oslo, when I went out of the airplane there
was snow. So I think bear in mind that we always see winter claims in Norway in Q4 and
Q1, and of course they have a higher combined, usually at least, than Q2 and 3.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. A couple of questions from me as well, the ﬁrst one related to your exit from Finland.
Looking at the price, 17% goodwill of premiums, I can't remember over the last 10 years to
have seen anything priced as low as that. Your business was not fantastic, but it was only
one buyer to negotiate with and did Nordea have a big saying in that context? That was
the ﬁrst question.
The second more related to Tor. You improved quite a lot in Norway. You are catching up
towards Gjensidige. There's still some room. How far delayed are you in -- or how many
years are you behind Gjensidige in improving your pricing models in Norway?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I'll take the ﬁrst question; you take the second question. I like your question, Per. Clearly,
we informed Nordea before we started the process in Finland, so they knew about the
process before February's announcement. Clearly, you wouldn't want to catch a business
partner by surprise doing something like that. And we've been very clear from the very
beginning that they had no say whatsoever in our choice in Finland, while at the same
time, of course, we had a mutual interest in handling the customers in a decent way.
If you look at the structure of the Finnish market, I guess you can see quite rapidly that
there's not a huge forest of potential buyers. So needless to say, the number of
companies we could negotiate with was very narrow. It was more than one, but it was very
narrow. And when you've run a portfolio for a large number of years, never creating
positive bottom line, then getting a very high goodwill price for that is diﬃcult. In the
process, it was a serious consideration whether, for instance, we should put the business
into run-oﬀ, which is not a scenario that looks great but you can actually create value from
a run-oﬀ scenario.

FINAL

I think that we were able to lift the goodwill price to EUR15 million despite some initial
value signals from the market that was considerably lower than that. And I think, all in all,
whether we had achieved EUR15 million or another number wouldn't have changed it a
great deal. I think it's more a matter of showing the employees and our shareholders that
we want to be in a market where we can create value for both customers and
shareholders, and we couldn't in Finland.
Would we have liked a higher price? Yes, of course. I think that would have been
unrealistic. So I think we're very pleased with that process and with the fact that there's no
strings attached, so we don't have to look at the reserves for many years or manage a runoﬀ for many years. We can leave it nice and neatly for customers and for employees as
well.

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

And I also thinks it's worth adding to what Morten said that if you look at the in-market
players, of course there is a few players which could be interested, as Morten said. But if
you look at the Finnish market in total, it seems like the interest from other parties around
is less for the Finnish market than perhaps what you see here in Denmark or other places.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We could add that if you look at the competition currently in the Finnish market, it's
extremely ﬁerce. My expectation is that most players in the Finnish market currently loses
money on the new customers and make money on the old customers. And pricing
competition is extremely ﬁerce, and of course that has an impact on the value as well.

I guess, to the last question, I'm not going to make any comments about Gjensidige. I'm
just going to say that we have made -- we have said that there are a couple of top
priorities. One is to improve our price diﬀerentiation ability -- capability. And of course, if
you look at our portfolio, if you place it into the Swedish portfolio, the Danish portfolio
and the Norwegian portfolio, I would say that we are most advanced on the Swedish
portfolio; then we are also relatively advanced on the Norwegian portfolio. And our ability
to introduce new parameters to change the products is -- well, they are relatively agile in
that respect. So we are more advanced in the Norwegian market than what we are in the
Danish market.
So I am not going to say that we are two years behind or three years behind or something
like that, but I'm just going to say that we have said price diﬀerentiation is our top priority.
We have a three-year program, and we are going to get in a relatively good shape over
that remaining now two and a half years or three years.

Q - Karl Morris

{BIO 7154573 <GO>}

Hi. Just a couple from me. With regard to your dividend policy, could you give us an idea
of what options you are looking at? I'm not asking you to tell me what you are going to be
announcing in the Fourth Quarter, but what considerations are you giving, what kind of
options are -- basically have management looked at?

Then I suppose secondly, with regard to Finland, obviously you've been willing or shown
to be willing to divest part of your business. With regard to Sweden, I think you talk a lot
about the barrier to entry in the Nordic markets and obviously scale is important.
Obviously, trying to launch a business in Finland from a Greenﬁeld start has been quite
diﬃcult. Are you happy with the size in Sweden or do you think it's subscale? Is it
something that you would potentially also look at divesting some time in the future? What
is in terms of the strategy towards the Swedish business?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think ﬁrstly, on dividend, clearly I was ready to announce the dividend policy at Q3 but
Tor didn't want to, so blame him. No, you can comment on dividend, if I take the Swedish
question. I understand the question, because of course our Swedish position is a lot
smaller than our Danish and Norwegian business. On the other hand, our Finnish
business had a DKK600 million portfolio, mainly distributed through one partner, namely
Nordea. Our Swedish portfolio is approaching DKK2b. It has a large number of
distribution channels. In boat insurance, motor cycle insurance, etc., we are market leader
with more than 30% market share. We have a large number of partner agreements where
we make very good money.

Bloomberg Transcript

Clearly, if you look at the longer term, are we satisﬁed with staying at DKK2b? No. If we
didn't believe in the future of Sweden, we would have tried to sell Sweden at the same
time as trying to sell Finland. It would have been a lot easier to sell Sweden, I think.
Clearly, a lot of our size in Sweden is attributable to the purchase of Moderna Insurance.
I think that we are trying to ﬁnd a process in Sweden where we make the foundation in
Sweden stronger and stronger, we improve the cost, we improve the pricing, we get rid of
the bad customers and we improve earnings. We grow small numbers, 5% or something
like that, per year. Then we try to look out for other portfolios out there over a period of
time that we could potentially acquire.
But in reality, when we have a strong portfolio in Denmark and Norway, we can live with a
small portfolio in Sweden with positive contribution to earnings, whereas I think if you
were a new entrant from outside and you only had a DKK2 billion position in one country
it wouldn't make sense at all. But of course we realize that we are in a transitional area with
the Swedish portfolio. But if you look at this quarter, it's doing 90% combined ratio and a
positive bottom line of DKK50m. We can live with that, even though it's structurally not
where we want to be long term.
And clearly I think that history has shown that if you try to grow too much in a market, it's
just disaster. So we'd rather have sound combined ratio, small gradual growth, and then
see if there is a new Moderna out there some day. That might be next year; it might be in
six years' time. But as long as we have positive earnings while we wait, that's okay.

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

Yes. I guess to the question, Karl, about the dividend policy, it will be about shareholder
value. So I guess it's a fairly simple question. No, but to be serious, clearly -- I think I said

FINAL

the same thing on the Capital Markets Day. Clearly, we have come from a situation where
the dividend policy is a model which is transparent but is also supportive in terms of
growth. We are now moving into a situation where we will have a relatively low growth on
the top line, but we will have higher cash conversion, we will have higher proﬁtability.
And thus we think it's important to look at a dividend policy that will support that kind of,
let's call it, change in terms of what happens on the proﬁtability side. But we will -- we are
now in the beginning or middle of November, and I guess it's not that much left of the
year, so we will make an announcement.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Just to follow up on the dividend, what's the Board saying, or the TryghedsGruppen?
What are they saying about dividends? That was the ﬁrst question.

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

Well I guess TryghedsGruppen is -- they are an owner which is -- they are concerned
about dividend. That's a part of their -- important part of their cash ﬂow, so they are as
concerned about dividend as any other shareholder or investor. They are concerned
about it.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

They just restated the other day their strategy for the coming years. Part of their strategy is
to pay out roughly DKK550 million per year for public good activities. What is ﬁnancing
their DKK550 million per year? It's the dividend they get from us. So clearly -- and then of
course the yield from their investment portfolio. But I think they are like, as you said, all
other shareholders. They like good results and high payouts. Perhaps they are a bit more
patient than you guys, but basically they want the same thing.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Then my ﬁnal question about the large corporate segment. I see that premiums are down
slightly compared to last year, but I kind of get the impression that a lot of your global
competitors in the Nordics have scaled down quite a lot recently. Is that something you're
seeing? And should we be looking for more growth, or are you happy with the size of
your book?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well I guess what we've seen clearly, that AIG charges has been down in terms of volumes
and presence on workers' comp. The pressure we saw on workers' comp two years ago
has been relieved signiﬁcantly. The minus 30% on pricing workers' comp almost doesn't
happen anymore. We do see that NEMI and Alfa Group still is crazy in pricing workers'
comp, but they are fairly small.
I guess generally we see -- I think we still see fairly ﬁerce competition on the bigger
property accounts, but we saw January 1 a price increase on average in our book and we
still during the year have seen price increases in our book. We don't generally see the
Page 13 of 22

FINAL

corporate market increasing prices yet. The most foolish of competition on workers' comp
seems to have been reduced. So I think, all in all, the corporate business is -- and the
corporate market is more healthier today than two years ago, but it's still not where we
would like it to be.
And having said that, I don't expect our volumes in corporate to grow in the next six, 12
months, but I expect the continuation of improving the results. Then I think it might be
another year or two down the line before pricing for the general corporate market is
where it should be.

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

And I think, just adding to that, I think it's fair to say that we will have to accept, actually, a
high volatility on the top line in the corporate segment, simply because if we want to stay
focused on the proﬁtability side there will be more volatility in that segment. And I guess
that's something that we need to live with, as long as we have, let's call it, the structural
engine in the bottom that can support the segment.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

You can actually say that if we look at it longer term, we think that private and commercial
should be able to have very high stability both on the top line and the bottom line, and
stability should be stronger in commercial than now on the top line, whereas structurally
longer term on corporate we do expect a general situation where we should allow the top
line to go up and down more with the market sentiment and the aggression of
competition.

A - Lars Moller

{BIO 2301941 <GO>}

I think we'll just try to switch to external. So operator, do we have any questions?

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Gianandrea Roberti from Carnegie is on line with a question.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, from me as well, I guess. A couple of questions on what has been
discussed before. There was a question on the combined ratio target. Am I correct in just
repeating that the target at this point is more on a 20% after tax ROE, which basically with
the current level of interest rates requires that you have 89% combined ratio, otherwise
you won't be able to make it, and this should be really the cornerstone for your targets,
and particularly as we move towards the full year '14 as the target is an unsustainable basis
from Q3? Is that correctly understood?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Yes. It's correctly understood. I think that we've tried to communicate the below 90% and
the 20% ROE as equal targets, but you're right that with the current interest rates we
would need to be below 90% to reach the 20%. And clearly the 20% is a sacred target.
Page 14 of 22



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2012-11-08

We wouldn't say hooray we've reached 90% but we didn't reach 20%. So of course
everything can happen to future interest rates, but the 20% is sacred and currently that
requires below 90%.

FINAL

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Okay. Great. The second question is on the dividend, but I -- at this point, I am not
interested really in what you're going to say in one month. I just am kind of puzzled by the
decisional process here, because this discussion has been going on for, what, six, seven,
eight months, and I would have thought that at this point you would have made your
mind up. It doesn't seem like an extremely complicated solution. So I'm just wondering,
what is the decisional process here, why you didn't come out now and now you will be
coming out in a few more weeks? Is there a precise reason for that?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

As I said, that's -- it's Tor's fault, and he is new and he is Norwegian so you never know.
No. I think -- I don't think it's very complicated. We have spent time on this at every Board
meeting since the Capital Markets Day, and we are making good progress. I guess if you
look at the structural changes on Finland, on Nordea, etc., we've had quite a lot of other
big projects running. And to be honest, ﬁnalizing those has been a higher priority than
announcing the dividend policy exactly now.
As Tor said, it's just another month and half left of the year, so I think it's just around the
corner. And we try to make sure that when we make a change we make a change to
something that is sustainable and that we can hold onto for a number of years, so we
don't take the process lightly either. So I think if we can ask for your patience just for
another month, month and a half.
And I think, in all honesty, that is precisely what we said at the Capital Markets Day. We
said within the calendar year 2012 we will come with a new policy. And I think some of you
would have liked it to be Q2 and some would have liked it to be Q3, but that's not what
we said. So hopefully that will play out as planned during the remaining part of this year.

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

Just to add to what Morten said or perhaps underline it, the fact is that there has been a
relatively busy quarter and we have been able to, let's call it, solve the Finnish situation.
We have been able to make changes to the Nordea and land the Nordea agreement. And
we have also made good progress on the savings. So I guess in all fairness we have made
the prioritization.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks a lot.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Matti Ahokas from Handelsbanken is on line with a question.

Company Name: Tryg A/S

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. Hi. It's Matti here from Handelsbanken. A question on the dividend as well, but
mainly reﬂecting how much does the sale of the Finnish operations, the DKK250m,
impact the situation? How should we look at the exit from Finland and the DKK250 million
capital release?
And I was also wondering, what kind of diversiﬁcation beneﬁt did actually Finland have
from an economic capital point of view? And obviously, that being gone, I'm just curious
about the magnitude of that, in your opinion. Thanks.

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

Yes. I guess I can -- in terms of the diversiﬁcation eﬀects, it's relatively low so no major
impact. I guess when you look at the capital relief, it's important to take into consideration
that this is mainly a private portfolio, and of course that is the most important impact in
terms of what happens.
I guess in terms of the capital buﬀer discussion and what is the impact of the DKK250m,
it's fair to say that we have taken this into our accounts as at Q3. But there are -- we are
still -- we still need approval from the competition authorities and from the FSA. And we
do think that that shouldn't be a problem, but of course it means that we need to have
that in place.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Then I guess that the capital release in Finland, of course, helps the total capital position
and thereby the payout. But we are trying to achieve a longer-term payout policy that is
sustainable over years and not just in year one where there is a DKK250 million release
from Finland. So it doesn't really impact the general work on dividend policy.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great. Thanks.

Operator
We have no further questions at this time.

A - Lars Moller

{BIO 2301941 <GO>}

Is there a couple of more questions here?

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Yes, I have two questions. One is again on Finland. You say DKK250 million capital relief.
As I remember, you have already deducted intangibles from the S&P model. And the
DKK250 million includes the price paid, so that would take the capital relief to something
like below 20% of earned premiums. Isn't that quite low, and why?

Page 16 of 22



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2012-11-08

And secondly, you have a subordinated loan from Moderna -- or sorry, from the Moderna
acquisition, which was issued to you by -- or you issued it to TryghedsGruppen. Do you
think it would be possible to replace that with something cheaper? And why haven't you
done that yet, since I think there was a call on it some while ago?

FINAL

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

I guess the latter question is relatively easy to answer. You're right; the ﬁrst call was at
June 30, but it can be called every quarter. And that's why we want to look at our capital
structure before we do anything about that, the subordinated loan. But clearly you are
right; you can reﬁnance it in the market today at a lower price. But as you know, if you
want to do something on the subordinated debt, it's important for us to look at the total
structure since it's really a long-term decision. And that's the reason why we are still
considering options and alternatives.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And I guess it's fair to say that the rules on the Solvency II -- Solvency I, Solvency II and
S&P on what capital quality and length do you have on such a mortgage in order to
qualify are very diﬀerent. So I think you should come away with a message that we are
planning to do a replacement, but we want to make sure that we have the right
replacement.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

In terms of the ﬁrst question related to the capital relief, yes, you're right; it's a relatively
low impact. That's why I said that of course it reﬂects the fact that this is mainly a private
portfolio.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

But I think the logic you were trying to do I didn't quite capture that, because if you take
the intangibles, the intangibles are already out of the capital base. So the intangibles were
not part of -- they were deducted previously from capital, and now you take them out of
the P&L as well. So that doesn't change the capital.
So I guess the DKK250 million -- I think the logic is more that you could compare the
DKK250 million to a percentage of the volume in Finland, which gets you to, what, 30%
something, close to 40%, right? That's probably the logic. And I think if you look at our
general capital to premium, that is above 50%, where corporate pulls that up and private
is towards the 40% mark. So I guess that logic is roughly right, isn't it?

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
I thought DKK250 million minus the price, which if paid would take it down to DKK250
million minus DKK112m.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I try to take the goodwill into account as well.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Yes. Two questions. In terms of investment policy, you have a very handsome return from
high yield investment. Could you elaborate whether, going forward, you will keep your
current mix of investment? That's the ﬁrst question.
And the second question goes to the new policy that you will introduce in Denmark. Do
you think you will capture market share with that new policy?

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

Well I guess to the ﬁrst question, there is -- there are no plans for major changes in terms
of the investment book. I guess you can say generally we are -- we do think that the
markets will be turbulent; it will be diﬃcult going forward as well. So there is no major
plans for changes in terms of the investment book.

Bloomberg Transcript

I am not quite sure if I catch the last question (multiple speakers).

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Was that on content, whether the new product would result in more market share?

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Yes (multiple speakers) okay.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

If you look at our total market share on the content, I think the likelihood that we can
increase that a lot is fairly low. But I think what we can achieve is a more healthy mix of
which customers we do get. We will start selling the product on Monday. We will start
converting all customers in the middle of next year. And I think it will be more a
combination of easier understandable and higher quality for the customers, stronger mix
of customers and thereby stronger earnings for us, taking into account that break-ins is
going through the roof and water claims are going through the roof, so taking into
account the two new big changes in the risk picture.
I think, to be honest, in the Danish market in general, increasing our market share a lot in
any line of business is very diﬃcult and probably not very wise either. I think, across
Denmark and Norway, the only segment where we can really increase our market share in
a meaningful way is in the SME market in Norway, where our market share is only around
9%, and really an area where we haven't spent enough time compared to private and
Page 18 of 22



Company Name: Tryg A/S

corporate. But even there, I think that is a very slow, gradual, say, 10-year project,
something like that. So bullish views on market shares I think is a bit far away.

FINAL

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Sorry for coming back. Vinit from Goldman's. Just three slightly operational questions, just
following up from the investor day meeting we had. Firstly, on the Swedish motor, I was
quite surprised, sort of surprised, to see their uptick in the average premium, because I
think there was some photos of Ferraris being replaced by other cars. And I'm just
wondering if that mix had actually been in place, or working towards it. So that's the ﬁrst
question. Shall I shoot the other two or --?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Easy answer. Okay. The second one is the -- there was also this whole chat around
65% of your customers needing to move to your preferred partners for car repair. And I
am just wondering if the DKK60 million improvement you mentioned on that slide on
that, has that got a role to play or is that something that will still happen in future years
and will show in the 250 per year claims? So that's second.
And third question is, corporate, I've also heard a lot about things like Danish
municipalities, things like oil exposure, and you are trying to reduce some of that as well.
Is that something that will still happen over time? Is that -- because you clearly mentioned
that it's been large claims hitting 3Q, but is the portfolio mix still a story for future years
already? Thanks.

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

I guess, to the last question on the corporate book, what we have mentioned is the power
utilities in the Norwegian market and the municipalities, as you mentioned, and clearly we
have made those changes. And I guess you can say that if you look at the large claims that
we had in Q3, it's related to, let's call it, an ordinary exposure that we have in our book, so
that exposure has been downsized.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I guess, Tor, we can add that the municipalities were mainly in Denmark, and I think we've
actually seen subsequently these customers with -- we don't work with anymore. And I
think we've seen subsequently that that decision was right, because in reality we've had
negative run-oﬀ losses from those customers from the rain showers in July last year. So
actually what we saw was the negative municipality development on claims has actually
been worse since last year. And it means that we'll see no new claims from that area, but
still we are paying oﬀ some run-oﬀ losses in that business, so I think that decision was
right.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}
Page 19 of 22



Company Name: Tryg A/S

Did it happen in this quarter or (multiple speakers)?

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

In this quarter as well, we had negative run-oﬀ losses from municipals in Denmark. I guess
on Sweden I don't think we can say that we are through the change of the motor mix. We
just saw the other week a status on how many new customers on cars have high horse
power, low horse power, high pricing, low pricing, high weight, etc., age of the driver.
And we can clearly see that the mix of new customers is changing dramatically. So we are
getting a lot more boring cars in Sweden and a lot less sexy cars. But I think the
transitioning of the accumulated portfolio is still going on.

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

And it's important to understand that you will have some customers that will have a
relatively high price increase and will still stay with us. So that's the reason why you -- and
that's why I tried to explain that the curve was a bit wavy, so to speak. It's not a kind of
steep development. And I guess what happens, of course, is that when you introduce a
new product and a new tariﬀ, you will tend to use a ﬂoor and a roof on the price increases
in order to try to stabilize your portfolio. And that's why, as Morten said, it will take some
time before it will ﬂow through the portfolio.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

But I think it's fair to say that two, three years ago Sweden was a country where our mispricing was the broadest. Today, we are actually getting close to a situation that Sweden is
the area where the largest number of products is priced exactly where we want them. So
our staﬀ in Sweden has been moving very rapidly on turning around the portfolio. And
you may recall that we hired a number of very senior actuarial staﬀ from some of the
largest competitors in Sweden two years ago, and that is really starting to pay oﬀ on the
quality.

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

And that's why I said to Per's question earlier that in fact we do think that in terms of price
diﬀerentiation we actually have the best stability -- agility now in the Swedish portfolio,
Swedish book of business.
There was another -- there was a ﬁnal question. What was --?

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

The car repairs.

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

The car repairs, right. Right. Yes. That is something that will continue to ﬂow into the
numbers in the coming years. Clearly, you saw that a major impact this year in terms of
annual eﬀect was related to the fact that we have been able to renegotiate agreements

Page 20 of 22



Company Name: Tryg A/S

with a lot of the car repair shops in Denmark, but you could also see that there was a
signiﬁcant number.

FINAL

So of course for us it's important to make sure that you get contracts with the right car
repair shops, that you get it at -- with an agreed quality level and at an agreed price. But
it's also important to look at, over time, do we actually need to have that many or can we
scale down and achieve more economies of scale in terms of procurement.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

So the DKK60 million had something to do with that?

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I guess you could say, Tor, that actually our initiatives on car and procurement is slightly
ahead of plan, whereas, for instance, house and building and procurement is slightly
behind plan. So there are variations within the project. But generally it is moving along the
plans we set.
