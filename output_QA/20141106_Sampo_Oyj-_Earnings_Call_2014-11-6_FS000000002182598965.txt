Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this Conference Call on Sampo Group's Third Quarter
2014 Results. I'm Jarmo Salonen, Head of Investor Relations at Sampo. With me here in
the studio, I have our Group CEO and President, Kari Stadigh; Group CFO, Peter
Johansson; and Deputy Head of P&C Insurance, Ricard Wennerklint.
I'll hand over to Kari for his presentation, but let me ﬁrst remind you that you can follow
this transmission live at sampo.com/result. A recorded version of the call will later be
available at the same address. Thank you. Kari, please.

Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Thank you, Jarmo. Welcome to the conference call on my behalf as well. Given the
sluggish economic environment in Europe, I'm happy to report a strong result. All area of
our operations improved the results during the ﬁrst nine months compared to last year.
I would like to start oﬀ with my list of best ever results. If combined ratio at 87.8% was the
best ever result. If solvency ratio at 94% was also highest ever. Nordea's contribution to
Sampo's result exceeded €500 million for the ﬁrst time ever for the ﬁrst nine months.
Also, Nordea's capital base is very strong and its total capital ratio exceeded ﬁrst time
ever at 20%. And it was very impressive to seeing Nordea's assets under management
climb to a record-high at €255 billion, very impressive numbers all the way. Concerning

Mandatum Life, its technical provisions exceeded for the ﬁrst time €9 billion and its unitlinked reserves peaked at €5.2 billion.

FINAL

Turning to the standalone Q3, it is worth noting that even if we are facing slow general
economic growth, the operating proﬁt grew in all areas. If by 1% burdened by currency
ﬂuctuations, Nordea by 22% and Mandatum Life by 15%. Our Q3 EPS grew by 15% to
€0.71.
Given these solid numbers, If will distribute in December as usual an internal dividend of
SEK 5.5 billion, i.e., almost €600 million, up 20% from last year. Also, Mandatum Life with
a solvency ratio of 29.8% is well positioned to distribute in the ﬁrst quarter of 2015 an
internal dividend at the same level as this year, i.e., €100 million. All this is ﬁne and dandy,
strong numbers and stable performance.

Bloomberg Transcript

However, there are the same old issues that keep us awake at night, namely the sad
general economic development in Europe and slow growth consequently leading to low
interest rates, actually lower than we thought and apparently staying lower for a longer
time than we thought. So, our running yields in our ﬁxed income portfolios are continuing
to come down. In If, the decline was after nine months on a year-to-year basis down from
3% to 2.5% and the Mandatum Life from 4.1% to 3.5%. Sadly enough, we will see this
downward trend continuing in the coming months.
Our investment stance remains the same, cash is king until we see a steepening in yield
curve, and equity should be bought on dips. There is not much left of this year, but as you
have all seen, we have changed our combined ratio guidance from 88% to 90% for the
full year. And even if we saw cloud burst in Denmark/Sweden, and forest ﬁres in Sweden
accompanied with ﬂooding now in Norway, we see no reason to change this. All in all,
conﬁdence prevails.

Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Thank you, Kari. Ladies and gentlemen, we are now ready for your questions.

Q&A
Operator
And we have our ﬁrst question from Mr. Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank Markets. Please
go ahead, sir.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. It's Matti here from Danske Bank. Two questions if I may. Firstly,
regarding the dividend payout, you're increasing it by 20% even though the result is ﬂat.
We interpret this as an indication of basically you willing to increase the leverage more in
If.

FINAL

And the second question is regarding – even though, Kari, you mentioned that you've
seen a record result overall an 88% combined ratio compared to peers, even though it's
not directly comparable, isn't that great? So, I'm just thinking, as a kind of benchmarking
act, would you consider cost cuttings or further kind of eﬃciency improvements in If to
get the proﬁtability maybe closer to some of very aggressive recent targets presented by
our competitors. Thanks.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

We are not really benchmarking us to our competitors. I think that we feel that we are the
market leader in this business segment and we run our own show here. So, whatever our
colleagues are producing, that doesn't really guide us at all. And I don't even want to
comment on our colleagues' performance because it's not relevant for us.
We run this company based on return on equity targets, and we are performing extremely
well there. And the present level of combined ratio is actually very much to my liking and
satisfaction. I don't know if Ricard wants to add anything. But this is my strong belief that
this is the way we see. This is an excellent result.

A - Ricard Wennerklint
I can add that cost-cutting has always been a big part of our strategy and we'll continue to
push down cost ratio the same way we've done on the previous years.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yes. Our cost ratio has been going down more or less every quarter on a level of 0.1%,
0.2% per year for the last 12 years. Dividend, I don't feel that we increased leverage at all.
Our solvency at 94% is all-time high. So by distributing this dividend, we are still in the
upper part of an A rating. So, I feel very comfortable with this and it's by no means an
indication of an increase in leverage.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

If I may follow up on that as well regarding the subordinated capital potential in Solvency
II. So you don't see this as a kind of indication to that front. I'm just here as well pointing
out to some of your competitors which have given fairly detailed estimates on how the
subordinated capital shares if you look at in the Solvency II world?

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 20728335 <GO>}

Yes, and on your previous question, Matti, I could add that actually, when we paid out the
SEK 5.5 billion dividend now, it's actually coming from the 2013 proﬁts. So, when we
made the full-year numbers for 2013, so in spring basically, If in Sweden and If in Finland
paid the dividends up to the holding. So basically, we're taking out now 2013 proﬁts. So
this year's proﬁt will not be distributable before we take the full-year numbers.
On hybrids basically, the hybrid capacities, I don't remember the exact numbers but I
think we're pretty close on the present regime, we're pretty close to the maximum hybrid

Page 3 of 10

Date: 2014-11-06

capacity, so we will have to wait until Solvency II and see how much we want to increase
potentially, hybrids in and if maybe Mandatum Life.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

FINAL

Great. Thanks.

Operator
We have a next question from Mr. Blair Stewart from Bank of America. Please go ahead,
sir.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Lovely to hear there were phrases ﬁne and dandy
being used in the presentation. A couple of questions, ﬁrstly on the P&C side, we know
that the net reserve releases were very low. We know that large claims were broadly in line
with expectations across the piece. I just wonder, has claims frequency been friendly or
otherwise over the piece? That's the ﬁrst question.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second question is on the life side, where I think you saw about a 22% reduction in
premium income in Q3, I know Q3, looking at life businesses on any one quarter is not
useful, but was there anything going on in particular in life that led to that reduction in
premium income? Thank you.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Well, I can start oﬀ with the life. The ﬂuctuation comes purely from Danske. What I quote,
our own distribution performed really well. Danske decreased to the level of the previous
year to 2012 levels. That's ﬂuctuation and that was, in my view, mainly based on the fact
that Danske was cutting their distribution capacity.
I suppose that their intention is to – after cutting capacity to start to grow again. So we'll
have to see how they perform but this was the source for the ﬂuctuation.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

How signiﬁcant is that as a distribution channel for you now please, Kari?

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Is that – sorry, I couldn't hear you now.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Sorry. How signiﬁcant is Danske as a distribution channel for the life business compared
to your own distribution?

FINAL

It's, at this moment, a little bit smaller but it's very important to ask because bank
distribution has become more and more important as we are selling less and less pension
products and more and more wrappers, capital redemption policies, for instance.
So it's more close to asset management nowadays in life than it used to be. And Danske is
the number three bank and we have an exclusive distribution agreement with them. So, of
course, it's very important for us. And therefore, their performance is inﬂuencing our
volume.

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 20728335 <GO>}

Normally, the third quarter numbers are quite volatile and the comparable number in
2013, we had an exceptionally good September. July is always very quiet. And then
activity picking up in August and September 2013 was, for some reason, very good month
and 2014 wasn't that good.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

When you distribute insurance products especially if they are from a subcontractor or a
partner, it's very dependent on how you'll compensate your distribution, what kind of
campaigns you have and things like that. And those issues, the timing of those are, of
course, not in our hands. So, I think we will see ﬂuctuation in the banking distribution also
in the future. It depends on their appetite for more mortgages and other issues.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Very clear. Thank you. And on the P&C side?

A - Ricard Wennerklint
Yes, on the P&C side, the claims frequencies has continued to surprise a bit on the
positive side. But then I have to sort of take away the fact that we've had a few events
during this year, smaller events, below our net retention of SEK 250 million. But still, they
impact the results. And, again, the same as we have said before, there's nothing to be
read into the prior year result. There are some volatility in prior year's result. Reserve
strength and solvency is still on very high levels, so really nothing to be read from this
quarter or the ﬁrst nine months prior year gains.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Very good. Thank you very much.

Operator
We have the next question from Mr. Mika Koskinen from SEB. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Mika Koskinen

{BIO 1557965 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. It's Mika from SEB. Just two questions regarding to the investment portfolio. You
mentioned that the running yields on the portfolios are likely to trend down in the coming
Page 5 of 10

quarters, which is very understandable. Still, you were able to maintain fairly stable
running yields. Now, in this quarter against the previous quarter, is there something
special that has happened whereby you could ﬁght against the trend a bit?

FINAL

And then second question, relating also to investments, you mentioned that equity should
be bought in dips. We had a fairly up signiﬁcant dip in the markets over the last few
weeks and did you increase your equity exposures in that period?

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yes. We work exactly as we communicate. So in the dip, we were buying shares.
Unfortunately, the dip was lasted for a very short time. We increased to roughly SEK 1.1
billion in equities during the dip. In the summer, there was some turbulence in the high
yield market and I think it was in July...

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 20728335 <GO>}

In July, yes.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

...so we were able to increase high yielders at very good value for roughly €100 million in
the summer. And that's – I would treat that as a one-oﬀ. And therefore, the running yield
didn't trend downwards this quarter. But I still expect it to do so going forward.

Q - Mika Koskinen

{BIO 1557965 <GO>}

Okay. That's very clear. Thanks very much.

Operator
We have our next question from Mr. Gianandrea Roberti from Carnegie. Please go ahead,
sir.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon from me as well. I have three question. Ricard, can you give me
some comments on the outlook for Norway. You continued to produce extremely strong
numbers in Norway and some of your key competitors are doing so as well. But at the
same time, Gjensidige is telling us that as an example in the price increases of 3%, 4% that
they announced at the beginning of the year, basically particularly in motor, they're not
pushing that through to customers anymore, signaling that, well, I guess, there's some
sort of limits of how much they can do. Just a few words on the Norwegian market would
be really appreciated.
And the second question is more of a discussion on your rating in the non-life. We'd
touched upon this before but I'm just wondering, there is a substantial diﬀerence from
your economic capital model and the (16:05) And clearly, the diﬀerence is the fact that
you need – I mean, I guess so far, you have been needing a credit rating. And I'm just
trying to understand now how far ago your discussion with S&P in terms of trying to

FINAL

convince them that your internal model is probably better and more sophisticated that
their capital model and so on.
The ﬁnal question is on life. I just want to check is it still correct the assumption that by
year-end, you will have everything in place to take in the Suomi Mutual portfolio? That's a
€1.3 billion of traditional reserve. And I think we mentioned previously, if I remember
correctly, probably an improvement of €5 million, €10 million or something around that
level on an annual basis in terms of the operating result. Thanks a lot.

A - Ricard Wennerklint
Well, on the Norwegian market, we are not looking to push through premium increases in
the Norwegian market. Generally speaking, we do claims inﬂation or expect the claims
inﬂation no more than that. So, if you want an outlook for the Norwegian market, you will
have to give me the number for Norwegian claims inﬂation next year.
Secondly, rating. Yes, a dialogue with S&P continue. We get a SEK 1 billion reduction of
the economic requirement for an A rating, i.e., they take part of our internal economic
model into account when they give us the A rating. Having said that, €1 billion is, of
course, not very much, but the dialogue continues and I expect to be given more credit
for our model going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 20728335 <GO>}

And then, Gianandrea, you have to remember that when you look at our economic capital
model, it scaled at 99.5 conﬁdence level which is close to a BBB, so you have to scale it up
to become A. And that means add on roughly 30% of capital requirement.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Then on the Suomi deal, it's still I think an excellent deal both the seller and the buyer are
beneﬁting. I wouldn't expect anything else but good takeover. The life company is very
busy working on this, for us, very big transfer. On the proﬁtability, I think that we have also
communicated that the impact will be very limited in the two ﬁrst years because then we
have agreed on a ﬁxed bonus level for the two ﬁrst years. Of course, we will get the
management, asset management fee of 0.2% from day one, but the carry or the proﬁt
sharing will not really pop in with full impact until year three.
It's a segregated portfolio and the takeover issue is the main issue that we get everything
running in the back oﬃce and that we take over the investments. In the investment side,
they have outsourced a big part of it to outside fund managers and we are, of course,
bringing the team as soon as we can.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. I guess I will have to make up my glimpse inﬂation estimate
to have an idea of your top line in Norway at this point.

FINAL

We have our next question from Mr. Daniel Do-Thoi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead sir.

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. I just have one question and it's sort of on your ROE. And if I have
done my math right, should I send the ROE against the 10 basis point decline in the
running yield, you'd have to improve your combined ratio by about 20 basis points?
And so given your sort of current run rate of 10 basis points decline per quarter, that to
me implies that you need to make up about 80 basis points on your combined ratio next
year and which I guess 10 to 20 basis points that you just mentioned comes from or can
come from cost savings.
So my question is how do you make up the remaining 60 or so basis points? I mean, does
the current competitive environment allow you to re-price suﬃciently? And feeling that,
would you consider scaling back on growth and perhaps returning more capital? Thank
you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I don't think that you can calculate the way you do because if running yields go down, that
shouldn't aﬀect our risk and underwriting philosophy as such. It is quite natural that we
are more pressured with running yields but partly that will decrease our investment return
and it has to be compensated also from an expected higher return on equities. If this
wouldn't happen, I would expect the investment income to be lower than this year. So it
will not be fully mitigated by underwriting changes.
It's very dangerous to change anything on underwriting in a company which is based on
underwriting excellence. So I don't expect that to happen. Then of course, on costs, I
think that you don't do it that quickly based on quarter by quarter. We have a tradition of
making this company more competitive year-over-year and that's a much longer term job.
So unfortunately, we are not in that type of culture that you describe that if the running
yields slowly deteriorates, it wouldn't aﬀect us. Unless the equities perform, the lower
running yield will impact our results.
Ricard, what would you like to add on this?

A - Ricard Wennerklint
Well, I have nothing to add. When we do the planning for If, we look at the two-year
horizon. To change prices now means changing the results between 12 to 24 months from
now. So this is far from a quarter-on-quarter business.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

And then also, maybe the last remark is that when we look at our ROE, you must
remember that our ROE target is 17.5% and we are signiﬁcantly above that. So we are not
pushing any panic button if the ROE ﬂuctuates with a big margin to our target.

FINAL

A - Peter Kristian Johansson

{BIO 20728335 <GO>}

Yes. The long-term average on ROE has been over 25%, and even in January, September
this year, ROE was over 22% and that's what the signiﬁcant amount of excess capital and
now we're partly distributing that out with the €600 million dividend.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

That's a good comment, that the quickest way to have improve the ROE is to distribute
big dividends. Much simpler than cost cutting or new underwriting guidelines. Good,
Peter.

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay. So we should think of the €600 million as sort of a sustainable level going forward
or a base to grow from?

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Wow. You are worse than my board. Let's take one dividend per year.
