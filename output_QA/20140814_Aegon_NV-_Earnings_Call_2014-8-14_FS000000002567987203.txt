MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Aegon Second Quarter 2014 Results Conference Call.
Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference
over to Willem van den Berg. Please go ahead.

Willem van den Berg

{BIO 15203834 <GO>}

Thank you, Jillian. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for this conference call on
Aegon's second quarter 2014 results. Similar to last quarter, we will keep today's
presentation short, leaving plenty of time to address your questions. We would
appreciate it if you take a moment to review our disclaimer on forward-looking
statements which is at the back of this presentation.

Our CEO, Alex Wynaendts, will share his views on the highlights of this quarter's
performance and will then be joined by our CFO, Darryl Button, to answer your questions.
I'll hand it now over to Alex.

FINAL

Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Thank you, Willem, and good morning to everyone. I'm pleased to start this call by saying
that we have again delivered a strong set of results, maintaining the positive momentum
of the previous quarters. The 7% increase in our underlying earnings has been driven
primarily by three sectors, solid growth of our business, improved operational
performance and higher equity markets. These drivers were partially offset by lower U.S.
dollar and unfavorable mortality in the U.S., largely related to lower-than-expected
reinsurance recoveries. The impact of continued low interest rate has been modest and in
line with the sensitivities we have provided.
I'd also like to mention here that we will update our mortality assumptions in the U.S. as
part of our annual assumption review during the quarter. This includes supplementing our
own emerging mortality experience with the results of recent old-age industry studies
which is expected to result in somewhat more conservative mortality assumptions.

Bloomberg Transcript

Sales in MCVNB were also very strong, and our return on equity for the quarter increased
to 8.8%. And the real highlight this quarter is our strong net deposits, which increased 75%
to €6 billion and helped grow our total revenue generating investments to over €500
billion for the first time in Aegon's history.
Now, turning to slide three. And as you can see on slides three and four, our strong
performance is a result of continued profitable sales growth. This, together with positive
equity markets, has led to higher asset balances and higher earnings. Asset growth was
especially strong in our U.S. variable annuity business and our pension business. Once
again, we've seen very strong variable annuity deposits with gross deposits of $2.5 billion
and net deposits of over $1.3 billion and we continued to achieve very attractive returns.
Deposits in our U.S. pension business were exceptionally strong with gross deposits of
over $8 billion and net deposit of almost $4 billion. This is mainly due to larger-than-normal
plan takeovers and extends a trend of growing balances driven by initiatives to increase
employee awareness and employee participation.
In 2003, we started to make sizeable investments in technology and our pension
business, and the aim then was to build a scalable platform from which we could grow
and improve service levels. The results of our commitment to investing in technology can
be seen both in terms of strong earnings and asset growth now at more than $135 billion.
And turning to slide five, the investments we continue to make throughout the company
are being made over the same objectives, and that is to grow the business in a
sustainable way. The required investments are made possible by continued cost

reductions. We're creating space to invest in new capabilities as can be seen very clearly
on this slide.
Let me share a few examples. Our direct-to-consumer proposition in UK, Retiready, is
gaining popularity and is supporting the asset growth we are seeing on our platform
which now stands at nearly £2 billion. In the Netherlands, 400,000 customers are already
using our new online portal, Mijn Aegon. And in the U.S., the number of retirement
customers that have used our new Retirement Outlook Estimator quickly is approaching 1
million. And we continue to press forward with new initiatives in many of our other key
markets.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to slide six where I'd like to update you on a number of capital-related results.
Operational free cash flows this quarter were €370 million. Market impacts, mainly lower
interest rate, had a negative impact on cash flows of approximately €25 million. And onetime items had a positive effect of approximately €75 million. The benefit from the
redundant reserves financing solution in the U.S. was partially offset by some asset derisking in the UK in preparation for Solvency II and model updates in the Netherlands. We
will implement further model updates in the third quarter of this year. Based on the strong
capital position and year-to-date cash flows, we will pay interim dividends of €0.11 per
share. This represents approximately 50% of the free cash flow.
As you can see on the final slide, seven, we continue to execute successfully on our
strategy. And today, I'm also pleased to announce that we expanded our partnership in
Spain with Banco Santander into Portugal. This is a new market for us. We have now
signed a 25-year agreement to distribute life and protection insurance products to over 2
million new customers of Banco Santander in Portugal.
So, in summary, we are proud of what we're achieving by executing on our strategy, and
this is reflected in a strong set of results. We're growing sustainably in our key markets.
Our earnings are up and we have record revenue-generating assets of over €5 billion.
And we are achieving all of these in spite of the persistently low interest rate
environment. These are exciting times for Aegon as we are well-positioned for future
challenges and well-positioned to take advantage of the many opportunities we see
across our businesses.
Darryl and I are now happy to take your questions. Thank you.

FINAL

Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just on the U.S. mortality
experience I was just wondering maybe if you could quantify a little bit what the drag on
earnings has been the past few quarters just to give an idea if there's any potential uplift
for earnings once additional reserving has been made. And maybe could you also quantify
or give a little bit of guidance on what the potential impact is in terms of the actual
quantum? Thank you.

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi, David, it's Darryl. Let me jump in with that. As you know, we've been doing a lot
of analysis on our mortality the last few quarters. I can – as I look back at the first quarter
and here in the second quarter, we're really seeing what I would say would be more
random fluctuations, and in first quarter in particular, a lot of the seasonal effect that we
normally see. Here in the second quarter, it was lower than expectations but mostly driven
by really reinsurance recoveries were lower than expected. However, in that process, we
have identified a trend. It's a smaller trend, but it's in the old age part of our market, of
our experience. So I would call that aged 85, 90-plus.

Bloomberg Transcript

And there's some recent industry experience out there through a new Tillinghast study
that we're looking at carefully there as well. So the actual experience has been small, but
in terms of what we see in the older age market combined with the new, I would say,
emerging experience, particularly coming from the new industry table, that's an area
where I can already look forward to seeing us making some assumption changes in the
third quarter.

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

And just any guidance on the quantum or the size of those impacts?

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

We're still – it's our third quarter process and so that's where we do our normal
assumption updates. So we're working through the actual modeling, the reserve and DAC
modeling now. What I do have sightline on is the direction of the assumption, and then we
will be making a change to the more conservative assumptions in the third quarter.
Unfortunately, I can't really size it at this point.

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
We will now take our next question from Farooq Hanif from Citigroup. Please go ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi everybody. I hope you can hear me clearly. I just wanted to ask a couple of questions on
your free cash flow and dividends. I think I'm just about understanding how interest rates
affect your earnings because you're looking at the delta between the recovery you're
Page 4 of 23

Date: 2014-08-14

FINAL

assuming in your DAC for future yields and the pathway that you're going through. But on
cash you had a €25 million market impact from the low interest rates in the Americas. Can
you explain what the direct statutory driver is there that's hitting that, and then how we
can think about the sensitivity going forward if one day we saw a more positive yield cover
environment? That's meant to be question one.
And question two is, you've mentioned here a rate of 50% dividend payout of free cash
flow, which am I right in thinking is the first time you've shown that kind of ratio in the
presentation? I don't know if it is. But if so, I mean is this the right level? Is that how you
would think about it going forward? Thank you very much.

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Farooq, let me take your second question first on the dividend. I think on the dividend,
we've been consistent and we have a policy, and we are consistent in saying that we
would like to have a sustainably growing dividend. We have here given you the number of
50%, but we clearly have an intention to grow sustainably.
The second thing I like to remind you, Farooq, also is that we have expressed our clear
intention to execute on the share buyback of those shares that were issued in relation to
the preference shares that were issued – that were taken in around the association. So
that's how you should be looking at the dividend.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of cash flows, Darryl?

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yeah. Farooq, specifically on the interest rate impact, the mechanism for a drop in interest
rates to come through capital, I would really break the U.S. business into the life business
versus the annuity business. Behind the annuity business is more of an economic
calculation with CTE contingent tail kind of capital calculation. That's where a drop in
interest rates in any one quarter will come in to that calculation and change the capital. So
we see a bit of capital interest rates sensitivity from the annuity business.
On the life business, the capital was a little more factor-based, and so you have the same
decline in earnings which is slow to emerge frankly and doesn't really move the capital
needle any one quarter to quarter where it would come through in the life businesses at
the end of the year when you do cash flow testing analysis. If you ran out of sufficiency
margins you may have to increase reserves, but we generally have a pretty decent buffer
preventing against that, so it does come from the annuity business in the U.S.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay. So is this asymmetric then? So we should not read too much into the €25 million and
look at it within the yields. Is it very difficult to give guidance on how it might improve?

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Page 5 of 23



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity

FINAL

Yeah. So I think – I mean the sensitivity is – and actually what we have is, we have a slightly
bigger number of in the €25 million coming from the U.S. from the drop in interest rates.
The drop in interest rates was pretty profound in the quarter. And then credit spreads
tightened and that provides a bit of a capital offset particularly in the Dutch business. So
basically if the yield curve moves in any one quarter, you'll find a little bit of capital noise
coming off the U.S. annuity business. And then that's a one-time item and then it will be
stable if interest rates came back up next quarter, it would reverse next quarter.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

We will now take our next question from William Hawkins from KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - William S. Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Thank you very much. I'm risking repeating a couple of questions, so forgive me. But
just again on the dividend, Alex, in the first half of this year have you just gone back to the
old policy of repeating the second half dividend and only making decisions about
incremental capital at the end of the year or is the €0.11 a genuine standalone decision
and so in theory in the future interim dividends could change year-on-year?
And then secondly, I appreciate you don't want to give guidance on what the U.S. mortality
charge would be, but I'm feeling like I'm swimming a bit in the dark at the moment about
the range of possible expectations. So maybe the question would be can you tell us the
size of the reserves for the specific buckets that you're reviewing? So what is the baseline
reserves that you're actually starting with?
And also if I can tag on to that, you've mentioned trends, you've mentioned reinsurance
recoveries. And I just wanted to be clear to what extent is this review related to a genuine
assessment of gross underlying trends in mortality and to what extent may it reflect
changes in relationship with your reinsurers? Because you've mentioned reinsurance
recoverables, which to my mind may have nothing to do with what's actually going on in
underlying mortality. Thank you.

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Yeah. On the dividends, my answer is simple. It's yes. Theoretically, we make any changes
we want. But again, I want to repeat here, Bill, what we want to do really is have a
dividend that's growing sustainably. I think we've been very consistent in that and that
means to your question, yes.

Q - William S. Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Okay.

FINAL

Yeah. On the U.S. mortality, William, it's – well, first of all, let me give you some of the
numbers behind your question on sizing, at least from a reserve perspective. Total life
reserves in the U.S. are around $28 billion, but this would only impact universal life
because this would be an unlocking event. This would be the FAS 97 business that would
have the P&L, and that's about $15 billion of reserves.
It would be an unlocking event as we change the assumption. Let me just reiterate what I
said before. It is an emerging experience that we're seeing. It's really the only place
where we've seen the mortality thus far deviate from expectations as in the older-age
segment. That's age 85-plusf. There's a new Tillinghast study that was put out at the end
of 2012. We've been studying that as well. It's in the older-age market, so we're basically
looking at those two things and our own experience, and that's the assumption change
that we're looking at making in the third quarter. So I apologize that I haven't been able to
size it for you. We're still working through the numbers in the calculations, and we're still
doing that. That's the one part of the Q3 assumption update that I do have a sightline on
and I wanted to give you a heads up for that now.

Q - William S. Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

And there's no way we can be refining further the $15 billion? It's basically a review of
mortality across that portfolio?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean, it's a review across – it's really a complete review of all of our mortality, so I
don't want to suggest that we're only reviewing the mortality in the older-age segment.
We're doing a complete review of all of our mortality assumptions. The only place that I'm
seeing at this point that we're coming out with the potential change is in this older-age
segment.

Q - William S. Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Okay. All right. Cool. Thank you.

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yes.

We will now take our next question from Albert Ploegh from ING. Please go ahead. Your
line is open, caller. Please go ahead.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Yes, good morning all. A few questions from my end. First of all, on the normalized cash
flows, you mentioned also there is a small negative impact or drag from the autoenrollment in the UK. Can you give some more color on that and what your expectations
are going forward?

Page 7 of 23



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2014-08-14

FINAL

Second question is on the Dutch business also related to, yes, longevity basically. And if
I'm correct, by the end of this year we will have some new tables coming up. Can you
maybe share some thoughts of that as well on whether that could be Q3 or more Q4, if
anything negative? And if there would be a negative update, how will you account for
that? Will you take a one-off charge or you will take it on a quarterly basis going forward,
something you've done in the past as well?
And the final question is basically on the UK. You flag also higher investments in IT in the
second half. Can you maybe quantify a little bit the step-up there that you might expect?
Thank you.

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, Albert, let me take your first couple of questions. On the auto-enrollment drag in
the UK, yeah, it's part of that cash flow – it's really part of the cash flow story coming out
of the UK. The drag right now is about £20 million inside of the UK cash flow numbers. It
has to do with basically the auto-enrollment. As we bring them on, basically these are
typically lower-revenue employees and entrants that we're bringing on, and we have to
set up some additional strength relative to that. So that's just additional statutory
reserving strain. It will release in the future, but that's what we're seeing as we bring these
auto-enrollees on, and that's inside the cash flow numbers.
You also asked about the Dutch mortality tables. Yeah, part of our annual process, we'll
have a look at new tables and new data when it's released later this year. We're not
actually expecting – at this point, I'm not expecting anything from that. So there's nothing I
would signal on that front. If we do see anything, it would likely be Q4 by the time we get
the data and do the analysis. But at this point, there's nothing I'm expecting there.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And to be sure, the 20 million you mentioned for the UK, that's pounds
or euros?

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

It's pounds.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Pounds, okay. And maybe one, yes, final follow-up. On the review that will take place
clearly typically in Q3 on assumptions, clearly the mortality has been flat. Should we also
read into that that, let's say, on the other assumptions at this stage, no meaningful update
or changes are expected?

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yeah, the only thing I would highlight in addition to the assumption review is we did have a
model conversion here in the Netherlands. In the second quarter, we've been converting
a lot of our models, particularly on the pension business here in the Netherlands over to
new software. Basically, I would say modernizing the modeling platform, if you will. We
Page 8 of 23



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2014-08-14

have taken a block of guarantees over this quarter and that had a negative P&L impact.
That was €78 million that's in the fair value number. We have one last book to convert and
that conversion will also happen in the third quarter. So I would say I would also look to a
model conversion in the third quarter.

FINAL

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Okay, great. Thank you.

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

You had also asked about UK investments. Yeah, we are signaling that we do have, from a
sort of a – I guess an expectation from earnings in the next couple of quarters, we do
have the final implementation of some of the technology that we have behind Retiready
and the platform in the UK that we expect will actually take up expenses relative to what
we incurred in the second quarter over the third and fourth quarter. So we are highlighting
that that'll have a small drag on underlying earnings in the third and fourth quarter in the
UK.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

We will now take our next question from Nick Holmes from Société Générale. Please go
ahead.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Hello. Hi there. Thank you very much. A couple of questions. First one is coming back on
the dividend. I think to Farooq's question you said that the interim dividend was held flat
partly because of your intentions with the neutralization of the pref share transaction, i.e.,
a share buyback. Wondered if you could give us more color on that. Are you basically
saying that you're looking to do that in H2 and that's why the interim dividend was held
flat? That's my first question.
The second one is just looking at the U.S. business. Wondered if you could give us a bit
more color on both the variable annuities, which are doing very well, and also the
pensions, which are doing perhaps slightly less well. And you cited margin pressure in
pensions. I just wondered how concerned you are about that. Thank you very much.

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Nick, let me reiterate what I've said on the dividend. We have the policy based on, as you
know, balance sheet, cash flows, we have a strong balance sheet, we're delivering on our
cash flows, and we want to have a dividend that is sustainably growing.
In terms of what I repeated here in relation to neutralizing the dilutive effect on the
preference share transaction with the association, we've said that that commitment is
Page 9 of 23

FINAL

there, but I have not given an indication around timing and I also don't want to do that
right now.
You asked me about the U.S. business. I think actually our VA business is doing well, very
well, but I think our pension business is doing at least as well. Our VA business has been
growing as on the back of growth of distribution, getting much closer with our distributors,
having the right products right now, being able to price them in a good way, in a way that
makes sense for our customers and makes sense for us. We're still making very good
margins and good IRRs on this business. As you can see, despite what is a low interest
rate environment, which I think is extremely positive, we're gaining market share. Although
it is not our ambition to gain market share in itself, what we just see is we are getting
deeper and deeper in distribution and adding new distribution.
In terms of our pension business, I actually think this has been a record quarter of our
pension business. I mentioned in my call $8 billion of gross flows, and was it – $4 billion of
net flows. And I do think that if you compare it to some – to what we've seen recently in
the industry, this is an extremely strong performance. And this performance is on the back
of investments we've been making in the past on our system, which gives us advantages
in terms of the best service levels but also scalability.

Bloomberg Transcript

I want to get that point because we are adding more business while maintaining our
expenses more or less flat. And that is I think what is giving us not only a strong business
in terms of growth, but also a business that is showing a very good earnings going
forward in what is indeed – as you probably recognized, a market where we are seeing
pressure.
The second part of this business, I would like to also bring back to your attention, and that
I think we signaled very clearly in our June conference is that we have now integrated our
pension business with our annuity business with the aim of not only improving the
coordination of our sales and marketing efforts because, effectively, our wholesalers in
both businesses were calling on the same people. We can now put them together and
increase our firepower in terms of sales. But equally important is about the whole
retention, as you know, the retention of customers, of our pension business that at a
certain point in time are going to retire. We've given you the numbers around the June
conference. It's around 4 million customers.
And as I said, what we know for sure is that each of these customers at certain point in
time will retire, will need products and services that we're going to offer them. So this
business in my view is not only doing well. It's doing very well, but it's also setting and
establishing a basis for future growth. That is what we are really truly excited about.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Alex, thank you very much for that very full answer. May I just follow up again, apologies
about this, on the connection with the dividend because you've described a very strong
business performance. You're very happy with that. Why did you then keep the dividend
flat rather than increasing it, say, 5% or something, given the strong underlying
performance?

We will now take our next question from Benoît Pétrarque from Kepler. Please go ahead.

Q - Benoît Pétrarque
Yes, good morning everyone. Just on the, on prior solutions again, sorry. The $4 billion net
inflow, how do you see the margin on this new business? Is that above or below average
on the stock? Could you give us a little bit of feeling about this new business? And also
obviously going forward, I mean, what is your outlook on this business net deposit-wise?
And then maybe just on the JV with Santander in Portugal, could you give us a little bit of
economics, cash outflow probably in the third or fourth quarter and also expected
contribution from the JV?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then last, maybe the improvement in persistence in the UK, you think it's sustainable?
Do you see that actually continuing in the third quarter? Thanks.

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Benoît, thank you. Just to add on, on the question. We've, I think, given you know what we
call the return on net revenue which was up 33%, which shows we're making good
margins on this business including the new business. But again, I'd like to reiterate, this is
the result of a long-term effort of building capabilities that are scalable. That really is the
key here, the scalability of our business. And therefore we're able to add business, and I
think as we shared with you the, to be exact, 33.9% return on net revenue which I think
makes – puts us clearly in the league of those players that are successful in terms of
growing and in terms of profitability.
It's always difficult to predict the next quarter because, in this business, part of it is
deposits that keep on coming from all our participants. We get over 4 million participants
at every quarter and every year add deposits. And the other part of it, and this where we
are being extremely successful this quarter, is takeovers. That means that contracts have
moved from another provider to Aegon. And that is never regular. And sometimes it is
related to corporate activities. In other words, a customer of ours that does an acquisition
and buys another company and integrates pension fund. That's also takeover. And as you
know, we are very strong in what we call the 43B (29:30), the hospital area, and that's an
area where we do see some activity around consolidation which obviously supports – has
been supporting our business.

FINAL

So, I'm confident, but again it's difficult to predict quarter-on-quarter, but I'm very
confident we'll see continued growth on the back of the service. And as you know, we've
been winning the award of the Best Pension Provider in the U.S. and all different awards
which we shared with you in June, so I don't want to do that again here.
Now your question on Santander, we have not disclosed any amounts, and obviously
these amounts are not such that we need to disclose them. What I think is important,
Benoît, is to see here that Santander was very keen to expand with us a successful joint
venture in Spain. That is what is exciting for us because we have in Spain making great
progress. We're working extremely well with them. And to me, the fact that they have
asked us to expand in Portugal is the best guarantee that this is working very well and
they are very satisfied with the way we cooperate and the way we're creating a business
for the customers.

Bloomberg Transcript

Obviously, it's 2 million customers. I mentioned that are potentially customers of the bank
that potentially go to buy insurance, it will take a bit of time, but this is the end of the
market which is the high end of the market. And it's a very under-penetrated customer
base. That's very attractive.
So on the UK, yes, we obviously see continued improvements. Keep in mind we've been
working extremely hard now for a number of years to try to get our expenses down. But
I'm not going to remind you the sheer size of this restructuring, so lower expenses is
supporting it. But what we're seeing is that the investments we've made in the platform
that these are investments that are supporting growth and that are supporting
persistency because at the end, persistency has been one of the drags on our earnings in
the past and I'm pleased to see that we see some improvements on our persistency and
I have every reason to believe that that improvement will continue in the future.

We will now take our next question from Ashik Musaddi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yes, hi. Good morning Alex and Darryl. Just two or three questions. First of all, can you just
give us some color about your update on the Canada and French review that you
mentioned at the Investor Day? Where are we on that? Any update on that?
Secondly, can you give us some color about your net flows in workplace pension? You
flagged in the press release around the net flows in the platform which remains very
strong at €400 million. So how is your workplace pension doing? Are you still getting net
inflows? Because it looks like last year it was kind of net outflows from the whole UK
pension book, so any update on that.

FINAL

And thirdly, I want to touch base a bit on your deleveraging plans. I know it may be early
and you may think of giving those numbers maybe at the next business review, but any
thoughts on what is the absolute level of gross debt are you looking to – are you very
happy with? Or after this deleveraging of a further €500 million, which is already planned,
do you further want to deleverage your book going forward? Yes, these three questions.
Thank you.

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Yeah. On Canada and France, you know we committed to come back to you before the
end of the year. So we have a little bit more time. And I will promise you that we will come
back to you as soon as we have something we want to share and can share with you.
That's an ongoing process. In terms of net flows, in the UK, indeed we have positive net
flows. I think also, as I just answered in the previous question, it's a combination of new
business and better retention. Better retention because the whole RDR activity is now
kind of fading down combined with the fact that we are having and putting in place this
platform, and we have now the Retiready, which is direct-to-consumer capability. So we
have now much more tools that are helping us to retain the business, and I think that is
exactly showing where we want to go.
And finally in terms of net debt, Darryl, would you please take this one?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Well, I think, Ashik, as I said before, I think we are committed to managing within a 26% to
30% gross leverage ratio. We're at 31.2% as we stand here today. We also have
committed to maturing out the senior note in the fourth quarter of this year for €500
million, which will move us down in the range. I think as long as basically I would say my
commitment is to manage within that range, as I've said before, I'm comfortable at the
high end of that range, and over time I would expect this to drift down into the middle,
and I think that's fine. I think as long as you see us over that top-end of the 30%, that we'll
have action plans to get back down within that 26% to 30% range.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

That's very clear. Just one follow-up on the workplace – on the pension net inflows. The
positive net inflows that you mentioned is in workplace or is it the total pension?

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Yeah. I think it's – the way to look at it, Ashik, is you need to see it's improved compared
to last year. It's an overall – yeah, workplace is corporate pensions, but we have individual
pensions, but the area where we've seen the best improvement in persistency is in the
workplace area.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. Sure. That's great. Thank you.

FINAL

Q - William H. Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning everybody. Just one question on the UK and really following up
from the earlier one in terms of the cash flow impact from the expansion of the autoenrollment. Can you just explain how that affects the IFRS earnings you report? I know
you've talked about how it impacts cash, but I was expecting that the underlying UK
pension earnings to have at least remained stable quarter-on-quarter and they seem to
have gone down. I just want to understand how that interacts.

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yeah. The bigger number, the £20 million that I mentioned, is really the strain that comes
through, and we have to set up additional regulatory reserves related to these autoenrollees. It's more of – that is not an IFRS impact. That is a statutory or regulatory impact.
And those reserves will release. So we see basically additional capital strain coming in
from these enrollees, and then that will turn around and release into the future. In terms
of the earnings impact, we have guided that there will be £20 million to £25 million
earnings impact once the legislation kicks in and once the fee capping is put in place. And
as a result, now there really isn't a lot of what I would call IFRS earnings impact on the
DWP other than the cost that we continue to incur to implement the structure or the
project.

We will now take our next question from Jan Willem Knoll from ABN AMRO. Please go

Q - Jan Willem Knoll

{BIO 18247722 <GO>}

Yes, good morning gentlemen. A couple of questions from my side. First, can you explain
the background and the impact of the model updates in the Netherlands mentioned on
slide 16?
And then secondly, can you update us on the impact of using the UFR on the Dutch IGD
ratio?
Lastly, operating expenses rose 8% in the Netherlands. Can you update us on what sort of
normalized run rate we should expect going forward? Thank you.

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yeah, Jan Willem, it's Darryl. Let me jump in here. The model updates, the short answer is
we've been converting our pension business over to a new modeling platform. And what
Page 14 of 23



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2014-08-14

FINAL

we found this quarter in particular when we moved the block of guarantees over, it's
basically new enhanced modeling software, does a better job, allows us with more model
points, more data points, better job with stochastic valuations of our guarantees. So I
would say we're getting an enhanced guarantee valuation for the pension business in the
Netherlands. As I mentioned before, we have one last block to convert which will come in,
in the third quarter.
Operating expenses in the Netherlands, I would say we have what I would consider to be
a run rate level of expenses, but we have had some reclassifications which has caused the
Netherlands expenses to go up a little bit. We had some expenses that we're going
through, the benefit payment line and we've done a deeper analysis on those related to
claims handling cost, and we felt that that would be better represented in the operating
expense line. So a lot of that is largely geography on the income statement.
Your second question I think was UFR related. And I must admit I'm going to leave that
one and let IR come back to you on that one. I just don't have the – I know we disclosed
the number at that time and I just don't have it at my fingertips, so I'm going to ask Willem
to come back to you.

We will now take our next question from Gordon Aitken from RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Yes, morning. Gordon Aitken from RBC here. Three questions please. First on your fee
based businesses in the UK and the U.S., can you just tell us what the revenue basis points
and the cost basis points are and where you see that spread going?
Second, on the Dutch buyout market we're not seeing a lot of activity in Q2 really from
anyone. I'm just wondering why this is. Is it the case that schemes are just not buying it at
all or is it that they're sinking themselves into the industry funds?
And third, on this U.S. mortality, just to what extent are you using standard tables for
reserving versus your own emerging mortality assumptions? Thanks.

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Gordon, on the UK, U.S. fee spreads, these are all different businesses. And I will ask
Willem to come back to you and give you some guidance because it would make no
sense taking it on a total overall basis. So, he'll come back to you separately.
Yeah, on the Dutch buyout market, as we said, and we said many times there is, we
believe, a strong pipeline. We're comfortable that this pipeline will convert at certain point
Page 15 of 23

FINAL

in time. You're right; we've observed also that Q2 has been a quiet quarter for the
market. But this is really no indicator of the next quarters. What I know is that we are wellpositioned in this market. There is a full pipeline, and I'm very comfortable and confident
that we will also be taking a good part of this market.
Also I want to remind you here that we have a very clear pricing discipline. We commit to
that pricing discipline. In particular, we can do so because it's only a small number of
players in this market. And our strong rating clearly puts us in a relatively stronger position.
So we want to make sure that we do the right deals for our customers but also the right
deals for us. But with the pipeline feel that it is, with the activity which I'm aware of taking
place, I'm very confident that we will see the good flow of business coming in this area.

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

On the last question, on the U.S. mortality, I mean, as a general rule, when we build our
mortality tables, we start obviously with industry tables, but then we build on our own
individual experience. And Transamerica is a very large player and with a large amount of
data. So basically I would say most of our mortality tables are driven more off of our own
internal experience and where our data has enough credibility.

Bloomberg Transcript

Maybe the small exception to that rule would be in this older-age market, where I would
say it's emerging data. We don't have as much data, so we're not as credible in our data,
so we do look to additional industry data to supplement our own assumptions and that's
exactly what we're doing now. And there's been a new recent study out on older-age
mortality, so that's why I flagged earlier that that's the area where I see our assumptions
updating in the third quarter.

Question from Steven Haywood from HSBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Steven A. Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Hello. Good morning. I wonder if you could speak a bit about the U.S. internal mergers and
whether there's any update there, particularly in terms of the amount of cost savings
possibly coming out here? And then secondly, with the £20 million to £25 million hit to the
UK earnings, will there be any write-off charge in the future for this as well? Thank you.

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Yeah. In terms of the reorganization which we have announced in the U.S. at the time we
announced it in our June conference, we made it very clear that this was much more
about revenue synergies than it was about cost synergies. Yes, obviously there are cost
synergies, but it has not been the main driver of our business. The main driver of this
decision was about creating a much better coordinated sales force that is approaching

Page 16 of 23

Date: 2014-08-14

FINAL

distributors, which are, in many cases, the same ones. Think about the large buyer houses
and broker dealers. And so we will have some cost initiatives, but I would say that was not
really the first and the clear objective.
And the second thing is we also want to be able to have, within one division, a full suite of
products that addresses the needs of our customers along the entire life cycle. That
means it starts at savings, it starts at corporate pension plans and it ends with annuities
and any other product that helps our customers to retire and to get a flow of income in
the way they desire.
So this is how we should be looking at it, and I think yearly results actually are showing
improvements in terms of retention of our business which, as you know, we've been very
clear that was an objective of us. If we try to keep more of the assets of the customers
that effectively retire and potentially could take the money away from us to keep them
with us. That is where the big opportunity is.
In terms of the earnings in the UK, Darryl, would you like to...

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yeah. In terms of the UK, so the earnings guidance that we've given is based on the fee
compression that we see coming from the cap. The way the accounting works, you would
only accelerate an amortization of an intangible if we came into a recoverability situation.
There isn't an active unlocking mechanism that would bring some of this in their
accelerated amortization. And there's nothing that I see, we still have sufficiency to cover
that, so I don't see any accelerated amortization of intangibles coming from that. So I
would say no to your questions.

We will now take our next question from François Boissin from BNP. Please go ahead.

Q - François Boissin
Yes, good morning everybody. Three questions please. The first question is with regard
to your model refinement in the Netherlands. I just wondered if you could give a bit more
details of what you're doing there and what you can expect for the next quarter?
Second question, in the UK you're talking about de-risking initiatives. I just wanted to get a
feel of what that means for your Solvency II capital base and if it could impact negatively
your earnings going forward?
And third question regarding the overall margin outlook on new business. You've had
stable new business margins Q-on-Q which is quite an achievement given the fact that
Page 17 of 23



Company N ame: Aegon N V

rates have gone down. Just wondered if it's reasonable to expect a drop in margins going
forward? Thanks.

FINAL

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yeah, François. Let me give a shot here. So on the model changes in NL, as I've
mentioned before, we've converted a block of pension guarantee business over to more,
what I would call, modern, sophisticated modeling software. It has increased the valuation
of those guarantees. I don't have a number to give you for the third quarter, but the block
we have left is about the same size of block that we did in the second quarter. So that
might give you a little bit of guide post.

Q - François Boissin
And the impact in Q3 was close to €100 million, right?

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

In Q2, it was €78 million.

Q - François Boissin
In Q2, sorry, yeah. €78 million, okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yeah. In UK, de-risking, that's exactly that we've been doing, is repositioning the portfolio
to get ready for Solvency II. We've been taking risk, credit risk, in particular, out of the
portfolio. We've sold some callable bonds. We've done some trading to bring in some
more inflation-protected gilts as an example. So this is repositioning for Solvency II that will
have a beneficial impact under the mark-to-market capital regime in Solvency II and the
volatility that comes with that regime. It has come at a little bit of a cost of giving up some
running yield. So there's been a small impact there and a small impact on the current
metrics. But it has been Solvency II repositioning is what I would say there and overall derisking.
Margins on new business, I would just broadly say we're very pleased that we've – with
the top line numbers, the sales, as Alex mentioned before, and we've been able to hold
margin that we haven't had to sacrifice our pricing or pricing discipline to hold that top line
and margin still holds strong. And I see that continuing into the third and fourth quarter.

Yes, morning. It's Michael van Wegen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. I wanted to go to
your slide five where you basically show a cost/income ratio. You talked about the
improvements that you've made so far. You achieved 59% for H1. Despite the
improvement I think that number is still well above what we consider to be the average
for Europe. I suspect a large part of that is driven by the UK. Can you talk a little bit about
how that ratio would look like for your main three regions? And if you were to be
successful with the restructuring on the UK where that number would be heading to?
Thank you.

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, Michael. We've given this number in June I think for the first time. So we are giving
you this year for the full first six months. Obviously, we want to get this number down. I
think you need to be – we need to be careful in comparing this with others because I'm
not sure we all do this on the same way, been seeing it and that was the reason why we
have not given you a more granular set of numbers right now because we want to have a
good understanding also what others are doing. So we have something which is
comparable because there's a lot of different ways of presenting this. But you're right, the
UK clearly does not help this number and the UK is clearly above the average.
And as you know, we've been clear that we need to take further – the expenses further
down in UK. There is a plan which needs to be executed between now and 2015, and
we're working hard in executing the plan which will take expenses further down in the UK.
That will help the overall number. But I would just caution you, in making comparisons, we
will provide going forward more granularity around this because it is important that what
we have is comparable. But the number, yes, will trend down, and the UK will support a
further trending down.

aftermath of the FCA fine on Stonebridge International, whether you see any sort of
problems with reputational damage or any impact on sales as a result of the fine. And I
wanted to ask whether you expect any litigation to result and also whether the fine itself
or the findings of the FCA will require any changes in your management controls or
policies there. Thank you.

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

these are activities actually which we stopped a couple of years ago. So we have taken
action, we've taken action in terms of stopping sales of this product. We have taken action
on the management but that has already taken place and we are making sure that in no
other place in our business – and we are reviewing it very thoroughly – there's anything
similar. So we are taking action and have taken the actions. And what you see right now is
the fine which comes later, obviously, and as such, should close this whole file. And we're
not expecting anything further from here.

ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Archie van Riemsdijk
Yes. Good morning. I have some questions on the pension sales. In the Netherlands, you
state that you're confident that there will be – you will take part of the consolidation in a
way. But is there another risk that other players will take over the market because it
seems that's sort of what has been happening in the second quarter?

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

As I said earlier in the call, I just want to be careful not to repeat myself, there is a pipeline.
Aegon is very well-positioned. Aegon has a very strong balance sheet, has administrative
capabilities that are in order. We're well-positioned to take advantage of the pipeline. I
also said the pipeline is not a regular pipeline. It's not back in flow. It comes and goes. And
certain points in time, we see more. And other points in time, we see less. I've made it
very clear that I'm comfortable and confident that Aegon will get more than its fair share
of the market based on what I'm seeing in terms of pipeline activity but also the
capabilities we have in the sector.

Q - Archie van Riemsdijk
All right. Thank you very much. If I may, just additional question on the pension contracts in

FINAL

Well, in the U.S., we see two elements here. One is deposits that come from all our
customers, all our customers save for their pensions directly to employers. Sometimes
they also add themselves, their only contribution. So that's a big part of the flows we're
getting.
In addition to that, we've been very successful taking pension plans over from other
participants – from other, excuse me, providers. And these are pension plans for
companies that have decided that they want to take advantage of the services and
capabilities of Aegon and Transamerica in the U.S. And these are large corporate plans,
401(k) plans or what you're very familiar with.
And I think as I said earlier, this is on the back of really strong capabilities in terms of
services we provide, the whole way we interact with the employees and that's what
employers like. Secondly, because we have a very scalable pension capabilities, we're
also able to provide this at attractive pricing and we're able to be competitive in the
market, which is quite a tough market. That's scalability. That is supporting our success in
the business. And as such, I have every reason to believe and to be confident that the
positive momentum will continue.

We will now take our next question from Archie van Riemsdijk's from Dow Jones. Please
go ahead.

Q - Archie van Riemsdijk
Yes. I had one additional question. I understand that Solvency II regulations will cause
Aegon to lose kind of a capital benefit due to diversification. Is this something that could
have strategic consequences and maybe you can expand a bit on the effect of Solvency II
in this respect.

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, Archie, it's Darryl. I wouldn't say that Solvency II causes us to lose a diversification
benefit. We have – diversification comes in our business in various ways. There's
diversification in really in most of the capital formulas and the regions that we operate
within. There's been an open debate within the Solvency II paradigm itself around how
much diversification benefit should be taken once you start doing the group calculations
which is a new element of Solvency II. And that continues to be a fluid debate backed by
conversations on fungibility of capital and things like that.
So, that's a – I would consider that a fluid debate that's still happening on the overall
aggregate Solvency II. It doesn't impact any of the solo capital calculations, then I would
not characterize it as us losing anything that we already have. That's for sure.

Q - Archie van Riemsdijk
All right. Sorry, am I still on the call?

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

You are.

Q - Archie van Riemsdijk
Okay. On the – well, to explain it a little bit better, does it – could the results mean that you
will have to keep on increasing your capital more, or is this not for a longer time than
expected earlier? Or is this within the balance of your strategy?

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Well, I certainly can't comment anymore than we did in June in terms of where the overall
Solvency II work is at for the company, so I would point you back to our presentation in
Page 22 of 23

June. What I would say is, again, it comes back to – even within Solvency II, it's a matter of
managing capital in the solo which would be the individual country regions of where we do
business. And so I don't see a restriction related to group diversification in Solvency II
coming in that causes a material change from how we manage capital locally. And that's
really all I can say in the context of we're still finalizing the Solvency II framework.
