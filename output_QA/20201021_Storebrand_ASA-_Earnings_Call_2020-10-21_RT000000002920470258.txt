{BIO 20548519 <GO>}

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Storebrand's Third Quarter Result
Presentation. My name is Daniel Sundahl, I'm Head of Investor Relations at Storebrand.
Today, CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad will start by taking you through the highlights of the
quarter, and afterwards, CFO, Lars Loddesol will take you deeper into the numbers. At the
end of the presentation, we will open up for Q&A. (Operator Instructions) But without
further ado, I give the word to CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad.

Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Thank you, Daniel. First a quick update on COVID-19. In the third quarter, the situation in
the Norwegian and Swedish society following the COVID-19 pandemic have continued to
normalize. As an impact of the pandemic, the corresponding -- and the corresponding
economic downturn Storebrand's results were negatively aﬀected in the ﬁrst quarter. But
the ﬁnancial loss -- ﬁnancial losses have to a large extent been reversed over the last two
quarters. Storebrand has remained fully operational with close to normal productivity and
has experienced strong underlying growth this year, despite the pandemic.
Today, we present the best third quarter operating proﬁt in Storebrands history. Growth
within savings and insurance segment combined with rebounding ﬁnancial markets and a
strong cost control are the main drivers for the proﬁt development. Storebrand's group

proﬁt for the third quarter was NOK1,012 million. Unit-linked premiums grew by 22% and
the insurance growth was 15% compared to third quarter 2019.
Asset under management increased to a record high level of NOK921 billion, and this
solidiﬁes Storebrand's position as a leading Norwegian asset manager. The solvency ratio
was 179% at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 16 percentage points from last
quarter. The solvency ratio without transitionals increased by 13 percentage points to
150%. The increase is due to positive returns on credit bonds and equities, as well as
pricing measures in parts of our guaranteed book of business.
The Board remains committed to pay a normal dividend in 2021. To start the share
buyback program, the Board will make a forward-looking assessment, including the view
on the run-oﬀ of the transitionals. With today's interest rate level, the Board do not expect
to start this program during 2021. We will of course revert to more details around capital
management in our Capital Markets Day in December.

Bloomberg Transcript

Storebrand continued to follow our two folded strategy. We actively manage our balance
sheet and risk in the guaranteed book of business that are in long-term runoﬀ. Solvency is
at 179% at the end of the third quarter, and our operational costs is developing according
to plan. Actually, we report lower nominal costs this year compared to eight years ago
adjusted for acquired businesses.
In the front book, we harvest capital-light growth through our leading position in
occupational pension in Norway and Sweden, as well as the individual market for savings
and insurance in Norway. We are recognized strong growth in asset management based
on our leading position in sustainable investments.
This picture illustrates the growth in our front book. Unit-linked reserves grew by NOK45
billion compared to third quarter of 2019. These represent a 22% growth. Total net
transfer so far this year is NOK6.2 billion. Asset general management increased by
NOK134 billion to record high NOK921 billion, this is a 17% growth. Market returns and net
ﬂows of NOK35 billion year-to-date is the main drivers for this growth. Within insurance,
the annual portfolio premium grew by 15% compared to the same period last year. This is
in line with our double-digit growth ambitions. Proﬁtability is good, the reported
combined ratio is 88% in the third quarter. Lending volumes in the Storebrand bank
amounted to NOK48 billion, an increase of 2% compared to the same period last year.
The growth in lending has slowed since we now approach the targeted level of NOK 50
billion in mortgages.
On the next two slides, I will give you some examples of how we in the third quarter have
seen important breakthrough within targeted growth areas, such as the new oﬀering in
public pension, in our segment of insurance and a breakthrough within international
sustainable asset management. In the market for public pension, Storebrand has been
elected to be the new provider of public occupational pension for Westland County, that
is one of the largest public pension accounts in the market. This contract includes more
than 11,000 current and former employees and a transfer of NOK3.7 billion. When it
comes to insurance, Storebrands has in this quarter successfully entered into an

FINAL

agreement with Insr Insurance Group to acquire their insurance portfolio. That will add up
to 2% market share within our P&C business.
Storebrand has continued to hold the position as a leading provider of sustainable
investment solutions. In the quarter, a new wide-ranging climate policy for investment was
launched to increase action on climate and accelerate the green transition. With this
investment policy, we strengthened our role as a sustainable asset manager contributing
to reduced carbon emissions, leading to reduced climate risk and secure long-term
returns. The policy utilize all our investment tools, including increased investments in
solutions, active ownership and divestments.
In this -- it is therefore with great pride I announce that our broad family of sustainable
funds also is recognized by the international audience, result in winning international
mandates. And in the third quarter, we have won a large sustainable mandate in the U.K.
And with that, I give the word to our CFO, Lars Loddesol.

Thank you, Odd Arild. So the third quarter of 2020 was a good quarter for Storebrand.
Operating results are back on track after a bumpy ﬁrst half of the year. The operating
result of NOK703 million is as far as I can recall the best in the history of the company. In
addition, the ﬁnancial result was strong at NOK340 million, leading to a result before
amortization and tax of NOK1,012 million.
In addition, we have accrued NOK49 million in performance fees in the quarter. The
accumulated accrued performance fees year-to-date totaled NOK137 million, which will
be booked in the fourth quarter. Earnings per share after-tax adjusted for amortization is
strong at NOK1.90 per share. There is a rebound in the solvency from both lower SCR and
higher own funds. I will revert to this shortly.
Customer buﬀers have been rebuilt and are at historical highs, securing returns to
policyholders and protecting shareholders capital. The solvency movement in the third
quarter has been strong. There is an overview -- here is an overview of the most important
steps in that movement. Every year in the third quarter, we performed a form of thorough
review of all model and assumptions. Net-net the biometric factors have a neutral eﬀect
on solvency. The most important factor in the 2 percentage point improvement is related
to lower cost and the introduction of individual pension accounts from next year.
Updated pricing and derisk strategy, includes pricing increases in the deﬁned beneﬁt
portfolio in Norway as a consequence of lower market rates, including an improved
modeling of future pricing ﬂexibility. De-risk strategy is related to how we act in times of
market corrections, like the one we saw in February, March this year and how this has
been incorporated in the modeling. The correction in the spring gave valuable
knowledge on risk mitigation and tested our strategy implementation. In combination,
this gives a positive contribution of 5 percentage points.

FINAL

The negative movement of 3 percentage points in updated volatility adjustment and
symmetric equity adjustment is primarily related to a lower volatility adjustment, which
have gone down by 6 pps in Norway to 30 basis points and by 2 pps to 15 basis points in
Sweden. The equity stress is up by only 0.3%, despite strong equity markets in the third
quarter. This is due to EIOPA calculating the equity stress based on relatively weak
European equity markets in the quarter.
Our investments are closer to the MSCI World, which have contributed to good returns
without a parallel negative contribution from the stress factor. This means that we have
beneﬁted from good equity returns without the corresponding increase in the equity
stress. Asset return and allocation have been positive by 8 percentage points. 10
percentage points is primarily related to good credit markets but also supportive equity
markets.

Bloomberg Transcript

With the increased risk capacity, we have increased our equity exposure sum during the
quarter. The increase in equity exposure increases expected returns going forward, but
reduce the solvency by 2 percentage points for a total movement of 8 percentage points.
The result after tax with amortization added back is NOK889 million, which contributes 3
percentage points to the solvency, before we set aside NOK350 million for dividends.
The transitional capital increases by 3 percentage points in the quarter.
This picture shows again the movement in the solvency margin as well as sensitivities in
diﬀerent scenarios. The sensitivities show an overall resilience to diﬀerent market
movements. Despite this, we know from the solvency movements earlier this year that we
can experience basis risk between volatility adjustment and credit spreads, a disconnect
between equity returns and equity stress, and twists in the interest rate curves that can
cause cost eﬀects not fully captured by these sensitivities on a quarterly basis.
Fee and administration income is up 7% year-to-date. Insurance results are strong pretty
much across all products. There is still strong cost control and the ﬁxed cost base has
been reduced. The operating cost line includes both performance related expenses
relating to investment products as well as increased sales commissions to external agents.
Financial return has been strong with contracting credit spreads and positive equity
markets. Tax is lower than normal due to the composition of the results, where the good
ﬁnancial return in SPP reduces the average group tax rate in the quarter. The normal tax
rate remains at 20% to 23%. The proﬁt after tax at NOK1,483 million year-to-date is
actually better than last year despite of the pandemic. This is partly explained by the tax
gains in the ﬁrst quarter and partly by the good results in the third quarter.
Splitting up the results in the three proﬁt areas, savings, insurance and guaranteed, we
see savings contributing with strong growth in assets under management; insurance
returning to good proﬁtability from portfolio growth and lower claims; and guaranteed,
especially from Sweden, recuperating some of the losses from the ﬁrst half of the year.
Other shows good returns in the company portfolios, especially from contraction in credit
spreads.

FINAL

Despite some margin pressure, the savings area shows good growth. Good cost control
and improving results in line with our ambition and strategy. All of the business lines show
improvement with the exception of the bank, which is hurt by the low interest rate level.
The bank has reﬁnanced debt with a negative one-oﬀ eﬀect in the quarter of NOK11
million, which will reduce future borrowing costs. The asset management company shows
the strongest ever ﬁxed result in the quarter and ﬁxed result is the result with our adjusted
for performance fees.
This picture illustrates the strong growth in reserves and assets under management. The
slight fall in premiums from the ﬁrst and second quarter is primarily a result of
extraordinary good sales of one-oﬀ premiums in Sweden in the ﬁrst half of the year. 22%
growth in unit-linked reserves, and total assets under management approaching a cool
NOK 1 trillion show that our growth strategy works well. The insurance area is back on
track after three week quarters, all business lines performed satisfactory in the third
quarter. A combined ratio of 88% is better than planned after quarter with very few large
claims. We have strong growth in all business lines. The growth is partly driven by price
increases and partly by good sales. New partnerships in distribution show promising
results. The Insr portfolio transfer will start December 1, and should ensure continued
strong growth throughout next year.
The guaranteed area is in long-term runoﬀ. Overall, the results are satisfactory, but
underlying there are weak results in deﬁned beneﬁt Norway with a negative disability
result from less reactivation i.e., people on sick leave that will -- are not returning to work
through this COVID period. The results from Sweden are up, where SPP now has a
consolidation which allow indexation of pensions with the corresponding indexation fee
to SPP. Furthermore, good ﬁnancial return has allowed SPP to reverse deferred capital
contributions from the ﬁrst half of the year. The level of guaranteed AUM as a percentage
of total pension AUM or assets under management continues to decline and is now
52.4%.
The buﬀer levels are at all times high and secure future customer returns as well as
protecting shareholders capital. As we said at the second quarter, despite the low interest
rate level we can, subject to normal risk premiums in the market, deliver guaranteed rates
of return and not dip into the buﬀers on the balance sheet for the next decennium, the
next 10 years. And if market returns in any speciﬁc year are lower, the buﬀers are an
eﬃcient risk management tool to deal with that kind of market volatility. We will obviously
dig deeper into this on our upcoming Capital Markets Day. In this segment, we see that
most of the mark-to-market losses in the company portfolios from the ﬁrst quarter has
been recuperated.
And with that, we move over to a Q&A, I don't know if you want to say something about
the Capital Markets Day, ﬁrst, Daniel?

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We have a couple of them coming in already, and the
ﬁrst one is from Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead, your line is now
open.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks very much. First of all, congratulations on a great result, I guess, probably not be
surprised if my ﬁrst question is on the solvency. And I guess that parts of the beat comes
from dynamic modeling of pricing and asset allocation. And I know you did a lot of work
over the summer as you indicated and help by your experience year-to-date, but it still
came as a bit of a surprise to me that you were able to ﬁnd these big levers to pull, ﬁve
years after Solvency II ﬁrst came in.
So I was just wondered, could you conﬁrm how much the dynamic modeling added itself?
And also, are there any speciﬁc reasons why you were able to model them now, but
couldn't before, what particularly has happened there? And then maybe separately on the
solvency, I was a bit surprised that the individual accounts add solvency, perhaps you
could just explain what's happening there?
And then a second area was on the disability reserves that you set up in Q1 and you
commented brieﬂy on those I think, but I was just wondering if you could say where you
are on the review of that or what the risk is upside or downside to revisiting those? And
also maybe if the news ﬂow on the virus continues to deteriorate? I'll leave it there actually
because it will be too long otherwise. Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Thanks Peter for your questions. On the dynamic modeling, it's -- there was a very
signiﬁcant interest rate fall in Norway in the ﬁrst quarter. And as a consequence, we -- as
you know from before, we have an annual rate of return guarantee on the deﬁned beneﬁt
portfolios. And when rates fell signiﬁcantly we were able to, according to the models that
we use, to raise the prices in deﬁned beneﬁt with approximately NOK40 million to
NOK50 million per annum next year.
And that dynamic that has been built into the pricing of deﬁned beneﬁt is captured by the
solvency model. And when we model these things, we need to have it documented and
proven and demonstrated in order to be able to capture the solvency eﬀect. So that -- the

Page 6 of 17

Date: 2020-10-21

interest rate fall made it possible for us to do all of those things, and therefore model it
correctly.

FINAL

On the IPA, the -- it's correct that, that has had a positive contribution, but that is like
second and third order eﬀects in terms of how you calculate the overall own funds
contribution as well as SCR in the stressed scenarios on these IPAs and the dynamics in
the market.

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

In general, I think you can say that the lapse risk becomes a little bit smaller when you
model the individual pension accounts compared to the modeling earlier.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

And the third element on your disability reserves, it's related to, as I mentioned, deﬁned
in all of our portfolios, in this particular case, the deﬁned beneﬁt portfolio. There is an
expectation that some of the people on sick leave will return to the workforce. That has
been much more diﬃcult throughout the summer with a much weaker work market in
these COVID situation. And therefore, we have seen less reactivation, i.e., less people
returning to the workforce than we would expect on a normal basis. And we have had a
minor or we had a weak result in the quarter and a minor reserve strengthening for the
remaining of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

When it comes to the reserve strengthening within the ﬁrst quarter and the development
of disability or lower, we see -- we don't see the eﬀect that we really take into account
during the ﬁrst quarter where we expected higher disability due to the fact that there
always was a lot of people on leave from the work. But it's still early days, so we don't take
that into account. We are very satisﬁed with our reservation and follow the situation, of
course, thoroughly going forward.

Q - Hakon Astrup

{BIO 18861149 <GO>}

Good morning. Two questions from me. The ﬁrst one on the individual pension account.
Can you provide an update there on how you see that will impact your fees going
forward? And also, what do you have for mitigating measures? That was the ﬁrst question.
And the second question is also on solvency. You are closing in now on 190%. And based
on the information that you have today, when do you expect it to start to pay oﬀ the
capital, which is tied up in the back book? Thank you.

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

FINAL

Let me start with the individual pension account. We expect that now to go live during the
ﬁrst quarter of our 2021. As you know, there will be the harmonized price for the pension,
the active account of deﬁned contribution and the pension certiﬁcates. And the estimate
that was done early days from a regulator was that it will reduce the fees for the life
insurance industry altogether in Norway with around NOK800 million.
And, of course, Storebrand being the main provider, we've 30% market share, you can
then see what will be the eﬀect approximately when it comes to income. Then of course,
the tools to mitigate that is, of course, some pricing eﬀects. It is a reduced cost and we
work very thorough with our cost base. And the third in itself is that you see strong growth
in this portfolio that over time will, of course, take into account their reduced fees, but we
have a strong growth in volumes.
The second question was about solvency and approaching now 179%. As I said, the Board
have the view, of course, about the solvency without transitionals and solvency with
transitionals, and the view of the run oﬀ of the the transitional capital when they make the
decision about our capitalization. They make the statement now that they don't expect to
start this share buyback program during 2021. And as I said, we will revert to both the
runoﬀ proﬁle of the transitionals and more comments around timing of share buyback
programs in our Capital Markets Day, at the 10th of December.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

And Hakon, as you know, both some of the transitionals will go away January 1, as well as
the lower UFR will be introduced according to the rules at the January 1. So we know that
some of this capital -- the transitional capital and the UFR based capital will be reduced in
January 1st.

Okay. Thank you.

Next question comes from Ashik Mussadi from JP Morgan, please go ahead. Your line is
now open.

Q - Ashik Mussadi
Thank you. And good morning Arild and Lars. Very strong results today, so
congratulations. I have a few questions, if you can help me. So ﬁrst of all, is it possible to
get like a cost number for 2020, what you're expecting? Because it's still hard for us to
think about what is the normalized number because you have done M&A, et cetera, so
your cost target is very clear that adjusting for M&A et cetera, you want to maintain a ﬂat
cost base. But is it possible to get a hard number for 2020, what you're looking for? Or
what is the normalized ﬂat cost number that should be there?

FINAL

Second thing on individual pension account. I mean, I agree that you have given some
clarity that NOK800 million is the forecast by the regulator that was done long back, I
think two, three years back. But we are just 1 quarter away from this to start getting eﬀect
into your portfolio. So, would you give us some clarity as to what sort of revenue, net of
cost, you're expecting to be impacted in 2021? So this is just like next year, how much do
you think the revenue or piece will come down on this basis?
And the third one is, can you just give some clarity on this Solvency II? You mentioned
some transitional and UFRs will reduce the solvency ratio on 1st of January, what would be
that number on 1st of January? So that would be great. Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Okay. Cost for the full year, you can expect the cost in the fourth quarter to be somewhat
higher than what it was this quarter, as there is more activity in the fourth quarter. We
don't have the exact ﬁgure, but as we said, if you remove the performance related fees as
well as acquired business, the cost levels should be, and we will demonstrate this when
we come this far, will be lower in 2020 than it was in 2012, and in the years '15 and '18 in
between.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the IPA and income eﬀect, as we have said, we are doing some diﬀerent measures in
order to maintain revenue. For competitive reasons, we cannot go into details about these
measures, and furthermore it's diﬃcult for us to assess the exact impact as of this stage.
So, we will shed some more light on that on Capital Markets Day. But I think actually the
market has to ﬁnd a new balance in order for us to come with a correct answer on that
question.
And on Solvency II and the transitional measures going away, it's 1/16 every year. However,
there's slightly more under Norwegian regulations due to some cut oﬀs between the
Solvency I requirements and Solvency II requirements. On the UFR, remind me, is it 5
basis points we expect next quarter? Or is it another 15?

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

I think it's another 15 basis points that the UFR is reduced with -- in the ﬁrst quarter of
2021. And the sensitivity on that --

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

We showed it in the second quarter. I don't think it's in the package this time, but we
showed it the last time, so you can ﬁnd the numbers there.

Q - Ashik Mussadi
Okay. That's very clear. Thank you.

solvency when you look back on the sensitivities.

Sure. Thanks.

The next question comes from Vegard Toverud from Pareto Securities. Please go ahead,
the line is now open.

Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

Thank you. I just have a couple of questions on the repricing of these the DB portfolio in
Norway. If it could be some -- give us some numbers or be a little more speciﬁc on what
this repricing means for the P&L? And also on the DC side, as I understood the report,
both income and costs were somewhat lower in the quarter due to lower activity. Is it
possible also to quantify the impact on income and costs for the DC products in Norway
and Sweden? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

So on the repricing of deﬁned beneﬁt, as I said, the annual interest rate guarantee is more
expensive when rates -- market rates go down. And I think I mentioned that we expect a
positive impact on revenue in the DB portfolio of NOK40 million to NOK50 million above
what it would otherwise be. But then again, if you compare to -- we still have closures of
DB schemes, so it's not necessarily -- it's not NOK50 million higher than last year because
we had more DB clients last year. And also in the deﬁned beneﬁt, I think we have
previously seen that the risk results are going to contribute NOK40 million to NOK50
million a quarter, that's probably a slightly lower numbers. But there will be a positive
contribution of some NOK20 million or something on the DB portfolio net-net.
On DC, there is -- as we've seen in the papers and in the Norwegian market, it's been very
tough competition in the DC market this year. And there is some margin erosion that you
can see in the numbers and illustrated with more details in the supplementary
information. So, I guess that is going to continue into next year with IPA.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

And as for concrete guidance on kind of eﬀects from costs in the line, I think it's more the
general comment that Lars gave that Q3 costs are normally a little bit lower than what we
expect to see in Q4.

Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

Okay. So, I'm just referring to the text in the report which says that the public margins
decreased due to lower activity-based fees from pension and administrative services.

That is -- yeah, we can --

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

FINAL

It's roughly NOK10 million compared to the earlier quarters or normal quarters. But there
is always some seasonality in those fees.

Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

Sorry, is it possible to repeat that number, whether you expect that number to be the
same next quarter or go back to a normal level?

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

There's always variation in those types of fees, depending on the activities we have in
these types of services. So it's impossible to say what's going to be next quarter, but
compared to earlier quarter this year or earlier quarters this year, it's approximately
NOK10 million lower.

Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, thank you. And just to follow-up on Lars' reply there earlier. The repricing is done
only on the guaranteed element, there's no repricing of the administrative fee element for
the DB portfolio.

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

No, it's primarily the annual interest rate guarantee.

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning, all. I've got a couple of questions left. Interesting that you've
moved back into the public pensions market. Could you just remind us of the
characteristics of these types of schemes that are coming in? Are they similar to what's on
the books already? Or has it got -- do you expect diﬀerent types of proﬁtability
characteristics?
Secondly, just again a reminder that actually the SPP consolidation ratio has gone through
108%. Could you just update us on the impact that would have on ongoing proﬁts into

And thirdly, I noticed in the insurance segment, a combined ratio of 88%, obviously,
above -- sorry, well, better than your target, let's say. Is there anything going on there
speciﬁcally in the quarter that's exceptional? Or just any explanation on that very good
combined ratio? Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Thank you, Blair. Let's start with the public sector market and the municipality market. As
you know, it's dominated well by one player today, the KLP, Storebrand is now entering
into this market. It's a healthy proﬁtability in this market. The product is, I will say, similar to
the deﬁned beneﬁt product in Norway, but there is well paid up policies as a part of that
product. Its rights that they have to be covered from the municipality in itself. So it's some
guarantee elements in it, but it's price guarantees and it's hedged risk compared to the
paid-up policies. And it's a healthy product when it comes to pricing.

Q - Blair Thomson Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Is it quite capital light on the solvency basis?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yes. Absolutely. It's a capital light product. It is.

On SPP consolidation, you are correct, it's now above 107% at which time we can take an
indexation. Which means that we write-oﬀ the pensions to the customers and we take an
indexation fee. With the largest portfolio being where it is now, we can expect to take
approximately NOK120 million a year, which means NOK30 million a quarter.
For some reason, this is set as of September 30th, which means that it has already been -we already have the numbers that make this available to take now for this year and we
can, therefore, say with a very high degree of probability that we will get another NOK30
million in the fourth quarter.
And then into next year, with -- if we have normal returns in Sweden, we will continue to
book NOK30 million per quarter. If consolidation goes even higher in some of the
portfolios, there is an opportunity to increase that somewhat, but not a lot more. But it's -it will be approximately NOK120 million a year going forward.
And on combined ratio of 88%, as I mentioned, we had very few large claims in the third
quarter, a few ﬁres, few very expensive car crashes, et cetera, which therefore made it a
good quarter. And I think Gjensidige experienced similar results in their portfolio from the
results that they gave out on Tuesday.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

Yeah. Thanks, Lars. I missed that comment. Thank you.

And our insurance portfolio is, of course, growing very fast with double-digit growth. In
Norway, we don't use any deferred acquisition costs. So all the costs are taken for that
growth upfront, so that also is a very important element to understand when you look at
these numbers and these strong results.

Next question comes from Jan Erik Gjerland from ABG Sundal Collier. Please go ahead,
line is now open.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning to you. I have three sort of questions. The ﬁrst one is to this PKB, the
Pension Capital Certiﬁcates. Could you give us the AUM you have look for the PKB as of
today? And as well, what kind of margin you really see on the new book you're writing
currently, so that we understand maybe the mathematics behind it.

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly on the solvency side, is any of your, sort of, disability changes inside the
solvency? Or is it just purely all of the things you have mentioned so far? Or is there any
sort of GDP or unemployment inspired stuﬀ into the solvency that we should be aware of?
And then on the solvency, would you consider hybrids so to boost it so that you will be
above 180% at any time? And ﬁnally, on the cost, you mentioned some NOK43 million on
reversed cost in the other segment, is that actually booked as a cost? Or is it as a reduced
ﬁnancial element or increased ﬁnancial element? Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Let's start with the Pensions Capital Certiﬁcates. We have about NOK35 billion in Pension
Capital Certiﬁcates in AUM. And the pricing is public, these are -- we charge a fee of
maximum NOK400 for capital certiﬁcate and maximum 2% if it's a small Pension Capital
Certiﬁcate. The average is substantially lower.

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

On solvency, I think I mentioned that we've gone through all the biometric factors in the
solvency model. And net-net, they are neutral and there are no big eﬀects. So we've also
gone through disability and longevity and all of those things as part of that. So there's a
thorough review every third quarter and this review this year did not lead to any
signiﬁcant changes either way.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

When it comes to boost the solvency, as you see, we are working very hard with the
solvency and numbers on a quarterly basis. The most important is the proﬁtability of the
business. To increase that, we look very thorough on lifting our underlying solvency ratio
and, of course, that is a part of the toolbox for using, for increasing solvency going
forward. And the management and the Board is very eager to reach to the levels we have
pointed to be really lower capitalized and start, of course, doing share buybacks as soon
as possible.

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

And the hybrid in itself, where the current numbers are too small to impact the solvency
overall, but if we create a new proﬁtable business area and growth, that will obviously
impact the capital generation going forward.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. On the cost side, in others, this small NOK43 million you mentioned in the text, is it
a cost element? Or is it an increased ﬁnancial return element?

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Increased ﬁnancial return element.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. So it's nothing to do with the lower-cost you reported in this quarter?

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

No.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

And have you done any calculation on the cost side? How much is sort of lower activity
driven or COVID-19 driven related lower cost in this fantastic cost number?

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

We work hard with the cost. We've promised the markets that the cost level in 2020
should be below 2018, '15 and '12. And we are going to deliver on that. We spend a lot of
time making sure that we have good cost control. And in terms of forward looking
statements on cost, we will revert to that on Capital Markets Day on December 1st -- no,
December 10th, I'm sorry. But with -- I'm not go into the breakdown of exactly where the
cost cut, or how the cost -- the diﬀerent cost elements, I don't think that makes sense.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

I think it is fair to say that there is quite limited impact on the cost levels from the
pandemic. Of course, there's been less traveling, as for everyone, and there has been

somewhat lower spending, especially in the third quarter when it comes to marketing. But
above that, I think it's very limited impact on our cost numbers.

(Operator Instructions) The next question comes from Thomas Svendsen from SEB. Please
go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Thomas Svendsen

{BIO 6070863 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Two questions. Could you just remind us about the market size and
the revenue pool you see in this public market? And also what market share you are
targeting there? And question number two, you have earlier guided for -- in the unit
linked operations you have guided for 12% to 15% AUM growth per year, should we still
consider this valid? Or should the -- you expect the growth to be lower now, now that as
most of the Norwegian corporations has converted from the DB schemes into unit linked
schemes. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Just quick on the proﬁt pool in public sector, it's of course a bit diﬃcult to talk about
because there is a municipality company having almost a monopole position in that
business today. But what you see is that the annual premiums in public sector is estimated
to be around NOK52 billion versus the premiums in deﬁned contribution in the private
sector is NOK29 billion. So it's a market double the size of what we see in private sector,
it's a proﬁtable market. And of course, we are a new entrant in this market, very happy to
see that we are able to win one of the largest and most complex account available in the
market. And we see this as a real opening of the market. With this NOK4 billion, NOK5
billion that we expect to -- well, dig into the public sector this year, this is a real opening of
the market and we expect to see at least the same numbers in the years to come as inﬂow
into our business. Then the market share will be what it is going forward.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

And in terms of unit linked and the growth, it is correct that most corporations have now
close to deﬁned beneﬁt schemes and going to deﬁne contribution schemes. However,
there is still an increase in the workforce, there is an increase in the savings level on the
unit linked contracts. And most importantly, very few people with the deﬁned contribution
scheme has reached retirement, so the payouts are very small compared to the pay-ins.
So yes, we do expect more than double-digit growth in AUM on a normalized basis within
unit linked in the years to come.

Q - Thomas Svendsen

{BIO 6070863 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you for that.

And we have one more question, the last one in the queue, and it's from Peter Eliot from
Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead, your line is open again. Thank you.

FINAL

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you so much. Just one very small follow-up actually on the municipality business. I
mean, obviously, congratulations on winning that contract. I mean, I understand that the
activity has been much, much lower than we might have expected. Might we still get more
good news this year? Or is that pretty much it? And could you think, I guess, how
conﬁdent can we be that there'll be more tender next year? And maybe a few words
about sort of the potential short-term pipeline would be great. Thank you.

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Hi, Peter. Just one quick comment on the public sector ﬁrst. We have also won more than
the one contract with the Westland which we highlight here, but those are of smaller size.
And I guess, Odd Arild can maybe also comment a little bit on the pipeline and how we
think going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yes. I think ﬁrst of all, when we talk about public sector we are used to talk and think
about the municipality market. But there's a lot of also public companies that these days
look into a situation when they convert from the old public pension schemes into more
hybrid or deﬁned-contribution type of schemes. We have had around, well, NOK500 to
NOK700 million in inﬂow from these kind of companies also so far for this year. And there
is also some very interesting tendering oﬀering out in the market in the fourth quarter,
especially for these kind of public companies or half public companies.
So yes, there is a pipeline also this year and of course, we expect a lot of municipalities to
go out for tender oﬀering during 2021. There was expected quite a pipeline in 2020 that
was heavily changed due to the COVID-19 situation, but we expect that to come back,
especially when you also see the opportunities to have reduced the price and better
solution for the municipalities that comes from this competition.

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

So I think we guided previously on 20 to 25 municipalities tendering this year, that has
been closed due to the COVID situation. But that is basically a delay not -- or a
postponement and not -- that they are not going to tender. So it should be quite a good
pipeline in the coming years.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thanks so much.
