(through translator) Ladies and gentlemen. thank you very much for joining us to the
conference call of Sompo Holdings. I am the speaker today the Head of IR, Nose. Based
on the material I will go through the presentation for about 20 minutes and then proceed
to the Q&A session.

Bloomberg Transcript

For you information with regards to the progress of the medium term management plan
CEO and the management team will talk about in the IR meeting to be held on November
25th, next week.
Now lets get right into page two. This page shows the highlights. In the first half of FY
2021 consolidated (inaudible) profit increased by ¥113 billion to ¥119.5 billion driven by
higher profit of Sompo Japan and Sompo International as well as gains from partial sales
of stocks held at the holdings.
We have revised our full year forecast for FY 2021 upward to consolidation (inaudible)
profit of ¥267 billion and a consolidated net income of ¥178 billion. Main reasons for the
upward revision include the impact from the partial sales of stocks in addition reflecting
the progress of each business area.
With regards to the shareholders return we have disclosed today. As you can see in the
public release we decided to conduct the buyback of ¥20 billion. This is the additional
return inline with our shareholders return policy because the latest capital surplus is
expected to steeply exceed the estimated level being assumed in the medium term
management plan.
Please turn to page four. This page shows the review of the first half of FY 2021. I am
going to go through the major points on the next page onward.
Please turn to page five. This page shows the underwriting profit Sompo Japan.
Underwriting profit increased by ¥11.9 billion year-on-year driven by a decrease in the

domestic natural disasters in spite of some rebound from the lost ratio decline due to the
impact from COVID-19.

FINAL

Please turn to page six. This page is on the investment profit. Investment profit has
increased by ¥13.8 billion year-on-year mainly due to an increase in net interest and
dividend [ph] income on the back of higher distributions from the funds.
Please turn to page seven. Consolidated ordinary profit. Other than underwriting profit of
Sompo Japan and investment profit I explained on the previous pages we had the impact
from the topline growth from Sompo International and higher profit from the offset [ph]
of the COVID-19 impact we had last year. In addition to the positive impact on partial sale
of stocks held at the holdings.
As a result consolidate ordinary profit increased by ¥113 billion year-on-year to ¥119.5
billion. Let me add that the numbers of our overseas subsidiaries include some noise
associated with accounting for the changes of unrealized gains and losses of assets and
that the local accounting principles of Sompo International. We showed a consolidated net
income on page eight. So please take a look later on.

Bloomberg Transcript

Please turn to page nine. Let me next talk about our full year forecast for FY 2021. As I
mentioned at the beginning, we have revised our guidance upward reflecting the impact
on the partial sale of stocks held at the holdings and the progress of each business area.
Let me explain in more details the main point of the revision on the following page. Please
turn to page 10. We have revised our guidance for Sompo Japan reflecting the decline of
large losses in the first half and steady net interest and dividend income.
We have also incorporated the impact from partial sale of stocks held at the holdings in
consolidate adjustments and others.
On page 11, we show the breakdown of consolidated ordinary profit. On page 12, we
show the historical progress rates of quarterly results. On page 13, we show a numerical
management target on the adjusted profit bases. Please confirm them later on.
This completes the explanation of the consolidated results and the forecast. Next let me
move on to the explanation of our domestic P&C business. Please turn to page 15. First
off the overview of the results of Sompo Japan. Let me explain each item on the next
page onwards.
Page 16, please. This page shows the net premiums written. Net premium written
excluding the household earthquake Ida [ph] increased by ¥20.8 billion year-on-year. In
addition to the increase in net premiums written in fire driven by optimization of pricing
we are keeping the momentum in other lines.
Net premiums written in auto, our main product segment, trended steadily with the
benefits from pricing optimization.

Please turn to page 17. Net loss ratio on the earned income [ph] basis. While accident rate
rose due to the partial decline in the COVID-19 impact earned income [ph] ratio improved
by 0.9 point to 56.8% due to a decrease in the domestic natural disasters.

FINAL

The earned income loss ratio forecast of the full year is roughly around the same level as
the assumption we had at the beginning of the year. We have the loss ratio on the written
basis on the next page. So please take a look at later on.
Please turn to page 19. Here is net expense ratio. Net expense ratio of the first half
increased by 0.1 point to 34.0% mainly due to depreciation costs of new systems. But the
ratio particularly Company expense ratio is in good shape against the plan. Full year
forecast is 34.9% or up .1 point against initial forecast.
Please check the page 20 later for combined ratio. Please turn to page 21. Investment
profits and losses. I explained about the first half results on page six. As to strategic
holding stock ¥5.9 billion worth stock were sold [ph]. Combined with stock future hedge
strategic holding stock was reduced by ¥19.9 billion.

Bloomberg Transcript

potential impact from snow. Next page is reference data of funds and refunds [ph].
Please check is later. So much for domestic P&C business.
Moving onto overseas insurance business. Please look at page 28. Overseas insurance,
Sompo International saw its profit increase with increasing revenue due to rate increase
less impact from the pandemic compared to last year and improving investment results.
Mainly driven by these factors adjusted profit of overseas insurance was ¥35.1 billion or up
¥27.7 billion year-on-year.
Given natural disaster impact including Hurricane Ida [ph] and performance progress of
overseas group companies full year adjusted profit is expected to be ¥56.5 billion. Please
look at page 29 later for business results by region.
Please turn to page 30. Some additional comment for business results of Sompo

steadily with rate increase, increasing share of profitable products on consolidation of
diverse US crop insurance company.

FINAL

And as I mentioned earlier, adjusted profit progressed steadily supported by increasing
revenue, easing pandemic impact and improving investment results. Full year adjusted
profit is expected to be in line with initial forecast with impact such as US Hurricane Ida

with revenue increasing by 16% year-on-year.
Net income in the first half decreased by ¥1.8 billion partly due to business expense
increase along with new business increase. As a result of review each item based on
performance progress full year of forecast of net income and adjusted profit remains
unchanged from the initial forecast.

Next page shows increase and decrease factors of net income of Himawari Life. And
page 35 gives additional information on adjusted profit. Please check those pages later.
So much for domestic life insurance business. Please move on to page 37 for nursing care

Questions And Answers
Operator

FINAL

The first question is from Mr. Maraki at (inaudible) Securities.

Q - Unidentified Participant
(through translator) Hi, this is Maraki [ph] from S&B (inaudible). My first question is on the
capital policy. On page 40 you are explaining that partial sale apparently of stocks. How
much percentage points have you included from that in ESR? And thank you so much for
this additional buyback and the return to shareholders but is the condition and the
circumstance where we can expect additional more return?
I think in the new medium term management plan you have shown four triggers. For
example, ESR above 275%, no large M&As and necessity to improve capital efficiency. But
what was the trigger that was infringed that trigger you to make a decision on the
additional return? So thats my first question on the capital policy.

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

(through translator) Mr. Maraki [ph], thank you for so much for your question. In the
material we simply say partial sale of stocks held at our holdings. But due to the partial
sale of plenty of [ph] stocks the impact on the ESR that was your question and also the
trigger triggering the additional return.
So those are the two questions we received from you, Mr. Maraki [ph]. So to your first
question relating to the partial sale of stocks (inaudible) what has been the impact of that
on the ESR. On page 40 if you look at other factor plus 13 points. On the left-hand side of
that about half which is about 6 points. Were the impacts from partial sale of stocks in
(inaudible).
ESR has increased driven by the partial of (inaudible) stocks. So thats the answer to your
first question.
And what has been the trigger or criteria for the additional buyback of ¥20 billion. In the IR
meeting in May we explained that in addition to the base return if certain condition is met
we are doing additional return. We explained that policy in the IR meeting back in May. But
this time of the four [ph] triggers, what was a trigger which became the reason for the
additional buyback.
The detail will be explained in the IR [ph] meeting next week on November 25. The
management is going to explain specifically other factors requiring capital efficiency
improvement. Was the trigger specifically for the additional buyback this time?
As I mentioned at the beginning we assume the stable capital surplus which is (inaudible)
above [ph] our assumption in the medium term management plan. So we decided to use

Page 5 of 13



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2021-11-19

that to additional return to shareholders. I hope I answered your questions.

Q - Unidentified Participant

FINAL

(through translator) Thank you, so much. Moving on to the question on SI, page 31.
Combined ratio was revised down by 2.3 points. So is it only due to the natural
catastrophes or last year I think you revised it down too.
But natural catastrophes assumptions at the beginning year (inaudible) how do set the
budget at the beginning of the year? Do you think how you compile the budget at the
beginning of the year is appropriate? So you are revising it down. So how do you evaluate
your ability to appropriately assess the natural catastrophes at the beginning of the year?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

(through translator) Mr. Maraki [ph], thank you so much. Your question was about the
revision of the combined ratio for Sompo International so how do we assess the
budgeting at the beginning of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Well unfortunately we decided to revise our combined ratio assumption downward but as
we pointed out correctly the large components are natural catastrophes. So those are the
major reasons. And (inaudible) part underwriting profit this time compared to the initial
forecast to the current forecast about 100 million downward the division was made [ph].
And this is almost by in large not just catastrophe [ph].
In particular Ida in Q3 and the flood in the Europe. So most of the $100 million of revision
was due to those natural catastrophes. But looking back in 2020, last year, from the
underwriting profit to underwriting profit at this time we have factor such as impacts from
COVID-19 but other than that due to the topline increase steadily profit has been
increasing.
Underwriting profit has been increasing and on the base excluding COVID base such as
(inaudible) insurance, natural catastrophes excluding COVID related impact. The base
fundamental insurance product are better and loss [ph] ratio can be improved in 2021
versus 2020.
So we are controlling the loss ratio continuously very well. So compared to the track
record from the past that (inaudible) you saw [ph] in the past I think its getting better. Its
getting improved. So thats my answer to your second question.

Q - Unidentified Participant
(through translator) I fully understood. Thank you, so much.

(through translator) Next question is from Mitsubishi USA [ph], (inaudible). Mr. Fuguno [ph],
please.

FINAL

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

(through translator) Mr. Fuguno [ph], please.

Q - Unidentified Participant
(through translator) Domestic natural disasters focus has been declined but is still on the
high level for the winter. Is it because that there are some uncertainties? And also in
Japan; Sompo Japan the loss ratio excluding natural disasters is raised? What is he
background? Is it just a one off or because of the avalanche losses or the middle sized
losses was the driver for that?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

(through translator) Mr. Fuguno [ph], thank you for the question. For you first, the budget
of the domestic natural disaster. Please look at page 25. As you pointed out for the first
half, ¥26.5 billion. Against that the release [ph] of ¥33 billion as revised forecast.

Bloomberg Transcript

As I mentioned at the beginning in the second half theres potential snow damage. So at
the end of last year there was some snow damage after which was quite a big fire [ph]
for the first time in a long time. So this is to prepare ourselves before the same level of
snow damage. That is the answer to the first part of your question.
The second part of your question excluding natural disasters and the EI loss ratio in the
first half was on the rise. First about automobile insurance, the impact from COVID
compares to the last year. This year the impact still remains but not as big as the last
years.
For the sake of time Im asking about the forecast for the year forecast, okay? For the
second half the automobile loss ratio in the March theres some reaction of the rise that is
factored in, and for fire insurance theres a part which is not really covered as disasters. I
mean there are small natural disasters which could increase in the number, so as a result
excluding the natural disaster EI loss ratio is expected to go rise.

Q - Unidentified Participant
(through translator) Thank you.

Operator
(through translator) Thank you. Next questions are from Mr. Batanavi [ph] from Diamond
Securities [ph].

Q - Unidentified Participant

FINAL

(through translator) Hi, this is Batanavi [ph] from Diamond Securities [ph]. I have two
questions. My first question is to confirm your capital policy. ¥20 billion buyback. Am I right
in understanding that this is the additional buyback? So if you apply 50% total return ratio
then additional buyback can be expected when you're announcing your results in May. Am
I right?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

(through translator) Mr. Batanavi [ph], thank you so much for your question about the
capital policy or shareholders return policy. This ¥20 billion additional buyback that we
have just announced as I explained at the beginning of the year this is the additional
return.
So base return, which is 60%, we usually return based upon the flow of earnings at the
end of the year, but this ¥20 billion is in addition to that.
And at the end of the year 50% of that asset profits will be returned as a base return, and
if necessary we are going to study the possibility of the additional return if necessary, and
as Mr. Manaki [ph] mentioned according to the full criterias, as Mr. Manaki [ph] mentioned,
we are going to study the potential additional buybacks.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Unidentified Participant
(through translator) Understood. My second question is on the natural catastophies
overseas. In Q2 what was the actual number, and what is the budget for the full year?
Then Hurricane Ida, European flood? Would you please give me the breakdown of each
natural disaster, of the total budget of natural disasters for the overseas business?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

(through translator) Thank you, so much, Mr. Batanvai [ph]. Natural catastrophes numbers
overseas, in the Third Quarter Ida happened, and also floods in Europe. In total of the two
the total was mid ¥20 billions. Ida mid ¥10 billion and European floods less than ¥10 billion
but high single-digit billions of yen.
And the overseas budget for natural catastrophes for the full year we are budgeting ¥60
billion, and the breakdown is as follows. SI and other overseas ¥55 billion, some for Japan
¥5 billion. So thats a breakdown of the total ¥60 billion.

Q - Unidentified Participant
(through translator) Understood. Thank you, so much.

Operator
(through translator) Next, Middle Securities [ph], Mr. Sado [ph], please.

FINAL

Q - Unidentified Participant
(through translator) Hi, its Sado [ph] of Middle Securites [ph]. I have two questions. First
question is about your fundamental earning capability. Thats what I would like to know.
So in May you publicized the Group adjusted profit, and that included some COVID impact
incoirporated, and how much of it is included in the revised forecast at this time?
And also other than COVID, factors such as the release of the deferred tax asset in Brazil
and other so called the one-off factors, how much or how many of them exist?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

(through translator) Thank you, Sado San [ph]. So your question is about our fundamental
earning power and also the COVID and other one-off factors. Starting with the impact
from the pandemic, so in this revised forecast the impact around the COVID in terms of
adjusted profit is about +¥19 billion.

Bloomberg Transcript

And compared to the initial forecast of the year it is a little bit below ¥10 billion which is
pushed up by our automobile net profit increase and so on.
And next as to one-off factors, what kind of one-off factors? So as you mentioned in your
question this Brazil-related factor and many of them are one-off factors that which will not
give any negative impact next year and onward. It will not leave any; a big impact on the
next years and onwards.
And as to COVID how much impact will come next year? Thats certain; thats uncertain.
Compared to the pre-COVID, theres some leveled impact of COVID. If we assume it, the
COVID impact that could lead to the positive impact because of the absence of that
impact.
And as to localized events such as the thunderstorms that which are quite small in size
and if such the small incidents did not occur, then that would be the contribute to the final
results.
So; and that also applies to overseas. The Brail factor if its not realized, that will be
positive. And for the other investment, i.e. [ph] the profit which is good this year, and if
that is not recurred next year that will be negative. So the earnings structure reform is
paying off, and the revenue is increasing overseas, and these positive; the factors will
remain next year and onwards.

FINAL

(through translator) Thank you. Second question. As so SIs, the revised plan, the gross
premium is raised greatly compared to the midterm, the plan target. It is coming very
close to it.
So is it sustainable or not? And also when you look at early net [ph] the premium,
retention rate is actually declining while the plan is to improving it and this; the background
for that as do some for international. Thats availability [ph] of topline growth and also the
net premium certification [ph] rate or the difference between gross and net and the
thinking about that. Thats the second question.
So think the environment that is remaining very well compared to fiscal year 20, the fiscal
year 21 the rate increase pace itself is slowing down, but the environment is good for the
hike of the rates, so its not that the next year topline is going to decline. That is not
assumption.
As to the plan for that next year, in May we are going to ensue that plan. Its not that we
are seeing some factors at the (inaudible) of the shade on the other topline increase next
year. As to retention rate as you know from December the interest company that
diversified, that has been consolidated.

Bloomberg Transcript

And right after; well this is still immediately after the consolidation, so much of the
businesses exited [ph]. So it looks like retention rate is different from the actual retention
rate, but we vogue proper insurance retention rate increase; to increase retention rate.
That effort on it still continues.

Operator
(through translator) Thank you. Next questions are from Sataki San [ph] from Bank of
America Securities Japan.

Q - Unidentified Participant
(through translator) Hi. This is Sataki [ph] from Bank of America Securities. I have two
questions. My first question is on the rate increase of SI. In January next round at the
moment what is your view on the next round of price negotiations in January or renewal
January?
Probably market expects that price increase magnitude is going to be smaller, but there
are some people in the market who thinks that a rate increase is going to be as large as
the one that is being acrhieved by SI. So what is your view on the magnitude of price
increase?
And secondly, you talked about pressure sale [ph] of stocks in (inaudible), but you don't
have to give me a detailed numbers, but would you please give me the reasons why you
have sold; you have gone out of the lookout period?

Page 10 of 13



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2021-11-19

Is that the reason? This regard you [ph] together with Parantea [ph]? My impression is that
you are working well with them like investing together with them, but what is the
background of why you have sold partially stocks in Parantea [ph]?

FINAL

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

(through translator) Mr. Sataki [ph], thank you so much. To your first question what is our
view to the rate of renewal increase in January? As you mentioned there are two kinds of
people in the market, two different opinions. Yes. As of now we don't have the firm view,
but generally first renewal is going to be quite solid continuously. Thats what we feel at
the moment.
Of course the extend without extend and the frequency period, the pricing will be
different, and compared to the rate increase that has been achieved by SI up to the end
of last year its possible that pace of increase may slowdown, but we are not assuming
sudden rate decline from January 1.

Bloomberg Transcript

To your second question about the reason in the background why we decided to sell
partially our stocks in Parantea [ph], as you mentioned, Mr. Sataki [ph], collaboration with
Parantea [ph] has been making very good progress. We are working together in the
project relating to RDP and we have projects where we are jointly investing as we
mentioned.
So at the working level and at the CEO level we have a very close, good relationship with
them. So when we formed the capital alliance at the beginning, actually the strength of
the relationship has become much stronger.
So in this environment, so we started to invest in Parantea [ph] to strengthen the
relationship with them, but we don't need to depend so much on the capital relationship.
We have a good established relationship now without depending too much on the capital
relationship and also exporter [ph] to one name has become quite large.
So from the risk management perspective we decided to partially sell, and also in the; in
our meeting in May our CEO mentioned that if we need new investments in the digital
area we have a policy to sell partially stocks in Parantea [ph] to use proceeds from the
sale to invest in new digital areas, and that was another reason why we decided to sell
partially.

Q - Unidentified Participant
(through translator) Understood. So is it the only sale or are you planning to sell more?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

(through translator) Well about the potential sale in the future or not, in the IR meeting
next week would you please ask that question to the management team, but basically if
necessary wed like to sell our shares in Parantea [ph] and use proceeds from the sale to

Page 11 of 13



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2021-11-19

invest in digital areas. So theres no change to that strategy, but we don't have any
concrete strategy or new strategy that we can share with you as of now.

Q - Unidentified Participant

FINAL

(through translator) Understood. Thank you.

Operator
(through translator) Next question, Mr. Otsuko [ph] from JP Morgan Securities.

Q - Unidentified Participant
(through translator) Otsuko, JP Morgan Securities. I have two questions. First question is
about dividend. So it remains in tact and why vital [ph] changed as adjusted profit is
revised up?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

(through translator) Thank you for the question. So for the other dividend payout that
remains unchanged. As to dividend, so the ¥40 increase per share was shown at the
beginning of the midterm plan, so rather than increasing the payout even more the; we
agreed [ph] on ¥20 billion additional buyback.
And for fiscal year 21 if we continue to accumulate the adjusted profit, then I think that will
be; that will contribute to; that could contribute to the basic; the return to the
shareholders or additional buyback that we are going to make a decision as that time
comes. So if you'd like, though, you can ask the question to the management next week
at a meeting.

Operator
(through translator) Thank you.

Q - Unidentified Participant
(through translator) And as to the second question, its a separate question. The ¥148.7
billion and the ¥280 - ¥210 billion the full year; the full year, the consolidated invested
profit, and the (inaudible) that is seems to be rather high, could you please talk about the
background of these numbers?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

(through translator) So for this time, the revised forecast, for example, natural disasters. It
is rather difficult to have the right assumption, but the last year the snow damage was
more than we had expected. So for the second half that we are on the conservative side
for the snow damage, but our; if we turned out to be wrong then we would be very
happy.

Page 12 of 13



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2021-11-19

Then we can accumulate more adjusted profit, so it would be 50% of the basic; the
return, and for that as well as we can increase the source for the return to shareholders.

Q - Unidentified Participant

FINAL

(through translator) So the risk factors for the second half, natural disasters, and what
about market risks?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

(through translator) In the first half the other dividend from the fund is contributing, but
you do not expect it as a big positive factor for the second half.
For the first half it is realized to some extent, so; and it is incorporated as part of the
factors for the division for the full year, but if the market gets better we do not assume
that the market will improve further in the second half, but you do not expect the market
will go down either. At this moment such news is not factored in.

Q - Unidentified Participant
(through translator) Thats clear. Thank you.

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

(through translator) Now its near the ending time for this conference call. If you have
additional questions or follow up questions, please contact our IR team. So this completes
