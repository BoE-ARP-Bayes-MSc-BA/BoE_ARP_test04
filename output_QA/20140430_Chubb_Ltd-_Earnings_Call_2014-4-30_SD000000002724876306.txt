Now I would like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Then we will
take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions, are several members of
our management team. Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.

Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, ACE had a very good start to the year.
Growth and operating income was driven by strong underwriting and investment income.
We produced double-digit, premium revenue growth, and every division contributed to
the good results.
After-tax operating income for the quarter was $777 million, up 4%, to $2.27 per share,
generating an operating return on equity of 11.2%. Book value per share grew almost 2.5
and now stands at about $87.
This was another quarter with excellent underwriting results. We produced $390 million of
P&C underwriting income, up 7%, with the calendar year combined ratio of 88.8. The
growth in underwriting was driven wholly by current accident year underwriting income,
which was up 17% before CATs. As a result, a double-digit growth in earnings premium,
and 0.5 point improvement in underwriting margin.

Bloomberg Transcript

Margin improvement in North America was the result of better pricing, earning its way in,
and mix of business. And internationally, as a result of better products, and geographic
mix.
Catastrophe losses were up modestly over prior year, to $53 million pre-tax. While net
trial period reserve development was essentially flat with First Quarter last year, reflecting
favorable development in our global P&C businesses, offset somewhat by negative
development from crop insurance, as we closed out claims from last season. The
adjustment to crop reserves means the 2013 crop year ultimate, moved to a 97
combined, up from the projected 95 we reported in the Fourth Quarter.
We produced $553 million in investment income in the quarter, up over 4%. It is a very
good result, given the persistently low interest rate environment in which we operate. Phil
will have more to say about our investment portfolio and results.
As you saw earlier this week, we completed the acquisition of the majority stake in Siam
Commercial Samaggi Insurance, a general insurer in Thailand. Samaggi a good strategic
fit, and complimentary to our business in Thailand, and enhances our overall presence in
Southeast Asia. We will launch a tender offer for the balance of Samaggi in the Second
Quarter.
Total P&C net premiums in the quarter grew 12%, as reported in nearly 14% on a constant
dollar basis. Excluding agriculture, which is, as I have stated before, is the way I prefer to
view the results, we grew over 11.5% in constant dollars, with strong contributions from
North America, Asia, and Latin America.

FINAL

In North America, P&C net premiums written, were up across the board, with retail
commercial up over 10%, wholesale commercial up about 11.5%, and personal lines up 9%.
Internationally, net premiums for ACE International were up 15% in constant dollars. Latin
America led the way with the growth of 62%, benefiting from the contributions of our
acquisitions in Mexico. Excluding these, Latin America was up about 7.5%. Net premiums
were up 13% in Asia-Pacific and 5% in Japan. In Europe, premium growth was essentially
flat with the continent up 1% and the UK down 2%.
Premiums in our London market base, London wholesale market base, E&S surplus lines
business, were up 2% in constant dollar, with strong gains in trade credit, property, and
(inaudible) lines, offset by declines in aviation and marine.
In our global A&H business, net premiums were up 3.5% in constant -- up 3.5% in constant
dollar. Our international business had growth of 7%, led by Asia-Pacific, up 17%, Japan up
11%, and Latin America up 9%. North America A&H also had a good growth quarter, with
net premiums up 15%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Combined insurance net premiums were down about 4% in the quarter. We had an
accounting adjustment that benefited combined's premiums last year in the First Quarter,
and adjusting for that, combined's premiums declined 2%. On the other hand, new sales
at combined were up 16%, a positive trend that continues, and so for the balance of the
year, we project net premiums of combined to grow.
Premiums for our global personal lines and small business division were up 45% in
constant dollars. Or 13% excluding the contribution of ABA Seguros. For our global rebusiness, premiums were up 10.5% in constant dollars, more than would naturally be
expected, given current reinsurance market conditions. We benefited in the quarter from
a few new structured reinsurance transactions written in the US operations. Finally,
international life insurance net premiums written were up almost 14% in Asia and Latin
America.
I want to say a few words about the current market environment. In the US, the insurance
market, as distinguished from reinsurance, is stable, though the velocity of price increases
is slowing. Rates continue to rise in casualty related lines, while they are flat, and declining
in short-tail related.
RENS and middle market specialty businesses are continuing to secure the highest level
of rate increases. For our larger account retail business, pricing for casualty related
primary, or lead layer excess business, remains stable, and we continue to achieve
positive rates. This is the business that requires more than capital and an underwriter to
compete, and it is a significant amount of our business. As a general statement,
competition is greatest when it is simply excess layer capacity placement.
The reinsurance end of our business, which is an important but small percentage of our
company, about 3% or 4%, is where the market is most competitive from a pricing point
of view.

FINAL

With all that said, let me be a little more specific. For commercial P&C in North America,
beginning first with our larger account retail business, HUSA, professional lines rates were
up 4%, large account risk management business, rates were up 3.6%, general casualty
pricing was up 1.7%, excess casualty rates were up just over 3%, while property rates were
down 2.5%. For HUSA, new business writings were flat year on year, and our renewal
retention rate, as measured by premium, was 98% in the quarter, with account retention
at 85%. Both quite healthy.
Our US E&S and wholesale business, professional lines rates were up 4.4%, casualty was
up over 5% and inland marine was up almost 7%, property rates were down about 3%.
New business overall on the strength of very strong submission activity, was up 11.5% in
our E&S business.
The commercial P&C rate environment internationally remains reasonably stable, with
retail rates essentially flat overall, with variability of pricing both up and down, depending
on territory and line of business. By territory, Latin America rates were up 1%, Asia-Pacific
was down 2%, and the UK and continent rates were flat. My colleagues and I can provide
further color on market conditions and pricing trends later in the call.

Bloomberg Transcript

As the year progresses, we imagine the market to become more competitive, depending
on the line of business and territory. We are an underwriting organization, with good
internal discipline, that has been built for long-term, sustainable growth. Due to our
excellent diversification by product, geography, and distribution, there are many territories
and lines of business where we operate today, that will experience good premium
revenue growth. Overall, I believe we will continue to outperform.
In summary, we are off to a good start to the year. Our underwriting and investment
income results were excellent, and from what we can see, I expect a good year.
With all that, I will turn the call over to Phil.

Phil Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

Thank you, Evan.
We had an excellent quarter. Tangible book value per share grew 3% for the quarter, and
operating cash flow was a very strong $1.25 billion. Cash and invested assets grew $1.4
billion, to $63 billion. Investment income of $553 million was quite strong. We expect our
strong cash flow to offset the impact of the lower reinvestment rate of 2.8%, versus our
current book yield of 3.7%.
There are a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income, including
the level of interest rates, prepayment speeds on mortgages, call activity in our corporate
bond portfolio, private equity distributions, and foreign exchange. Therefore, we currently
expect our quarterly investment income run rate to be $540 million.

FINAL

Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $462 million pre-tax. This includes
$56 million of gains from investment partnerships that we account for under the equity
method. It is worth noting that some of our peers include these types of gains in
investment income and operating EPS and ROE. We do not.
Our net loss reserves were down $105 million in the quarter, primarily due to payments
related to last year's crop losses. This is a seasonal impact. Excluding those payments, net
loss reserves would have increased $179 million. Our paid-to-incur ratio was 106% for the
quarter. When we normalized the ratio for last year's crop loss payments, the ratio is 93%.
CAT losses were $43 million, after tax, from worldwide weather events, and we had
positive prior period development of $63 million after-tax. $92 million of after-tax
favorable P&C prior period development, excluding crop, was offset by unfavorable crop
prior period development of $29 million. The P&C prior period development was primarily
from long-tail lines, and related principally to accident years 2008 and prior.

Bloomberg Transcript

The expense ratio in our North American P&C segment was 21.5%, compared with 20.1%
last year. As we reported, last year included a favorable $29 million legal settlement that
benefited the prior year's ratio by 2.2 points. Adjusting for this, North American P&C was
actually down 0.8%
Net premiums in our North American agriculture segment were up, as a result of the crop
insurance premium sharing formulas with the US government, relating to loss
development from 2013. In essence, the formulas require insurers to retain more
premium as crop losses increase. In addition, changes to our third party proportional
reinsurance, in both years, also contributed to the growth. Excluding these items, net
premiums increased $4 million, or 3.2%.
Global A&H earnings for the quarter were ahead of plan, but down about 6% on a
constant dollar basis from prior year, primarily due to positive prior-year reserve
development, reported in the First Quarter last year, that didn't repeat. Excluding year-onyear prior period development, and other one-time items, A&H operating income grew
in-line with premiums.
Total capital return to shareholders during the quarter was $550 million, including $330
million of share repurchases, and $220 million in dividends. Since we made the
announcement of our repurchase plan in last year's Fourth Quarter, we have repurchased
a total of $436 million through April 28, of a program to repurchase up to $1.5 billion.
Earlier this month, AM Best upgraded the financial strength rating to A++ superior, for
ACE's core North American property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies.
I will turn the call back to Helen.

Questions And Answers

FINAL

(Operator Instructions)
Our first question from Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Hello?

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

What drove the crop reserve strengthening in the First Quarter, that'd be helpful. And
then, what your outlook is for 2014 in that business.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Jay, what drove it, we had late traveling, late reporting, than normal in typical years, claim
reporting from farmers. Typically in November -- by November, early December, you've
had almost all the claims. This year, they came in a little later. We had more claims
reported later in December, into late December. And then adjusting them takes a little
longer.
And the reason they were late and why adjusting takes a little longer -- this year, crop
losses were a matter of not simply yields, but commodity price changes. The price,
particularly, of corn. And so, in adjusting to that, you've got to apply that change to
deductibles, once you know yields, et cetera. And so the whole development -- ultimate
development pattern in settlement of claims, moved a little later, let's call it four to six
weeks, or even longer than that.
We've had another year -- when we look back in the records, there was another year like
this, where it was slower and, again, it was when there was a commodity price caused
change causing losses, and how the farmers then reported, and how long it takes for the
guys in the field to ultimately adjust with them.
And so, if we have another year like this, where there is -- and it's commodity price
related, we will be better informed about that, as we think of our ultimate development.
But that's about as clear an answer as I can give about it. And when we look at this year, if
you -- we see an average year. We're booked to an average. What is it Phil, 88.9%?

88.9%.

FINAL

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

-- is the current accident year. Some of you, what we can see in your reports, have
calculated kind of a 92.2%. You ought to look at how we did the math. And the math -- we
don't think the math was done right. But anyway, it's booked at 88.9%, which reflects that
we expect [ph] this year.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

That's helpful. Thank you. And then, just more broadly, Evan, I'm not sure if you're at RIMS
now in Denver, or I'm sure have you executives there, what's the tone coming out of the
conference this week?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I'm in New York, enjoying this lovely weather. The tone coming out of there, I'll ask John
Keogh and then John Lupica to make a brief comment on it. From what I can tell, the tone
is stability.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Keogh

{BIO 2104739 <GO>}

I think that's right. This is John Keogh. John Lupica and I just got back last evening after a
couple days out with a whole bunch of clients and brokers, and I think that's pretty
accurate in terms of general tone. I think the expectation for the rest of the year, from the
clients and brokers we talked to, is more of the same of what you saw First Quarter.
Generally stable pricing, with moderate to slight rate increases across casualty lines. And
property stable to slightly down.

A - John Lupica

{BIO 4213297 <GO>}

I would absolute agree with that. No real dislocation in the market -- very stable, very
consistent with the expectation that casualty will be balanced, professional lines will be
balanced -- certainly in the primary layers -- capacity layers may get a little more
competitive, and the expectation that property -- certainly cap pricing -- will get
challenged.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

That's helpful. Thank you.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Company Ticker: ACE AB Equity
Date: 2014-04-30

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you. Just one question I had, the North American P&C, it looks like the loss ratio
improved quite a bit year over year. Just trying to get an understanding of what drove
that. Is it mix? I mean it seems like pricing has been moderating. So, is it partially lower loss
cost? Or, what are some one-timers in there that sort of clouded that comparison?
Thanks.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

It's not one-timers. It's a combination of mix and price. And you notice, when you see loss
ratio down in some lines, they're also lines that will have a higher expense ratio to them.
So, the overall combined ratio, while it's down, on a current accident year, more modestly
than you're seeing it on simply a loss-ratio business. So, it's mix and price.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Mix and price. Okay. And then, just on the crop book, I guess, we've had a few folks report
already this quarter. I haven't seen the adjustments in the First Quarter from others. So I'm
just trying to understand, is it maybe the geographic profile of your book, or some other
complexity that has caused this sort of reporting to impact your book specifically?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No, it's -- we're actually -- we and Wells are the two that are really spread geographically
on a national basis.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Right.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Very good diversification by territory and crop that way. There were certain, particularly
Iowa corn -- very, very stressed this year. On the other hand, you take a place like
Minnesota, or the Dakotas, were excellent yields. So, it really varied by state. Iowa was
tough. We write a lot of business in Iowa. But the late reporting by farmers -- their first
priority is to get their crop out of the ground. You've got to know that. And it isn't like
submitting a claim to the insurance company. So they're going to get their crop out of the
ground. They're going to get it to a place where you're then able to measure yield as a
derivative of them pulling their crops.
And then the ability to -- so they report a little late sometimes. And then the ability to
apply the commodity price change in addition to yield, and then figure out your profit and
loss sharing with the government, by state, because you've got to have all crops in there,
takes time. And we just noticed when there's a price difference driving loss -- a
commodity price difference, it tends to create a greater lag in the ultimate development.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

I see.

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

That's all. Nothing any more complex than that.

FINAL

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

I see. And I guess, from an anticipation standpoint, I guess you can't know what that is
before you get those farmers reports -- or you don't really have an indication of what
those potential yields might be.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

(multiple speakers) make your best guess. What are we talking about? We're talking
about the difference between a 95% and a 97%. So, of course, you make your best guess
at it. We had brought it up to a combined that we thought reflected the ultimate of 90%
to 95%, so you try to do that. But you don't have it all. So, you can have 1 or 2 points, or a
couple of points of variability around that. You're looking at a Cat. And so, in this case, it
was $30 million.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

We'll go ahead to our next question with Arash Soleimani with KBW.

Q - Arash Soleimani

{BIO 18869554 <GO>}

I wanted to get your thoughts on expectations for the June 1 Florida renewals.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

In terms of --

Q - Arash Soleimani

{BIO 18869554 <GO>}

Just the pricing.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Pricing. I'm not going to prognosticate the pricing, except I know it's not going up.

Q - Arash Soleimani

{BIO 18869554 <GO>}

Right. And I guess one question I'm trying to get at is, you see the pricing obviously
declining, there are some expectations for double digit -- I guess one question is, how

Page 9 of 17



Company N ame: Chubb Arabia Cooperative I nsurance Co

much further do you think it could go down and still at all be somewhat attractive to the
traditional players?

FINAL

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Well, I'm not going to speak for the appetite of traditional players, except my own
Company, and there, I'm not going to make a general statement. It really depends on the
individual risk, it depends on what layers you're talking about. Are you talking about the
dollar swap in layers, are you talking about the more middle range, where the return
periods are shorter? Or, are you really talking the tale where there's a minimum price you
want to be able to take the risk, and rates online are generally low anyway to begin with.
So, it really varies. But I'm not going to -- past that, I'm not going to go there.

Q - Arash Soleimani

{BIO 18869554 <GO>}

That's fair. And I know you don't give specific guidance, but I just wanted to get some
thoughts on continuing appetite for buybacks versus M&A.

A - Evan Greenberg

Our appetite has not changed whatsoever.

We'll go ahead to our next question with Vinay Misquith.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Good morning. Your growth in the North American segment was really strong. If you could
give us some color into what the source of that growth is, and how is the competitive
landscape, and how are you winning the business?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yes. I'm going to just start a little bit and then ask John Lupica to talk about it. The growth
was very broad based. Our retail commercial P&C business at the large account end did
very well. Risk management had a -- our risk management business had an excellent
quarter, as an example. Our professional lines book had a good quarter. Our E&S
business in the Westchester had very strong growth, and it was off the back of both
casualty, inland marine, and professional lines.
Professional lines, in particular, had a very good quarter in the E&S space. Our small
commercial, and our personal lines business, both had decent growth in the quarter. Our
small commercial business was up double digit. And our personal lines business was up
high-single digit. And so we were very pleased. It was broad based. John?

A - John Lupica

{BIO 4213297 <GO>}

FINAL

And I will just add on to that with the same theme that the growth really has come across
the board. It was broad based and it's from years of working strategy -- and a healthy US
market, I'll remind you. Our portfolio management has given us some insight and clarity
into our books, allowed us to focus on our high-margin products, and really address the
low-margin products through underwriting actions, like price returns or conditions.
As Evan noted, we've made some key investments in businesses like our private risk
services, small commercial, our E&S through product, our primary casual, our global
network -- all of those businesses are driving our growth and moving the needle for us.
And, more importantly, we're delivering our Company in a really focused and coordinated
way.
So, as Evan had noted, we've seen US retail up 10%, our E&S business up 13%, our small
commercial business -- we've had a lot of investment over the years -- up 13%. Even
Bermuda, our wholesale business on the island, is growing nicely. And, again, as a result,
another quarter of rate increases, 1.8%, exposures are up almost 2 points. Great account
and premium retentions, as Evan had noted, and our ability to change renewal positions
here and there.
So, all in all, it was a good quarter for North America. I hope that helps.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Yes, it's helpful. Thank you. Just as a followup to that, the retentions, that the amount you
keep net, stayed flat year over year. That was increasing last year, so curious as to why
that stayed flat this year. Because I would have thought reinsurance pricing has gone
down, you might keep more net. So, if you could help me in that, that'd be great, thanks.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Vinay, if reinsurance pricing went down, why would I hold more [ph]?

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Phil, the business mix changed, too, I thought.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No. Look, the retention, when you look at them, in aggregate, is an amalgamation of each
individual line of business decisions, and the mix between lines. But the point is, our
reinsurance buying strategy is quite consistent, quite stable, and our net retention reflects
that stability.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

That is helpful.

We're not, fundamentally, opportunistic reinsurance buyers.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

FINAL

Sure, fair enough.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

We measure first and foremost -- we underwrite to the growth, so we look to make
money for our net and our reinsurers. And, too, we buy for volatility protection, and to
protect a limit above our appetite for net retention, based on our own risk management.
So, that's the fundamental first reason that we buy.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure. It's helpful. And, just one last thing for Phil. Just the numbers question. What is the
normalized tax rate for the rest of the year, Phil?

A - Phil Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So this quarter was a little bit lower than we would have expected because of where our
prior period, primarily, because our prior-period development, and where it occurred. If
you look at the prior-period development, there was very little tax on that. And that tends
to drive the tax rate down overall. I believe that the range that we should be looking at is
13% to 15%.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure. Thank you.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Good morning, Mark.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Good morning. Small question. In the life segment, the policy acquisition cost ratio was up
fairly substantially. I know that's not a real significant item usually, but I was wondering if
there was any changes in product or mix there that might allow for it? And then, while
we're on the topic, maybe just a short strategic update on the life segment. We haven't
heard much about it lately, not a lot of growth, nor acquisitions in a while.

So, on the numbers question, you'll notice that admin expenses went down and
acquisition expenses went up, and it's because we made a re-class. There were some
marketing-related admin costs that we thought were more appropriately classified in
acquisition costs, so we just made the move -- nothing substantial, no bottom-line effect - just, we think, a better classification.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

On the strategic update -- our life business is predominantly -- it's made up of --the life
segment, as you know, is made up of three parts. One is the Life Re, which we have not
been taking new business since 2007, and that has been running off, that's fundamentally
variable.

Bloomberg Transcript

The annuity business, you have international life, and you have combined North America
business, which is on a life company paper. So the international life, which is I believe what
you're referring to, that business is doing quite well. It is predominantly Asia based,
though we have a book in Latin America which is more term insurance related. It's not
traditional whole life and savings and protection-related products. That is Asia.
And there, we've got over 35,000 agents now, and our agency force is growing at a rate
of around 10% to between 10% and 15% a year right now at the moment. The business is
in Vietnam. It is doing very well. In Thailand, it is doing well. Indonesia had an excellent
quarter, an excellent last year. Hong Kong, since we made that acquisition, it is generating
very good growth. Best growth it's seen in years, and good margins, and good income.
And Korea, which we also purchased, which is getting on track. Korea is a more difficult
territory. We've been working hard at it. And we're seeing good signs of growth, and
we're getting better at our arms around expense control, and growing the agency force.
And margins, we can see, beginning to improve.
Overall, Asia is what's powered that growth, and very pleased with it. The operation in
China -- we got out of the bank-related business, which took down revenues, but the right
thing to do. It really doesn't generate any money. And we are focused on building agency
there, and that is on track and doing well. So, we have said that our life insurance
business, which doesn't generate a loss now, is generating a very modest profit,
breakeven -- the modest profit, because we're growing it organically. It's expected to,
over the next couple of years, have strong GAAP earnings emerge, and we see that on
track.

Q - Mark Dwelle

We'll take our next question from Thomas Mitchell with Miller Tabak.

Q - Thomas Mitchell

{BIO 22121384 <GO>}

I was wondering, the very large placement I guess, is a CAT fund by the reinsurer for the
Florida Catastrophe Insurance Program. Is this -- do you think that this sort of thing is more
likely to stay in the United States because of the investor pool here, or are we likely to
see that migrate to other large jurisdictions?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Are you saying the investor pool for the CAT bond market in Florida?

Q - Thomas Mitchell

{BIO 22121384 <GO>}

Well, not just in Florida, but we assume US investors are more comfortable than foreign
investors. I might be wrong with that.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I don't think I'm really in a position to answer that question definitively, but I think longterm investors with large pools of capital that have a certain liquidity profile, I think on a
global basis, are more -- are going to be more attracted to this class. On the other side of
the coin, it's part of their portfolio, diversification, even a small percentage. However, I'll
note that the class itself, overall, is a small investment class. It's not a -- in a tack-on
market relative to any other investment classes, it's a fraction. It's tiny.

We will take our next question from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Good morning, Evan. I was -- I found your commentary in your annual letter very
interesting. I was hoping you could elaborate on a couple of points on your view of the
markets. The first, you talked about commercial P&C, we are in the beginning of a
transition market, which means return of a more competitive cycle. I was hoping you could
elaborate on that. That read to me as you think we're heading down reasonably close to
the typical cycle we're used to experiencing. Is that what you were trying to say?
And, if so, how do -- or do you think there is a -- what do you think the potential is that, as
some others have espoused, that we sort of learn from our mistakes, and we have better
Page 14 of 17

technology, and the cycle is, quote-unquote, dead?

FINAL

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Well, I think I -- what I said there, I take a more nuanced approach to that. I don't think it's
black or white. I don't think there's no such thing as cycles at all. And I don't think that
we're going to have the kind of swings we saw in the past -- in the 1990s, let's say -- I
don't think we're going to see those kinds of peaks and troughs. I think it'll be more
moderated, is my bet. The exact size and shape, I have no idea. No one knows with any
real certainty.

Bloomberg Transcript

And, by the way, I think it's going to vary -- it varies by type of business and class of
business. Some businesses, you have a lot of homogeneity; you have millions of individual
units of exposure that are more homogenous; it's more frequency, not severity related;
lends itself to lots of rich data and prediction. And, by the way, I think you'll have less
cyclical movement in those businesses. You have so much of our business where it's very
difficult to predict trends. It's very difficult to -- you don't have the same homogeneity,
very difficult to just predict exposure, and exact pricing differential, and you've got some
guys with a lot of data, and you've got lots of guys who have no data who are competing.
And then you have capital movements in and out of the business that fuel and drive the
appetite.
On the other side you could say, you know what, there's greater use of actuaries,
Sarbanes, et cetera, to help -- and SEC to help ameliorate some of the bad behavior that
can occur. So when I add it all together, I said exactly what I mean, and I am reinforcing it
this quarter, saying it. And that is, I see the market becoming a bit more competitive. I
think that trend will continue. We're seeing the rate -- the pace of rate increases
moderate in casualty. We're seeing property decrease. I think that trend will continue.
I think you have human nature, seeing companies who have been outperforming in certain
classes, and areas of lines of business, and guys scratching for growth. And they're
saying: I want a piece of that, too. And it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. So I don't think
cycles have come and gone.
And, by the way, if you manage it right, I think there's where some of your greatest wealth
creation ultimately takes place. You're a disciplined, insightful underwriter, and you're
willing to trade share, and then, ultimately, over a period of time, you will generate
superior shareholder returns and growth in book value. Past that, I can't prognosticate the
exact shape and size.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

No, that's a very thorough answer. My only followup on that piece would be, does that
suggest -- the human nature part suggest that it's going to be hard to sort of execute this
-- what was the Greenspan term? -- the soft landing where we manage to stop price
decreases just as we hit loss trend? Or do we likely, and at least in more competitive
lines, bottom out with pricing going below loss trend over the next year or two?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Ian, I think the beauty of our business, which is -- really then becomes your job to separate
the cats and dogs -- and that is: forget the mean -- it's the distribution around the mean.
Who knows when to walk away, and when to grow, based on insight into price -- into trend
exceeding pricing -- and, even then, you can still play it if you have good margin -- but
knows when the margin has reached a point that the risk reward is no longer worth it. Who
understands that and has the ability to execute on it? That's the question. Not the mean.
And that becomes your job.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Agreed. Agreed. That's the hard part. Then, on the reinsurance comments you made --

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I think our job is hard, too.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The reinsurance comments you made about how the business model needs to change
where Cat is, if I can paraphrase, subsidize other lines. I guess, A, how is ACE responding
to that? And, B, how do you see that actually playing out? Because it would seem, on one
hand, that makes logical sense, but on the other hand, if you're pressured in Cat maybe
you say -- not saying ACE, but other, less rational, competitors may say: Well, I'm not
making money in Cat, why don't I go to try to steal some growth in other areas, and
maybe it actually gets worse in the non-Cat areas.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I think that's probable -- you know, I don't know with any certainty, but I believe what I
wrote is exactly that. That I believe that it'll be a painful -- it's a painful adjustment in
between. And that, ultimately, if Cat isn't going to subsidize the balance, then you're
going to have to get the pricing right. But in between that, you're going to have a -- you
will have what we're already beginning to see: a messier, more competitive market, as
people are driving for share, and for growth. And they're doing it by sacrificing margins.
And how are we going to play it? Very simple. We will shrink the business if it cannot earn
an underwriting profit. Period.
