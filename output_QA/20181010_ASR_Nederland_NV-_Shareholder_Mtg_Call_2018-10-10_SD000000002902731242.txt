Thank you very much, Michel. Ladies and gentlemen, also from my side, welcome to our
ﬁrst Capital Markets Day after our IPO in 2016. And today, hopefully, for all of you, we
have a full and exciting program.

Bloomberg Transcript

And as said, our journey started as a listed company roughly 2.5 years ago. And by then,
when we internally prepared our IPO, some of you may know, one of my hobbies is riding
roller coasters. And the faster, the higher and the more turns, the more I love it. And
internally, I always tend to compare preparing a IPO with riding in roller coasters. And
when we did the analyst presentation in April 2016, I wanted to start with this comparison.
And as you know, when you prepare an IPO, you have lots of bankers and lawyers. And
they all came to me, "Don't do it, don't do it. Investors won't like a comparison of an IPO
with riding a roller coaster." However, since we've IPO-ed and during the IPO, I have
experienced the same as I experienced riding a roller coaster in the U.S. My favorite roller
coaster is the Kingda Ka in Six Flags Great Mountain -- Magic Mountains (sic) (Mountain). I
experienced our IPO the same as riding that coaster. Having said that, now we are IPO-ed,
I think since our IPO, we had quite of a smooth ride. And our -- and that was based on our
strategy and the way we executed it. And we intend to continue that going forward.
So let's have a look at how we introduced a.s.r. at the IPO. And I believe on this slide, you
will ﬁnd all the key topics that have been discussed during the 2.5 years of our listing. As
said, we became listed in 2016. And within a time frame of only 15 months, we fully
executed the privatization from the Dutch government. And this journey, some people
referred to it as a textbook IPO. And we're proud on that. Most of you have been with us
the whole journey. Some of you regrettably have joined us later. But I'm sure you will
recognize all the words on this slide. This is, in a nutshell, our equity story. And I can add,
we are very pleased with the strong support we get from all of our investors.
Today our focus will be, as you can expect, mostly on ﬁnancial issues and on the business
aspects of a.s.r. However, running an insurance company comprises more than only the
ﬁnancials. It's also about creating the right culture and develop very strong corporate
values.
So allow me to address a few words on something fundamental to the success of a.s.r.
And Steve Jobs once said, "A company needs to have a why." The why of a.s.r. is we are
here to help customers. Without customers, we are nowhere. We help them to live their
lives and to mitigate risks they are not willing or not able to bear themselves. And we help
them to accumulate wealth for future use, for example, in our pension area. And all 3,800
employees at a.s.r. are committed to deliver the services for our customers.

Yesterday evening, we had this dinner. And those of you who were present were able to
meet 3 enthusiastic young talents of a.s.r., who each of them make the diﬀerence on a
day-by-day base within a.s.r. But I'm equally proud of all the more senior colleagues,
being in the 40s, 50s and even some of them in their 60s, they put forward their best
skills to deliver to our customers. And we all within a.s.r. act according to a number of, to
my opinion, very important corporate values. They are our behavioral compass. And those
are quite simple: we are helpful; we think ahead; and we act decisively. These corporate
values have created the winning culture at a.s.r. And I'm -- quite frankly, I'm proud on the
achievements we have delivered together.
So now let's have a look at what is a.s.r. today. a.s.r. is one of the most diversiﬁed
insurance companies in the Netherlands, with roughly 60% of top line in Non-life and
40% in Life. Our history goes back almost 300 years. And we are deeply rooted in the
Dutch society. We're a leading insurance company in the Netherlands with a very clear
top 3 position. We run the business with very well-known brands. And we have a leading
position in the still dominant broker distribution in the Netherlands. And ﬁnally, we are
able to serve over 1.5 million families and corporates in the Netherlands.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the Netherlands, we have to operate in a very fast-moving and highly regulated
environment. So we have to stay on top of all the trends we see today in the economy, in
digitalization and also in all kind of regulatory trends. And I'm not going to talk you
through all of those. But let me mention 2 of them.
Technological developments aﬀect the industry and drive the development of new
business models. Philippe Wits this afternoon will talk about how we approach those
technical developments within a.s.r. Secondly, we see lots of socio-demographic
developments. And also there, one example, in the Netherlands today, out of the 7 million
people in the workforce, 1 million of them are no longer employees, they have become
self-employed. And this number is growing rapidly. Those individuals require diﬀerent
services and tailor-made insurance solutions from insurance companies. And we are
perfectly positioned and well placed to beneﬁt from this macro trend. And Michel
Verwoest will talk about this, this morning. And therefore, adaptability has become one of
our distinctive characteristics. The proof is -- of that is in how the people that know a.s.r.
already, for more than 10 years, the proof of our ability to change is in the change we have
gone through since our nationalization in 2008. And therefore, I think the investment
proposition that we presented in 2016 is still intact.
And let me give 2 examples of our investment proposition and why we think it is still valid
and will remain in place also going forward. First of all, we combine a very robust stock of
capital with a high return on equity and very attractive capital generation track record.
Secondly. And that's another example, we've been proving that integration of bolt-on
acquisitions is in the DNA of a.s.r.
(technical diﬃculty)
(ability) together. We aim to achieve a combined ratio in the range of 94% to 96%. We
have decided to exclude Health from the target because, as you may know, Health is a

Page 4 of 84



Company Name: ASR Nederland NV
Company Ticker: ASRNL NA Equity
Date: 2018-10-10

FINAL

product line that is more prone to political scrutiny. And our targets for Health remains
where it is at 99%.
And why do we introduce this range? Firstly, the range reﬂects our leadership to manage
these products in a proﬁtable way and, at the same time, realize growth. It allows us to
remain competitive and to protect our in-force portfolio. The range allows us to absorb
normal storm and large claims. And for example, in a year that we see the normal storms
that we have assumed, the normal large claims and large ﬁres, we assume that we will be
able to deliver the 96%. And in years that are much better, for example, like last year, 2017,
we had hardly any big storms, hardly any big ﬁres, then we are probably able to deliver
closer to the 94%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Importantly, this combined ratio target goes hand-in-hand with our Non-life growth
targets. As you know, the Dutch markets in Non-life is not a growing market. Despite that,
we intend to grow inorganic -- sorry, organically between 3% and 5% over the next three
years. So the combined ratio target should be seen in connection with our growth targets.
And together, this will create value also from a shareholder perspective going forward. So
we think we are comfortable taking market share and, at the same time, remaining a very
proﬁtable Non-life business in the Netherlands.
Then let's move to Life. In Life, we also have 2 metrics. First of all, we intend, despite the
declining Individual life book, to keep our operating result in Life stable compared to
2017. And by then, the Life returns was EUR 633 million. And we remain conﬁdent that in
terms of earnings, we can maintain the level of 2017, as said, for the next three years. And
secondly, in Life, we are very focused on managing our costs. And we target to lower
them from the current 57 basis points on our reserves to safely within the range of
between 45 and 55 basis points on basic provision. And last but not least, we also
introduced fee generation business at our IPO. And this business is growing very
signiﬁcant and has an increased absolute contribution to our net operating proﬁt. And in
this area, we target to achieve at least EUR 40 million of operating results of the
combination of the 2 segments, Distribution on the one hand and Asset Management on
the other hand. And this is, by the way, excluding our banking activities. And I will talk
about them in a minute. And after we have reached the EUR 40 million level, we aim at a
growth of at least 5% per annum going forward. And of course, as you know us, we will
not refrain from beating our growth targets if opportunities of growth appear.
In my introduction, I already talked about the other stakeholders. And we think it is
important as an insurance company deeply rooted in Dutch society that we also need to
introduce a number of nonﬁnancial targets as well. And those are all also for the medium
term. First of all, for our customers. As you may know, we on a day by day measure how
happy customers are with the interaction with our colleagues. And last year, we already
had a very high score, a positive Net Promoter Score of 40 points. And we aim to grow
this already very positive from a Net Promoter Score towards 44 points in 2021. And that
will be hard work.
The second nonﬁnancial target we introduced today is on our investment portfolio. And
speciﬁcally to the measurement of the carbon footprint and the level of impact
investments we can do with our portfolio in the next three years. We explore
Page 5 of 84



FINAL

Company Ticker: ASRNL NA Equity
Date: 2018-10-10

opportunities to further reduce the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio going
forward. And that will be in line with the Paris Agreement. a.s.r. already measures and
evaluates the results of its eﬀects with the ﬁnal goal to support the global energy
transition. We already measure the carbon footprint in as well our sovereigns and
corporate portfolio, as well as in equities and in credits. And we will now add real estate
and mortgages to that. And our objective is that 95% of our total investment portfolio is
measured regularly by 2021. And I believe we are the ﬁrst insurance company that
announced such a target going forward. And in addition to the target, we aim to invest up
to EUR 1.2 billion in impact investment. And this can be done within our return
requirements.

Bloomberg Transcript

And thirdly, yesterday evening, we talked about the culture within a.s.r. We stimulate our
employees to help local society and communities by allocating part of their -- of our
employees' time to help individuals, families and groups with ﬁnancial issues. We for
example provide ﬁnancial courses for children. We help families to improve their ﬁnancial
planning and assist communities more generally. And we aim to grow in this area by 5%
per annum.
Let's now talk about how we aim to deliver on those targets. And our plans can be
categorized in these 3 buckets. First of all, we maintain our ﬁnancial discipline. It has
gotten us where we are today. Secondly, we manage the value from our existing business.
And with that, we mean both the robust capital-generative service books as well as the
existing Non-life business. That positions us altogether so uniquely as a true composite in
the Dutch market. And thirdly, we have identiﬁed a number of areas for growth. Today,
we'd -- we want to focus on the areas of growth. So in the presentations of Michel, Karin,
Jack and Dick, we will talk about the areas of growth. And value over volume, by the way,
does not mean for us that we are shrinking to glory. But we deploy our capital in a rational
manner to pursue proﬁtable growth volumes and earnings growth in the selected areas,
being P&C, Disability, Asset Management and Pension DC.
And let me take you through our ﬁnancial disciplines and how we intend to deploy capital
in pursuit of proﬁtable growth and extract value from the existing business. First and
foremost, our disciplined approach to manage the business is what deﬁnes us. And this
has proven to be successful. And we do not adjust this going forward. Value over volume,
as said, continues to be our key principle when selling products and services. We of
course pursue volume growth. But we'll only do this if it is value accretive. Maintaining our
discipline in terms of cost eﬃciency is key to not return to past mistakes of the industry.
Opportunities to consolidate in markets will be continued to look at, as will certain
expansions of our product and services portfolio will be considered. This -- and I want to
be clear about it, this at all times evaluated against an ambitious hurdle rate of at least 12%
return on our investments.
And maintaining a strong balance sheet with room to maneuver. Capital is allocated
rational. And this takes me to the next slide about capital deployment. We will continue to
allocate capital in a rational way, as said. And we continue to use our Solvency ladder. You
never want to be below the 100%. 120% is the risk appetite. 140% is the level where we
will be able to pay cash dividends. And if we are above -- safely above the 160%, we will
be able to be entrepreneurial going forward. You are quite familiar with this ladder. It
Page 6 of 84

FINAL

hasn't changed. And if and when we are in the entrepreneurial zone, we focus on growth
opportunities. And we use this zone to adopt regulatory changes, like the lower UFR from
4.2% in the direction of 3.65%. And with the current reported Solvency ladder of -Solvency level of 194%, we for sure are in the entrepreneurial zone. So the question raised
here, the answer to that is a clearly yes, we are above that zone. And we are on the
lookout for proﬁtable growth.
And we see 3 ways to deploy our capital going forward. First of all, organic growth. As
you have seen, we feel comfortable with a growing market share, especially in the non-life
area. And we have growth ambitions in the area of distribution and services and in asset
management. Another value-additive way to grow the business at a.s.r. is to add books of
business, especially in the life area. We are already the consolidator of the funeral market.
And we intend to become the consolidator of the individual market in the -- individual life
market in the Netherlands as well. And last but not the least, we have a robust level of
Solvency. And we do see room to increase our exposure to certain market risks. And Chris
will talk about this in depth later today because we are fully aware of where we are in the
cycle. And if -- let me make it clear, if there are no opportunities to deploy capital for
further growth, we -- and we can't meet our ROE target anymore, we will not hesitate, we
are not capital hoarders, to return capital in the most shareholder-friendly way we can
imagine. And also, Chris will give some guidance on that later today.
And this matrix where we plot our business is familiar to you. And it changed a little bit. So
let me talk you through it. In the top left, where you will ﬁnd the Non-life segment, we
focus on to continue our organic growth in P&C and Disability. And if we see inorganic
opportunities there, we will certainly consider them. Health insurance, which was at the
right side, is now added in the quadrant left upper. And it's now combined with our
growth target in the Disability business. So we think having a health insurance company
needs to be linked to our Disability business. And together, we will be able to accumulate
growth there. Selected Distribution and Services, which were also on the right side, are
now on the upper left. We have acquired those companies over the last few years. And
they will facilitate further grow going forward. And they will be helpful to become an even
more service-oriented company. Our proximity to the end customer has reduced. And
this, we feel, is key to be adaptive to all of the trends we discussed earlier.
The Life segment basically could be split into 2 areas. First of all, the bottom left, where
you will ﬁnd our service books, which we adequately have capitalized and managed to
lower the cost and to variablize the cost and to deliver excellent service. We have moved
Funeral to this section. For both Funeral and Individual life, we will be actively on the
lookout for opportunities to add books of business. And I will come later on in my
presentation on what are the opportunities we still see in the Dutch market. Then in the
top right, we have our growth opportunities that exist primarily out of the Life segment,
being Asset Management and Pension DC. And to conclude on this slide, we also have
non-core. We had it in the past. And we recently decided that we need to move the bank
to this area. And we are in the middle of a process of evaluating opportunities for ASR
Bank going forward. But as from today, we consider the bank to be non-core.
Now let us zoom a little bit into Non-life, followed by Life and Asset Management. Let me
start with P&C. The foundation, the reason why we are successful in this area and are able
Page 7 of 84



FINAL

Company Name: ASR Nederland NV
Company Ticker: ASRNL NA Equity
Date: 2018-10-10

to grow proﬁtably in the Dutch very competitive market lies in the following unique selling
points. First of all, our insurance craftsmanship. And with that, we mean, ﬁrst of all, our
underwriting skills does comprise risk selection and pricing; claims management; and
running an operation in a very eﬃcient way. Secondly, we have a leading position in the
still dominant broker distribution in the Netherlands. Today, out -- every 1 out of 3 policies
that is -- that comes through the broker distribution ends up with a.s.r. So our market
share in that area has increased towards roughly 30% to 33%. And we have learned how
we can maintain a superior combined ratio while, at the same time, show organic growth.
And we now today have learned how to integrate portfolios on our IT system. And our IT
systems can onboard more business going forward without increasing costs signiﬁcantly.

Bloomberg Transcript

And where should the P&C growth come from going forward? First of all, organically, as
said, by gaining market share at the targeted combined ratio. If we can't make the
combined ratio between 94 and 96, we will probably decide not to grow. And if and when
available, we are willing to onboard small and medium-sized P&C books without, as said,
increasing our operational costs going forward. We will beneﬁt from the created
economies of scale on our new platform. And Michel will talk about that later on today.
And further on, we will be able to increase the share of wallet within our acquired
distribution partners going forward.
Then Disability. Actually, the foundation is comparable to the P&C foundation, a strong
knowledge of underwriting, pricing and claims handling. But we also have become the
owners of an evolving disability platform. And Michel will explain this later in detail. But
today, we own a number of distribution companies. We now -- we own added services
that help people to remain healthy. We have in-house claim prevention services. And we
have actually disability treatment and reintegration businesses. And that all together
enables us to build a platform going forward to capture the growth in Disability.
So we will be able, going forward, to serve customers through the whole value chain. And
we will own lots of customer data from all of those angles. And this will be helpful to price
the business adequately but also to help customers to remain healthy and to bring down
the combined ratio. And as a result of that, we will be able to improve customer services
and as said, especially in the area of self-employed people that has become increasingly
important, between 40 -- 94 and 96.
So now the Life segment. Life premiums, as said, represent roughly 40% of our total
premiums. But the contribution of operational result and capital generation is and will
remain large for longer. The robust capitalized books that we manage and service book
that we have comprise the traditional DB Pensions, the Life Individual business and the
Funeral book. Our Funeral book, by the way, is not closed for new production. But sales
have reduced since the commission ban that was introduced by the government in 2006.
Our foundation for the successful Life business lies in that we are able to run this business
eﬀectively. And we have been able to implement simpliﬁed processes with low and
variable costs. And Karin will talk about that later today. We've been able to excel in the
migration and conversion of books. And we have become specialists in how we can
migrate portfolios, complex portfolios, simplify them and bring them over to our platform.
And lastly but not less important, we have been able to optimize Solvency II capital and
investment returns on our own books and acquired books.

FINAL

So what are the growth opportunities we see in this area? As said, we are a consolidator in
the Funeral area. And we intend to become the consolidator of Individual life books in the
Netherlands, something that the market is already, for more than 10 years, looking for. But
until now, nobody was successful in that area. And please refer again to the stated targets.
We intend to keep our operational proﬁt at least stable compared to last year's, the EUR
633 million. And we intend to lower the cost from 57 basis points to 45 -- to between 45
and 55 of basic provisions.
Then lastly, the -- our growth pursued in the Asset Management area. Growth of our Asset
Management businesses was already targeted when we IPO-ed the business. Basically, at
that moment in time, our asset managers were only focusing on managing our own
insurance assets. And we have been able, since then, to grow organically and
inorganically our assets under management. And we did it in a proﬁtable way.

Bloomberg Transcript

The foundation of our success in Asset Management lies in, ﬁrst of all, we have a very
long-lasting experience in liability-driven investment management based on managing
our own insurance assets. Niches like Dutch mortgages and real estate and ESG-related
assets are also -- have also become one of the successful aspects in our Asset
Management business. And we have introduced a range of capital-light Pension DC
products over the last few years. And we have been able to grow in that area. So we see
clear opportunities going forward. And Jack and Dick will talk about it extensively later
today, to grow in the Asset Management segment. And we will continue to build and buy
on -- sorry, we will continue our build-and-buy strategy in this area to add scale and skills
as well at the same time. And we aim to achieve, as said, an operating result from this
segment of at least EUR 20 million by 2021; and from there, 5% growth per annum.
During my presentation, I, a number of times, mentioned that we still see signiﬁcant
inorganic growth opportunities in the Netherlands. And as you know, we prefer -- and we
prefer to look at bolt-on acquisitions. And how we deﬁne them going forward, let me talk
you through this. We've used the DNB statistics to prepare this graph. And we have
excluded the traditional top 5, being Achmea, NN-Delta Lloyd, us, Aegon and VIVAT. And
this leaves us with the following opportunities in the Dutch market. And we've identiﬁed
per segment at least 12 to 14 companies that may be well available going forward. Within
the P&C mid-market, we have identiﬁed roughly EUR 3 billion of premiums, which is 30%
of the Dutch P&C Non-life market. Within Disability, in the mid-market, we have identiﬁed
roughly EUR 1 billion out of the EUR 3.5 billion, which represents -- which is -- which could
become available going forward. And within Life, the group of mid-market insurance
companies which own roughly EUR 20 billion of provisions. So all in all, in those 3 areas,
we think there are still 12 to 14 insurance companies available that may need to ﬁnd a safe
home going forward.
And what are the drivers for consolidation today? First of all, the regulatory Solvency II
framework. Going forward, also IFRS 17 may create opportunities to consolidate the
market. But the most important, especially in the life market, is every small and mediumsized life insurance company faces the decrease of the cost coverage. And they all need
to ﬁnd a solution for the lower costs coverage in their products. And as we all know, there
is an end in cost cutting. So we expect that a number of those companies will need to ﬁnd
a safe home.

FINAL

When and how much this potential will occur. So to speak, is uncertain. It is diﬃcult to
predict. And we will not try to guide you on that. We merely want to stress that inorganic
growth, like the bolt-ons that we have done over the last few years, is a real possibility to
grow a.s.r.'s business. And as you well know, we prefer the M&A strategy in terms of bolton and smaller acquisition. And we never have been focused on large transformational
transactions.
And the question will inevitably be raised today. So let me preempt it a little bit. If and
when we see a possibility to do a large-scale transformational transaction, we from a
management perspective feel obliged that we at least need to look at it. But in all cases,
we will stick within our ﬁnancial framework. And as you know, one of the important criteria
in our ﬁnancial framework is a transaction has to meet the 12% return on investment. So
yes, if and when VIVAT will become available for sales. And we've seen all the press
release recently, we will take a look at it. And the jury is out whether we will be able to

So let me conclude. And what are the key messages I would like you to remember? We
have delivered on our targets. And we continue to build on this very strong track record
of delivery. We have deﬁned a very ambitious set of new targets for the period of 2018 to
2021. And I like you to remember, those are targets we have to realize in a competitive
Dutch market. So compare our targets with all the targets of our competitors. We are
uniquely positioned to leverage our capabilities. And we have -- that we have to grow the
business as well organically and inorganically going forward. And underlying our strategic
principle will remain to be value over volume. And we deploy capital for proﬁtable
growth. And we remain committed to our ﬁnancial discipline. And last but not least, what
you get today is a.s.r. as it is plus our pursuit of proﬁtable growth.
Thank you very much. I would like to hand over to Chris, who will elaborate on capital
management.

H. C. Figee
Jos, thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen. Good morning. Great to have all of you
in this room. It's large -- a large number. And great to have -- could you stand up, please?
Also great to have people on our webcast.
For those of you who picked up a booklet when you came in, there's some information on
the art in our room. We're joined here by the 2 brothers, the Witts. And...

So I was trying to say we're joined here today by 2 gentlemen, 2 distinguished gentlemen,
the 2 brothers, the Witts. The guy on the left-hand side is Jan de Witt, where he was the
ﬁrst actuary in the Netherlands living in around 1600s. So when I'm talking about the
Solvency II, ex UFR, ex VA, with the DTA-adjusted tiering margin, at least one of them is in
this room will enjoy that composition. Secondly, sorry to say, they -- ironically, he didn't
live very long. He was beheaded by the relevant authorities at that time. So when you talk
about vigilant regulators and a tough DNB, life isn't so bad today.
Having said that, let me start with my presentation. It's called a quality balance sheet
enabling the pursuit of future growth. The 3 words to remember is quality, a quality
balance sheet; enabling because, ultimately, the ﬁnance function, the risk function should
enable the development of the business; and the word proﬁt, proﬁtable. We aim to
achieve proﬁtable value-creating growth for our group. And of course, I'm going to talk
about a.s.r. as what we do today using the familiar terms of stock and of ﬂow. I think I'd
love you to remember a.s.r. as an and company, not an or company. And I mean, a.s.r. is a
company that is able to deliver actually the returns and invest in the business and return
to shareholders. It's not an or company. It's not or invest in our business or return to our
shareholders. We're an and company. We're a company that creates a continuous ﬂow of
proﬁts of capital on already strong stock of capital that we can deploy in our business
organically and inorganically and return to shareholders. We're an and company, not an
or company.
To that matter, I'll start with earnings. Looking back on the last year since IPO, we've
delivered a signiﬁcant growth in the earnings of our group. Whether you look at IFRS
earnings or operating earnings, growth substantially north of 10% per annum. And if you
were to strip out the beneﬁts from shadow account and in capital release, there is
underlying earnings growth of this group by any metric, which also translated into strong
earnings per share and dividends per share. We were able to translate the earnings
growth in the group into attractive returns to shareholder, with over EUR 750 million of
cash distributed to our shareholders since 2015. So the group has had a good historic
performance, good historic track record of growing our earnings.
That actually is, of course, founded in our business. If you look at our business portfolio
using the 4 quadrants that Jos already mentioned, the matrix that Jos produced, each of
those 4 segments have shown attractive earnings levels in an absolute terms and growing
earnings levels over time. Whether you look at our Non-life businesses, whether you've
also plotted the distribution businesses or whether you look at our service books or the
Asset Management operations, all of those businesses have shown growth. And I'm very
pleased that the Asset Management business is now also -- it's small. But it's growing and
starts to contribute meaningfully to our bottom line
The box at the bottom right is our non-core operations. In 2015, pre-IPO, we made
additional reservation for the Leidsche Rijn Centrum development that has been fully, fully
provided for. That was a real estate development activity that we have inherited from the
old Fortis organization and that we're rounding oﬀ this year, fully provided for and we've
moved to the bank, to the non-core segment as well. In terms of earnings, the bank has
been relatively ﬂat in the past year. So think about a 0 plus 1, minus 1 type of result in the

Page 11 of 84

FINAL

past year. So the bank has been included to the non-core graph. But the actual numbers
are relatively small.
And the Asset Management business is now a EUR 10 million sustainably, 50-50 split
between real estate business and the classical capital markets, Asset Management
business. But it's clear to us that all quadrants have been contributing to our earnings and
all quadrants have been showing attractive level of earnings and attractive growth in
earnings, which yield a very strong return on equity on a growing stock of equity. Despite
about 9.5% growth in equity or a 10% growth in operating equity, the ROE of the group
has been above 14%, sometimes even above 16%, 17% in very speciﬁc quarters. So we've
been able to deliver a good ROE on a growing stock of equity.
That also poses a slight numerical challenge because, in the long term, the denominator
in the ROE calculation will catch up. That is the E, the average equity in the ROE will
continue to grow over time. And at a pace where we should be adding results and adding
earnings, the E will catch up, putting some kind of mathematical pressure on the ROE
simply because the denominator will increase. That's the main reason why we put the
ROE range in a 12% to 14% range. We will not drop below 12%. If you do some numbers
analysis on last year's earnings, for our ROE to drop below 12%, the E would need to be
above EUR 4.4 billion. And it will take quite some time before we get there. But the ROE
range of 12% to 14% basically says we can continue to run at the existing high level of
earnings, we can add some earnings growth to it. But ultimately, there is an E component
that needs to catch up, which will gradually erode the ROE. But 12% to 14% is the range
that is still consistent with creating value, still much above the cost of capital and the level
that we feel is consistent with outperforming businesses as we're running it. So strong
ROE on a growing book of equity. And we'll continue to have an ROE substantially north
of the cost of capital.
Let me then move to capital. The terms we use, I guess you know, ﬂow and stock. So the
question, does one have enough capital? Does one generate enough capital? And those
who can say yes to those questions are positioned on the top right quarter. We labeled
the Insurance Nirvana, those people have reached a higher level of karma, where you get
-- you have lots of capital. And you create capital. And you have this positive ﬂow where
adding strong stock creates more capital, gives you more stock, creates more capital. And
of course, we'd love to position ourselves to get further into this nirvana state of mind.
Let me talk about stock, let me talk about ﬂow in terms of our capital position. Our stock
of capital, like our IFRS earnings, like our IFRS capital, has been growing diligently in the
past years. As a matter fact, the owned funds that we have, whether it's the complete
owned funds or the unrestricted Tier 1 owned funds, have been growing at a rate almost
double the rate of the required capital growth. So we've outgrown the required capital
twice in terms of availability of funds. This actually caused the Solvency II ratio to increase
over time from 180% in 2015 to 194% at the end of last year, in spite giving back EUR 750
million of cash to our shareholders. So a strong growth in available capital.
The required capital has also grown about 2% a year, growth mostly driven by insurance
risk and market risk. As you can see on the graph on the left, the insurance risk growth,
half of it was in Non-life or at least P&C. The P&C business, the growth in the P&C
Page 12 of 84

FINAL

business, the acquisition of Generali added Non-life capital requirement. The other half is
50-50 between Disability and Life. And the Life growth and required capital in Life mostly
was for longevity. And it's a technical thing. If interest rates fall, the charts for longevity risk
goes up. So if you think about the growth in our insurance risk capital, 1/2 of it is P&C, 1/4
of it is Non-life Disability and 1/4 of it is the increased longevity charge due to falling rates.
Secondly, you've seen our market risk increase over time. Our equity position actually has
remained stable. But we've added real estate to our market risk portfolio, added
mortgages and added credit. Today, our market risk is about 43% of our prediversiﬁcation capital. We think we could go theoretically up to 50%. We don't want to be
north of 50% because we're an insurance company, not an investment fund. So we'll not
go north of 50%. Today, I don't think we'll actually reach the 50%. We have no plans to
get there. But there's ﬂexibility to add market risk if we see opportunities to do that. The
small rerisking program that we announced in the half year will move to 43%, somewhere
to the 44%, 45%. And that's a level that we're actually quite comfortable with. So I would
love to say I'll let you take on that. We can add market risk. We will probably not go to the
full amount. The maximum is 50%. And we'll do it very diligently and with very much in
mind with where the market actually is. But in summary, owned funds outgrowing, by any
metric, outgrowing our required capital in spite of us returning capital to shareholders.

Bloomberg Transcript

Today, by any measure, our stock of solvency is strong. Whether you take the solvency as
is, simply the solvency number that were produced, exceeds 160% entrepreneurial norm
by a signiﬁcant margin. And also, if you were -- you take into account the mandatory
unavoidable decline in the UFR, our Solvency II level today would be at 183%. So if we
were to account a UFR of 3.6%, the target UFR that we appear to be kind of driving to, our
Solvency II would be 183%, signiﬁcantly over the 160%.
The second metric, the more economic view, i.e. take a UFR that's consistent with our
investment returns, a UFR of 2.4%, our Solvency II would be at 154%, 158% mark,
depending on a bit how you work with tiering, the oﬃcial number is 154%, substantially
above 120%. So whether you take the headline number or you take economic number,
both ratios actually show you a.s.r. has suﬃcient stock of solvency. A third perspective, the
S&P perspective is not on this chart. But the redundancy capital from an S&P perspective
nears the AAA range, at least mathematically.
And fourthly, if you take the regulatory exit value, a metric that's being discussed in our
industry, where the deﬁnition seems to gyrate towards solvency ex UFR, ex VA, ex DTA,
that ratio would still also be in the 110%, 120% range. So the owned funds ex UFR, ex VA
with no DTA at all will also be north of EUR 3 billion. So whatever perspective you take,
the headline number, our own economic number, or you take S&P's view, or you take the
exit value view, our stock of solvency is strong and able to withstand shocks.
We've shown on this page sensitivities, as we show typically. Diﬀerence this time, we've
taken out the VA eﬀect. So these are really the growth sensitivities of various movements,
spread movements in sovereign bonds, corporate spread movements, rate movements in
equities and real estate. You can show the various implications of adverse market
movements. We could absorb those adverse market movements. Actually, if you were to
add up these movements. So if you took on this sovereign spread, the credit spread

impact, 100 basis points lower yield and equity is minus 20; and real estate, minus 10, that
together would be less than 30% to keep our solvency still substantially above 160%, not
taking into account the beneﬁt from the VA that would come with that. These are gross
numbers ex any VA impact. So our solvency is at the level that we think we can sustain
market shocks, that we would not enjoy those stocks (sic) (shocks), deﬁnitely have a bad
night sleep over those shocks. But the group would have been able to sustain those
shocks and still be safely over 160%. So a resilient solvency ratio also in line with our
market exposures.
Limit dependency on group level diversiﬁcation. Solvency is not only strong at holdco. But
also strong at opco. We have a deliberate policy to keep capital at the opcos and keep
our opcos strongly capitalized. As a matter of fact, the delta between the solvency of the
largest opcos, Life and Non-life. And the solvency of the group has been around 10% to
11% in the past years, reﬂecting a Level 3 diversiﬁcation. Our group does not depend on a
huge amount of diversiﬁcation that kind of shows a great level of group solvency not
found within the business solvency. In our situation, solvency is strong at the business and
at the group. There's a 10-points Level 3 diversiﬁcation. But that is not the driver of the
solvency of a.s.r. Solvency is strong at group and at opcos. Of course, there's
diversiﬁcation inside the operating entities. Even if you were to strip out all diversiﬁcation
beneﬁts, recognize no diversiﬁcation at all, our solvency ratio would still be north of 160%.
So diversiﬁcation helps, it beneﬁts but doesn't drive the number. The number is found
into a hard solvency in the operating entities.
To add to that, we have also ﬂexibility to add capital. We've got ﬂexibility to raise capital
going forward. Whether you take the solvency perspective or the IFRS perspective or the
S&P perspective, our group has the ﬂexibility to add more capital going forward. And this
metric, we think, the balance sheet, the IFRS balance sheet drives the quantum of capital
you can raise. Solvency drives the instrument you can you choose.
If you look at our leverage, we report a leverage today of 25%. We think that leverage
could increase if we wanted to. The leverage actually is quite overstated because of our
shadow accounting methodology. That does not yield -- the realized capital gains are not
included in this number. For most peers, it actually is. So if you were to recalculate our
number, including the shadow accounting reserves. And make an adjustment for the LAT,
the adjusted leverage ratio would be around 20%. So a comparable number to peers.
Because most of us in the industry use realized capital gains as part of equity, the adjusted
number would be around 20% compared to peers. That's why we're saying we can think
we can actually live with a 10% higher leverage number, either 25% to 30%; or in a
comparable terms, 20% to 30% is something we could actually sustain.
Now we're going to lever up just for the fun of it. Leverage is not a goal in itself. But it
shows you we've got ﬂexibility to raise capital in the capital markets if we were to deploy it
if we knew we were to ﬁnd attractive ways to spend that money. And our Solvency II
regime allows us to pick and choose instrument. We have had room in each and every
instrument out there, whether it's a Tier 1 or Tier 2 instrument, a perp Tier 2 or a data Tier
2, we have ﬂexibility to pick and choose the instrument we like. So we can raise capital.
We have got the ﬂexibility to raise capital. And we've got the room to choose the
instrument we like.

FINAL

And for illustrative purposes, if we were to go to the upper end of our leverage range to
35%, that would mean around EUR 900 million of additional hybrid capital we could raise.
The interest cover in that situation would still be around 6.5x also saved in a single
(earnings). So think about EUR 500 million to EUR 900 million of leverage we could
add/raise to deploy if that would be needed, if that would be required.
Finally, closing oﬀ on stock and ﬂow, let me bring together the left and right-hand side of
our balance sheet, asset leverage and ﬁnancial leverage. Because in -- as part of prudent
and responsible ﬁnancial management, you should look at both indicators in sync, how
much asset risk does one have, how much ﬁnancial risk does one have? Starting on the
asset risk side. Our market risk at the end of 2017 was about 46% of total risk, in line with
the industry. We've made an analysis. And IR can share with you some of our Life industry
peers. And we found that most of us run between 46%, 47%, 48% of our risk allocated to
market risk.

Bloomberg Transcript

If you then zoom in on that market risk and relate that to your own funds. So the asset
leverage, meaning risky assets or yieldy assets, divided by your own funds, we're actually
kind of slightly less then where the market is. And by risky assets, we deﬁne equities; real
estate, excluding rural. Rural real estate land is a diﬀerent asset class. It's qualiﬁed as real
estate. But it's not as risky as classical asset real estate. So we look at equities, real estate
land, plus any bonds that are noninvestment grade or not rated. That, lumped together as
a risky asset group related to our Tier 1 capital, is about 100%. So 1x unrestricted Tier 1 is
our high yield asset book, compared to the industry where you're more looking at 140%,
150%. So our market risk is in line with -- just slightly less than our peers.
On the ﬁnancial leverage side, it's clear that by any perspective, whether you use a
Solvency II perspective or you use the IFRS perspective, our leverage ratios are less than
our peers. We have more unrestricted Tier 1 in our asset base and we have less ﬁnancial
leverage on our IFRS balance sheet. And again here it is the unadjusted number. And
comparable you would actually use 20% for us and 28% for our peers. So in summary, our
balance sheet has low ﬁnancial leverage, an average to slightly below-average market
asset leverage. So in combination, it shows you a robust and very solid balance sheet.
Now of course, we could rerisk our business. We had some discussions yesterday
evening. Are you willing or able planning to massively rerisk your business? We could. But
probably, we won't. We've indicated by the half year numbers that we're adding some
risk to our investment book, think about 4% or 5% in terms of solvency ratio, EUR 80
million of capital. That EUR 80 million of capital buys you around EUR 150 million of
equities and EUR 500 million of investment-grade credit. That's why you can aﬀord
spending EUR 80 million of capital. That would bring your market risk or our market risk
to about 44% of total risk. That would bring the asset leverage from 105% to around 107%.
So it's very much in the same range.
If we were to move our market risk to the full 50%, then you talk about EUR 350 million
more required capital. Then you're talking about 15 to 20 points of solvency that you'd
spend. Now it's unlikely that we do -- that we'd spend that amount over time. Think more
of a gradual continuous optimization of your investment portfolio, in line with the few
points that we're doing this year. Think about investing in real estate, think about investing
Page 15 of 84

FINAL

in mortgages, because the 2 asset classes that we feel comfortable with, even if we're late
cycle today, the Dutch real estate market is well underpinned, the Dutch mortgage
market, especially if you're a buy-and-hold investor, is still valued very attractive for us. So
we can see some continuous optimization on market risk. But by far and by sure, another
big asset play going forward.
And furthermore we've developed a number of tools that will allow us to optimize the
return on capital in the investment grade space. So a tool that says, if you look at rating
categories, issue categories and maturities, where do you get most bang for your buck,
where do you get most return on solvency capital on sub-asset class and submaturities.
And we ﬁnd there is room to optimize the credit portfolio to optimize the return on
solvency capital further. So in terms of market risk, expect a gradual small increase of
market risk, not moving to the 50%, something similar to what we've done this year,
possibly a bit less. If we do anything, focused on real estate and mortgages and focusing
on further within the current capital consumption optimizing our asset mix.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving from stock to ﬂow. The ﬂow of capital is kind of always diﬃcult to determine,
because the solvency ratio from one year to another, you look at the diﬀerence between 2
ratios, where the numerator of the ratio is an NPV number. So dividing that up in 2
buckets is always a challenge, it's a calculatory challenge. Jan de Witt would have loved it.
We always take 3 perspectives to give the full story. There is not one number that you can
use to identify the ﬂow of a.s.r.. But we look at what the business capital generates. So the
business cap generation; we look at the organic cap generation. So business plus the
release of the book; and we look at the total amount of owned funds that the group
generates.
And this chart, by now you know. We look at what the business generates. So the honest
capital from underwriting results, from fee income, from excess returns. We look at the
capital from the organic cap generation, which is the business cap gen plus the release of
capital from our book. And we look out how much owned funds we generate. Irrespective
of what the required capital does, is the group able to say sustainably and considerably
and structurally add owned funds over time? Those 3 metrics drive or determine your
view on a.s.r., determine your view on how we're actually doing. And those numbers have
shown favorable development over time. Here, you can see the business capital
generation, the organic capital generation and the total EOF accretion over time.
The business shows -- the business cap gen, underwriting results, fees and spreads, then
you can add the book release to get organic cap gen, or you can look at the total owned
funds generation over time. And the latter is, of course, a bit more volatile. There are
more mobile changes in there. There is market valuations in there. But ultimately, we want
to make sure that our group generates owned funds consistently over time, irrespective of
what you do with the required capital.
Going forward, we'll make one change in methodology. And I promise you it's the only
one to do today. The only mobile change today is that when we dive -- when we're diving
into our business capital generation, we found that we used to risk margin on the new
business as part of business cap gen, whereas most of our peers actually net that risk
margin on new business with the risk margin release from the existing book. So we found
Page 16 of 84

FINAL

it's probably better reﬂection of reality to give on the business capital generation number,
excluding the risk margin on the new business stream. And going forward, report that
new risk margin on new business as a net number for the risk margin release in the book.
It's all optics, the numbers at -- in total don't change, it's through the allocation of risk
margin consumption from one bucket to the other. So going forward, we will report
business capital generation under a newer deﬁnition that we think is more representative,
more reasonable to look at our business.
Organic cap generation, which is a business cap generation plus the return to the book,
has developed favorably. We believe EUR 430 million is feasible in 2021. So EUR 430
million of organic capital generation in 2021. Please note there is no model change here,
no methodology change here. We've had various discussion with you on the using of our
long-term investment margin, LTIMs. This is using the existing model, the existing
assumptions.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the past, when we look back, when we compare to the LTIMs -- the spread assumptions
we used, when you compare it to the actuals, in practice, the actuals were higher than the
LTIMs we used. In 2017, on average the organic cap gen understated the actual number by
about EUR 2 million a quarter, about EUR 9 million for the full year. In last -- in this year,
the understatement was about EUR 7 million in the ﬁrst six months.
So historically, the long-term investment margins that we use have underscored,
underrepresented the actual investment returns we made, at least from a ﬁxed income
perspective. So we feel very comfortable with this number because the actual investment
spreads actually will give you a higher number than that this year. But again, no modeling
changes when we announced the target. The target is according to the existing way of
working. We believe we can move to EUR 430 million in 2021. And the key drivers are on
the left-hand side of this page.
And again, that will be founded, of course, in real business achievements. Ultimately,
ﬁnance is a function of the business. What ﬁnance presents is produced by the business.
So all capital that's being generated ultimately is generated by the business. And if you
can see on this graph, each of the 4 segments contribute to generation of capital. I always
say jokingly, there are very few nonalcoholic things in life that give you so much joy as a
combined ratio below 100%. And of course, our business does that. Our combined ratio
in the Non-life business has been below 100% for the last few years. And on a growing
book. And we've added fee income to the Non-life business.
Our service books have increased our spread income, have achieved and delivered on
the synergies of recent acquisitions. The asset management businesses have delivered
fee income over time. And on our non-core businesses, we have contained the risks.
We've sold the largest part of the Leidsche, of the real estate development business.
Leidsche Rijn Centrum is yet to come. And we moved the bank into noncore. So
ultimately, whatever business capital generation or organic capital generation we
produce, it is founded in what the business produces. And the business have actually
delivered on producing results that are in line with capital generation.

Which is also shown if you go into the numbers. This chart shows you the capital allocated
to the various business lines and the ROE produced at the various business lines. All of
our businesses, all of our core operations have returns that exceed the cost of capital.
ROE, substantially above 10%. In Non-life, between 9% and 12%. The 9% actually is a
storm number in the ﬁrst half of the year. Excluding that storm number, the ROE on Nonlife would have been 14% in H1. This number also includes the health insurance business,
which is a bit of a drag on the ROE, that business in itself. If you were to exclude health,
you'd also add 1% to the ROE of the Non-life business. So Non-life safely in the valuecreating zone.
Life business, also ROE is 12% to 13% on an operating basis; including capital gains on an
IFRS basis, north of 15%. The asset management business, ROE is 11%, growing to 25%.
You can see a beneﬁt of scale. Once you get through a certain hurdle, once you get the
scale, the ROE of asset management goes up very quickly. And you can also see the noncore business is simply a business that doesn't meet our return hurdles. The ROE of those
businesses are simply lower and don't meet what we want our business to achieve. So
again, capital consumption and value creation are in line with our strategy. All of our core
businesses contribute to the creation of value to our shareholders. All of our businesses
contribute to the generation of next capital.
And of course, it will convert into earnings. Ultimately, we love to give share -- capital back
to shareholders. With a payout ratio of 54 -- 45% to 55%, we can pay out EUR 230 million
of earnings. And we can also test that level with the business cap generation or organic
cap generation. And you get implied payout ratio at between 50% and 75%. So
eﬀectively, we're paying out, no matter how you look at it, more than half of the capital we
generate. But not more than 75%. So there is also room to grow, room to increase our
payout going forward.
We just conﬁrmed, historically, if you look at the long-term view in 2016 and 2017, the
payout ratio was about 45% of our operating proﬁt. Related to the business cap gen, it
was about 60% to 70%. Related to organic cap gen, we're talking about 50% to 60%. So a
fair distribution of what we're generating capital to our shareholders. But also with some
upside going forward. Clearly in line with, how Jos stated, a stably growing dividend over
time.
A few words on holding cash, a much debated topic. Does having holding cash make a
diﬀerence? We think it doesn't. Our opcos are strongly as suﬃciently capitalized. Our
group is suﬃciently capitalized. We are in one country, one jurisdiction with one regulator.
The board of the group is the same as the board of the opcos. So there's no disciplinary
rationale for us to upstream capital. And there's no ﬁnancial rationale to upstream capital.
We like to keep the cash and the capital at our holdcos. There is opco cash, of course. But
that's cash as a function of our business.
So the opco cash is there to cover the next 12 months of holding cost, cover hybrid
expenses, cover known dividends. And that is suﬃcient. So our holding cash function
cash policy is a function of our business objectives, cover holding costs, cover hybrid
expenses. With that, we can actually very safely communicate to you and manage our
holding cash. By the way, this is excluding our credit facility. I don't think borrowing

money to keep holding cash is a good idea. But if you want to, you could add the
undrawn holding cash facility to our holding cash, which is north of EUR 300 million. It's
undrawn. But it could be seen as cash or near cash because we could have access to it
anytime we want it. At least in the past, we never had any impediments to upstream cash
to our group.
So the cash upstreams have been signiﬁcant, have been stable. In the course of this year,
every entity has actually contributed to upstreams, whether it's the asset management
business, whether it's the distribution business, they all have been able to upstream cash
to the holding. So we've had no impediments to move cash from opco to holdco as a
function of what we do of the holding cash.

Bloomberg Transcript

And as you can see as well, because the owned funds accretion has been strong. Because
of our stock has been strong, we have been able to upstream, actually, even a bit more
than our organic capital generation over time. So cash over OCC has been north of 100%,
which is a function of the broad capital generation that we've achieved in our businesses.
This then begs the question, "Dear a.s.r., what are you going to do with all this capital?
How are you going to deploy this in the most value-creating, most value-enhancing way?"
The 2 numbers to remember are 10% and 12%. In our philosophy, the cost of capital, the
cost of equity ought to be very precise. The cost of unrestricted Tier 1, we assume at 10%.
And the hurdle for return on new investment is 12%. That's the way we look at our capital
allocations. Ideally, we invest in organic growth. Organic growth is very value-creating.
You can see from the returns that our business deliver, new business in our Non-life and
asset management is value-creating business. We love to grow our capital, our business
organically. That doesn't consume much capital. But of course, that's priority #1.
Opportunity 2 is we could invest in market risk. Again, the return on the diversiﬁed capital
should be substantially north of 10%, meaning we are here to meet or exceed the cost of
equity. So when you invest at market risk, the return on the diversiﬁed market risk capital
allocation should be north of 10%. We've done that in the past. Last year and this year, we
spent the number of solvency points investing in market risk, also cognizant of where our
markets where. So for example, in the ﬁrst half of 2017, we halted our market risk program
simply because spreads were too tight, valuations were too high and didn't make sense to
allocate capital. After the Italian budget crisis. So thanks to Italy, we think there is actually
room again to invest into market risk. But on a very measured basis.
Then ﬁnally, we believe we're going to invest in inorganic growth opportunities. Jos
alluded to those. But again, only and always have the return on investment, the return on
unrestricted Tier 1, actually, it's 12%. That's the hurdle. That's the norm for investing into
inorganic opportunities. And of course, these large-scale commitments of capital will
always be tested against a reasonable payback period and will always be tested against
what would happen if we bought back shares for the same amount? Could -- does the
acquisition stand up, is it robust in light of the obvious alternative? So a disciplined
framework for allocating capital, 10% and 12%. And 3 areas where we can invest our
money.

If no deployment of capital is foreseen, we will not sit on it. We are not capital hoarders.
So and I'm going to read this chart aloud because it's important. When the SCR ratio
according to the standard formula exceeds what is needed. And from a reasonable
perspective and no proﬁtable deployment is foreseen for a reasonable period of time.
And the increase is not driven by economic factors, we will return to shareholders. So
when we look at the standard formula, there is a reasonable upper limit that we're going
to be above for a long time. And we don't know where to spend it. And the increase is not
driven by an artiﬁcial increase in the VA, for example -- imagine a situation where the
budget situation in Italy will deteriorate, spreads would blow out, the VA would go up, our
solvency would go up, that would be the wrong indicator for giving back capital. But if
there's an honest genuine increase, retained increase in our solvency ratio and we can
spend it, yes, of course, we'll give it back to the shareholders.

Bloomberg Transcript

And many of you have asked us, where is the number? At what number will you start
giving back capital to shareholders? Unfortunately, I can't give it to you. That number is -it's a bit like the Higgs particle in physics. You know it exists. But this can't be observed.
And when you see it, it's gone. By deﬁnition, you can't see it. Although we know it, you
can infer its existence, you know roughly where it is. But you have to build a multibillion
CERN tunnel to ﬁnd out where it is. But we know, of course, where the range is, where the
area is where you can start to give back capital. There is an area, that's a range that's
indicative for -- it's hard to spend all this capital.
Now that range we can develop, we think, together. And that range I can give to you. It's a
3-digit number; a 3-digit number that indicates where the discussion on capital returns
should start. And the 3-digit number, I think it's us, for management, to set the ﬁrst
number. We think it's a 2. The second number, we allow our shareholders to set. I think it's
a pretty low number, a 0 or a 1. And the third number, well, if we agree on these
principles, the third number actually is completely irrelevant.
So from our perspective, there is an area by which we can consume -- return capital.
There's no precise adverse number to pick it. But it's a number -- low 200s is when it's fair
to start the discussion on returning capital to shareholders, provided it's not economic
and provided there's not a range of very attractive investment opportunities out there that
we could spend the money in and then create value for you. But again, trust us, we're not
capital hoarders. We're very much aware there is a situation where returning capital to
shareholders is becoming a very important discussion topic.
Having said that, the clock's ticking, I'm way overdue. This is my ﬁnal slide. It shows you
I'm a poor presenter because my entire presentation is summarized in this one slide. I
could have done with one slide in 5 seconds. We generate capital from any perspective.
OCC or UT1, whatever you take. We opportunistically raise capital. We have ﬂexibility to
add capital if we want to. We can deploy capital, either in re-risking or in acquisitions. And
we can give capital back to shareholders. We're an and company. But not an or company.
Generate capital, raise capital, deploy capital and give it back to shareholders.
We conclude to this page. But again, it's a summary. Business driven ﬂow of new capital
on already strong stock of capital. And at the end of the day, discipline and ability to
invest and deploy is the name of the game.

Questions And Answers
FINAL

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Absolutely, yes. So Chris, thank you, very interesting presentation. We have the ﬁrst Q&A
session. Jos, can I also please invite you to the stage? I'm sure, ladies and gentlemen, you
have many interesting questions. If you please could raise your hand if you have a
question. Wait for the microphone, Barth and Vincent are in the room with the
microphone. So everybody in the audience can hear. But also the viewers on the live
webcast. Please state your name, your company name. (Operator Instructions)
Yes? So I see Benoit already raising his hand. So...

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, Benoit Petrarque from Kepler Cheuvreux. So I was wondering why you're not able to
link the dividend payout to the capital generation? I mean, the IFRS 17 is coming. So the
IFRS ﬁgure will not become relevant. So I'm a bit kind of wondering if the market will not
lose faith in this payout ratio. So what is your view on that? And the second one will be
just on the bank strategy. I think banks are very important to grow mortgage books. And
now you put it on noncore. Just wondering, in terms of implication for growing the
mortgage portfolio and plug it to your balance sheet, or what will be the implication of
that?

A - H. C. Figee
Okay. Benoit, thank you. On the dividend question, at some point, we will, not yet. I think
at some point, the industry will move dividend distribution as a function of capital
generation rather than IFRS proﬁts. I would think, today, it's a bit too early. I mean, IFRS
proﬁt is still is an audit number. The deﬁnition of cap gen having -- so we've made one
small deﬁnition change. But that needs to be completely settled and stable before you go
there. At some point, we'll go there. I think especially if you go to IFRS 17, the ﬁrst year,
we'll all be massively confused and produce a number that's going to be very hard to
interpret. So I think by that time, we and probably the rest of the industry, by that time, will
have moved to dividend as a function of cap gen. What we intend to do is, as we did
today, show to you the trail of numbers relating dividend to the various capital numbers.
And at some point, we'll formally go over to a new model. But give you guys a history and
an audit trail of capital relative to various capital numbers. So you'll get used to the ratios
that are linked to that. And at some point, when we go over, it feels very natural.

A - Jos P. M. Baeten

{BIO 2036695 <GO>}

And Benoit, to your second question. Actually, there is no relationship between the bank
and our mortgage business. Yes. It is the same management team. But a balance sheet of
the bank on which we decided that it will become noncore doesn't mean that we are not
anymore in the mortgage business. So our origination of mortgage will continue as it has
been in the past. And as you know, we have a fund, a mortgage fund. And we put some
Page 21 of 84

Company Ticker: ASRNL NA Equity
Date: 2018-10-10

mortgage on our own balance sheet. So the coming noncore of the bank doesn't aﬀect
our ability to originate mortgages going forward.

A - Michel HÃ¼lters

FINAL

Okay. Johnny Vo?

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

It's Johnny Vo from Goldman Sachs. Just the ﬁrst question, just in terms of gearing of
assets to unrestricted Tier 1. I mean, if I just think about a.s.r. 11, you had about EUR 5
billion of unrestricted Tier 1 in there, a little bit over EUR 5 billion of unrestricted Tier 1.
Most of your double leverage, your hybrid you inject down there is equity. So about EUR
1.5 billion. So if you remove the EUR 1.5 billion, you're about EUR 3.5 billion. You have EUR
2.6 billion of equity sitting in that entity against EUR 3.5 billion of genuine equity. If I look
at the gearing of assets and risky assets within the portfolio, there's a lot that sits in there.
And it's a -- I'm not saying that this is a problem. But this is part of your business model.
Your business model is consuming capital by eﬀectively taking on risk assets and
generating it through capital generation. So can you respond to that? The second thing is
just in terms of capital generation of the target that you've given. How much of that or
what are your long-term investment assumptions in that number? Because obviously that
can help you to get to that number very quickly.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - H. C. Figee
Yes. Look, Johnny Vo, your point in it -- if you look at the a.s.r. Life business in it the
investment returns are an important component of that business. I think it's
commensurate to running a eﬀectively closed Individual Life book, where the returns from
cost, returns from underwriting results gradually fade away as your book shrinks. But your
asset base stays signiﬁcant for longer. So in terms of our business model, you're
completely correct. So a portion of our business is actually generate investment returns
from our Life business. We look at asset leverage as a very -- as a secondary measure.
Prime measure is how much capital is in the assets that we make, how much capital is held
against it, using the standard formula which is quite penalizing compared to an internal
model. So the fact that we're holding 43% of a standard formula gives me a hint that it's
reasonable. And the asset leverage similarly is a secondary indicator. You don't want us to
be exploring at group level. And whether you allocate assets to the Life or the Non-life
entity that's actually â€“ there's more fungible in assets. But to your point, our Life
business as part of a Life book is eﬀectively into runoﬀ that actually becomes over time -much more an investment business over time. And as to the cap gen, we've used longterm investment assumptions. It's basically 330 basis points of our swaps for equities, 300
for real estate, 110 for mortgages. It's about 50 for credits -- sorry, 70 for credit, 50 for
peripheral governments and it's ﬂat to kind of noncore -- for core governments. That is
the margin that we use. We believe they are consistent with our long-term, across-thecycle assumptions. And we use a VA of 20. So we accrue our liabilities in that model of VA
of 20. If you compare to the actuals today, the mortgage returns actually exceed the longterm investment returns. Credits is kind of where it is, 70 is roughly what you make. And
on govies, peripherals are today exceeding, depending on which peripheral you take
(achieving) the 50 basis points. And we underscore on core governments because they
trade at minus signiﬁcant amount. That whole bundle together, including the VA and also

FINAL

the entire ﬁxed income book, our long-term investment margins underscore the actual
spreads we make. And I don't take into account total returns on equity and ﬁxed income -equity and real estate. So that's why I said last year, the actuals versus LTMs were about
EUR 9 million in the full year and EUR 7 million in the half year. So I feel comfortable that
we're not kind of -- we're not eating into ourself or promising returns that we can't make
in the OCC number.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

It's Farooq Hanif from CrÃ©dit Suisse. Going to M&A, what you've done really successfully
since IPO is using cash to buy things that probably a lot of us analysts didn't know existed
and added portfolios and it was small and you were able to sort of digest it. Very, very
accretive, as you've shown. So what is your preference? And what is it extra that you need
for something that's really big to make it worthwhile and make it digestible for you? And
the second related question to that is about funding mix. So you've presented a little bit
more potential leverage. I mean, you've talked about in the past that it's not rocket
science. But clearly there's a range of funding mix out there. And so if you think the
market is amenable, would you rather just use equity if it's really, really big?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jos P. M. Baeten

{BIO 2036695 <GO>}

Well Farooq, to your ﬁrst question, what is the preference, what we've tried to convene
today is that our preference is and remains small; and medium-size bolt-on acquisitions.
We're for sure we're good at it, we're able to integrate them in a very fast mode and I
think the proof is out there that we have done it. The areas where we focus at. First of all,
the funeral market is already consolidated for the larger part. But we still think there are
opportunities out there. So we would love to ﬁnalize the consolidation of the funeral
market. It has been proven to be very value creative. Secondly, the Dutch market is for a
prolonged period seeking for an opportunity to consolidate the Individual Life market. All
of our books are shrinking to levels that we can't aﬀord anymore. We have a EUR 15 billion
book in our Individual Life market. But if you run a company with a balance sheet of
roughly EUR 150 million or even EUR 500 million, you will reach within a number of years
the level where you can't make the cost that you need to run the business anymore. So we
think it's time to create a Dutch consolidation in the Individual Life market. So that will be
our second aim in terms of consolidation. Thirdly, our key aim to grow our Non-life
business is organic growth. Of course, we can set the premiums, we can set the
acceptance criteria, do our own underwriting. But if and when there would be books in
the disability or P&C area, which let me say are not yet beyond repair in the area of 105,
106 combined ratio and we would be able to buy them to add our cost levels to put them
on our platform and to be able to bring back the combined ratio within a foreseeable
term to our levels, then we would also love to do some M&A in the P&C and disability
area. And ﬁnally, we have acquired 2 medium-size and small asset managers. We have a
feeling that at the moment asset managers are quite expensive. So we would love to do
more on that. But we are also realistic at the current price level that, that could be a
challenge. So our preference medium-size to small bolt-ons. And as said, if there are any
larger transformational opportunities, we feel the Dutch market needs to consolidate
further that we are -- that we need to look at it. But within the same ﬁnancial criteria and
operational criteria as we have done and will do going forward for the medium-size and
small ones. And on ﬁnancing, that's your hobby, Chris.

FINAL

A - H. C. Figee
I think the point I want to make is we've got ﬁnancing ﬂexibility. So ideally we'd fund
acquisition with cash or debt. That's the most value accretive way to ﬁnance it, especially
in today's credit markets. And I think we have got the instruments out there and the rating
and the capital market reputation out there to do so. You don't have to look into about
what are you buying. So most small and midsized insurance companies come with 100%
equity balance sheets. So they would be ideally suited to fund with cash or fund with
debt. If you think about larger insurance companies, they tend to come with debt on their
balance sheets. There's some with a lot of debt on their balance sheet. So if you then take
a pro forma like newco perspective, larger companies that bring -- that have their own
debt already are less prone or less qualifying to do equity -- debt ﬁnancing. So think
about small and bolt-ons continue in the cash and debt ﬁnancing approach. Think about
larger transactions, especially those that have signiﬁcant amount of debt on their balance
sheet, they have to be equity ﬁnancing. They just don't let themselves to use ﬁnancing
against it.

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Okay. Cor?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

Yes, Cor Kluis, ABN. Question on the partial internal model. Are you already doing
something internally to work little bit on the internal model, especially as there might be
some delay on IFRS 17? And in the past I think you've said, it's about -- it would take 1.5
years or something to implement such a system. Yes. Is it still the planning or have you
already done something in that respect? Other question is on Generali, especially the
Non-life business that some of the (elevated) combined ratios there progressing in time,
do you feel comfortable that you can bring that combined ratio to an attractive level in a
short time? Or what's your experience it or some disappointments or did something go
better than expected there?

A - H. C. Figee
Yes. On the internal model, I think if you -- our capital today, we don't need an internal
model to boost our capital ratio, it's already fairly strong. And just moving to an internal
model to get to a higher solvency number, that would be not the right thing to do for
shareholders. But if you think, the cash out -- the cost that it requires to build an internal
model, you're looking at something north of EUR 30 million. I mean, you can borrow and
leverage from the skills that are out there, the consulting ﬁrms that have done it before. So
you can fast track it. But the used task work, the documentation work, we still think it's
EUR 30 million project. So one point of Solvency. Just spending that money until you have
a higher Solvency ratio overnight doesn't do good for anyone. I don't think you can
assume that we're immediately giving it back to shareholders. So you need to have a
deployment of that model. The deployment could come in the form of a large acquisition.
If you make a larger acquisition and you have to re-risk a big balance sheet, then an
internal model might be a very eﬃcient way to raise the capital to fund the re-risking.
Then suddenly EUR 30 million becomes a very cheap cost of capital, if you can use the
capital to re-risk something. Or if you build a strong of acquisitions, then in a couple of
years' time you ﬁnd yourself with a bigger balance sheet, also then an internal model
Page 24 of 84



FINAL

might be a very cost-eﬃcient way to fund that. a.s.r. is standalone, we probably don't
need it in a big M&A or a string multiple small M&As, at some point it might become
realistic. Where are we today? We're of course doing pre-work, it is always good to think
about to do some analysis on what would it mean to us, what would a project look like,
how much time will it take, how we organize ourselves so that if and when the time
comes, we're ready to start. So we're in a, the preparation of the preparation phase, if you
wish. Which is identifying what would it take, what would the rough impact be, who would
be involved. If IFRS 17 gets postponed, that would make life a lot easier. If IFRS 17 would
canceled, that would make life really lot easier. But I don't think that's going to be given to
us. At this point, we still work on the presumptions that IFRS 17 starts on time because we
haven't had any formal guidance that it's not going to be the case. But again we have to
wait and see. But there is the preparation work for the preparation phase is ongoing.

A - Jos P. M. Baeten

{BIO 2036695 <GO>}

And on your Generali question, Cor, the combined of the Generali book of Non-life
business was 101.4 for the ﬁrst half 2018. What that a surprise? Not really. We -- during the
due diligence, we already have seen what the quality of the book was. However, between
signing and closing, they have written some additional business which didn't add value,
to put it in a mild way. So where are we in the progress? Actually the book is -- exists out
of 2 pieces. First of all, there is mandatory broker business that is already included and
managed by a.s.r.. So that's fully integrated in the mandatory broker business of a.s.r.
However, the portfolio is not yet at the quality we want to have it. So we have started with
repricing, reevaluating the business and having discussions with the mandatory brokers.
Then there is the so-called provincial part of the portfolio that is foreseeing that we will
integrate that into the a.s.r. framework latest First Quarter next year. We also will have to
look at repricing and using the wheel. And I'm not going to mow all the grass for Michel,
he will talk about it later today, to get towards our own combined ratios. We think it is
doable. It will cost some top line. Out of the EUR 180 million, we expect that we will use a
part of that. The number, I don't have this famous glass bowl so I don't know how high
that number will be. But we prefer value over volume, as you know. So if you -- if we need
to get rid of parts of the business because we can't really reprice them, we will do so.

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Okay. Claudia?

Q - Claudia Gaspari

{BIO 15148414 <GO>}

Claudia Gaspari from Barclays. Just one question on the ﬁnancials criterias for M&A. You
keep going back to this 12% ROI hurdle rate. But would you not require a higher ROI for a
larger deal given the larger execution raise, potentially longer time to integrate, especially
if it then comes also with a lot of debt on balance sheet. And how do you think about
that?

A - Jos P. M. Baeten

{BIO 2036695 <GO>}

I think, Claudia, that it is a very realistic view. What we always do -- the 12% is the minimum
hurdle rate. And we take into account what are the operational risk, how long will it take.
And you only can do that after you have done thorough due diligence on a certain M&A

transaction. So if and when something big would happen and our judgment is that it -that more risk is involved, we will deﬁnitely take that into account in our decision. And
whether the hurdle becomes 12.5% or 13% or even 14%. And what we allow ourselves that
-- I can't comment on that today. It depends on what you see during the due diligence
and how you are able to -- how fast you are able to integrate and what the perceived risks
are.

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Maybe just on that topic, can you also comment on the governance that we have in place,
where we are looking at consolidation?

A - Jos P. M. Baeten

{BIO 2036695 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. And I think we've told it before to some of you. Within our strict ﬁnancial criteria, the
ﬁrst thing we always do as an executive board when somebody comes up with an idea,
well, this company may be for sale or I had a conversation, then we start to write a letter to
our supervisory board. And we say, well, we have identiﬁed this opportunity, we're going
to take a look at it and please, dear supervisory board, remember us. Those are the
criteria. They are on culture. They are on the ﬁnancials. They are on integration risks. And
if and when we decide to bring out a binding oﬀer, we discuss this with the supervisory
board. And they will remember us to the ﬁnal outcome compared to the initial ﬁnancial
criteria. And by the way, they never had to remember us, because every ﬁle we brought to
the supervisory board table was within those ﬁnancial criteria. But we have a governance
framework in place that if we come -- if we would become overexcited during a
transaction then there is this on a distant supervisory board that will remember us what we
have said before we started.

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Okay. In the back, Robin?

Q - Robin van den Broek

{BIO 17002948 <GO>}

Robin van den Broek from Mediobanca. First question is on the operating result for Life.
EUR 633 million is your reference point. Think you printed EUR 340 million in H1 '18
already. I appreciate that has public equity dividends in there elevating H1 versus H2. But
you still have some synergies to reap from Generali, you are re-risking. So I was just
wondering what are the driving forces to basically go back to the 2017 level? And the
second question is on the 12 to 14 mid-market players you've anonymously identiﬁed in
your slides. I was just wondering how the dialogue is progressing with these players? I
mean, UFR is coming down. So I guess some players are seeing a little bit more pressure
on the capital side. What additional -- basically, how is the dialogue evolving with these
players? Are they more open to talking to you? So also in perspective what you said, I
mean your preference is to basically look at these rather than doing something large. Yes.
If the dialogue is basically heating up with these players, how would you look at this larger
animal as well?

Yes. On the live results, Robin, I think the factors at play are, as you've pointed out, the
ﬁrst half results tend to be higher than the second half for Life, the seasonality eﬀect,
dividend season in Q2. So that's a normal phenomenon. Secondly, we are re-risking
somewhat. But that will kick in over time. Third phenomenon is on the investment side.
There is some downward push, because, for example, the older vintages and mortgages
are running out. I mean, the 2008, 2009 vintages and mortgages were extremely
proﬁtable where you're looking at spreads of over 300% at that time. They are being
reﬁnanced today. So on the yield side, there's always a natural pressure down because of
the nature of the book. And the older vintages and mortgages or credits that you
acquired years ago gradually run out. And you renew them at lower spread. So eﬀect (that
plays), seasonality eﬀects, re-risking helps, kicks in time -- over time. There is some older
return that gradually run out. And thirdly, as the book gradually declines, the dynamics
are such that you get less cost coverage from your clients. And Karin will talk about it
much more. We think we're able to counter that with cost reductions. So the cost result
would probably keep stable. But that's already accretive even when you see a book line.
The result on mortality will have a downward push. I can't compensate lower mortality
results because our book declines. So you see the Life business gradually moving towards
more investment results over time, cost result stable, some downward pressure on
mortality result. And on the investment result, you need to work hard to keep the yield up,
because the book -- the older vintages years run oﬀ and then you have to beneﬁt from a
lower required interest. That whole mix together, various moving parts gives us the
guidance that we put on the screen.

{BIO 2036695 <GO>}

Okay. And on your second question, well, hopefully you understand, we cannot comment
on individual cases on which we are or not working. But let me answer the question a bit
more anecdotal. two years ago, when we identiﬁed potential companies that we would
love to bring to a.s.r.. And we picked up the phone and we gave them a call, they didn't
pick up the phone and let us waiting. Today, we see an adverse development. We even
get calls from companies with which we start to engage and start to have a discussion.
That always takes more time, especially with the smaller; and medium-sized companies
that already are owned for a long time, for example BioFoundation, it's more a discussion
about emotions of giving up on their own future. So it always takes more time to engage
with those type of companies. But what we see today is that there is -- that there are more
opportunities and more companies willing to have a discussion with us on parts of the
portfolio or on the whole company or on a complete book. So we see an upcoming trend
that -- and that has created our statement of today, we think that the time is there to start
to consolidate the Individual Life market. And to continue consolidating the funeral
market. How would that interfere with a possible large transaction? I think, we're in the
midst of ﬁnalizing the Generali transaction, that will, in general, not interfere with any
further M&A. We haven't announced anything today. So one can assume, if you start a
conversation, it takes time to negotiate, then you have the time between signing and
closing. So before any transaction will be announced, we hopefully are in -- on our way in
ﬁnalizing ﬁnally the Generali transaction. So Generali will not interfere with that. And if
and when we at the same day had to do 2 transactions then we probably would have
some sleepless nights. It is not impossible. But it would not be our preference. But doing 1
or 2 smaller, medium size thing, especially if they are in one area, for example, in the
funeral area that probably will not directly interfere with a larger transactions. But at a
point in time that we see the opportunity, we have to make a ﬁnal judgment whether we
Page 27 of 84

dare to do 1 small and at the same time look at something bigger. So I can't predict it. But
our feeling is that if the timing is right, it's not impossible.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - H. C. Figee
Maybe to add on that, Jos, if you go back a few years, we acquired Axent and De
Eendragt. Some of you will maybe remember that Axent was a funeral business, De
Eendragt was a pension business. We eﬀectively announced those deals on the same day
or the Friday afternoon and the Monday morning. And we did it on purpose because one
was a longevity book, the other was a mortality book. So together it was a fantastic deal.
So we were able to conclude to sign those 2 small transactions almost eﬀective the same
day. The people at M&A looked pretty miserable the next morning. But actually it was
doable, NOC integration was doable because one was a pension business, the other one
was a funeral business. So I think there is no reason to say we can't work on multiple
streams at the same time, especially a few smaller ones you can combine then you have
to play at how things go. Obviously, to your point, Robin, on the Life businesses, we do
the see, (I agree that I think) we see in terms of the declining Individual Life book lapses
were up last year, they are down a bit this year. But still on an elevated level. Everybody
experiences that. The UFR will go down, everybody experiences that. If you look at the
outlook for your balance sheet, somewhere in 2020-ish, you will see a gradually slower
contribution from SCR risk margin release, right. That's the point where that contribution
to capital slows down. So if you have a EUR 15 billion life book, it's tough. But it's okay. If
you get EUR 1 billion life book, the combination of UFR going down, less organic cap
generation from high risk margin SCR release in the next -- that point coming near, cost
pressure, then it becomes obvious that for the smaller Life players things are getting
diﬃcult. And I think that realization is now sinking in.

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Okay. Matthias, in the back.

Q - Matthias De Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Matthias De Wit from Kempen. Only one question from me on the capital generation
target for 2021 of EUR 430 million. I had a slightly higher number in mind considering that
you are already at EUR 377 million for '17, excluding Generali. So at the growth you foresee
in Non-life, the re-risking, UFR drag goes down. So I got to a slightly higher number. So is
there anything you can share on the key building blocks like can you bridge it? I also
wondered on what assumption it is based for interest rates? You referred to forward
trades into -- during your presentation. So can you be a bit more speciﬁc there, please?

A - H. C. Figee
Yes. So we assess these targets from 2 perspectives, bottom up and top down. Bottom up
starts with where we are today, because if you take today's cap gen or the cap gen for the
ﬁrst half year, adjust for storms, add Generali to it, add the UFR unwind to it. And add
some tax beneﬁt to it, see where you get and we have a balance sheet plan, basically
assumes the rates are where they are today. The top-down approach is you got take a
balance sheet line as you assume the forward curve materializes. I don't know what the
interest rates are going to be in 2021. If I knew, I probably wouldn't be here. But let's

Page 28 of 84



FINAL

Company Name: ASR Nederland NV
Company Ticker: ASRNL NA Equity
Date: 2018-10-10

assume the forward curve materializes and we run the numbers on that, those 2 numbers
converge. But the top-down number is slightly higher than the bottom-up number
actually. And we felt at that point the EUR 430 million is probably a good -- really
conservative pick on what the cap generation 2021 could be. The kind of the key unknown
is what at that point in time the risk margin and SCR release will be, because that's a
function of the decline of the book and I think it's also a function of the forward curve at
that time. And so I reckon with the fact that in 2021, the risk margin and SCR release will
be a bit less than what we experience today. So you see earnings growth, fee income will
be higher, combined ratio, the Non-life earnings will be higher. We can see some beneﬁt
from increased investment returns. There is the UFR unwind. The unknown is indeed what
does the book return deliver at that time. And I -- we have to work on the presumption in
2021, 2022, you will see a gradual decline of that capital release from the book. So that's
kind of the biggest factor in there. (We're then) aﬀected by what the rate -- the forward
curve will be at that time. Secondly, I think this -- the OCC number is on a reasonable
asset mix. I don't want to give a number that hinges on a drastic re-risking of the business,
because at that point, I don't want to be kind of forced to re-risk the business to meet a
target that we've given. So it's also based on a reasonable asset mix assumption like we
have today. In 2021, where, why might it be diﬀerent, if in the capital release might be
diﬀerent, if we de-risked our book, because markets are diﬀerent, then the number would
change. For the rest, I feel comfortable that the EUR 430 million is very well attainable
having tested it from a bottom-up and a top-down perspective.

Okay. Any further questions? Yes. Steven?

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Steven Haywood from HSBC. Following up on the previous question about the Life
business and the stable earnings outlook. You've mentioned a 45 to 55 basis points Life
operating expense target. And is that coming down from 57 or 75? I just wanted to
conﬁrm that. And...

A - H. C. Figee
57.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

57. And how is this achieved and is this required, this improvement to maintain that stable
Life earnings target? Then secondly, on the -- you already mentioned that 14% ROE is not
an upper limit. With regards to the other targets, the EUR 0.55 payout ratio, the 94%
combined ratio, the EUR 0.05 Non-life growth and the stable Life earnings, are these
upper limit as well for the company?

A - H. C. Figee
Well the 45% to 55%, I think the -- we're coming down from 57%. Assume that the
midrange of that is what you need to meet our return target, the bottom end of that range
is what you will outperform actually that level.

{BIO 2036695 <GO>}

And to your second question, I think target setting in itself, it's always fun to exceed
targets. So if we announce a target, it's not that we, let's say, if we have reached the target
in September that we send everybody home and start early holidays. So it's fun to try to
exceed. But I think you also have to be realistic. And as said in my presentation several
times, we are in a very competitive Dutch market and it's all a balancing act between
adding value, serving customers and at the same time try to grab growth in a declining
market. So I think they're pretty well balanced. They are challenging. But also we feel they
are realistic and it's doable.

A - H. C. Figee
I think on the dividend side, Steven, the 55% at this point is the upper limit on ordinary
dividends. But of course, there's no reason why you can't do supplementary distributions
if you'd get there. So if you feel that you've got more capital to give back to shareholders,
we'll be happy to do it through specials or buybacks depending on where value is at that
time, depending on what our shareholders would like at that time. So there's -- on
dividend, the ordinary dividend, think of that range. But if we have got capital to spend,
we'll ﬁgure out a way to give it back to shareholders. That's not the biggest problem.

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Okay. In the back, Jason?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

Jason Kalamboussis, KBC. The ﬁrst thing is on your targets. Do you ﬁnd that if you were to
do a larger acquisition, you would try to stick to most of them? And the second thing is on
the internal model, is it fair to assume that's about two years that you would need to
develop?

A - Jos P. M. Baeten

{BIO 2036695 <GO>}

On your ﬁrst question, all the targets are based on the a.s.r. as it is today. We didn't
included yet any M&A in that. So if and when we would do large M&A, we at least have to
reconsider what will be the eﬀects and it would be great to remain on those targets, for
example the 12% to 14% we have stated clearly. It starts at 12% depending on the risk. It
even could move up a little bit. But I think the real answer only can be given if you have
analyzed all the numbers of the company you acquired. And in general, what we have
seen at the combined ratio at Generali, we need some time to repair it and to bring it
towards our level. So maybe during the integration period, you have to accept that your
combined will deteriorate a little bit. But at the end of the day, you want to run the
business at the levels where we run it. We think this is necessary to run a sustainable,
healthy company going forward. And on your internal model question, I think Chris
already stated, we may need 1 to 1.5 years to build the model and then you have to prove
that you used the model and the model works. And it will probably cost another 1 to 1.5
years. So in total, we expect that an internal model may need somewhere between 2 and
three years before we get agreement with the regulator that we can use the internal
model.

FINAL

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Steven Haywood from HSBC again. When you say safely above 160% Solvency II ratio,
what do you mean by safely above there? How much scope downwards do you have
there? Obviously, you've got plenty of debt headroom as well. If you take EUR 900
million, plus the EUR 200 million potentially that you're redeeming, there's plenty of debt
headroom to come. Then secondly with regards to the DNB and their focus has been on
the Life insurance companies on their costs. Is this focus going to continue from the DNB,
do you think? And will this be driving M&A? What kind of solutions is the DNB suggesting
for these companies?

A - H. C. Figee

Bloomberg Transcript

Well safely over 160%, we don't want to drop below 160%. In our capital, we take the
actual capital into account. So not the potential we could raise in managing our group. So
it's good that we have ﬂexibility. We look at the capital actually inside the company. Safely
for practical purposes, I would say, the UFR decline will shave about 10, 11 points of our
solvency the next three years. So you want to make sure that with that in mind you stay
above 160%. So safely above 160% eﬀectively means 171%, because that's roughly the UFR
decline that we're going to experience, assuming we don't generate any new capital at all
in that period. So -- but very conservative thinking, if you're 171% in three years' time, we
will still be above 160% barring any unforeseen circumstances. On DNB's question, what's
DNB going to do? I think, you should ask them.

A - Jos P. M. Baeten

{BIO 2036695 <GO>}

Maybe we can make 1 comment from that. The role of DNB is protecting policyholders.
And what you would see in general, if they think a company is not viable going forward,
the ﬁrst thing they tend to do is stop writing new business. That is, in general, a ﬁrst signal
that companies run into diﬃculties. Then they start to pressure on de-risking the balance
sheet and then they start probably to discuss with management whether they shouldn't
look at safe homes or put the business in runoﬀ. And I think everything that Chris already
said in terms of Solvency II, decreasing books, diﬃculties to meet the cost levels that's all
helpful at least from our perspective to bring companies in a position that they start to
think about their future. And DNB probably never will comment on that publicly.

A - H. C. Figee
But I think the discussion on cost. And what your cost assumption and your best estimate
is a very important one. If your book is shrinking, do you presume that all costs are
variable? What does that mean for when the last policy leaves the building or if there's 1
policy left, does this 1 poor client bare all the cost of your operation. So I think is that cost
assumption and your best estimates is a very important determinant of your long-term
variability -- viability. So I think the discussion in the industry on what do you assume the
cost variability and your best estimates? Today and in 10 years' time or in ﬁve years' time
combined with the actual tangible cost experience, that will become I think a thing of
focus.

Good morning. Is it working?

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - M. H. Verwoest
I would like to start this Non-life session with a short overview of the Non-life segment.
And then I will zoom in on the most important businesses in that segment. Our Non-life
segment consists of 3 businesses: the P&C business, the health business and the disability
business. And I will also take you along a few of our distribution businesses, which Jos
told too, are most of the time active in the Non-life department.
Our health business is a self-supporting business when it comes to the capital
management. And from a strategic perspective, our health business is supportive to
disability and to P&C direct. In this presentation, I will zoom in on the disability and P&C
business. And our focus within these businesses is leveraging on our speciﬁc skills to
achieve strong combined ratio in the range of 94% to 96%. And at the same time, we aim
to have growth of 3% to 5% per annum in the next coming three years, holding on to our
value over volume strategy.
So let me ﬁrst start with P&C. What I would like you to remember from this session is the
following: Within P&C, we have a well-diversiﬁed proﬁtable portfolio and with strong
positions in several segments. Due to our craftsmanship and our value over volume
strategy, we are capable to outperform the market in combined ratio and growth. We
have been doing it. And we will be doing it. We have a reliable and low-cost organization
and because our excellent results and the way we are managing these books, we are
positioned to grow organically or if possible, inorganically.

So let's have a few on the market. The P&C market is a competitive market. And as a
result, we have a strong #3 position in that market with market share of 15%, including the
Generali GDP. The dominant distribution channel in the P&C market remains the
intermediary channel. The intermediary channel does about 50% of the sales and has
80% of the portfolio. And the intermediary channel can be characterized by longer
customer relationships, which is very important; by lower claim ratios. And what you can
see compared, for example, to the direct channel that the churn in the intermediary
channel is much lower than it is in the direct channel. So therefore, you see more sales in
the direct than you see in intermediary. But the portfolio stays around that 80%.
As you see on the bottom left side, a.s.r., we are focused on retail and SME. And as Jos
told you for example, within the dominant intermediary channel, our retail percentage of
new business is 33% at the moment. So 1 on 3 new policies in the intermediary channel
retail is sold via a.s.r. That's what we are in the market. Let me show you how we are
managing our business successfully.

Bloomberg Transcript

If you look at P&C business, it's all about revenue business at a combined ratio lower than
100%. And that seems to be very simple. But to be honest, it's hard and complex. And the
key questions are, do you know what you are underwriting? Are you asking the right price
for that underwriting? Do you managing your claims according that price? And do you
have cost-eﬃcient organization which services your customers well? And to be
competitive and value driven, do you need to understand the risks you are underwriting.
And because the 2 most diﬀerentiating elements you can see are mass claims and the
price you are asking for the risks. And the real knowledge is in managing those mass
claims. And we have -- we happen to outperform the market in this ﬁeld.
The volatility of the results in the P&C business is mainly driven by calamities. And we take
into our pricing, into account that there are certain calamities in a year. So there is no
world without a storm. There are some storms in the year. And we take it into account in
our pricing when we set our prices to the market. And of course we have large claims,
especially ﬁres, which will inﬂuence our combined ratio. If the market is competitive as it
is, it will allow us just to earn a few cents on euro. So you had to be cost eﬀective, you
have to really understand what you are doing. Then you need to be absolutely disciplined
in what we call the total of the performance wheel. And how does this wheel work? I will
show you now.
Here you see the performance wheel. And in the center of this wheel is our craftsmanship,
the expertise of our people. And at ﬁrst it starts with portfolio management. And that
means that we continuously assess, reassess our portfolio. We are continuously using the
data coming out of the wheel to improve our pricing, to improve our underwriting, to
improve our claims. As mentioned, claim management is key. And for example, at a.s.r.,
we choose not to outsource claim management but to keep it in our own house instead of
outsourcing it. And we are very disciplined in claim handling. We are the best-in-class in
bodily injury claims handling and demonstrated by our average claim there is 23% lower
than the market average. The number of claims managed by our own employees is 8%
higher than the market average. And last but not least, the handling time is 10% plus. And
that's good for our customers, too. There you can make a diﬀerence if you want to have a
very good combined ratio.
Page 34 of 84

Thirdly, we are managing and monitoring our combined ratio. For example by the
proﬁtability, looking at the proﬁtability of product, product groups, looking at the
proﬁtability of our distribution channels. So we look into a single distribution partner how
he is working and how he contributes to our combined ratio. What we -- besides that, we
are rationalizing our portfolio. So rationalizing our processes, our products, our IT system,
to be cost competitive because if you just can earn a few cents on a euro, you need to be
very cost competitive; and to increase our response to the market -- to the changes in the
markets.
And ﬁnally in the wheel, with these group results and this approach, you can improve your
competitive position in the target markets, in the targeted group where you want to be
and make a proﬁt. So when you -- and when you also have your services right, which is
shown at an NPS, a Net Promoter Score of 55, you can either grow and still have a good
retention rate. And that's good for our business. Having and using advanced data is key in
this wheel. And we have direct access to all the data because we are managing this chain
in our own house for many years. So only with such an integrated approach, our P&C
business is able to underwrite the right risk at the right price with the right service. And
that is in the end beneﬁcial for both the customer and for us as an insurer.

Bloomberg Transcript

And this slide shows you the result of that integrated approach. As well the combined
ratio as the growth rate have been outperforming the market. The combined ratio has
been 4% to 7% better than last year's. And the growth rate has been 3% to 12% higher
than the market average. So as said, with our knowledge, with our data, we are capable of
underwriting the right risk at the right price with the right service. That's a powerful
performance wheel indeed.
And when we look at claims, because I just told you, it's one of the most important things
when you're managing your P&C business, there are 3 kinds of claims: we have bulk, we
have large claims and we have the calamities. And the performance of our claims is driven
by the way we manage our billed claims. And that's quite a ﬂat line when you look at the
billed claims because the volatility is in the large claims. And if you look at our claims, you
can see that it's quite stable. And in only 3 quarters out of the past 14, the claim ratio was
little bit higher and mostly due to severe storms in that. When there are more storms, of
course we have a reinsurance program to a certain amount. So our combined ratio is, to a
certain amount, protected by our reinsurance program.
So now I talked about claims, let me talk with you about our cost management. For P&C,
our IT platform is key from a data perspective and from a cost perspective. And as part of
our combined ratio, we are managing our cost to have a sustainable combined ratio. And
as Jos told you, we are really cost focused. But we are managing our cost to manage our
combined ratio. And this means that sometimes we invest in claim handlers; sometimes
we invest in more underwriters or more IT just to improve the combined ratio and
balancing with cost and combined ratio. That is the way we look at our portfolio.
We're now ﬁnalizing the implementation of the SaaS platform, Software as a Service
platform, with Quinity. And that system will enable us to improve our -- to use our data in
a better way for underwriting and pricing and claims handling. It will also provide us with
better service to our customers and to our -- the intermediaries. And last but not least, it is
Page 35 of 84

FINAL

reducing our IT cost and variablizing those costs. To further manage our costs, we are
continuously rationalizing and simplifying our portfolio. And we have been doing this in
front of the IT migration. And we will complete the migration for this platform in 2020 and
2019 all our retail businesses already on the platform. And we have been doing this whilst
we were growing and decreasing our cost, as you can see on the right hand of the slide.
So let me show you the growth of our business. To start here, we only grow there where
it's at value to a.s.r. And in the last years, we've been growing rapidly in a shrinking to
stable market whilst we terminated also EUR 77 million of nonproﬁtable business. So
within this ﬁgure, we also terminated EUR 77 million of nonproﬁtable business. And the
growth is a result of our performance wheel because we have a competitive pricing, we
have a dominant position with the dominant distribution channel, the intermediary. And
we have good product features. And we have a good package. And we're reaching an
average of 285 packages a day sold with an average premium of EUR 520. And we're
managing that on a day-to-day basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

Other factors that made our growth possible were: our selective growth in SME market,
also there, value over volume, understand the risk in our underwriting. So it goes slow.
But it gives growth. The capture fallout, the Delta Lloyd acquisition, the uplift of the
economic cycle and of course, some of our acquisitions, which I will talk later on to you.
As said, we also acquired some intermediaries in this market. And let's have a look at
them. Last year, we acquired Corins. That is a authorized agency in the coinsurance
market. We acquired Van Kampen Group. That is a large service provider and general
service provider in the market. And with the acquisition of Generali, we got ANAC, also a
service provider but specialized -- more specialized. The strategic reasons for us to
acquire these intermediaries were forward integration. We really want to understand and
be closer to the customer. The second one is we want to learn: to learn more how does
the distribution channel work, to learn how we can inﬂuence the intermediary channel, to
learn how we can oﬀer better services to them, to learn how we can improve our ratios
with the mandatory brokers. So learning, learning, learning. And last but not least, they
are adding value in our portfolio by earning fees.
And for example, we acquired Van Kampen, we have -- with Van Kampen, we have access
to 2,900 intermediaries in the Netherlands, which most of that business bring to Van
Kampen. And we do also pilots with these intermediaries. With Van Kampen, for example,
we did the pay how you drive pilot. In the big building here, it sometimes is diﬃcult to
have a pilot like that. When you do it at Van Kampen, you can have it in an environment,
which is smaller. You can trial and error and learn and when it's working. And it's
sustainable. Then you can bring it out in the larger portfolio of a.s.r. With Corins, we
bought â€“ we recorded and bought the player in the coinsurance market. And by the
acquisition of Generali, it doubled. And now with Corins, we have 5% to 6% market share
in a market of EUR 1 billion of coinsurance. And we are the largest Dutch player in that
ﬁeld. So this was a quick view on the acquisitions in the intermediary channel.
Let me now give you an example of innovation within P&C by making use of internal and
external data. And there is FRISS. And FRISS is an external web-based IT solution that
enables us to detect fraud at an early stage by an automated process. And FRISS makes

FINAL

use of artiﬁcial intelligence and machine learning by connecting both internal and
external data. But that's free, available on the market. What is really making it suitable for
us is that we deﬁne ourselves the knowledge rules in that machine. So that our knowledge
rules are running in FRISS. And those rules make them unique competence to a.s.r., even
though the software is -- it is a software-based machine, which is available on the market.
And I would like to give you some examples. But they are limited because I don't want to
give -- to disclose our competitive advantage in this ﬁeld. But for example, clients with
heavy debts are recognized when they are asked for insurance. And why? Clients with
heavy debts have a larger risk of no payment or -- and a larger risk of claims. Another
example, when a person wants to ensure a car. But at the same address, there's also a
company established, we don't accept this automatically because a company car has a
higher risk than a personal car. Small things and so there are a lot of rules. But with those
rules, we are able to -- in an early stage, to prevent fraud or to prevent risks we don't want
to have at the price we are asking.

So I've shown you a little bit how we are managing our business. But I would also like to
show you how we are integrating businesses. And in the past, we've acquired portfolios
that we have migrate in several ways, technically, commercially, with robotics. And
Philippe will -- this afternoon, will show you one of our robotics migrations. And examples
of integrated and migrated portfolios are the base portfolio, the Ditzo but also part of the
AvÃ©ro portfolio, which we bought last year. But the largest so far is Generali. And that is
migrated and integrated as we speak.
And actually, we are ahead on plan. The legal merger has been completed. We moved
the direct business to our Ditzo platform. The authorized agents, one of the largest parts
of that portfolio has been integrated. And now we are operational integrating the last
part. And we will ﬁnish that during 2019. Then all the Generali products are in our
environment, in our control. And our new IT platform, Quinity. And the performance
wheel gives us the opportunity to acquire these portfolios and to improve the combined
ratio to the levels we desire. And we can do that in a period of 2 to three years. We're very
experienced on that.
So let's summarize this P&C chapter. We have a well-diversiﬁed and proﬁtable portfolio.
And thanks to the craftsmanship which we use in the performance wheel and our valueover-volume strategy. We have a scalable and cost-eﬀective operation with low and
variable costs. And this allows us to grow in the markets, organic or inorganically. And at
the same time, we keep the value in the company. This was P&C.
Let me take you now into the business of Disability. And the Disability business in the
Netherlands is not the same as it is in the rest of the world. So I would like to shortly tell
you what about -- something about the Disability market. It's also detailed in the slides of
the Appendix. And this disability product is aimed at the self-employed, the individual,
the self-employed or at the employer. And in the latter case, we speak of group disability.
And when we zoom in on the self-employed, for the self-employed in the Netherlands,
there is no Social Security. There's -- so when someone becomes sick or disabled, there's
no Social Security for the self-employed. So the self-employed has to decide for himself if
he wants insuring, for what amount, for what period. And if he has an insurance and he

becomes sick or disabled, the payment depends on the insurance, of course. And the
percentage of disability. And that is between the 20% or 100%.
When we look at the group disability, in the Netherlands, employers are responsible for
the sickness leave in the ﬁrst 2 year of their employees. And an employer can choose to
bear the risk himself; he can go through the governmental institution, the UWV; or he can
go through the private place like a.s.r. After two years of illness, the employer is no longer
responsible. But a lot of employers oﬀer insurance to their employees as part of the
secondary beneﬁt package to bridge the gap between the last salary and the Social
Security payment after two years.

Bloomberg Transcript

For both the self-employed, the individual part and group, the employer part, prevention
of illness and fast integration is key for both the customer and our combined ratio. So
having you introduced in the world of disability, let me talk you through the speciﬁcs of
our business. Starting with the key highlights: we have a very strong #2 position. And we
are a top performer for years in the Dutch Disability market. And that is thanks to our
speciﬁc multidisciplinary approach and our craftsmanship, which is recognized in our
underwriting, our claims handling, our pricing but also our reintegration skills. We
achieved an excellent performance. And that is shown in our long-term, best-in-class
claim ratios and thereby, also in our combined ratios, which is secured by our value-overvolume strategy. And I will show you in this presentation that we are perfectly placed to
beneﬁt for the increased demand for sustainable employability. And as last but not least,
we are in a good position for further growth, organically and, if possible, inorganically.
Let's start by looking at the market. The Disability market in the Netherlands is
approximately EUR 3.7 billion in size and has been relatively stable over the years. The
market is moderately concentrated, the top 3 players having a market share of around
70%. And the disability product. But I think that's clear from my introduction, is quite a
complex problem -- product. And therefore, the intermediary channel is the distribution
channel to sell this product via. Sustainable employability is becoming key to the labor
markets. And by -- there are some underlying macro trends, the increased ﬂexibilization of
workforces. So short-term contracts, the use of more self-employed. We also told you that
the self-employed group in the Netherlands is increasing rapidly. There are technological
developments and the aging population.
And for example, the aging population, people need to work longer. And we know from
our data, when people become older, the chance of being sick or becoming disabled are
higher. So during the later stage of their working life, they're starting to get more
problems. And also, people need -- nowadays needs more mobility. In the past, you had 1
career because you were working, you ﬁnished the working at the same employer with
the same job. Today, the environment is changing so rapidly that you need to have 2 or 3
careers. So you have to constantly move on and develop yourself. To avoid sickness and
disability is very important -- to avoid sickness and disability, it's very important to have
preventive measures and to stimulate a healthy living and working.
So let's move to the next slide where I will demonstrate you how we are managing our
business. And on this slide, you see to 2 -- you can see the 2 triangles. And sometimes in
our house, we call that our golden triangles. A key in the triangle is that we have our own
Page 38 of 84

FINAL

competencies in our own house. And you can see that in the top triangle. We have our
own claims experts. We have our own job-related experts, our vocational experts. We
have our own medical-related experts, our medical advisers. And they are at our payroll.
And that's quite unique in the market that we have them at our own payroll.
And if you look, for example, to the group of the entrepreneurs, when an entrepreneur
has a problem, starting to get sick or is sick or whatever, we have a multidisciplinary team
with all those roles sit and wait to become active. And they sit. And they ﬁnd a solution
together from day 1. And therefore, we are able to make the period of sickness and
disability very short. For group disability, the bottom triangle, we have a similar process.
But there, we have reintegration and sickness leave outsourced to third parties, which we
have a strong relationship with.

Bloomberg Transcript

All in all, we focus on avoiding and minimizing the periods of absence caused by sickness
or disability. And within disability, we are managing our business with the same
performance wheel as I have told you about with P&C. And the way of working results in
very attractive combined ratios also due to our excellent claim ratios demonstrated on the
next slide. And we have very strong and stable combined -- stable claim ratios, as you can
see on the slide. And we price our products at a claim ratio of 75%. But most of the times,
we outperform this number. 11 out of the 14 quarters, our target -- we outperformed our
target of 75%. This is the result of the triangles, of our golden triangles. And as you can
see, there is some seasonality -- seasonable pattern in it that is mainly caused by the ﬂu.
So if you look at the disability market, it's easy to write new business and to grow in
market share. You just turn on the pricing button. And you will get the market. However,
for proﬁtable business, we stick to our value-over-volume principle. And I will
demonstrate that in some cases which will follow. And for example, we had the BeZaVa
case. In 2016, legislation changed. And the employer became also responsible for the
temporary employees, which is a large group, 10% to 15% of the working force. And it's
attractive to ensure them, too. But we had, at the time, the competition of the
governmental institution, the UWV. And the prices of the UWV didn't meet our prices,
which we found they were sustainable to have a good combined ratio. And therefore, we
withdraw of that market. And we're now waiting because in 2019, '20, those customers are
coming back on the market. And I think we will get them back at prices we really get our -suitable for us. But we didn't go for the volume. We went back just to stay with our valueover-volume strategy.
Secondly, let me brieﬂy talk to you about the sickness leave case. When the economy
goes up, sickness leave goes up, too. It's strange. But it's happening. And that's what our
data say. And when our prices doesn't meet the claim ratio anymore, we are looking for
improvements, improvements in the reintegration, et cetera. And if that doesn't meet our
expectations, we increase our prices. And last year, we increased our prices on average
with 20% to have again a healthy portfolio.
And ﬁnally, I would like to discuss the disability case. We as a.s.r. have a very strong
position in the risk classes 1 to 3 that are the so-called white-collar classes. And we have
less of a strong position in the classes 4 or 5, the so-called blue collar. But we are there
where we can add and collect value. Nevertheless, we want to be present. And we want
Page 39 of 84

FINAL

to be good in 4 and 5, too. But the current products, including the prices, are not suitable
for us. So we have seen this problem. And we decided to ﬁnd a solution.
And we decide a new product. And we introduced it a few months ago. And the product
is called Langer Mee in Dutch. And that means something like longer -- with us longer
working. And it's the ﬁrst disability product where the customer is required to accept
services, services on preventing -- on prevention. And as long as the customer is working
with us on those prevention measures, he can be insured at a reasonable price. So this is
beneﬁcial for the customer because we're helping him during his working load. And it's
beneﬁcial for us because we are reducing our claim ratios. And we are getting really to
interact with our customer and building up the relationship.

Bloomberg Transcript

Another example of a product innovation is Doorgaan, the keep on going, which is
unique in the Dutch market. And we introduced that a few years ago. a.s.r. is one of the
few Dutch insurers, which has both a health insurance and a disability insurance. And we
are the only one who is combining this 2 in 1 product. And by combining these 2, we oﬀer
the entrepreneur and the employer the so-called Doorgaan proposition.
And what does this bring to the customer? It brings integrated product and services
aimed at preventing and shortening the sickness leave and disability. For example, we are
providing more physiotherapy. We are providing more mental health care. We are
providing childcare. And we're doing that at an early stage even before the person
becomes sick or disabled. That's what we are oﬀering to our customers. Besides that, we
oﬀer a better service. And we oﬀer a better premium and there is no overlap between the
products of health and disability. And the logic behind this is that we better invest at the
start of something happening with physiotherapy or with mental health care than waiting
until someone becomes sick. It's much cheaper to do it in front, to help the person than to
do it afterwards. And that is a real win-win. And therefore, we expect this concept to
further growth because it's good for the customer, it's good for us and it's good for
society.
So I've been talking with you about our business. I've been talking the way we are
managing our business, talking with you about the new products we introduced to the
market. But what's really exciting me is what's happening in the ﬁeld of sustainable
employability. And how this change -- changes the demand of our customers from an
insurance-only to insurance with all kind of services behind it related to sustainable
employability. And let me tell you what that landscape of sustainability looks like. In the
landscape of sustainability, sustainable employability, it's all about productivity:
productivity now, productivity tomorrow. But also productivity over 10, 20, 30 years when
the person has to work. And the combination of that productivity question, combining
with the macro trends as earlier discussed, lead to the increasing demand of services.
And it all starts for the person with having the right job, having the right competencies for
the job and being in a good condition, mentally and physically.
And to stay productive during your working life, it's necessary to develop yourself on and
on, day after day, to be the best a company can get. And today, the environment of your
working life is changing very rapidly. And the combination with the increasing retirement
age -- in combination with the increasing retirement age, therefore companies and
Page 40 of 84

FINAL

employees are looking for services to help them to ﬁll in their own responsibility for
sustainable employability. And it's needed to accommodate the businesses and people
and to -- so that they can remain productive. And we are in a perfect place because we
have access to all the services and products in the ﬁeld of sustainable employability.
For example, we have access to distribution. In this ﬁeld, the intermediary network is the
distribution part. And we have also access to Boval and to SuperGarant, 2 large players,
which we acquired in the last years, which are specialized in this ﬁeld. But we have also a
stake in the largest occupational health company, Human Total Care, which services 1.5
million customers in the Netherlands with company doctors. And we are the largest selfemployed network organization in the Netherlands, ZZP Netherlands, self-employed
Netherlands.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the ﬁeld of prevention and added services, ZZP Netherlands, Human Total Care have -and our own prevention services, which I showed in the triangle, are there. And in the
ﬁeld of claims management, getting back the customer to work as soon as possible, we
can rely on the Keerpunt, that's a joint venture with Nationale-Nederlanden; Human Total
Care; and of course, again, our own expert. And last but not least, because we have all
those services around when someone is starting to get sick, when a person is sick, when
he has to reintegrate. But sometimes it really goes wrong. Then we have our disability
insurer, which provides the ﬁnancial backup. And we have our health insurer. This provide
us with early interventions on the health side.
And if we are able to integrate -- in the coming years, if we are able to integrate those
services and use the data coming out of those services in an advanced way, we will be
really capable of outperforming the market and getting people back to their work and
keeping people productive. And thereby, we will be lowering our claims. We will be
lowering our combined ratio. And we can grow in this market segment. This unique
platform sets us up for proﬁtable growth. Going forward, we also â€“ we're still looking for
partnerships in the ﬁeld of ﬁdelity because we also believe that to promote a healthy way
of living and working is essential in this framework. And with all these partnerships, we are
perfectly positioned to fulﬁll the increasing demand from sustainable employability.
And that brings me to the conclusion. First of all, we want to leverage on our leading
market position, whilst we're continuing our excellent performance using the
multidisciplinary triangles and the performance wheel. We also committed to keep our
combined ratio attractive by sticking to our value-over-volume strategy. And besides that
I've just showed you that we have access to unique platform in the value chain aimed at
building an ecosystem centered around sustainable employability. And ﬁnally we will
actively seek for opportunities to grow organically or inorganically.
This ends my presentation on the Disability. And it also is ﬁnishing my presentation on the
P&C. In the P&C business -- in the Non-life business, our P&C and Disability business have
a target of 94% to 96%. And at the same time, we have a growth objective of 3% to 5%.
This is doable. But this is doable because of our partnership, because of the triangles and
because of the wheel we are using. We are perfectly placed. And we have the persons in
our company.

business.

FINAL

Thank you, Michel. So check, is it working? Yes. Are we still alive? We're going through the
Life book just before lunch.
What I'd like to present to you today and leave you with just before lunch with the next 4
key messages. And I have to push the button myself. So. We manage our Life book on a
very low-cost operation. But at the same time, we focus on good customer service. Good
customer service is very important for our retention rates, as it will reduce our unnatural
lapses. We have customers with us for over 30 years. So good customer service is really at
the heart of our strategy in Life. This is why we don't call our books, back books. But we
call it service books. And this is a crucial diﬀerence from, for example, situation in the U.K.

Bloomberg Transcript

I will provide you with an overview of the development of the total Life book, including
the average duration of the composite Life book and explain why this book is robust and
provides us a strong base for realizing investment margin in the years to come. I will give
an insight in our acquisitions over the past three years and will present to you how we
have been able to unlock the synergies. We have 3 sources of synergies: cost synergies,
capital synergies and re-risking the assets we acquire. And if we look at these 3 key
messages, we believe that we have a proven track record to have set up a ﬂexible
organization that is able to adopt change. That is why we believe that a.s.r. is wellpositioned for the next consolidation wave.
But let me start with providing an overview of what is in this Life segment. In the Life
segment, we have 3 lines of business: Funeral, Individual Life and Pension. And all of our
people working, all the managers focus on the same things. They focus on the eﬃcient
operations with strong customer service; they focus to rationalize a product portfolio. And
by doing that simplifying our operations; and applying these 2 skills, we can also apply
this on the books we acquire because most of the books have similar characteristics.
In M&A, our main focus is on Funeral and Individual Life. But we also have skills to
integrate Pension books. As already mentioned this morning with the acquisition of De
Eendragt, we also have integrated a Pension book. And meanwhile, we continue to
manage the unit-linked ﬁle. Total reserves of the Life book add up to EUR 38 billion at the
end of 2017. And if we include Generali book, this increases to almost EUR 42 billion.
Operating result, as Jos presented, was EUR 633 million. And it's our target to deliver a
stable operating result for the period 2019-2021.
Let me provide you an overview of the drivers of this operating result. This slide describes
the drivers of -- the 3 sources of the operating result of the Life book. The main driver of
the uplift of the operating result over the past years has been the increase in the
investment margin. And this afternoon, after lunch, Jack Julicher will give you a detailed
presentation on the investment income. But also the technical result has improved. And
this has mainly been the result of our acquisitions. The cost result is a hard work. It's a
hard work to keep the cost result in positive ﬁgures. And it's important to know that in the
Page 42 of 84

costs, it also includes the cost we make for our investments. So the costs of real estate and
investment management are included in the cost result. But all in all, what Chris was also
mentioning this morning, we only can realize these results if we have customers. And this
is why we have a strong focus on good customer service because it will increase our
retention levels.
And digitalization is key. Our customers demand the latest technology to be
implemented. We have invested, therefore, in client portals in all 3 lines of business: in
Funeral, Individual Life and also in Pensions. Digital communication is really what
customers demand for. And you need size in order to be able to implement these
services. We also have implemented the chatbot. And Philippe will show it to you this
afternoon. But also in operations, we make use of the latest technologies. We try to
implement as much straight-through processing as possible. But if we are not able to
apply straight-through processing, we are also implementing robotics. And by
implementing robotics, we can reduce sort of boring and repetitive tasks of our call
agents, freeing them up for the real customer service.
But let me go to M&A and some -- and explain to you a little bit how we are integrating all
these acquisitions. Over the past years, in Funeral -- let me start with Funeral. Funeral is a
relatively simple product. The acquired books have been successfully integrated into one
platform. It's an IT platform, which has a stable cost base. We ﬁrst have migrated all of
a.s.r. policies towards this platform. We did this before we IPO-ed. So it was done,
ﬁnalized in 2011, 2012. And we thought, well, if we have the skill of migrating all of our
own books to one stable platform, we can also acquire books in the market. And we
announced the ﬁrst acquisition of Axent. This was really a share deal. It was a complete
company we acquired. It had 2.2 million policies. And it took us 18 months to integrate
this organization, close down Groningen entity. And move all policies to Enschede, which
in -- which is like a 2-hours travel away from Groningen. And so all of the staﬀ we had to
release. And we built up only some additional staﬀ in Enschede. And this is where the
cost synergies really start to kick in.
But we had a challenge because at the same time, in the same year, we closed the deal
with NIVO. And with NIVO is a company we had already discussions going on for ﬁve
years. So when we announced the acquisition of Axent, the former owner became a bit
nervous. But that wasn't a problem because we made the deal with the former owner that
he would serve the contracts for additional 12 months. So it was like an outsourcing
contract. Then after we had closed the migration of Axent, we started on the migration of
NIVO.
And as you can see in the graph, it took us only 12 months in this case. And Generali was a
composite book. But it also included some Funeral contracts. And it took us only ﬁve
months to migrate these contracts. And only 10 days ago, we closed and migrated the
portfolio of PC (Holt). And although it was only 15,000 policies, migration and paying for
this book took place on the same day. So what you see is that we are on a steep learning
curve.
Each integration, lessons learned are evaluated and we take them along with the next
migration. So in Funeral, we have a ﬁxed IT platform, it's good to remember. And adding
Page 43 of 84

FINAL

more policies to the platform. We can't disclose. But IT costs have been stable since 2010.
So that is a relatively nice business case.
Then we thought, can we do the same in Individual Life? And again, we started with our
own books. a.s.r. has come from 7 diﬀerent life insurance companies. They were all
bought long, long time ago. But the products were still on legacy systems. And in the
past, each feature of a product required a new product. And this is why we had over 1,800
diﬀerent products in these 7 portfolios. And that's when we thought we do not only have
to migrate these policies, we have to rationalize them. And with the selection of our IT
platform, we look for 2 things. First of all, we wanted variable costs. So we selected a
partner who oﬀered a SaaS solution. And we pay a cost per policy. So we're fully variable
in our IT costs after migration. But secondly, the system needs to be more modern so that
we could have more of the similar features in 1 core product. So we rationalized 1,800
diﬀerent features and products to 12 core products. And this rationalization, I believe, is
one of the key strategic assets of which we have done over the past years.

Bloomberg Transcript

We started this whole rationalization process in 2013. And besides the product features,
we have also rationalized the funds. And as you can see in the graph, on the bottom righthand side, we reduced the funds from 270 to 34 core funds, most of them managed by
our own investment team. So remember, rationalization decisions are crucial. But the
interesting thing is that all of the Dutch players have more or less sold the same products.
So when we acquired the Generali portfolio, we only had to make 8 additional
rationalization decisions. So the skill we have built up on this rationalization, we can also
apply it now on the book we acquired.
But let me ﬁrst give you an update on where we are with our own migrations. For some of
you who were here at IPO, I showed you our plan on the migrations. And I'm happy to tell
you that we're more or less on track. We have migrated 5 out of 7 books. And at the end
of this month. And we're quite sure that, that will happen by -- being on -- already on the
10th of October, we're going to migrate the sixth book. Then we have one more book,
which was planned for the First Quarter of 2019. But now we have decided to migrate the
Generali book ﬁrst. And this is because the HLS book was outsourced to Infosys so we
have to insource it. And we still -- we have a contract through 2020. So from an economic
perspective, it was more interesting to integrate and migrate the Generali book ﬁrst. And
we will integrate and migrate -- or insource and migrate HLS book in the second half of
2019. So it is our aim to ﬁnalize both the migrations of Generali and our own books in
2019.
What is interesting of the Generali (cases) is that for us, it was the ﬁrst time that we have
bought a composite life book. So it was not a monoline life -- funeral book or a monoline
individual life book. But was a composite life book. And we already gave you an update in
the June call. But let me give you an update on where we are with the Generali
integration on the life book. I'm happy to tell you that everything is going slightly ahead
of schedule. We have migrated the funeral book in the 1st of July. It was planned for
October. But again we knew the PC health book was coming as well. So we were able to
accelerate the migration of the funeral book to the 1st of July. So that's ﬁnalized.
'Individual Life is on track. I showed you before, we are planning to migrate this in the ﬁrst

FINAL

half of 2019. But all rationalization decisions have been made. And we're now in the
process of data cleaning and preparing for the migration.
For Pensions, it's slightly more complex. But we have sent out oﬀers to all of our Deﬁned
Contribution customers already in this year. And some of the customers have already
agreed to move over to our a.s.r. DC proposition. This is a commercial migration. And
Jack Julicher will explain to you this afternoon what our DC proposition looks like. But we
have very positive responses from the Generali customers. With the closed book, it's -their deﬁned beneﬁt portfolio was already closed book for several years. That would be a
technical migration. And it's planned to happen 2019 and early 2020.

Bloomberg Transcript

So Generali was an example of where we have split up the book between our 3 lines of
business. We have disentangled the holding quite swiftly by moving all of the staﬀ
towards Utrecht in the ﬁrst -- within three months after closing. And having everybody: the
people managing Funeral with Funeral, Individual with Individual Life and Pension with
Pension; you accelerate the speed of integration because all of the staﬀ of Generali, when
they moved over to the building here in Utrecht, they immediately started in the
department where they were supposed to work after migration. So physically or from an
FTE perspective, from a personnel perspective, everybody has joined the new teams. And
having a very tight labor market, it also helped us because we had a lot of vacancies in
Individual Life and Pension. And we were able to oﬀer our new Generali colleagues the
positions, which were vacant. So having a ﬂexible workforce now helps us also in realizing
the cost synergies.
That about Generali. But let me sum up the total of the value creation from the
acquisitions we have done in the past years. As said we have 3 sources of synergies: it's
cost synergies. And as you can see and add up the numbers, you are much better at that
than I am. But it's over 3 million policies which we have migrated onto the IT platforms of
a.s.r. And this has created not only signiﬁcant IT synergies but also synergies in operating
the books as we no longer have to overhead over the books. Capital synergies, being part
of a composite insurer and buying a monoline funeral book gives capital synergies which
we can unlock as soon as the migration is ﬁnalized. And re-risking the assets. We have
added over EUR 7 billion of assets. And we were able to re-risk those assets and realize
higher investment margins. Having a robust capital position, we are able to re-risk and
increase the investment income if opportunities to do so come by.
Furthermore, we added 220 million of gross written premium. And this is helping us to
keep the book and top line relatively stable, creating a robust book. So all the eﬀort we
have done in realizing eﬀective cost operation, we can apply on -- also in these
acquisitions. And this is why we have an ambitious target on further cost reduction. In half
year 2018, we already have announced that we had additional EUR 8 million of decline in
our costs in Life.
I will explain a little bit what the graph is about because we had to ﬁnd a metric for our
cost reductions. And we decided that we want a metric which was related to our -- to the
basic provision as we do acquisitions. But also, there might be a decline in the basic
provision. And we said we want to have a target of 45 to 55 basis points of basic
provision. But let me explain. The basic provision is what -- the technical provision minus

the famous shadow accounting reserve. And the green line is showing our basic provision
over the past years. And the uplift you see is the acquisition of Generali.
The gray line shows you the operating expenses. And these are the operating expenses
including the costs we have to make for our investment departments. And as you see,
these costs are declining. This is partly the eﬀect of migrating our own books and partly
the eﬀect of the cost synergies from the acquisitions. Going forward, we think we will also
be able to realize cost synergies further, cost synergies from the Generali integration. And
we expect -- therefore, we expect to go even further down from the 57 basis points,
further down towards the range between 45 and 55.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then I also would like to show you our development. But this is from a Solvency II
perspective. So as with -- the former graph was on IFRS basis, now we switch to Solvency
II. If we look on our best estimate liability. And that's measured at market value under the
assumption of a forward interest curve, including the VA and UFR, we expect the book for
Funeral and Pension to be relatively stable, as average durations in Pensions are 18 years;
and in Funeral, even 36 years. So this gives us a stable best estimate liability. But in
Individual Life, you see the decline. And this is what all of the market is experiencing. So
imagine that you are a single Individual Life player. You really have a challenge. And this is
why we believe that the market will start to consolidate. And in Q&A, Jos and Chris were
already talking about this.
So let's focus on the possibilities we see for M&A. And again in this graph, the top 5 is top
of the graph. But we believe that in the mid-market. So the medium, small-sized
companies, there is roughly EUR 20 billion of assets and provisions. And having all these
regulatory developments, they really put pressure on this medium-sized companies. So
we believe that out of the 13 companies, some of them will come to the market. And as
said, we can't give you any details on discussions we are having or -- but this gives you an
idea of the possibilities there are. So in the meanwhile, we'll continue to migrate the
Generali portfolio. But if there will be possibilities, we are ready to look at these ﬁles.
So let me conclude with the things I would like to leave with you before going to Q&A.
a.s.r. is running the life book on a very low cost. But in the meanwhile, we focus on good
customer service. It's a robust and predictable service book, provides a strong basis for
realizing investment margin. And this is why we are targeting our operating income to
stay on the level of 2017. We have a track record in consolidation. And we're not only the
good buyer but also the good owner of the books we buy. And this is why we believe we
are very well positioned for the next consolidation wave.
This is where I end my presentation. And we'll go over to Q&A.

Q - Hadley Cohen

{BIO 18331131 <GO>}

It's Hadley Cohen from Deutsche Bank. A question for Michel, please. You're -- the 3% to
5% growth guidance that you're -- or target that you're giving, how sustainable do you
think that is? And I guess within that, what are you assuming your competitors are doing?
Is there any assumption that your competitors are catching up with your craftsmanship
and what have you? And if not how big could that growth be if you assume your
competitors were to stand still and do nothing? Then a question for Karin, please. I know
it's a slightly alien concept in the Dutch market. And I can -- for obvious reasons. But is
there any prospect around new business, writing new business and how you're thinking
about that?

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Okay. Thank you. Michel?

A - M. H. Verwoest
How sustainable is our growth rate? We think it's very sustainable because our sustainable
-- our advantage at the moment is not an advantage which is standing still. We are
continuously improving our skills, our data, our wheel and therefore, we think that we can
aim at that growth in the market and still having the value in that growth. The only
problem which can occur is that there are a lot of competitors which are not rationalized
pricing. And if that's happening, we don't have our growth rate. But we'd still remain to
our value and to our combined ratio. But I think most of the market is, at this moment,
more rational than it has been in the past.

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Okay.

A - K. T. V. Bergstein
Yes. And on Life, I think there are 3 angles where we see potential growth. First of all, in
DC Pension markets. And Jack Julicher will talk about this, this afternoon. Because we
have it in the quadrants of asset management, we made a split between the service book
and the DC book. And we have a strong market position there. And we're now clearly the
#3, with the consolidation of Delta Lloyd and NN. And that is really a market where we are
still growing. In Funeral, we do have cross-selling on the existing portfolio. So there is
some additional sales. However, we do see that it's more limited than before the panel
commissions. And thirdly. But this is a bit further away but we are thinking about that in
our innovation department, that you could have a combination between healthier living
and term life. This is what we see in other countries. But this is really further away. So we
haven't stopped thinking about it. And we have the knowledge base and we'll continue to
look for possibilities. But there is nothing decided yet today.

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Okay. Farooq?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Farooq Hanif from CrÃ©dit Suisse. What is it now about Individual Life that's making you
interested? Is it just that you now have the platform? Is it litigation risk? IFRS 17? What is it?
Why now? Because you didn't talk about it before, I would have thought you didn't always
have all your systems in place. So why now? Then secondly, in coinsurance, obviously
that's a bigger market share amount than I thought. So and that's obviously more the
slightly bigger ticket commercial business, I guess. So what's your appetite there?
Because that's clearly something you've not done before. You've got skills in what you do.
You've built skills in what you do. I mean why not develop that too?

A - K. T. V. Bergstein
Okay. Shall I start with the Life, Farooq? And the questions -- good questions. Thank you. I
think we ﬁrst wanted to build up the capability with our own books. So from 2013
onwards, we really started with the rationalization. And with the rationalization, you do it
through all of your books because if you change -- if you make a decision, you have to do
it for all the books at the same time. And that was quite a complex thinking. I think it took
us two years with the product rationalization board to make all the decisions on the
products. And we made them through all of the portfolios. Then we started to migrate
them one by one. But the hard thinking I think was done between 2013 and 2015. And
because most of the Dutch insurance companies have had similar products, we now have
that capability in-house and we can apply it to other portfolios. And we have the proof
that we can also do the migration successfully. So it's a little bit of doing it ﬁrst with our
own books. And then we can also apply it on books we are buying. And secondly, I think
that the problem for the other companies is now sort of appearing. We knew that we had
to act. And we had our study in -- already in 2011, that we knew that if we did nothing, we
would have an issue to come. By having this plan of rationalization and migration, we
have lowered our cost base and we have made it more variable. So that helped us. But
the others, they run into the same sort of challenge. And apparently yes, if they haven't
thought of something themselves, they might come to us.

A - M. H. Verwoest
When it comes to your question about coinsurance, the 5% to 6%, we are not the -- as
a.s.r., we are not the underwriter of all that business. So but we are tending to do is to get
more of that business but the very slowly, understanding the market, knows what risks we
are underwriting. But part of the 5%, 6% has been brought to international players or
other Dutch players. So it's not all on our books.

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Okay. I think Benoit is actually ﬁrst.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

Benoit Petrarque from Kepler Cheuvreux. A couple of questions on disability. There have
been lot of complaints from self-employed that pricing is relatively high. I think a lot of
self-employed in this country are actually not buying the products. At the same time, you
have a quite high proﬁtability, I think 91% combined ratio. So how do you reconcile that to
the role of adviser in the Dutch society? And do you see also more longer-term hurdles in
terms of return on equity on this business line? Or do you have objective in terms of
lowering this return on equity on disability? And also at this stage of the cycle, which is
extremely good, employment -- unemployment is very low, do expect some pricing
pressure on this segment? Then on the P&C, I've been surprised by the premium growth
coming from intermediary. I think this has been growing 5%, 6% last year. Longer term, do
you think this is sustainable to grow in this segment?

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Those were 3 questions.

A - M. H. Verwoest
Okay. Yes. On disability, starting with ﬁrst one. It's correct that in the Dutch market, there
are complaints about certain groups which are not able to ensure themselves because the
price is too high. What I showed through my presentation is that, that are the classes, the
blue-collar classes 3 to 5. And why is it possible to have a good combination of price and
product over there? That's because most of those workers are not seeking for a disability
product. But it's more like a pension product because those roles they have end up at 55
or 60 years to become disabled. What we have -- are doing now is changing the world
and changing our approach by helping those customers by preventing that they will
become disabled at 55. That was the Langer Mee. So we add services to it. So they are
working on their competencies, the way they are working during their younger years, we
are looking at that. And therefore, we can oﬀer them prices which are suitable for them
and also have a proﬁtable insurance. So that's the main way because there is too much
diﬀerentiation in the market and the white collar doesn't want to pay for the blue collar.
The combined ratios as they are, are good and we need them because there's also a cost
of capital in between. It's long-tail business. And in long-tail business, you have to be a
Page 49 of 84



FINAL

little bit careful with the business you are writing. The unemployment, does that give
pressure to the prices? I think that the pressure on the prices will -- the prices will increase
because of the economic uplift. There's more sickness leave. And as a matter of fact,
when the economy goes down, the sickness to leave goes down also. So it's just the other
way around. So I think it will be an increase in price instead of a decrease in price. And the
growth in the P&C business, we are growing quite suﬃciently because we're just growing
there where we can add value and collect value. And with our wheel, we have the
knowledge to target groups, to target products, which is bringing us value and bringing
value to the customer. And there's a lot of data behind that. And there's a lot of
professionalism in the wheel. We -- our people, our underwriters, our claim handlers, our
commercial people are constantly assessing together what's happening in the markets.
And we have that all in our old house. And using that data and that performance gives us
the opportunity to be ahead of the competition. And I think that will stay an advantage
because it's our main goal. But it's hard in a shrinking to stable market.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jos P. M. Baeten

{BIO 2036695 <GO>}

To add on, on the discussion on the self-employed, as said there are currently roughly 1
million self-employed. And there is a generic discussion on whether they are able to pay,
to get disability insurance at a reasonable rate. But if you zoom in to this population,
roughly 1/3 of that 1 million self-employed are providing income to families. The
remaining 600,000 are partially working. And their families are not dependent on the
income of this part of the self-employed population. So there is a debate going on
whether there should be an obligation to buy insurance. And from our perspective, it's
not going to work for the 350,000 that are currently out there. It may work. But as you can
understand, we are not -- we don't prefer to sell business because people are obliged to
buy it. And that's why in the newspapers, the discussion is always about the whole group.
And the people that can aﬀord a decent insurance are mostly the 600,000 that have
partial jobs. And the people that can aﬀord, Michel already explained how we approach
them to help them to pay an aﬀordable premium going forward.

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Okay. I think Johnny Vo was -- and then Farquhar.

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

It's Johnny Vo from Goldman Sachs. Just the ﬁrst question, to Karin, just in relation to the
product features and the fund rationalization that's happening, I mean what is the conduct
risk there, that you're forcing policyholders eﬀectively to take a.s.r. funds? So that's the
ﬁrst question. And the second question just relates to the competitive advantage of a
consolidation strategy. What is -- given that you outsource your IT, what is your
competitive advantage against a closed block consolidator who could come in the market
where you see more and more private equity coming in? So is this sustainable over the
long run?

A - K. T. V. Bergstein
Yes. Yes, on the ﬁrst question, that's a good question because I think I forgot to tell that
we always stated the rationalization decisions based on 3 parameters which is: customer

Page 50 of 84



FINAL

Company Name: ASR Nederland NV
Company Ticker: ASRNL NA Equity
Date: 2018-10-10

interest, the customer always has similar or better conditions because, otherwise here you
get conduct issues; then we look at it from an operational perspective; and of course from
a ﬁnancial perspective. But we always look at it in that order. Then on the competitive
advantage we have, we have had the insights in all of the products and the products
features already from our own books. And as explained, I think we have a competitive
advantage in this thinking work, had the work from the rationalization board, which
consists of actuaries, people from compliance, legal, product managers and marketeers.
And they all work together in yes, how can we rationalize? Because I think if you don't
rationalize and only migrate the books, then it's much harder to get the real beneﬁts out
of it. And by having done it on 7 legacy books. And now 8 with the Generali with it, we
have built up quite some insights.

A - Jos P. M. Baeten

{BIO 2036695 <GO>}

And on the PE part of your question, Johnny, over the last 10 years, I think there is not one
insurance company in the Netherlands that didn't have a conversation with PE, whether
they were willing to sell their books to PE, like happened in the U.K. And until now none
of us have seen a reasonable price which is better than how we think we are able to serve
those service books going forward. So I think yes, there is competition from PE. But also
from a regulatory point of view, Dutch regulator has stated on several occasions that if
and when there is a challenge for end market consolidation, there is a preference for end
market consolidation.

A - Michel HÃ¼lters

Farquhar?

Q - Farquhar Charles Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Farquhar Murray, Autonomous Research. Just 3 questions, just 2 on the Non-life side. Just
on -- you mentioned on the broker channel, which is obviously where you're mainly
focused, kind of loyalty. But I just wondered if you could give us some numbers around
the level of churn and how that's trended in recent years in terms of what you see on the
Non-life side in the broker channel. Then just in terms of channel discussions on Non-life,
was wondering if you could give a sense of how the broker channel's standing versus
direct distribution in the Dutch market over recent years and where you see things going
from here. Then just coming brieﬂy to Karin on the Life side, I can very much see the kind
of skill set you've built up in terms of integrating in the Life businesses and how that
clearly brings you to somewhere kind of new in terms of what potentially comes next. I
just wondered how you deal with the kind of background unit-linked issue in terms of
pricing and thinking about those kind of issues on the (build) blocks that might ultimately
come forward.

Should I start?

FINAL

A - M. H. Verwoest
First, to the broker business. We're -- often, we discuss this like an intermediary is just
advice and we have directs. That's not the case. Most of the professional intermediaries
are multichannel. So the Dutch market is going direct. But a lot of it is going via the
intermediary because he has the relationship but he's selling his product also direct. And
sometimes he sees the customers. So it's a multi-channel approach they have. The churn.
And the last ﬁgure I know, the churn in the direct channel is more than twice higher -more than 2x higher than it is in the intermediary channel. And therefore. And there is
some kind of a correlation between the duration of a customer and the claims. In the ﬁrst
years, customers claim more than in the latter years. So with the direct channel, you have
more claims. In the ﬁrst years, you have more acquisition costs for that. And therefore you
see more sales in the direct channel. But it's more going around in the direct -- in the real
direct channel instead of that is coming from the intermediary channel. Your question is
how does the intermediary channel develop? I think the intermediary channel is
consolidating in the Dutch market. So they're becoming larger. They're getting service
providers. That's one of the reasons, strategic reasons, why we bought 2 of these
companies, to better understand what they are doing. And they are very professional
organizations, which are multichannel-oriented, high craftsmanship on that. And we really
believe that in the business of P&C and the disability for sure, they will remain the
dominant channel. And besides that we have our own expertise and experience in the
direct channel because we have Ditzo. But we're not growing very fast in the digital
channel because it's not the -- I would prefer to grow in the intermediary channel because
it brings us better returns and better value. But if it's necessary, we can grow in the direct
any time. But we only do that when it brings value.

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Okay.

Q - Farquhar Charles Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Just a follow-up on that. I mean can you actually give us the numbers in terms of churn? (I
understand) you're giving us 2x versus 1. But can you actually give us the level?

A - M. H. Verwoest
I have to seek for it and then we will...

Q - Farquhar Charles Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

And how's the trend in that been? As you say the intermediaries themselves are changing.
But is that having any change in terms of churn behavior that you've seen in recent years?

A - M. H. Verwoest
No. We see -- what I've been seeing is that it is slightly going down. But it's not with the
large bank because the relationship of the customer with the intermediary is much bigger
than just one product. What you see in the direct channel, that's another thing. In the
direct channel, there's a lot of single product buyers. In the intermediary channel, the
customer ﬁrst buys more packages. And besides that, he also has his mortgage or his
Page 52 of 84



Company Name: ASR Nederland NV
Company Ticker: ASRNL NA Equity
Date: 2018-10-10

other insurance brought by the intermediary. And therefore the retention is much higher.
And in the direct channel, people are looking for the cheapest or -- every year and year
again. I'll seek it for you and we'll give it later on.

A - Michel HÃ¼lters

FINAL

Then the question on...

A - K. T. V. Bergstein
Yes, on the unit linked. Like I explained to Johnny, the -- for our customers, it's always a
similar condition or better. Yes. So in migrations, the unit linked issue is not aﬀected. All of
our customers have been activated to make a decisive choice. Should we stay or do we
go to an alternative product? This has also made that we had some more natural lapses.
And that whole program has been ﬁnalized. And if we do due diligence, this is always one
of the key items we have to look at. So we look at several portfolios. And like Jos was
explaining, we have strict ﬁnancial criteria. And sometimes we decide not to acquire a
book and that could be because of the unit linked issue in due diligence. So we look at it
in due diligence. And we are obliged to do so because we migrate and integrate the
books. And for our policyholders, we should not increase the risks. So this is a important
item in due diligence.

+++presentation
Welcome back, everybody. Welcome back. If you could all please take a chair. Sit
comfortably, please. Thank you. All right.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, welcome back for the afternoon program where we have,
again, 4 speakers lined up. We'll start with the presentation of Philippe Wits, as I said,
about innovation and digital; Jack Julicher on our Asset Management platform; Dick Gort
on real estate; and ﬁnally, Patrick Klijnsmit on IFRS 17 and additional life disclosures. So
with that, Philippe?

A - Philippe Wits
Thank you, Michel. Good afternoon, everyone. A couple of weeks ago, I was sitting with
my youngest son on the couch and he was looking at a YouTube video of a SpaceX rocket
blasting oﬀ into space, launching a satellite. And he turned to me and he said, "Dad, why
aren't we able to put people on the moon anymore?" And I thought, wow, that is actually
a very good question. Why aren't we? Clearly, we have made huge advancements in
Page 53 of 84

FINAL

technology. But all this exponential growth in technology, surely, we should be able to do
that and yet we still use and so use Russian rockets from the '60s to put people into
space. I wouldn't go in there actually.
So that made me thinking. And what is true for innovation is also true for the innovation
approach of a.s.r.. And it's actually not about technology or not about technology alone. I
think you need 2 things. You need a clear purpose, something you're really passionate
about, something you're really dying for to solve in a market. And secondly, you have to
realize that innovation and the application of technology is just a lot of hard work. It needs
humans to get it running. A robot doesn't do stuﬀ on its own. AI is really not that
intelligent, sorry to burst the bubble.

Bloomberg Transcript

So in the 20 minutes I have for this presentation, I'm going to talk to you about all -- not all
the hard work a.s.r. is doing, that would simply take too long. So I'm going to talk to you
about what a.s.r. is doing today and give you very concrete examples. And shortly touch
upon what we are preparing for tomorrow. So -- and after this 20 minutes I hope you
leave this -- well, you don't leave this room. But I'll leave you with these 4 messages. And
actually that our approach to innovation is very customer-centric. We really look closely at
customer paying points and trying to solve the unmet customer needs. You'd probably
like this as well, we don't throw good money after bad. We use stage gate funding to get
our innovations done. Thirdly, we partner with specialists in the ﬁeld of venture capital
funds to ﬁnd the best technology and the best startups. And ﬁnally, we have a very nimble
and agile IT architecture to cater for the ever-increasing technology.
So if you look at the market, it is very clear that a lot of markets are being disrupted. And a
lot of people actually think that it is because of technology. And they're right. I mean, it's
part -- for sure, it is technology, the Internet, the Internet of Things. But actually what these
companies are really doing well, they're ﬁnding pain points where customers really ﬁnd it
very diﬃcult or even didn't know that it was an unmet customer need. They solve it so well
that these consumers ﬂuctuate. And they get exponential growth. And that is only logical.
And so what we call disruption as an industry, customers actually call it a sigh of relief.
Finally, someone who is understanding what I want.
On my latest trip to Valencia, I was with my kids. So I have 3 kids. And my oldest daughter
loved to drive a motorcycle or scooter. And she said, "Can we rent a scooter?" And I -and you all know you dread -- I mean, renting a scooter or a car is very cumbersome. I
really didn't look forward to it. I went down my apartment and beyond -- behold, there
was a scooter in front of my apartment shared by a sharing platform by cooperative
model, unlocked by an app, paid by the minute. I loved it. I used it. And there is no
wonder that the taxi and the travel industry has been revolutionized this way. But again,
it's not about the great app, it's not the fact that I unlocked the scooter and retrieved the
helmet by the app. It is because these cooperative models are able to instill and thrive
trust through cooperation that actually makes the customer want to share stuﬀ in videos or
taxis, homes or whatever.
Now what is the great news about this? a.s.r. and all insurance models are actually the
mother of all cooperations. We actually invented cooperation. And we thrive and rely on
trust. The only thing we need to keep doing is keep getting relevance to our customers
Page 54 of 84



Company Name: ASR Nederland NV

FINAL

and keep showing that we are actually cooperating and that they are actually cooperating
with us. So -- but we don't have to develop that on our own as well. We have multiple
companies who are helping in that space.
And another trend we're looking at is data. So data, of course, is the big promise of big
data. And I'll give you a couple of examples later on. But big data is also about big
relevance. So it's not only about the data, people are looking for the relevance. And the
debate on data being not allowed to share through GDPR is right. I mean, we should
protect the right of customers. But actually from our research and engaging with
customers, they're more than happy to share their data if they get relevance in return and
if they get control over the data. So those are just 2 important trends we are looking at
and are investigating.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now staying on the topic of data. Data, of course, is key. And this looks like a very
complicated graph, it's not. So the left-hand side, I will get you through it. Starting on the
left-hand side is actually what we have been -- what we are doing the entire day. We have
a plethora of engagement with customers, literally thousands and thousands of phone
calls, emails, letters, maybe even faxes, I don't know, keep coming in to this company
every day. And it's only limited by human scalability of it. But as a huge database and
huge insights, we can derive from these customers. And on the right-hand side of the
graph. And Michel and Karin have been talking about it extensively, is they've been
migrating diligently to new platforms, to the SaaS solutions. And rationalizing that
landscape has provided us with ﬂexibility and cost, that is a great thing. But it has also
unlocked something else. And that is that these structures and these systems are much
more open architecture, being able to unlock by APIs and by integration layers.
Now how do you combine these 2 things. And that is where the magic happens. The
magic happens in the middle. And actually that is the digital asset a.s.r. has been building
over these last couple of years. And that digital asset is combining these human
interventions with the systems, providing and we've been building a digital
conversational algorithm. And the use cases are fantastic. And I'll give you just one
example. And that example is the chatbot.
So imagine this, you're an insurance company and you have a lot of things to tell to your
customers, you build thousands and thousands of pages, you probably notice a.s.r. was
like that as well. We loved our website; our customers didn't like it so much. 50% of our
customers were not ﬁnding the answer they were looking for on our website, pretty
dreadful percentage if you ask me. 50% of the customers that left either never went to the
website again or starting calling the call centers and sending letters and complaint engine
actually on the website. And that's the only thing you see. And that's actually the website
of a.s.r. today. You can just type in a question and get your answers. Sounds pretty easy,
right? I mean, chatbot, how hard can it be? But actually, it turns out it is very diﬃcult and
we have been solving this.
So why is it so diﬃcult? Just let me give you a very small anecdotal example. If a customer
would type in, "Can I actually transfer money to my bank?" You would think, well, easy
answer. Well actually bank, as in a lot of languages, in Dutch means bank as well. But it
also means another thing. It means actually a sofa or a couch. So and it actually

happened. Imagine that the customer would get a response, "Yes. You can buy a couch at
IKEA, it's 3 kilometers from here." Imagine what would happen in the call centers, not
happy at all. So it took a lot of hard work to program the chatbot to really get the
customer and give it a context in an insurance environment. And we succeeded in this.
Since the launch of our chatbot, 25% increase in customer interaction with our website.
And the best thing is now 73% of the customers actually ﬁnd their answers online, which is
great. And we got awarded by the Lovie Awards, the European prestigious prize for Best
Internet Site; and the Webby Award, which is an international award. We ended up in the
top 18% of the best homepages. Now -- and although I love these prizes, photos being
taken. But the best prize we got is that customers valued our Internet site with a 40%
increase in Net Promoter Score.

So this chatbot actually used to be the best technology last year. But remember that we're
also building this nimble and IT architecture. Actually, at the beginning of this year, we
migrated to a much better chatbot. But the good thing is we kept the digital interface, the
algorithm for ourselves, that is our IP. And we were able to plug in a new chatbot with zero
migration costs or almost zero migration costs and no service interruption. And the
customer, therefore, didn't even notice it.
But we also realized that the customer is never happy enough. And that we compete not
only with other insurance companies. But mainly with the likes of Coolblue or Amazon or
Apple where you get better customer service. So we imagine that what if the era of voice
is coming. And actually it is already there. Probably you guys maybe have a Google Home
at home or you'll use an Alexa app as I have at home or you use Siri from Apple. That is
actually fantastic technology. I mean, it is great AI. I mean, it's very impressive what these
companies are already doing. And it's probably going to change the face of what we do
and we may not use a website anymore. But just converse with these devices.
There's one thing that these things are not very good at or are pretty bad at actually. And
it is Dutch. They don't understand the Dutch language. So when I was preparing this
presentation, unfortunately, Google Home had just announced that they'll be handling
Dutch as well. And I say unfortunately. But of course, we already knew. The only thing is
that Google Home or the Dutch language is not very good in an insurance context. So we
have on the back of our digital asset already been building a voice bot, where we actually
could handle this as well the same as we have with the chatbot.
Now speciﬁcally for you, for your audience, I've asked my team to build a English bot.
And I will show you this example. And please bear in mind, this is a prototype. It works not
very well in English. I promise you, it works really well in Dutch. Here we go. Go video.
(presentation)
Thank you. So this is what we're looking at. So again, this is great technology. I think we
have the digital asset. Now we have to ﬁnd out whether our customers want to interact
with our chatbot, with a human or with our voice bot.

So I want to stay with you with the bots. We're not quite ﬁnished yet with our bots. So
robots in movies are often cute or walk on 2 legs or do scary stuﬀ and end the world, the
Terminator. Our bots are extremely boring. They don't do those kind of stuﬀ. And actually
when you see on the left-hand side -- on the right-hand side on the screen, you see a
robot working 24/7. And that's exactly what they should be doing. So are robots being
boring? Yes. They take over boring tasks, they take over repetitive processes where
humans are not really good at and robots much better, therefore, freeing up time for our
agents to engage in human interactions where you need more emotions.
An example, actually right here and Michel was talking about it is actually the P&C
example. So in P&C, when we took over the AvÃ©ro portfolio, this robot was actually
helping us to become the consolidator in the market. And we're actually going to use this
robot in the Generali transfer as well. So what is this robot doing on its own? The robot is
actually taking the data and the products from the AvÃ©ro, which is very diﬀerent than
our product oﬀer, taking that curated data and actually automatically making a policy
oﬀer, which is exactly personalized for the customer, automatically transferred to the
system, the intermediary. Intermediary only needs to do one thing, push the button,
Accept. And the policy is on.
And as it is shown here in this P&C for this particular process, there's a 93% reduction in
the handling time. And that's pretty impressive. Although I must say that before
everybody starts calculating that all humans within a.s.r. become obsolete, that's not true.
I mean, I love people. So that's not going to happen for one reason. And that is -- that
robots are actually employees, too. And robots need attention, they need training and
maybe they even need a lot of tender loving care as well. And actually when I said there's
one reason, there's a second one as well actually some process we even don't want
robots to handle because you just want human interaction as well and not all processes
are able to be handled by a robot as well.
So those were very concrete examples of what we are doing today. Let me tell you a little
bit on what we are working on for tomorrow. And actually, we -- when we focus our
energy, time and resources, we focus on 2 themes which are derived actually by the
trends Jos, our CEO, was mentioning as well. And that is living longer and prevention. It is
very clear that people tend to live longer because of a lot of things, better nutrition, better
health care, better medical care. So people live longer, have to save longer and have to
work longer as well. So we are looking on how can we improve the physical, ﬁnancial and
mental vitality of people. And for that, we are looking at ways how can we nudge people
in better behavior, in better health. And are looking at DNA and DNA data on how could
we actually provide people with personalized food programs or personalized exercise
programs. And the second one is about prevention. I mean, clearly, the data we're getting
in and the data which is out there promises personalized risk proﬁling and promises also
for us to be able to detect risks further -- earlier and also therefore to prevent risks rather
than just being out of ﬁnancial amount.
Now -- and as you have maybe been looking at the landscape of ﬁntech and startups,
there's so many startups in ﬁntech companies out there. And it's very diﬃcult to focus and
it's very diﬃcult or not so easy -- or it is easy to spend a lot of money. And as I said, we
don't do that. We take a very diligently approach in innovation and only innovation we do.

And we use a stage gate approach with very clear KPIs and very clear results, which
targets need to be met before the next round of funding is brought in there. So we use
actually a VC approach for innovation internally as well.
And secondly, on that diligently getting the costs for innovation in the brackets we wanted
to be in is that we are actually cooperating with venture capital funds to invest in startups
and in ﬁntech companies. And the reason for it that we thought about setting up our own
investment fund. And we could, I mean. But the problem is you'd probably go through a
steep learning curve and you'd probably spend a lot of money before you learn that you
may or may not very be very good at it. So we decided diﬀerently. We invested in 2 funds.
Aquiline on the left-hand side, which is also called Redwood in the States, mainly covering
European and U.S. assets; and Finch Capital, mainly covering Europe and Asia.

Bloomberg Transcript

So these funds are -- these venture capital funds are looking through the markets. And in
the thousands and thousands of options of technologies or startups, they provide us with
the best and the top 3. So we get 2 results out of this relationship. One, we get obviously
a result on our investment. And secondly, they provide us with the investments, with
proprietary information and in-depth knowledge of the companies they're showing us.
And we are done also and better able to assess whether this technology or the company
is worth cooperating with.
So just name 2 examples of Aquiline. Actually, one of them Michel already talked about.
And that is FRISS. So Aquiline is invested in FRISS. And we are cooperating with them. The
other interesting company Aquiline has invested in is Kryon. Kryon is an Israeli ﬁntech
company in robotics. And it's a deep learning robot. Most of the robotic companies, you
have to program the robot because deep learning -- this robot embeds itself into the
process, looks at thousands and thousands of situations and then comes up to the best
process and start working on it. Finch Capital has been investing in Trussle and Ikbenfrits,
which are both online mortgage brokerage platforms. Trussle is in England and Ikbenfrits
in the U.K. -- sorry, in the Netherlands. And Komparu is an interesting company, is a SaaS
platform for comparison sites.
But we don't invest only at arm's length in startups outside. We also invest internally in our
own startups and we work on certain things we want to improve on in the Dutch markets.
If you have been joining our dinner yesterday, (Tima) has been talking about to take the
vehicles to insure the world, our sustainability startup. I want to mention just 2 of -- out of
many we're doing.
So one is forward thinking. Forward thinking is a platform which is helping our customers
solve the wealth accumulation problem. The issue with wealth accumulation is that in the
industry, we love to talk about money, customers don't. They love to talk about their lives.
So the forward-thinking community is getting a lot of traction is because we talk about
their lives. And actually what is funny, there's a lot of customers bringing up problems. But
also solutions. There are already lots of solutions out there which are not mainly wealth
accumulated money related but other solutions. And the great thing is they bring the
solution and the solution is just not very well designed, it's not very scalable. And that's
where we come in as a startup. We make this solution scalable and very well designed.
And especially with a.s.r. with all the knowledge behind it, we could leverage on that.

And the second example I want to give you is the young entrepreneur disability bot we
built. So young entrepreneurs have a -- there's a paying point for young entrepreneurs,
they're very young so they don't know a lot of risks and they don't care about it. And
they're entrepreneurs so they don't think anything will happen to them. So we needed a
diﬀerent approach to attract these young entrepreneurs. And actually, we custom-built a
bot for them, which is mobile-only, very customer-friendly and with virtually almost no
threshold. It's very easy to get a disability product.
So those were just 2 examples of our startups. I want to leave you with a ﬁnal note. I trust
that I've shown you that we are very customer-orientated, always looking for the paying
points and unmet customer needs. We take good care of your money which is invested in
us and from our customers. We don't throw good money after bad. We invest in the -- in
venture capital funds because they are the specialists. And ﬁnally, we keep our IT
architecture agile and nimble.
I want to thank you for your attention. I would give the ﬂoor to Jack Julicher. He's going to
talk about asset management.

Can I have the slides on this monitor? Ladies and gentlemen, asset management for third
parties is a perfect example how we catch the growth opportunity in the ﬁnancial markets.
And it is also a perfect example of the success of our bolt-on acquisition strategy. And
what we did is we followed, as from the IPO, a strategy of buy and build. We in-sourced
assets. And we also grow and grew organically.
Let me sum up the key messages of today for third-party asset management. In the ﬁrst
place, we are a strong asset manager that is leveraging upon the key competences we
have developed in our 300-year history as the asset manager for the insurance
companies of a.s.r. And secondly, we build 2 speciﬁc platforms, which service a growing
asset base. And we are a typical Dutch player, focusing on institutional investors and
professional investors. So insurance companies, pension funds, government-related
parties, wealth funds, et cetera. We strive for a diversiﬁed growth. And we have a
distinctive proposition, distinctive with respect to sustainability, distinctive with respect to
LDI and matching and also with a lot of knowledge in speciﬁc asset classes like residential
mortgages. And lastly but very important, we are fully equipped to capture the assets in
our changing pension landscape.
Let me show you how we developed the skills as a third-party asset manager. We insourced assets. We in-sourced assets that were outsourced to external parties. And
secondly, as I said, we followed a buy-and-build strategy. What we did is that we acquired
niche asset players and that we added EUR 7 billion of assets of service books to the asset
portfolio. And thirdly, as I said, we grew organically. We were very successful in the
market. We were able to grow organically in LDI, in balance mandates, in residential
mortgages and in other aspects of the traditional capital market products.
Let me show the performance. We delivered as we promised. We delivered. And that is in
the table at the right. We delivered a long-term investment margins. We showed to you,
Page 59 of 84

we presented to you the process of the IPO. We delivered -- we outperformed a longterm investment margins that are underlying the operational capital creation. Looking to
the other portfolios, we were able to outperform consistently our benchmarks. Whether
we talk about credits or severance or equities, we consistently outperformed. We follow a
strategy of passive plus. That means that we are able to have a small tracking error against
our benchmarks. In general, we use broad benchmarks. And we are allowed to have small
tracking error to compensate on one hand for the sustainable policy, I will go into that
later. But also to compensate for the cost of the investment management organization.
Let me continue to the growing asset base. As you can see, our asset base has grown by
17% since the IPO. And when we concentrate ﬁrst on the assets managed for the internal
insurance companies, then we see growth of 13%. And that is showing the success of the
bolt-on acquisition strategy. We added about EUR 6.7 billion of assets related to service
books. And when we looked at the strategy, the investment strategy we followed for the
insurance companies, there are 2 elements. The ﬁrst element that we strive for,
diversiﬁcation, further optimization, diversiﬁcation of the portfolio. And secondly, that we
were in a process of shifting the portfolio step by step from liquid assets to less liquid
assets. And what we did is we harvested some of the illiquidity premium in the portfolio.
And that means that we invested the biggest share of the portfolio in somewhat less
liquid assets like residential mortgages. But also in ﬁnancials, subordinated ﬁnancials,
somewhat in private loans. But also that we further internationally diversiﬁed our ﬁxed
income portfolio.
And when we look to our market view, we view agility grow that is still substantial. We are
also in a market environment of very low interest rates. But there is a tendency to upward
pressure on these interest rates as a consequence of the withdrawal of the ECB as
tightening of the monetary policy. And on the other hand, what can be seen is
uncertainty, event risk. Still on a local basis, event risk like Brexit, like Italy, like Turkey, like
local crisis at emerging markets as a consequence of a strengthening dollar and the threat
of a trade war. But we feel that it is too early to derisk our portfolio. It's too early to derisk
our portfolio. That means that we still are in the process of further optimizing our portfolio
for the insurance companies. That means that we are on pace of a slight re-risking and
optimizing of the portfolio. We kept back, we held back somewhat at the beginning of this
year around the crisis in Italy and the uncertainty about Turkey. But as markets normalized,
we decided to continue to go back to the original plan of a slight re-risking of our
portfolio.
The asset management for the insurance companies gives us a perfect basis for a thirdparty asset management. And let me move to the platforms that we developed for thirdparty asset management. We developed 2 speciﬁc unique platforms. One platform, which
will be dealt with by Dick Gort, is the a.s.r. real estate platform. And the other one is the
more traditional capital markets a.s.r. asset management platform.
And let me go into what -- some more detail with respect to the contribution of the thirdparty asset management platforms to the operating income of a.s.r. What we can see as a
result of our buy-and-build strategy of in-sourcing and of organic growth that we are
contributing to the operating result of a.s.r. a substantial amount. We are contributing EUR
10 million in the ﬁrst half of this year. You can't multiply it by 2 because there's some
Page 60 of 84

seasonality in the costs that we are starting from scratch that we are now able to deliver a
distinctive amount to the operating income of a.s.r. And what is illustrating this success is
that we also have inﬂow. In the ﬁrst half, we had inﬂow of new assets in the third-party
asset manager of EUR 1.2 billion. We had inﬂow in those past years in LDI, in balance
mandate, in the mortgage fund, et cetera. And that means that we present to you. And
Jos announced that this morning, that we present to you that we expect and we target
that we can contribute to the operating result in 2021 more than EUR 20 million. And the
moment that we are reaching the EUR 20 million, we will grow 5% annually thereafter.
Let me continue to the success of the proposition. What makes our proposition
distinctive? In the ﬁrst place, what is shown in this matrix is, on one hand, the products we
oﬀer and, on the other hand, the clients groups we service. And what we oﬀer is
mortgages, mortgage fund, ESG funds, balanced mandates and LDI products, overlay
products. And what is important that we only oﬀer that to our clients, that we are skilled in,
(expertised) in, that we are the best in that we can service our clients best. And the
propositions that we can't oﬀer because we don't have the skills, we don't oﬀer. So we
focus on the propositions we are skilled for. And that means that we were able to attract in
our mortgage fund, EUR 1.2 billion of assets; that we were able to attract in our ESG funds.
So sustainable funds, more than EUR 3.5 billion of assets; that we were able to keep
stable the more traditional balanced mandates and funds; and that we were able to
increase the inﬂow in the LDI matching propositions with EUR 1 billion.
And what makes our propositions so distinctive? Of course, we are a Dutch player. We
focus on our expertise. We have a lot of knowledge of regulation for pension funds and
insurers. But one of these distinctive elements is our ESG proposition. So our sustainable
proposition, our proposition for social, responsible investing. And what we do is, of
course, exclusions. Everyone is doing exclusions. You cannot be distinctive then. But it's
important, it's the basis, the foundation of our ESG policy. But what we are doing is that
we internalized the sustainable policy. So the ESG policy in our investment policy. We
internalized it. And we did that by following an approach of active voting. But also of
active engagement; informal engagement with the companies and the governments and
the sovereigns that we are investing in.
And moreover, we added to this an approach of positive selection. And one of the
successes of positive selection is illustrated in the graph below. And that is our ESG credit
fund. Because of the positive selection. And we believe that companies that have high
score in ESG, that in the long term these things companies will perform better. And that is
an investment belief. But it is an important investment belief. And it is illustrated, it is
proved by this graph. What we see is that in the credit fund -- ESG credit fund, the carbon
footprint is decreased by 1/3 compared to the benchmark. And the benchmark is (ibox)
benchmark. And that is shown here. The carbon footprint is reduced.
And Jos announced this morning 2 non-ﬁnancial targets. And the ﬁrst one was that he
said that we are going to invest and have a budget in 2021, EUR 1.2 billion impact
investments. Then we're talking about climate bonds, green bonds. For example, our
agreement with Triodos, where we have sustainable agreement for granting sustainable
private loans. But also that we support pioneers and innovators in the ﬁeld of impact
investing. And moreover, the second nonﬁnancial target is the measurement of the
Page 61 of 84

FINAL

carbon footprint in our portfolio. We will be able to measure 95% of our total portfolio
with respect to the carbon footprint. And that is the ﬁrst step, the ﬁrst step with respect to
integrating climate change in the investment policy and to integrate the Paris Treaty in our
investment policy. And we are one of the ﬁrst movers there because we work together
with Ortec and some institutional investors in the Netherlands. But as the only insurer and
scientiﬁc bureaus in the world, to integrate climate change, temperature increase in the
economic scenarios that we use for our investment policy.
Let me move to the second distinctive proposition we have. And that is in the area of LDI
and matching. Of course, we have a long experience in constructing a portfolio to match
cash ﬂows, to match liabilities on the basis of a benchmark, a swap benchmark, UFR
benchmark, of course. But what we can oﬀer is a complete product proposition. A
product proposition that also can oﬀer the monitoring as well we can oﬀer reporting and
even can oﬀer the risk management function. And what we see at this slide is that we have
a complete range of products for pension funds and for insurance companies. We can -for big pension fund, we can oﬀer a tailor-made mandate with a tailor-made infrastructure
for the use of derivatives. But we can also oﬀer tailor-made products for the clients that
want to participate in the general pension fund in the RPF. And we can also oﬀer fund
structures for small and medium-sized pension funds, fund structures that are tax-eﬃcient,
that are cost-sharing and that are using collective management of infrastructure for the
use of derivatives.
Third distinctive product proposition. In the area of residential mortgage, residential
Dutch mortgages, what we oﬀer is 2 funds. One fund with mortgages with a kind of
government guarantee. So NHG guarantee; and a fund without that guarantee. And what
we oﬀer is, on the one hand, these mortgages with that NHG guarantee, less risky with
somewhat less return and spread. On the other hand, somewhat more risky proposition
with higher return and somewhat higher risk. Then to understand that residential
mortgage in the Netherlands are one of the safest asset classes. When we use the
Moody's technology, then we can say that the internal rating that can be associated with
this asset class is in the high-rated area.
And what distinguishes this product in the market? What gives us our proposition is that
we are a famous brand in the market with a loyal distribution channel through the
intermediaries. But also that we use vertical slicing. That means that there's no conﬂict of
interest, that we allot exactly the same portfolio concerning the features to the fund as we
allocate to the insurance companies. We already attracted more than 30 pension funds
and insurance companies. And we committed almost EUR 2 billion of assets in this
residential mortgage fund. And we started last year, we launched this fund last year.
Then a growth area where we feel that there are lot of possibilities. And that is the area of
capital-light DC pension business. As you know, there is a tendency in pension market of
a shift to -- from deﬁned beneﬁts to deﬁned contribution, a shift from solidarity to
individualized products, a shift that employers want to have impact. They want to have
control over the premiums they have to pay. On the other hand, employees that want to
have inﬂuence on the investment policy. And what we did is that we launched in 2018 a
new product in the DC area. And what distinguished this product is that we launched it on
a completely new platform. So without any legacy that we introduce it with a customized
Page 62 of 84

portal for the diﬀerent categories of customers. So for small and medium-sized
companies but also for the somewhat bigger companies. And that we fully integrated the
ESG component in the life cycle -- in the underlying life cycles. And that makes that this
product is very successful. We were able to attract EUR 600 million of assets under
management in a period of less than one year. And we feel that we are in the center of,
let's say. And fully equipped to exploit the desire in the market for solutions -- capital-light
solutions in the pension landscape. We were able to attract more than EUR 100 million of
premiums. And I think we can be very proud of that.
That brings me to the conclusion of my presentation. Let me sum up the key messages.
We are a very strong asset manager using the key competencies that we have built up in
our long history as asset manager of the insurance companies. We created 2 unique
platforms to service the growing asset base. We are a typical Dutch player, a typical Dutch
player working for pension funds, insurers, government-related institutions and wealth
funds. We strive for a diversiﬁed growth with a distinctive product proposition, especially
in SRI, LDI and with an extensive knowledge of certain asset classes like residential
mortgages. And last but not least, we are fully equipped to capture the assets in the
changing pension landscape and in the changing pension market.
Thank you. That concludes my presentation. And I want to give the ﬂoor to our CEO of
real estate, that is Dick Gort.

Okay. Thank you, Jack. My name is Dick Gort. I'm responsible for real estate within a.s.r..
And I'm going to give you a short presentation about a.s.r. real estate.
We have been investing in real estate for more than 125 years, which resulted in a really
beautiful high-quality real estate portfolio of which we are very proud. We take a look at
the rural portfolio that we have is portfolio of EUR 1.4 billion invested in the Netherlands, a
really beautiful portfolio with long lease terms and a -- which give us a very good hedge
against inﬂation. We've got a strong track record of signiﬁcant and stable investment
income. And by building our real estate platform, we are being acknowledged by a large
group of investors, not only from the Netherlands. But also from an international base like
Europe and Asia. By having that platform, we see that the fee income we have is
increasing, especially from third-party investors.
Well if you take a look at our real estate platform, actually, we are one of the largest real
estate investment management companies of the Netherlands. We have about EUR 5.2
billion invested. And we have about 150 employees. We have invested in residential
investments, retail investments, oﬃce investments and rural investments. Well our people
are very skilled. We work on a daily basis with real estate. So the 150 people we have are
very skilled. We're very proud of them. And we are very lucky that we can work in this
industry.
If we take a look at our business model, it's actually quite simple and very focused
business model. We have our own fund asset and property management. We do it
ourselves as much as we can because we believe we want to be in close contact with our

tenants, with our investors and with our other stakeholders. So we want to be on top of
business. And that is what we do.
Well these 3 asset classes we have, we opened them for third-party investors by
structuring real estate funds. So we have a retail fund, a residential fund and an oﬃce
fund. And besides those 3 funds, we have a rural portfolio. The rural portfolio is for 100%
owned by a.s.r.. And I'd like to zoom in on the rural portfolio with you. Later on I will zoom
in on the details of the real estate funds.
But ﬁrst, the rural portfolio. The rural portfolio is about EUR 1.4 billion in size. It is a very
well-diversiﬁed portfolio across the Netherlands. It has very long lease contracts, contracts
of 30 or 40 years per contract are very common. And it gives us a very good hedge
against inﬂation. As Mark Twain once said, "Buy land, they don't make it anymore." It's a
saying in which we believe very much. Although we are an active asset manager because
we don't buy just to buy, we're always looking at the performance. So we also sell on a
daily basis.
The portfolio or the rural portfolio can be characterized as follows: It has a very diﬀerent
correlation compared to the other asset classes we have. So that's why we are -- we like it
so much. If we take a look to the direct return we have, it's very stable. We've got
attractive capital growth. We've got long lease contracts and we've got a good hedge
against inﬂation. So that's why we like it as much. If we take a look at the graph on the left
side, we see actually a graphic of the Netherlands, it's the map of the Netherlands. We
see all kinds of black dots there. All those black dots are actual areas of land we own. And
as you can see, it's all over the Netherlands. And all those dots look like if the Netherlands
has got the measles. But we're everywhere on this map.
If you take a look at the graph at the top right, we see the green bars indicate the areas of
land we own over the last 15 years. And in 2003, we owned about 24,000 hectares of
land, which grew year-by-year to 37,000 hectares of land, which makes us the largest
privately owned -- landowner of the Netherlands. And it just didn't grow by buying land.
As I told you, we are an active asset manager. So we buy and sell land every day. But this
the net result of the portfolio.
If we take a look at the graph at the bottom right, we see those green bars which indicate
the direct return of the portfolio over the last 15 years. And we have added a black dotted
line which indicates the average return, the direct return which is 2.5% over the last 15
years. And if we take a look at the red line, which is the line for the CPI index, the inﬂation
line, we see that the direct return gives a very good hedge against the inﬂation. If we even
take a look at the total return of the portfolio over the last 15 years, it has been 9% per
annum. So that's quite impressive, I think, especially if we take the low risk characteristics
of the fund with it. So a very attractive portfolio, which we are very proud. We are more or
less the only investor in the Netherlands who is investing in this segment. And we will
keep doing that for many, many years I'm sure.
So if I go back to the core funds we have, since 2011, we've set up 3 real estate funds. We
started with the retail fund in 2011; 2013, we structured the residential fund; and in 2016,

we structured our oﬃce fund. The reason we set up these funds is by doing this in this
way, it made the asset class real estate more liquid because it is in itself a more or less
illiquid asset class. And by structuring these funds, we could add liquidity to it. So a.s.r. is
and was able to derisk and re-risk its real estate exposure more easily by just selling or
buying shares in the funds. Another reason why we set up these funds is that we -- by
doing this could improve our real estate platform, attract other investors to our platform.
We could expand our assets under management by the new money, which came to the
platform. And we could beneﬁt from the economies of scales by setting up our asset
management company.
If we take a look at the funds more in depth, we see that retail fund, which we structured
in 2011, is about EUR 1.5 billion of assets under management. We have a very strict
strategy there. We focus on high street locations. So 2/3 of the portfolio is invested in high
street, in the top 20 cities of the Netherlands and about 1/3 of the portfolio is invested in
convenient shopping centers like district shopping centers and supermarkets. I'm
convinced this is the best retail fund of the Netherlands by far. And it is acknowledged by
a lot of investors. So we are very proud of it and we have that portfolio because we are
working on it for many, many decades to get this quality.

If we take a look at the residential fund, we structured it in 2013, as I said. It's about EUR
1.2 billion. It's a low-risk portfolio. We invest in urban areas, very attractive areas in which
the rent levels we focus on are mid-level. So very aﬀordable, low risk. And if we take a
look to the vacancy, it's less than 2%., more or less the same as our retail fund. So very
proud of that as well.
And in 2016, December, we bought the oﬃce portfolio of the Dutch Railways company.
We believe in oﬃces. But oﬃces need to be located on the right location. So we believe
in mobility hubs like intercity stations in the largest cities in the Netherlands. And the
portfolio we brought was located on those positions, very rare portfolio and we bought it.
We've got a lot of oﬃce buildings right on top of those intercity stations. But also in the
direct vicinity of it. So vacancy also very low, below 5%, a very good investment of which
we are very proud. And we are trying to get more assets under management there over
the years. But as for all investments within a.s.r., it's also about value over volume.
Well by setting up the platform and building those real estate funds, we attracted a lot of
international clients to our platform of which we are very proud. When we started in 2011,
we worked only for a.s.r. But with our ﬁrst closing in the retail fund, the ASR Dutch Prime
Retail Fund, we started with 2 Dutch pension funds, the U.K. pension fund and the
Belgium insurer. And afterwards, we had many, many closings. So in total, 25 closings. We
added a lot of clients to our platform. This is a selection of the clients we have, all pension
funds, insurance companies, banks and foundations not only from the Netherlands but
also from other countries in Europe like Switzerland, France, Italy. But also Asia, Japan.
So a very nice combination of clients, of which we are very proud. And we were able to
provide these clients very attractive returns. As we can see in the graph in the bottom
right, we see the total returns of our funds over the last three years. So for example, in
2015, the total return for the core residential fund was 12.7%; in 2016, it was 14.5%; in 2016
(sic) (2017), it was 14.4%; and the ﬁrst half of 2018, we've got 6.9%. So these are all nonPage 65 of 84

leveraged returns because we try to use less leverage in our fund as possible. So very
impressive results, we think ourselves and also the other funds are doing very, very well.
If we take a look at the top-right graph, we see that the assets under management within
the funds are growing as well. So also by active asset management, selling and buying
and capital appreciation there. But it's all growing in all those funds. If we take a look at
the graph at the bottom left, we see the gray bars, which indicate the amount of
investments, which are brought by third-party investors. So we're seeing the funds quite
impressive that the third-party investors are taking a big share in the funds. And we see it
increasing over time. Then we see 2 green bars. The ﬁrst bar on the left is the a.s.r. PF, the
a.s.r. Property Fund, which is actually the fund we have for policyholders. So it's not open
for third-party investors. And we see the rural portfolio, which is 100% owned by a.s.r.

Bloomberg Transcript

As I told you, we are an active asset manager. And we are always looking for new
opportunities. Recently, we decided to invest in European non-listed real estate. And we
are the cornerstone investor in the BlackRock euro property fund, which was just launched
a few months ago. And we decided to invest more in European-listed real estate. So that's
a new activity we're working on.
If we take a look at the assets under management. This graph gives you a picture of 2011
when we started with our real estate funds. So in the ﬁrst half of 2011, EUR 3.7 billion assets
under management. And in 2017 (sic) (2018), we see that the assets under management
are EUR 5.2 billion. If we take a look at the green bars, we see that a.s.r. had EUR 3.7
billion in 2011. And if we look at the bar at 2017 (sic) 2018 , we see that a.s.r. still has more
or less EUR 3.6 billion, EUR 3.7 billion assets under management. So the gray bar we
added is the capital raised by third-party investors. And altogether, it amounts to EUR 5.2
billion, which is approximately 30% of the total assets under management.
Well the lower graph gives us a picture of the fee income, well, obviously, in 2011 we
started with 0 third-party fee income. And if we take a look at the bar on the right, we see
that in 2017, it is EUR 11 million, which is also approximately 30% of our fee income. So we
have been building a real estate platform for a long time. We worked in real estate for 125
years. And we've been able to attract institutional investors to our platform, of which we
are very proud.
So this brings me to my conclusion. We've been working in real estate for 125 years. That's
a really long time. But that means that we're very dedicated and very hardworking on real
estate with our 150 colleagues. So the portfolio is at the moment EUR 5.2 billion. We've
been investing in retail, the a.s.r. Dutch Prime Retail Fund, which invests in high-street
locations and convenience shopping centers. We've been investing in residential, the
a.s.r. Dutch Prime Core Residential Fund, which is investing in low-risk houses for midlevel rent apartments and houses. Oﬃces right on top of the intercity stations, we're very
well located. The rural portfolio, EUR 1.4 billion with very long lease terms, which gives a
good hedge against inﬂation. And we are investing in non-listed real estate funds on a
European basis.

Besides that, we have a very strong track record of signiﬁcant and stable investment
income. We attracted a lot of institutional investors to our platform, not only from the
Netherlands but also from Europe and Asia. And we've got a very reliable and increasing
amount of fee income, which is increasingly coming from third-party investors.
I thank you very much for your attention. And this was my presentation. And I would like
to give the hand to Patrick Klijnsmit, who would tell you more about life disclosures and
IFRS 17.

A - Patrick Klijnsmit

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Dick, for your introduction. And thank you all for sticking with me for the ﬁnal
presentations of today. And as Dick already mentioned, I will talk a little bit about IFRS 17.
So that is the future of insurance accounting. But I will start out with the life disclosures,
some focus on the future life earnings. And as you know, there has been already a lot of
things said about those life earnings in the previous presentations. So I'll -- what I will try
to do is give some additional perspectives on that.
Turning to our life disclosures ﬁrst. In terms of key messages, there are really 2 key
messages to remember. First of all, we have a signiﬁcant life service book. And that
signiﬁcant life service book has actually been growing over the past couple of years. And
that of course is due to our bolt-on acquisition strategy. So whereas you would expect a
life service book to be shrinking, our service books have been growing. And another
important message here is that the primary proﬁt driver of the service books is the
investment margin. And the investment margin in the case of a.s.r. is supported by our
shadow accounting methodology, aiming to keep the investment margin as stable as
possible.
On the next slide, you can see the development of the life service books and more
speciﬁcally, the basic provision. And the basic provision, as was already mentioned, is the
provision excluding the shadow accounting and capital gain reserves. So the basic
provision here in the last, what is it, 3.5 years has grown with about EUR 6 billion. And that
EUR 6 billion was supported by the acquisitions, the acquisitions of Axent, NIVO,
Eendragt and of course, Generali. They added about EUR 7.5 billion in total. So if you do
the subtraction, then you end up with an underlying decrease of about EUR 1.5 billion,
which is an undeniable decrease but still it is a relatively small decrease if you see it in the
perspective of the total portfolio.
If you look at the proﬁtability in the portfolio, as mentioned, primarily investment margin.
And for the ﬁrst half of 2018, the investment margin was about 85% of the operating
results in the Life segment. So a very important part driven by the investment margin. But
of course, there are other sources of proﬁtability too. And those sources of proﬁtability are
very carefully managed, reﬂected, for instance in the presentations of Karin but also
reﬂected in one of our targets which really focuses on the operational costs in our Life
segment.
On our next slide, we can see some actual numbers. So it's nice for a ﬁnancial to have
some numbers. And what you could see here that the investment margin has been

FINAL

growing quite rapidly over the last three years. And actually there are a couple of reasons
for that. One is an obvious reason. Of course, the book itself has been growing. So with
the growing book, you have a growing investment margin. But that seems kind of logical.
Second reason is that there has been a successful, active search for yields in the portfolio.
For instance, in the end of 2017, we had quite a bit more mortgages in the portfolio
compared to the beginning of 2015 or the end of 2014. That was also shown in the
presentation of Jack.
And the third reason why it has been growing is a bit more a peculiar reason. Quite a few
years ago, we had a rather large swaption portfolio, which we sold at that time at a quite
signiﬁcant capital gain. Based on our shadow accounting methodology, that capital gain
was put into our capital gain reserve. And it started to get released from that capital gain
reserve from 2015, 2016 onwards, which was the time that the original swaption would
have turned into a swap. So that was the moment based on our methodology when it is
released into the P&L. And that has really supported the investment income -- or the
investment margin in the last few years. And it actually worked a bit like a double
whammy because we did not only get the release of the capital gain reserve but we also
got â€“ well, or did not have any more actually the right of the swaption premium. So that
added together to create a quite substantial growth in the investment margin over the last
couple of years.
We do not expect this type of growth to continue. We expect the investment margin to
increase a little bit. It will be supported by the shadow accounting release, or the release
of the capital gains reserve that will be about EUR 300 million annually going forward. So
about the level of 2017. It will continue -- the investment margin continues to grow a little
bit because of the acquisition of Generali that needs to be embedded for a full year in the
portfolio. But the growth rates that we've seen in the past are -- well, there's -- on a
standalone basis, that is not likely to happen.
If you look at the technical result and the results on costs, we think it will experience a little
bit of pressure. It was already mentioned. We are focusing on trying to keep the result on
cost. You can also see that the result on costs already is -- experienced some pressure
here. The technical result is actually still going strong. But that was because of the
additional bolt-on acquisitions that we did. Towards the future, we think it will get some
pressure. But you should remember, the pressure is only -- well, only 15% of the operating
result. So pressure is a relative thing here. And if we combine the investment result and
the technical result, we think that overall it will be fairly stable in the years to come. It will
give a good proxy for proﬁtability in -- well, up until the IFRS 17 implementation.
Well say you want to model this yourself, you can also assume that it will be stable. But say
you want to model this yourself, we suggest to use -- can be practical about this. But if you
want to model this yourself, we suggest to use the basic provision as the denominator. So
if you want to model the investment margin, you can do that by using the development of
the basic provision. But using basic provision excluding unit linked simply because with
unit linked, the investment margin ends up with the policyholder, not the company. And
for the technical result, you can use the basic provision including unit linked.

What you should not take into account is the size of the cap gains reserve and the shadow
accounting reserve. The size of those reserves are very relevant in terms that they -- that is
the pot of reserves yet to be released into the P&L. But it does not give you any indication
about the pattern in which it will be released simply because that has much more to do
with the investment income and with the development of the basic provision. So it should
not include those elements.
And that quickly brings me back to our key messages and just trying to get another focus
or another perspective on the life earnings for the future. We think the combination of a
service book, which has been growing, we've been able to carefully manage that in the
last few years, plus an investment margin that is really supported by the shadow
accounting methodology, make it very stable. Plus our focus, a continuous focus on cost
and keeping the technical result will render a very stable foundation for the life book or
the life earnings in the coming years. And we think that will be the case up until the
introduction of IFRS 17, when it is in 2021.

Bloomberg Transcript

And what happens when IFRS 17 comes, well, is in my next short presentation. IFRS 17 was
introduced in May 2017. It's the new standard on insurance liabilities. And actually, IFRS 17
is a relatively small standard. It's only about 60 pages or so. It's highly principle based.
And that basically means that we need to do all the work. We need to make the analysis.
We need to make the choices. And what we do know is that IFRS 17 will mean a complete
overhaul of insurance reporting. And that is also the reason why we decided to defer the
implementation of IFRS 9 up until the moment that IFRS 17 will be introduced, simply to
avoid 2 major accounting changes in consecutive years in our books. So we defer IFRS 9.
IFRS 9, however, is already in force from the beginning of this year, has already been
implemented by banks.
What we want to do today is just give you a bit of an understanding of the choices that we
need to make, the impact that IFRS 17 probably has and more or less, a direction of travel.
What we do not give or cannot give at the moment, simply because we don't have them
yet, are ﬁnal numbers or -- so more a direction of travel. And you should remember, as it
is a principle-based standard, we can make choices in that standard up until IFRS 17 is
implemented. And actually, the time until implementation may be even longer than we
now expect because the IFRS 17 endorsement process at the EU has run into some delay.
And that may actually mean that we will not implement it in 2021 but perhaps 1 or two
years later.
Well on the next slide, there's the impact of IFRS 17. And when we started out with this
project, we thought, well, IFRS 17 is a market value standard. Solvency II is a market value
standard as well. So how hard can this be? Unfortunately, there are quite some diﬀerences
between Solvency II and IFRS 17. For instance, IFRS 17 uses an economical discount rate,
whatever that is. But an economical discount rate is required. Solvency II uses the UFR.
And many would argue that the UFR is not the most economical of discount rates. Then
there are diﬀerences in the way we deal with costs. There are diﬀerences in the way we
deal with contract boundaries. And in Solvency II, we have a risk margin. In IFRS 17, we
have a risk adjustment, which actually seem similar and the purpose of them is similar.
And actually the methodology under the standard model is kind of similar. But there are

Page 69 of 84

FINAL

diﬀerences. For instance, the cost of capital assumption in the Solvency II risk margin is
6%. And I'm not sure -- not quite sure that we will use that under IFRS 17.
The most noticeable diﬀerence between IFRS 17 and Solvency II, however, is the way we
deal with future proﬁts. So in Solvency II, future proﬁts are part of your own funds, of your
equity, if you will. In IFRS 17, they are part of the liabilities in a so-called contractual service
margin. And the contractual service margin, as you may know, is the present value of the
future proﬁts of a policy based on current assumptions. And that present value will be
released -- or the future proﬁts will be released into your P&L over the lifespan of the
policy. So IFRS 17 and Solvency II being very diﬀerent on that aspect.

Bloomberg Transcript

We've also tried to get a bit of understanding of what IFRS 17 means when you compare it
to IFRS 4. And when we start out with our IFRS 4 insurance liability of EUR 38.2 billion, it's
in the bottom right side of the slide, by the way. But if we start out with the EUR 38.2
billion that you've seen in other presentations already, you ﬁrst need to take out -- or you
need to get to IFRS 4 at pure tariﬀ rates. And to do that you ﬁrst need to take out all
shadow accounting-related elements because shadow accounting is really an IFRS 4
phenomenon. It was actually used in IFRS 4 to make IFRS 4 more market value based. But
IFRS 17 is already market value. So no need for that anymore. So you take out the shadow
accounting reserve, you take out the capital gain reserve and you move that to equity. So
that's good. But unfortunately the release of these reserves will not support your P&L
anymore. So that will not be the case anymore in IFRS 17.
But then the next step to get to IFRS 4 at tariﬀ rates is to take out our own pension scheme
because our own pension scheme in a consolidated level, on a group level, it is not an
insurance liability but it is an IAS 19 deﬁned beneﬁt obligation. So you take it out to get to
the pure external tariﬀ rates IFRS 4 liability. So that's the EUR 30.2 billion that you see in
the middle of the slide.
Then to bridge from those IFRS 4 at pure tariﬀ rates to IFRS 17, we add about EUR 8.6
billion. And these are 2015 ﬁgures. It's based on an analysis where we used a lot of
Solvency II ﬁgures. We have a discount rate of a UFR set at 2.2% in there. So there are
many things you can say about this. But this gives a bit of an indication and a feel where
it's going. But you add EUR 8.6 billion, which is a combination of a contractual service
margin that you add, you add a risk adjustment. And the most important thing that you
add is the impact of the current discount rate and the impact of the current assumptions
on your portfolio, on your provision. So from that we add up with the IFRS 17 liability.
If you look at the historical CSM which is created here in the transition, we think the
historical CSM will be highly dependent on the transition approach that we take. There
are many choices, there are diﬀerent choices to make there. And I will come back to that
on a separate slide because that's a very signiﬁcant choice to make on the onset of IFRS
17. If you look at the CSM, the contractual service margin, going forward. So from
transition onwards, new production, we think it will be somewhat higher in funeral. We will
-- think it will be somewhat higher in disability. We think it will be somewhere in the
middle of the pack for Individual Life. And it will be lower or absent, in some cases, in the
DB pension space. And this may also be an additional reason for a shift from DB to DC
because under IFRS 17, if you make any loss-making contracts, it will be immediately

FINAL

visible in your P&L. So no margin of error there anymore. So perhaps that will give an
additional drive.
If we go to the next slide, we go to the ﬁrst choice that I need to -- I want to discuss. And
actually this is the easiest of choices. But it is an important one. It is about the
measurement approach. There are a couple of ways to deal with the insurance liabilities.
And basically, well, what's in the name, the general model is the model which is used
most often. The general model is the model that we will use for life insurance, that we will
use for disability. And the life -- the general model is the complete model which also
creates contractual service margin.

Bloomberg Transcript

What is also an option is to use the premium allocation approach in case you have shortterm insurance business. And the premium allocation approach, the bad thing is that it
does not create CSM. But the good thing is that it's much, much simpler than the
implementation of the general approach. So at a.s.r., we will very likely choose to use the
premium allocation approach for both P&C and for health, making IFRS 17 â€“ that is the
takeaway of the slide, making IFRS 17 really about the long-tail business. There's also, by
the way, a variable fee approach. And the variable fee approach is for DC products for
unit linked. So having a separate category for that. So the noninsurance part of the
business more or less.
On the next slide, we have one of the most important decisions to make. And that
decision is about the transition approach. The very interesting thing about IFRS 17 is that
the IASB thought, well, how can we make IFRS 17 really complicated? Well we need to do
a full retrospective application of it. That seems to be the base case of IFRS 17. So in IFRS
17, what you should do is have a full retrospective approach. That means that you go back
to your inception date of your policy then ﬁgure out whatever your data and your
assumptions were at that time, then calculate the CSM based on that. Follow that CSM up
until transition. And whatever is left of that CSM, put that in your balance sheet.
And actually that is feasible in some cases. For instance, if you acquire an insurance
portfolio, then the acquisition date for the acquiring company becomes the new inception
date of the portfolio. So that means, for Generali, we acquired Generali at the 5th of
February 2018. So the inception date for IFRS 17 purposes of Generali portfolio is the 5th
of February 2018. So a full retrospective approach is feasible there. But you can imagine if
you would have written a funeral policy in the 1980s, there would be very, very few
insurance companies that would have thought about keeping all the data and keeping all
the assumptions because they won't need to transfer to IFRS 17 3 or 4 decades later.
So in many cases, the full retrospective approach is theoretically very interesting but
practically not feasible. And in those cases, you can move to the modiﬁed approach. And
the modiﬁed approach, there we stay as close as possible to the full retrospective
approach. But we can make some shortcuts here and there. And at a.s.r., we will probably
do that for our funeral book. And we will probably do that for our disability book or at
least part of our disability book. And in both cases, that will render a signiﬁcant CSM.

Page 71 of 84

FINAL

What you can also do is that you will use the fair value approach. And in the fair value
approach, you basically say, what would be the value of the liabilities if I would sell them
to a third party upon transition? So you would determine what a third party would ask for
the liabilities when you transfer to IFRS 17. So what you do is you take the fulﬁllment value
of the cash ﬂows, you add to that a risk adjustment. And you add to that a CSM because a
third party, when they take over your policies, they want to make money on that.
And the interesting dynamic that happens here, that if you have a loss-making DB book,
for instance, then that DB book becomes proﬁtable from the moment that we transfer to
IFRS 17 onwards. So currently, loss-making book will become proﬁtable again. But of
course that will really give a beating to your equity because the CSM needs to come from
somewhere. And in this case, it will be -- will come from your equity. We will probably use
the fair value approach for the individual -- part of the Individual Life book and part of our
DB book. Because it's also one of the simpler approaches, you don't need a lot of
historical data for that.

Bloomberg Transcript

What is the interesting -- or what is good to know about the a.s.r. business, we luckily have
a relatively small DB book. We're not the biggest DB player in the Netherlands. We have
adopted the value-over-volume strategy quite a long time ago. And another important
beneﬁt for a.s.r. is that we do have the shadow accounting and the capital gain reserve
moving from liability to equity upon transition, really mitigating the impacts thereof.
Final choice that I want to discuss is the choice for the discount rate. The discount rate is -should be an economical discount rate. But other than that, there's not much described in
IFRS 17. So basically everything you could sell to your auditor, you can use. We think that
the choice for the discount rate is highly dependent on the composition of your portfolio.
That's really because the discount rate is a distributor between equity and future proﬁts.
So if you have a low discount rate, you will have high future proﬁts but low equity. And of
course, it will be the other way around with a high discount rate. So that makes insurance
companies highly incomparable. The good thing for you is that we need to disclose the
discount rates. So you can make some calculations and make us comparable again. The
bad news is, there's always bad news again, that all the changes in the discount rates can
be accounted for either through equity or through OCI or through the P&L. And that
makes insurance companies relatively incomparable again.
At a.s.r., we currently have a very stable earnings pattern. We have -- under IFRS 4, we
have shadow accounting, keeping it predictable and stable and we'd strive to do that
under IFRS 17 as well, although IFRS 17 is a market value standard. But we think in the
combination of IFRS 4 and IFRS 17, especially in the discount rate space, there are quite
some opportunities to do some matching and to take the volatility out as much as we can.
And we are currently investigating that.
So quickly to my next slide, to keep up with the time, the next slide is on the a.s.r. project.
I think, overall, we're well underway with the project. We already made quite some
decisions on, for instance, the systems architecture. We are implementing a new general
ledger, working hard on a cash ﬂow projection model serving both Solvency II and IFRS 17.
So trying to be as eﬃcient as possible. We have also analyzed the full standard, made our
initial choices. We are currently working on a ﬁrst complete dry run, actually, in the ﬁnal

stages of that. And so moving forward pretty well. We do, however, know that this will be
a long project. It will also be a tough project. And we know it will also be a relatively costly
project. We expect it to be as much as the Solvency II project has been in terms of cost.
If the EU would postpone, that may alleviate some of the pressure on the project. Not
quite sure I'm really happy with that because over the past 1.5 years, we got a good
dynamic in the project moving forward pretty well. And it seems that we are, well, at least
a bit ahead in the pack or somewhat in front of the pack. And if we now have a
postponement it may also feel like, well, being ahead in the race and then the safety car
entering the track and the whole pack comes back together again. But well, it's out of our
hands, we'll see what happens.
And with that, I'm back at my key messages. And I give back to Michel for Q&A. Thank
you.

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Thank you, Patrick. That's about ﬁnishing on a high on the IFRS 17. That's new. Can I please
invite the other speakers as well for the ﬁnal Q&A session for today. So Chris, Philippe,
Dick and Jack?
+++qanda

Bloomberg Transcript

All right. So the end is nearing. Final Q&A. And well, you know the drill. So I'll just â€“ like
2 questions per round per speaker, name and stuﬀ like that. So Johnny Vo?

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

It's Johnny Vo from Goldman Sachs. Just a few questions. First question to Jack. I mean
with growing your asset management business, I mean there's probably 3 levers you can
do to try and grow assets. There's distribution, probably pricing in terms of costs or in
terms of maybe alpha. Which are you using to grow your asset base? And what are you
trying to do to get your assets up, of those 3? The second question is related to, you sort
of said mildly you can increase the risk within the book of the insurance business. What
type of assets look good today given where we are in the cycle? And just a ﬁnal question
just on IFRS 17. But actually to Chris, just look, Chris, you said about the fact that in the
future, probably dividend payments would be correlated to capital generation. Here's an
opportunity in IFRS 17 to align the earnings closer to the capital generation. Why would
you not choose that?

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Okay, ﬁrst question. Jack?

A - Jack Julicher

{BIO 5943222 <GO>}

Yes, ﬁrst question. I think we use all 3 aspects. So in the ﬁrst place, distribution, example is
the DC product but also using the expertise when we distribute, for example, the
residential fund proposition, that's one. Pricing of -- always, you have to be competitive in

this market. It's a very competitive market. So you have to deliver added value to your
customers, else they won't select you. That's very easy. Then alpha. Yes, of course, alpha.
You have to be very clear in what is distinctive. So we lever upon the sustainability
proposition, that is a real distinctive proposition. And there we create the alpha in the
portfolios. So in all the ESG funds, we have a very speciﬁc policy integrated where we can
show our clients that we create alpha given, of course, the benchmarks and the
parameters for the ESG proposition. Then the second question?

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

Yes. The assets to increase in your insurance. So you said that we could increase the risk
for insurance liability.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jack Julicher

{BIO 5943222 <GO>}

Yes. What we do is we have -- what I said was that we were on a pace -- the original pace
of re-risking the portfolios for the insurance companies. That means that we have 2 paths.
One path is a slight re-risking. So Chris explained that we have to go with 3percentage of
SCR. We are on a pace there. And the second way we are doing it is optimizing the
portfolio. So Chris explained hurdle rate is at least 10% or more return on the allocated
capital. So on the market risk capital, that is allocated to the market risk, we have to make
a return of at least 10%. So that's the basis. But what we have developed is tools, not only
looking to return and volatility but also looking to optimization in a broad spectrum of all
available asset classes where we can create an optimum with respect to excess returns
related to the capital consumption. When you ask me what asset classes are attractive, at
the moment what is attractive is we feel you have to be very selective. In many cases, you
are not adequately rewarded for the liquidity risk you take. And liquidity, that is the
essence of the play. So you have to be very selective. That means that a lot of classes in
private loans are not feasible to select. A class that is to a certain extent. And Chris said it
already, is -- that is attractive is, for example, residential market still. Spreads are at levels
of 140 to 180 basis points. The remuneration for illiquidity is around 40 to 70 basis points.
And that is asset class where I think there is some value in. In general you can say real
estate is in other class where there is some value in. In general you can say certain class is
in, for example, infrastructure debt because of the attractive treatment in the Solvency II.
But in general I can say markets are relatively expensive, almost all markets. And where
we're underweight certainly is in sovereigns, for example. Equities are also fairly
expensive relatively. And when you look for credits, we are on a neutral base. So no
underweight, no overweight. And yes, looking to the more illiquid asset classes, you can
add some value there precluded that you are very selective.

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Okay. Then, Chris?

A - H. C. Figee
Just to build on it, Johnny, I think we look at it from a couple of perspective. We either
have an asset that the -- either you're a good producer or you're a good owner. I mean,
our shareholders don't hire us to buy equities, to manage equities in principle, right. It's
part of a portfolio but not as a unique skill. I think we produce our own real estate. Dick

Page 74 of 84

sources the own -- our own assets. We source our own mortgages. So those are assets
where I can look my shareholders in the eye and say, look, you're doing something with
your money because I'm sourcing an asset that you can't probably source yourselves. Or
you have to be a real good owner. Infrastructure debt is in the current solvency treatment.
We're a relatively good owner for that because there's some subsidy from EIOPA to
holding that. So you see that at this point in time, that perspective and valuations
coincide. So that's actually where we want to grow our business. We're not so much as the
others in the path of loading up on illiquid asset or doing bank loans. If you go to that
market, I'd be very hesitant to add anything that is like single B private equity-backed
covenant light loans. Even if yields are high, that's a segment that we don't want to be in
from a risk perspective and a return on capital perspective. So I think it's Dutch
mortgages, it's real estate, it's infrastructure where we think there is value to be added.
Other class assets, we're going to be a bit restrained. On your question IFRS 17, that's a
very good point. I mean the issue is that reality doesn't change because of IFRS 17. It's
almost like you're starting to measure temperature from Celsius into Fahrenheit but then
present it in Sanskrit. So nobody knows what it's going to look like. But it's going to be a
funny number. So what it's actually going to be, we don't know. I think the level or at least
development of earnings in IFRS 17 will be more similar, more akin to Solvency II. So
today, you can have situation where your cap gen goes up, earnings go down or the other
way around. I think the direction of earnings will be similar. The point is I have no hard
number today that I can base my payout on, right. If you divide EUR 230 million by the
IFRS 17 earnings, that might be 10%, might be 90%, I don't know what the payout ratio is.
So I guess the safest thing for us to do is to gradually shift towards a Solvency II cap genbased payout ratio because that's a number I can grab. I will have an audit trail by that
time. And now honestly, we need to see what that Sanskrit Fahrenheit number looks like
when we get there. And I guess at that point in time, the direction of earnings, it will give
probably similar messages, similar direction as the solvency ratio. That's a good part of it.

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Okay. Hadley?

Q - Hadley Cohen

{BIO 18331131 <GO>}

Hadley Cohen from Deutsche Bank. Question for Dick, please, ﬁrst. On your retail fund,
how are you thinking about that on a medium to longer term sort of view? I mean I guess I
get the point that it's a very high-quality asset. But ultimately, the retail model is changing,
right? People are shopping online and what have you. And you're seeing it in the U.K.,
particularly that high-street stores are closing down and the value of U.K. retail REITs is
reducing. How are you -- ultimately, the high street needs to evolve, I guess, to become
more food and entertainment orientated. How are you thinking about that with regards to
your portfolio going forward? Then, I guess, linked to Johnny's question on IFRS 17, for
Patrick or Chris. But the -- one of the main proﬁt measures, targets that you've given to us
today is the ROE target and you've had an ROE target since IPO eﬀectively. How
important is that really? Because I guess under IFRS 17, you're going to have to get rid of
the amortization and the realized gain reserve, which is about 40% of your operating
proﬁt. And I guess is -- do you think that there is enough ﬂexibility within IFRS 17 to be
able to fully oﬀset that? Does it matter? But if not, presumably your ROE goes down. So
optically it looks a lot lower. But as you said, economically it doesn't change anything. But
how are you thinking about all that? Does it really matter?

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Okay. Dick, ﬁrst question.

FINAL

A - Dick Gort

{BIO 16118720 <GO>}

Yes. Well I think, of course, there's a lot of doubts about retail internationally. And
especially if you look to the U.K., you see some diﬃculties with retail companies. I think in
the Netherlands, if you look to the retail market, it's very depending on which kind of
retail you're focusing. So we are focusing on the high -- on the retail on the high street.
But on the best high street locations of the Netherlands because there are a lot of high
street locations in diﬀerent cities which we are not investing in. So we are only investing in
the top 20 cities. And what we have seen over the last years, even during the crisis, that
the valuations of those locations went up. So we're very selective on it. So we are in the
inner city of Amsterdam, the inner city of Utrecht, inner city of Rotterdam. So we're very
speciﬁc in where we invest. So I think if you select on the right place, the retail market is
doing very well. And still retailers are ﬁghting to get in our retail units. And I agree with
you that in retail locations, you see much more blurring with the food and beverages. We
see it also in the high street. So it -- I think it gives something extra to the high street
market. So retailers want to invest in those places where it's very busy and crowded. And
that is in the best high street locations.

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Okay. Then second question, Chris? I think it's the...

Bloomberg Transcript

A - H. C. Figee
Yes, let me start. And Patrick, you complement. It's -- when you move from IFRS 4 to IFRS
17, we will lose the contribution from shadow accounting to our reported earnings. We'll
get something back in return, which is the release of CSM. So the CSM amortization will
go to P&L. That isn't there today. And by luck or by skill, I think we have a number of
portfolios that will have -- that are likely to have a CSM that can be amortized. I mean
funeral has a signiﬁcant CSM relative to fulﬁllment cash ﬂows. Individual Life and disability
have signiﬁcant CSM relative to fulﬁllment cash ﬂows. So I think we will lose shadow
accounting contribution, you get see CSM in return. And comparatively speaking, our
CSM qualifying portfolio. So the non-DB side of a.s.r., is relatively large compared to the
industry. So I think that will look relatively well. And it's all optics. I mean, it is -- obviously,
it's optics. But the CSM contribution will be good. What will the ROE be? I don't know.
Personally, I think you go back almost to the embedded value time where people look
like, what's the delta EV? So the new -- I'm talking abbreviations here. But the new ROE is
like the delta equity. And your delta equity could be the next metric people will follow.
The one thing that you need to be mindful that the amount of equity you hold is a
function of discount rate you choose for your fulﬁllment cash ﬂows. So that's something
where companies have a fair degree of freedom to steer. So I guess the challenge for us
and for you will be to ﬁgure out, is there a comparable level of discount rate, what's the
equity and can we harmonize it and then what's the delta equity that people will generate.
But I would presume that delta equity or a percentage growth in equity is the new ROE in
that time frame. Patrick, do you want to add to that?

FINAL

A - Patrick Klijnsmit
Yes. I think in terms of the number of the ROE, Chris talked a little bit about the R. But
there's also the E. And we implement IFRS 9 at the same time. And the equity there
probably goes up a little bit simply because we now have quite some investments, which
are on amortized costs. And well, they will get some added value. Of course we also had
the impact, as you saw of the liabilities going up. So I'm not quite sure what the equity will
do. That's an unknown as well. So with that, you end up with a question, does it really
matter? Now it is a new base point. And from there on, we'll see what happens.

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Okay. Can we have, ﬁrst, Farquhar, please?

Q - Farquhar Charles Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Farquhar Murray, Autonomous Research. Just a couple of questions ﬁrstly to Dick. I think
on Slide 135 of your presentation, you were kind of showing revenues, investments under
management within the AuM business. I mean on the third party side it's obviously rising.
But on the fees revenue side, we weren't really seeing fee income improving. Is that just -obviously, the numbers are slightly small. Is that just noise? Or is there a kind of genuine
fee pressure in that slide? Then just secondly, on the EUR 1.7 billion on retail, just to follow
up Hadley's question, how much of that is very clearly in a city prime exposure and how
much is obviously potentially secondary-type locations? Then a quick one just to Jack. On
the mortgage market, obviously, you're saying 140 to 180 basis points is attractive. Can I
just ask what level of margin would be unattractive? And also what kind of volume
aspirations would you have from here?

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Okay. Start with Dick.

A - Dick Gort

{BIO 16118720 <GO>}

Yes, okay. If I understand your question correctly, you were talking about fee pressure on
the slide?

Q - Farquhar Charles Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

On the third-party AuM. It looks like -- on the third-party AuM, it's like, it's about EUR 10
million for three years. And obviously, AuM is going up a little bit. It could be noise. Or is
it fee pressure?

A - Dick Gort

{BIO 16118720 <GO>}

No. I don't understand exactly what you mean.

Q - Farquhar Charles Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

So I think if you look at Slide 135, you're showing revenues by third parties. And it's about
EUR 10 million, EUR 11 million each year for last three years, I think. And at the same time,
obviously, third-party AuM is actually going up. So it feels like maybe there's possibly
Page 77 of 84



Company Name: ASR Nederland NV
Company Ticker: ASRNL NA Equity
Date: 2018-10-10

some fee pressure. But the numbers are obviously in the range that it could be a bit of a
noise. I'm just trying to understand, is there fee pressure in that picture?

A - Dick Gort

{BIO 16118720 <GO>}

FINAL

No. There is no fee pressure because our fees are linked to the assets under
management. So there's a direct correlation with it.

Q - Farquhar Charles Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Okay. So why has the revenue number not gone up then?

A - Dick Gort

{BIO 16118720 <GO>}

Well I think we are also selling assets as well because we want to be very -- on top of the
market. And if we foresee, for example, in the retail market that we have an asset we don't
want to have anymore, we sell it. The assets under management go down and our fee
goes down as well. So it's -- there's a direct correlation with it. The second question you
had about retail was which amount of assets is invested in those high street locations?

Q - Farquhar Charles Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think just try and play it straightly. I mean you've got EUR 1.7 billion at retail. And I'm just - you're obviously saying it's all kind of lovely inner cities that are wonderful. I'm just trying
to get a sense, can you be a little bit speciﬁc about how much of that is obviously genuine
prime retail in inner cities, which I think we'd all agree they're probably pretty solid versus
kind of second relocations where maybe we've got legitimate concerns?

A - Dick Gort

{BIO 16118720 <GO>}

Yes, yes, yes. Okay. So 2/3 of the Dutch Prime Retail fund is invested in those high street
locations, in those 20 -- top 20 cities. So about 95% of high street is located in those top
20 cities. And 1/3 of the assets under management within the fund are invested in district
shopping centers. So convenience shopping centers like supermarkets and small shops
around it. But the core of the -- those investments are supermarkets, yes.

A - Jack Julicher

{BIO 5943222 <GO>}

Yes. Then the question on mortgages, at what level it wouldn't be attractive, what we do is
we use cost price model. So that means that we calculate for the credit risk, that we
calculate for the capital consumption, that we calculate for the options that are in the
mortgage product. But a main indicator would be the remuneration for illiquidity risk. And
as I said, it is now between 40 and 70. I would give it a very close glance at the moment
that we would be at levels of 20 to 40. Then what you are asking with respect to volumes,
yes, we target on total production volumes of EUR 2 billion to EUR 2.5 billion in total for
the insurance companies and for external parties. And in general, you can say you need
for external parties EUR 1 billion to EUR 1.5 billion. That is what we target for the coming
years.

A - Michel HÃ¼lters

Okay. Can we have Benoit?

FINAL

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

Benoit Petrarque from Kepler Cheuvreux. Two questions on the asset management, one
on the real estate. So on the asset management, could you -- on the EUR 20 million target,
could you come back on the earnings model behind the improvement of your purchasing
results? I was thinking about guidance on inﬂows -- third-party inﬂows, fee margin
expected. And also on the cost side, do you expect also costs to improve? And the
second question on asset management was around the, I think you have EUR 8.2 billion of
balanced funds in your third-party AuMs. How much of that is linked to the unit linked
individual life book? Is that included? And do you expect some runoﬀ from that? Then the
last one was on the Slide 131, on the rural portfolio. If I do the math correctly, you value
your rural portfolio at EUR 4 per square meter. I mean just doing the math on the Slide 131,
you generate 2% yield. It's probably linked to the price you get from the -- on the lands.
But how much capital gains do you make on the top of the kind of 2.2% yield every year?
For sure, when the third parties want to develop, you get a nice price for that. So how
much cap gains you do on -- through the cycle every year on the top of the 2.2%?

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
First question is on for you, Jack.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jack Julicher

{BIO 5943222 <GO>}

Yes. The percentage unit linked and, yes, all kinds of policies of the insurance there, that is
31%. And yes, the model behind the EUR 20 million, you can say we have diﬀerent ﬂows
of assets. So we have the in-sourced assets. We have the balanced mandates and the ESG
funds. And in general the expected fees are between 15 and 18 basis points. And yes,
depends on the costs, how we manage at the cost side. We expect that we can leverage
upon the scale of the insurance companies in the sense that we have an organization that
has a scale. So that means that, yes, we expect -- that we are able to do that with a fairly
stable cost base.

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

And the inﬂows in (DMs), how much would that be?

A - Jack Julicher

{BIO 5943222 <GO>}

That depends. That is -- but I explained was one main part are the mortgages. So EUR 1
billion to EUR 1.5 billion. And we expect, let's say, EUR 0.5 billion to EUR 1 billion in other
mandates, balanced mandates, et cetera.

A - H. C. Figee
I think, Benoit, it's fair to assume that the business model of the asset management
functions and real estate, it's all about fees are stable and expand your assets under
management. And the AuM is more a function of how many interesting objects you can
acquire. I think there is quite a pipeline of investors that have either committed capital or
are wanting to commit capital. And the bottleneck really is can you ﬁnd things that you
Page 79 of 84



FINAL

Company Name: ASR Nederland NV
Company Ticker: ASRNL NA Equity
Date: 2018-10-10

want to invest in, that you want to hold in your fund? So but as there are a lot, you're
growing your AuM base by acquiring attractive new buildings, locations, et cetera. So in
real estate, it's all about AuM. So the growth in real estate earnings is really growth in
AuM. And the cost base is reasonably ﬂexible. But again real estate is a business where -- I
don't mind running a slightly higher cost base in real estate because it's such a highmargin, high-value-add business. So in real estate, it's not such a scalable business but
the AuM that comes in gives you good margins. On the -- on Jack's business, on the
capital markets asset management business, I think there will be a -- I wouldn't be
surprised if there's slight margin pressure on some of the products, simply on the
mortgage business. There are multiple mortgage funds out there. I think we have a
successful one we've grown signiﬁcantly. But I wouldn't surprise there would be some
small margin pressure on the mortgage funds. But in earnings rise, AuM will allow us to
grow that business. So that's a scalable business. So adding another billion of mortgages
doesn't require a single more -- additional FTEs. So it's a scalable business. Some toplevel margin pressure. But then cost scalability, which can be exacerbated by in-sourcing
some assets that are done by third parties we're going to bring back home.

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Okay. Then the question on the rural portfolio and the returns.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dick Gort

{BIO 16118720 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. Well the EUR 4 per square meter is about right. It's a good math. I think
that's the -- more or less the agricultural value for land on average. Our focus within the
portfolio is to rent the land to farmers. So that is our main focus. And due to the fact that
our portfolio is very large, we are sometimes lucky when something special happens,
somebody wants to buy it or government needs it for something. So overall, there are
some moments in time that we've been very lucky. But overall, we focus on lending the
land to farmers for a long period of time. And we want to be very trustworthy on that. The
direct return is about 2.5% over the last 15 years. And the total return has been 9%. So
there's -- a part of it is capital appreciation on top those moments of luck we had. But I
don't know by heart which -- what the amount is exactly.

A - H. C. Figee
But the land is really not held to develop. It's farmland. So if someone wants to develop it,
that's -- you stumble into it. But we don't acquire land with the purpose of redeveloping.
It's really -- it's a rural agricultural business. So our clients are farmers, actually. And so I
think the price appreciation is when farmers want to expand, they want to grow their farm
and buy land or trade land. Then there is land scarcity, that's actually what causes a
gradual uplift in value. It's not a development play.

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

Because you assume a 300 bps excess return on your real estate. So I mean it's quite low
versus what you could expect in a normal real estate. But it's probably linked to this
relatively low return you make on your lands, right?

A - H. C. Figee

FINAL

Well 2 things. First, the non-land business has a 4% to 5% direct return still, right,
excluding capital gains. So the non-land, the oﬃce are highest and residential houses are
lowest and retail is in the middle. So the non-land business has a 4% to 5% in direct
return. The land business has a 2.5% return. But historically, as Dick said, we've been
delivering 9% total return over how long a period?

A - Dick Gort

{BIO 16118720 <GO>}

15 years. (Or it can be longer).

A - H. C. Figee
15 years. The -- there is no sign that -- I can't predict whether it's going to be 9% or not.
But there is still suﬃcient comfort that there's value appreciation of land, maybe not 9%.
But there is -- we deﬁnitely made more than 2.5% because the history and the trends in
the farm market is such, in the agricultural market are such that are still looking -- people
are still looking for land.

A - Michel HÃ¼lters
Okay. Before we â€“ yes, I know, Farooq. So before go over to Jos for a wrap-up, time for
one ﬁnal question. Farooq, you've been holding up your hand for quite a while already.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Philippe, can you just say a little bit about the Individual Life service book? Because
you've got a lot of customers, maybe some of them you often not talk to a lot. What
solutions do you have? Or what are you thinking about in terms of retaining those
customers? I was wondering if that's something you could possibly comment on. Then the
second question for Jack, about infrastructure. I mean, you seem to be doing some. But
your focus is elsewhere. But it's also very attractive under Solvency II. So I'm thinking, why
not more? Is it because you're happy with your mortgages and your real estate business?
Is it because it's just not available in the Netherlands to the extent you want with duration?
If you could comment on that, that'd be quite useful.

A - Philippe Wits
Yes. So on the life service book, how do we retain customers? That was your question?

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Yes, because obviously (inaudible) you hold the money and (a do-it conclusion) might be
a good way.

A - Philippe Wits
Yes, no, absolutely. So one of the things we're doing. And that is also the reason why the
chatbots or the voicebots is there, is to actually take out all kinds of stuﬀ which customers
can actually handle online. And where it actually comes to surrender, I mean I don't think
you want surrenders or conversation with customers to be handled by chatbots and a
straight-through process customers in and out of the door. So actually, what we are doing

is we're actually building there, one, we're actually using big data to actually assess and
see whether we can predict when customers are actually surrendering. And actually, it's -you can already predict a couple of months ahead, actually. That's one. And second, we
want these customers to be able to talk to our customer agents to have that human
interaction and actually to assess whether they are be able -- enable them to live in the
product or give them a better product, as Karin was explaining, for example, in unit
linked. I mean sometimes it's better that a customer surrenders into another product. So
those are just 2 examples on how we are thinking about it and what we're doing.

Yes. Yes. We look to all asset classes. So that means that infrastructure debt is one of
them. But as I mentioned, there are also others. And when you look to speciﬁc
infrastructure, what is important to know is that the duration is often very long. So that's
also why it ﬁts with the balance sheet of an insurer. But that means that nevertheless, the
fact that it's a preferential treatment under Solvency II, still the solvency charge is relatively
high. So you need a substantial margin. And what we see in the big infrastructure
projects, that there is a compression with margins. So then you don't need that hurdle for
return on equity. So but where the sweet spot is in the somewhat medium-sized projects.
And there is a sweet spot. And that's the spot we are looking at.

Because you have to look very hard. If you go to the -- you do the European landscape of
infrastructure funds, the bulk of it is in the U.K. I mean the U.K. had to develop
infrastructure market or the U.S. And given all developments on Brexit, we don't want to
be overexposed to the U.K. infrastructure market. So you'd be looking for Eurozone
infrastructure product. Unfortunately, everybody else is, too. So margins are relatively thin.
There are attractive funds out there or attractive solutions out there. But you need to work
very hard to be very selective. Because you just go blind into an infrastructure solution,
you get to what Jack says, lower-yielding funds and the lender actually exploits your
capital charge and he takes all the beneﬁt by paying a very low yield. So we are looking
for Eurozone infrastructure product and be very selective. And you look for very speciﬁc
partners, often in the smaller size or very niche markets to get the infrastructure product
that gives you the yield that you want. Unfortunately, it's hard to deploy EUR 2 billion. You
have to kind of collect and gather mandates every day, slowly but surely. So it's a function
of how eﬀectively can you deploy the money in Eurozone infrastructure at an attractive
rate. But for example, we've got one of the big reinsurance in Europe has decided to turn
its reinsurance engineering skills into an infrastructure fund, which we like a lot. We know
bridges. We know toll roads. We reinsure these all the time. So we can also build an
infrastructure fund and open that fund for reinsurance clients. Well that's a great solution.
So there you partner with someone you know very well. And you've got more or less
proprietary access to infrastructure fund. So that's the type of solutions we look for rather
than pursuing just the ninth or tenth whatever investment bank infrastructure fund. That's
actually not very attractive.

Then the wrap-up for Jos. So.

A - Jos P. M. Baeten

So ladies and gentlemen, some ﬁnal words on hopefully what was for all of you an
interesting and, at least for us, what was an exciting day. We were very proud that we were
able to present a.s.r. to you in the way as we did it today. We delivered over the past 2.5
years what we have promised to our investors and even more since the IPO in 2016. We
will continue on our journey going forwards. And we will continue to aim a delivery of our
new today announced ambitious targets for the next three years. We hope investors here
and on the webcast stay with us to have this journey together with us going forward.
And in a nutshell, what you have heard today is you will keep a.s.r. as it is with upped
targets in terms of return on equity, with upped targets in terms of OCC delivery. And on
top of that, organic growth, proﬁtable organic growth in nonlife, opportunities in
consolidation of the life business and potentially some opportunities in the nonlife
business also, a position -- so a position as consolidator for the life market, a stable fee
generative business and a growing fee business in the asset management and in the real
estate. And we have positioned ourselves today as the provider of sustainable
employability needs increase, especially in the self-employed markets. And I hope we
also have given you the proof that we will be able to deliver this going forward, whether it
is through our excellent business performance, our capital management expertise, the
way we deal with innovation and digitalization, our unique asset management capabilities
and last but not least, the way we are able to onboard regulatory changes.
So having said that, this concludes our ﬁrst Capital Markets Day. Thank you for being with
us, also to people that were, during the whole day, following us on the webcast, over 200
people were with us and are with us until now. So that's quite a success. We have
appreciated all your questions. We like dialogue. My personal belief is real gold shouldn't
fear the melting pot. So going forward, keep asking questions to us. It keeps us sharp and
it helps us to be on top of the delivery.
You're all invited to join us for drinks. And hopefully, we will be able to get some feedback
from you, how you enjoyed or not enjoyed our ﬁrst Capital Markets Day. Thank you very
much.
