{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Let me start by saying, we've been
through one of the most turbulent years in recent history, which has been shaped by
extraordinary set of circumstances, including the worst pandemic in more than 100 years
and in its way devastating economic and emotional fallout. A collective reckoning with
racial inequality that continues to challenge America, and the increasingly vivid reminders
that our climate is changing.
Despite these challenges, The Hartford continued to deliver strong results with core
earnings of $636 million or $1.76 per diluted share for the fourth quarter and a trailing 12month core earnings ROE of 12.7%. For the year, core earnings were $2.1 billion or $5.78
per diluted share and book value per diluted share excluding AOCI was $47.16, up 8%
from 2019.
The Hartford's performance reflects the strength of our businesses, our execution on
strategic priorities and build a solid foundation for our Company's future sustainable
success. I want to thank all my colleagues across The Hartford. I am incredibly proud of the
resiliency demonstrated by our employees, and their commitment to our stakeholders
during this unusual time, while balancing the demands of work and family.
Now turning to the business and 2021 outlook. Property and Casualty underlying -underwriting results significantly improved in both the fourth quarter and for the full-year
2020, with strong performances in both commercial and personal lines. Excluding the
impact of COVID, commercial lines underlying margins expanded by 6.5 points in the
fourth quarter and 1.6 points in 2020, with improvement coming from all businesses.
These results were in-line or better than the guidance we provided a year-ago, and were
driven by higher pricing, adherence to our underwriting disciplines and operating
efficiencies.

FINAL

In commercial lines, pricing momentum continues across nearly all lines excluding workers'
compensation. And we expect pricing increases to continue as additional rate is needed
to offset pressure from social inflation, more frequent catastrophe events and the
persistent low interest rate environment. In commercial lines, our teams are executing
strongly on a number of fronts. In Global Specialty, the strategic transaction to acquire
Navigators is on track. The integration is proceeding well and it is providing us with
expanded product breadth in Middle-Market and Global Specialty.
In 2020, we've met our goal of improving financial performance in the business compared
to the second-half of 2019, and the acquisition was well timed from a market perspective.
Small Commercial results remain excellent, we continue to strengthen our competitive
advantages in market leadership position. The launch earlier in the year of our new
business owners policy, raised the bar for customer experience in buying and managing
coverage. Going forward, we've a robust strategy to grow through product innovation and
we will continue to invest to maintain our industry-leading digital experience. I'm excited
about what we'll continue to accomplish in this business.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Middle and Large Commercial, we completed year-one of a three-year plan to
transform the underwriting process, provide a differentiated customer experience and
grow our specialized verticals. In the fourth quarter, underlying margins improved by 4.4
points, compared to prior-year, primarily due to lower expense ratio. In addition, our
broader and deeper product set and enhanced analytics will drive further growth and
improved margins.
Moving to Personal Lines, underlying margins improved in both the fourth quarter and the
year, benefiting from continued favorable auto frequency, lower non-CAT incurred
property losses and reduced expenses. In 2020, we extended our AARP relationship with
a new contract that runs through the end of 2032, solidifying our unique value proposition
for the 50 and over demographic. We are also investing in a new digital platform to
administer and market our products. Doug will provide more detail, and I'm excited about
the new auto and home products, we will launch in the next six months.
So in summary for P&C, 2020 performance was strong, despite challenges of the
pandemic and COVID losses. In 2021, we expect continued modest COVID losses in
workers' compensation and financial lines. And while we are encouraged that the vaccine
roll-out has begun, we're learning it will take more time than initially projected to achieve
protection across the broader population. With this outlook, we are expecting our
Commercial Lines, underlying combined ratio, excluding the impact of COVID in both
years to improve by approximately 3 points from 2020 results to a range of 88.5 to 90.5.
The margin expansion alone is significant, when coupled with our business mix, it is an
ambitious but achievable outcome. In Personal Lines, our outlook for 2021 incorporates an
assumption that driving patterns begin to return to more normal levels and property
results are more in-line with historical trends. The result is an expected underlying
combined ratio in the range of 87 to 89.

FINAL

I am very bullish about our growth potential and expect to increase our top-line, at a
faster rate than we have experienced over the past five years. While some of this growth
reflects a positive pricing environment, we see the increasing opportunity to utilize our
brand, people, enhanced underwriting capabilities and excellence in customer service to
capture market share.
Before moving to group benefits, I want to briefly comment upon the business
interruption lawsuits, brought against The Hartford and the industry. While we're
extremely sympathetic to the difficulties faced by our insureds, in all businesses dealing
with the pandemic, the claims against us are outside the scope of our policies.
All of our property policy is subject to litigation, plainly require direct physical loss or
damage to trigger coverage, and the COVID-19 virus clearly does not cause such loss or
damage. Although, it is still early in the lifecycle of some of these cases, we're pleased
with the overwhelming majority of decisions to date by federal and state courts across
the country has held in favor of the insurance carriers and recognized that the presence of
the virus does not meet the direct physical loss or damage trigger for coverage.

Bloomberg Transcript

Given the number of lawsuits, it is not surprising that some initial rulings have gone against
the industry, where appropriate these cases have been or will likely be appealed and I'm
confident, Appellate Courts will properly consider the growing body of precedent in favor
of the industry. Nevertheless, a few unfavorable trial court rulings does not change our
view of this exposure or the strength of our coverage arguments, we remain highly
confident in our contract language and coverage positions.
Finally there has been some commentary about the number of lawsuits filed against The
Hartford versus other industry players. We do not believe simply comparing the number
of lawsuits is a useful way to assess exposure. A more appropriate way is to analyze
coverage defenses, eliminate profiles, portfolio mix and other variables. Since the initial
outside wave of lawsuits against the Company, the pace of new cases against The
Hartford, has slowed significantly and is now in-line with peers.
In the meantime, pending case counts against us have been reduced by approximately
25% to-date, through a combination of motions and withdrawals. Turning to Group
Benefits. Core earnings were down in both the fourth quarter and full-year, as we
experienced excess mortality rates, which we believe is attributable to the ongoing
impacts of the pandemic. Obviously, mortality has been impacted by thus directly
attributable to COVID, but there is also an indirect effect which is most likely the result of
patients deferring regular treatments for chronic conditions or individuals tolerating
warning signs of a health problem for too long before seeking care. All caused excess
mortality amounted to $152 million before tax in the quarter and included $22 million of
claims related to prior quarters.
The full-year impact of excess mortality was $239 million, which reduced our full year core
earnings margin by 3.1 points to 6.4%. In disability, our fourth quarter loss ratio was 65.1%,
was 3.1 points higher than prior year, as the fourth quarter of 2019 results included higher

Page 4 of 23

FINAL

favorable prior-year development. For the full-year 2020, the loss ratio improved by 1.2
points to 66.1%, benefiting from strong recoveries into a lesser extent favorable incidents.
On the top-line, the fully insured ongoing premiums were down 2% in the quarter and for
the full-year, as our clients responded to the pandemic driven economic pressures by
reducing their workforce in associated payrolls. 2020 fully insured ongoing sales driven by
strong national accounts were up a 11% to $717 million and persistency was slightly
favorable at approximately 89%. Sales are off to a solid start in 2021, with 1, January
effective date of sales exceeding prior year by more than 10%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Looking into 2021, we expect the Group Benefits marketplace to remain dynamic, as
digital transformation, product innovation and customer demands accelerate. Our
competitive advantages and future investment roadmap will strengthen our market
leadership. That said, many questions still surround the pandemic and its effect on
mortality and the economy. Therefore, we are basing our loss picks heavily on total
mortality trends in the near-term, rather than trying to isolate COVID-related deaths only.
Based on historical mortality expectations, excluding any pandemic related effects, we
expect the core earnings margin to be between 6% and 7%. The decrease in expected
margin from 2020, actual ex-COVID results, primarily relates to lower expected favorable
prior period development on LTD reserves and life waiver claims and lower net
investment income.
Taking into account the uncertainties surrounding the mortality impacts of the pandemic,
we expect core earnings margins to be reduced by 2.3 points given the continued higher
rates of all cause excess mortality. Actual mortality rates will be impacted by the vaccine
roll-out pace, mutations of the virus in the broader population, returning to more routine
medical care. In addition, we expect to a much smaller degree, elevated short-term
disability claims compared to historic norms. Lastly, we expect these higher mortality in
short-term disability claims to impact our results predominantly in the first-half of 2021.
As we close the books on 2020, I'm optimistic about the future. At The Hartford,
underwriting human achievement is at the heart of what we do. We are committed to
making a sustainable and positive impact on society, as an essential element of our
ongoing success. Across The Hartford, we're making this happen by always doing the
right thing, fostering a workplace where everyone is welcome and respected, using our
resources and influence to help mitigate the challenge of changing climate patterns and
helping to make our communities, where we live and work be safer and more successful,
which has never been as important as it is today. Heading into 2021, I am confident in our
business portfolio, people and our strategy to deliver value for all our stakeholders.
Now I'll turn the call over to Doug.

Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. As Chris referenced, 2020 was an
unprecedented year for Property and Casualty industry, and The Hartford. The global

Page 5 of 23

pandemic and civil unrest losses, significantly contributed to the challenges presented to
our customers we serve, along with our broker and agency partners.

FINAL

Our employees deserve a huge thank you for their tireless efforts throughout this difficult
year, tackling every obstacle that came their way. Despite the challenges, I was quite
pleased with our overall performance. Property and Casualty underlying margins improved
by just over 1 point in 2020, and written premiums grew 3%.
During the year we also made substantial progress on a number of key business
initiatives. In Small Commercial, despite COVID charges and expected margin
compression from workers' compensation, we continue to outperform with another sub90 underlying combined ratio. During the last four months of the year, new business from
Spectrum, The Hartford's industry-leading package product achieved record levels.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Middle and Large Commercial, 2020 was the first-year of our underwriting
transformation journey, intended to address profitability, efficiency and customer
experience. Strong pricing and underwriting actions have driven improved profitability in
the core book. In addition, investments in technology and data, are paying-off for
underwriters and distribution partners. Our pace has accelerated, quote turnaround time
by 5 days, which equates to about 25%, while simultaneously improving the underwriting
experience and effectiveness.
In Global Specialty, we are nearing two years, since the Navigators acquisition closed, and
are poised to exceed core earnings and new business goals. Underlying financial results
are improving, driven by exceptional pricing and book reshaping. Continued progress to
deepen relationships with retail distribution partners, has delivered an additional $134
million of new premium, across Commercial Lines that would not have been possible prior
to the acquisition.
Finally in Personal Lines, we renewed the AARP contract to 2032 and we will be launching
a brand new auto product with improved digital capabilities by April. Homeowners will be
launched in the summer, with both products in a number of states by year-end. Underlying
results were extremely strong, driven largely by the pandemics impact on driving miles,
while new business remains below expectations.
Let me now pivot to summarize our financial performance for 2020 and then I will
conclude with some thoughts about 2021. Property and Casualty core earnings were $1.7
billion for the year, with a combined ratio of 96.4. This includes COVID-losses of $278
million or 2.3 points and current accident year catastrophe losses of $606 million or 5.1
points.
Excluding COVID losses, each business reported underlying margin improvement for the
year and significant improvement in the fourth quarter, much of which was driven by a
lower expense ratio. COVID losses in the quarter were $28 million, including $14 million for
both workers' compensation and financial lines. The workers' compensation charge
includes the benefit from the pandemic related favorable frequency.

FINAL

Turning to CATs. We incurred $55 million in the quarter, primarily from hurricanes and
convective storms, well within our expectations. Net favorable prior year development for
the year was $136 million or 1.1 points. In the fourth quarter, we reported $184 million or 6.1
points of net unfavorable prior year development which Beth will cover in her remarks.
Turning now to our business line results. The Commercial Lines underlying combined ratio
was 95.5 for the year, improving 1.6 points from 2019, when COVID losses are excluded.
The margin improvement was driven primarily by favorable non-CAT property results, and
a lower expense ratio, partially offset by continued margin compression in small workers'
compensation. A few words on pricing. US commercial lines, renewal written pricing
excluding workers' compensation was approximately 11% for the quarter, an excellent
result and consistent with the third quarter.
Middle Market renewal written pricing in the US, excluding workers' compensation
increased 10.4% for the year, nearly doubling 2019s result. In the fourth quarter, the
written price increase was stable at 10.3%. Property and general liability pricing remains
firm in the high single-digits, while auto held steady in the low double-digits. In Global
Specially, US pricing in the quarter was a robust 19.2%, generally consistent with thirdquarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

The US wholesale book achieved 25 points also in-line with quarter three. Excess pricing is
in the mid 30s, while Property Lines are persisting in the low 20s and auto has moved into
the mid-teens. Pricing gains in the international portfolio remains solid, with improved
results in marine and a very strong professional lines pricing.
Small and middle market workers' compensation pricing in the quarter, while still negative
increased 60 basis points from the third quarter, driven by favorable ratings in a few
states. Overall, I am very pleased with how effectively our team has balanced the impact
of the pandemic, account pricing and profitability improvements in 2020.
Let me share a few more details on the businesses starting with Commercial. Small
Commercial had another very strong year. The underlying combined ratio was 89.2% for
the year, 1 point better than prior year when COVID losses are excluded. Lower non-CAT
property losses and a favorable expense ratio were partially offset by workers'
compensation margin compression. Total Small, Commercial written premium declined
3% for the year. After a challenging second quarter due to the economic shutdown,
written premium in the last six months was essentially flat to prior year.
In the fourth quarter, new business results were strong and policy retention return to
historical levels. Our premium retention in the second half of the year was unfavorably
impacted by lower premium audits and endorsements of approximately 4 points to 5
points, due to lower payrolls. Fourth quarter new business of $153 million was up 11%
versus prior year. Our Spectrum product is driving this growth and I am very encouraged
by the improved business momentum.
Moving to Middle and Large Commercial, we posted an underlying combined ratio of
100.9% for the year, 2.5 points better than prior year after excluding COVID losses. A

favorable expense ratio and lower non-CAT property losses, drove the margin
improvement. Total written premium declined by 3% for the full year. New business in
Middle Market was down 18% versus 2019. However, new business premium in the fourth
quarter was up 2%. Quotes, quote ratio and hit ratio in the guaranteed cost book for the
fourth quarter were all better than 2019 levels. 2020 premium retention declined 7 points
versus 2019, driven by underwriting actions and lower exposures in workers'
compensation. Through this underwriting discipline, we start 2021 with much improved
financial performance.
In Global Specially, the underlying combined ratio was 98.3% for the full year, 2.5 points
better than prior year after excluding COVID losses. We continue to be pleased with the
margin expansion in Global Specialty. Excluding the impact of COVID, we have seen
approximately 5 points of improvement from the second half of 2019, almost entirely
coming from the Navigators book with particularly strong results in US wholesale and
Global Reinsurance, combined with a lower expense ratio. Global Specialty written
premium for the fourth quarter was up 9% versus prior year. Top-line growth was driven
by significant favorable pricing, partially offset by slightly lower new business levels and
lower retentions, primarily in the international book due to our portfolio reshaping and
underwriting actions.
Shifting over to Personal Lines. Written premiums declined 6% for the year, 4% when
adjusting for the second quarter refund. Although new business levels were below
expectation, auto new business was up slightly versus prior year. Lower responses were
offset by a better conversion rate. We are excited about the launch of our new auto
product in April, with the countrywide rollout of both auto and home to occur over the
next two years.
Despite lower growth, underwriting results in 2020 were particularly strong. In Personal
Lines auto, the underlying combined ratio of 88%, was 9.9 points better than 2019.
Consistent with the industry, frequency ran well below prior year. During the fourth quarter
reduced frequency remain fairly stable with third quarter results. In home, the underlying
combined ratio for the year of 72.5%, was 5.8 points better than prior year, driven
predominantly by favorable non-CAT weather.
Before I turn things over to Beth, I would like to share a few thoughts about 2021. We
project the 2021 Commercial Lines underlying combined ratio between 90% and 92%.
This includes the COVID loss estimate of 1.5 points. The COVID estimate is approximately
two-thirds workers' compensation and one-thirds speciality lines.
Ex-COVID, we expect our 2021 underlying combined ratio at its midpoint to improve
nearly 3 points from 2020. Renewal written pricing and middle market is forecasted to
remain strong during 2021 and largely consistent with 2020 across most lines. We foresee
Global Specially renewal written rate increases to remain in the double-digits. Workers'
compensation pricing is projected to be largely consistent with 2020. In Personal Lines, we
expect driving miles to increase, as the vaccine rolls-out, particularly for our AARP book,
contributing to an underlying combined ratio of 87% to 89%.

FINAL

Reflecting back on 2020 in spite of all the challenges we faced, financial results were
quite strong for our Property and Casualty business units. We delivered year-over-year exCOVID margin improvement through disciplined underwriting, significant portfolio
reshaping and the start of Hartford Next, in every business. Given the incredible
challenges of 2020, I am extremely encouraged by the improving underwriting
performance. With underwriting actions largely behind us, we're now well-positioned to
improve our margins and pivot toward growth.
Our team is energized for the future and confident that we have the talent, tools and
teamwork to deliver. I look forward to updating you all on progress throughout the year.
Let me now turn the call over to Beth.

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Thank you, Doug. I am going to cover results for the investment portfolio, Hartford Funds
and corporate, provide an update on our capital management plans and discuss P&C
prior accident-year development, including the results of our Annual A&E study.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net investment income was $556 million for the quarter, up 11% from the prior-year
quarter. For the year, net investment income was $1.8 billion, down 5% from 2019, due to
lower reinvestment rates and lower yields on floating rate securities partially offset by a
higher level of invested assets, due in part to the acquisition of Navigators.
The total portfolio yield for the full year was 3.6% compared to 4.1% in 2019. During the
year, the average reinvestment rate was 2.5% compared with the sales and maturity yield
of 3.4%. The annualized limited partnership return was 32% for the fourth quarter, driven
by higher private equity valuations and distributions and the sale of two underlying real
estate properties, resulting in an LP income of $152 million before tax in the quarter.
For the year, the LP yield was 12.3%. Overall, the credit performance of our investment
portfolio remains very strong. Net unrealized gains on fixed maturities after tax increased
to $2.8 billion at December 31, from $2.4 billion at September 30th. Unrealized and
realized gains on equity securities was a gain of $55 million before tax in the quarter.
Turning to Hartford Funds. Core earnings for the quarter was $46 million, up 15% from the
prior year quarter. This is primarily due to an increase in fee income and lower
administrative expenses, including a reduction in state income taxes and travel expenses.
The increase in fee income, which is largely attributable to higher daily average Hartford
Funds AUM, was partially offset by a continued shift to lower fee generating funds.
Full year core earnings were up 12%, due to higher daily average assets and lower
expenses, including a first quarter reduction in consideration related to the latest
transaction of $12 million before tax. Long-term fund performance remains strong with
two-thirds of funds, beating peers on a five year basis. The Corporate core loss was $51
million for the quarter and $178 million for the year.

For the fourth quarter, the core loss is higher than the prior-year quarter, primarily due to
the impact of the Company's investment in Talcott Resolution. For the quarter, we
recorded $1 million pre-tax loss from Talcott compared to $21 million of income in the
fourth quarter of 2019. On January 20th, the consortium that owns Talcott announced, it
was being sold to a new group of investors. We will receive 9.7% of the proceeds in any
pre-closing dividends. We are very pleased with how this investment has performed, and
since we have been recording Talcott's results on the equity method, we do not expect
significant impacts to net income on closing.
In the quarter, we continue to execute on our Hartford next initiative. For the second half
of 2020, we recognized savings, before program costs at $106 million and we have
increased our estimate of 2021 savings to $350 million as we have been able to
accelerate some of our initiatives. Overall, we are on track to achieve annual operating
expense savings of approximately $500 million by 2022, reducing the P&C expense ratio
by 2 points to 2.5 points, the Group Benefits expense ratio by 1.5 to 2 points and the claim
expense ratio by approximately 0.5 points as compared to 2019 results.

As Doug mentioned, we recognized net prior year reserve strengthening of $184 million
before tax in the fourth quarter, which included several items. First, we completed our
annual asbestos and environmental reserve review. Before session to the adverse
development cover, we have in place, net reserves increased by $218 million comprised
of $127 million for asbestos liabilities and $91 million for environmental.
The $127 million increase in the asbestos reserves was primarily due to an increase in the
rate of asbestos claim settlements, as well as higher than previously estimated average
settlement values and defense cost. Overall, the number of asbestos claim filings in the
period covered by the 2020 study was roughly flat with the 2019 study. The $91 million
increase in environmental reserves was primarily due to an increasing number of DFAS
[ph] claims as well as higher remediation and legal defense costs.
Since the completion of the A&E study brought the cumulative losses ceded to the ADC,
to an amount in excess of the $650 million of ceded premium paid, the company
recognized a non-core earnings charge of $210 million representing a deferred gain on
retroactive reinsurance. The cumulative losses ceded to A&E -- ADC are currently $860
million, leaving $640 million of limit remaining.
Session [ph] to the Navigators adverse development cover were $5 million in the fourth
quarter, with $91 million of limit remaining. In the quarter, we increased reserves
associated with sexual molestation by $125 million, which is related to claims asserted
against the Boy Scouts of America. Offsetting these reserve increases, with favorable
development for prior year catastrophes of $116 million, primarily related to accident years
2017 to 2019, as well as favorable development in workers' compensation and package
business.
Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI, rose 8% for the year to $47.16 and our 2020
core earnings ROE was 12.7%. We ended 2020 with a debt and preferred stock
capitalization ratio, ex AOCI of 21.6%. Our goal is to keep debt leverage within the low to

mid 20% range. Turning to capital. As of December 31st, holding company resources
totaled $1.8 billion. As we look at 2021, we expect dividends from the operating
companies to total $850 million to $900 million for P&C, $250 million to $295 million for
Group Benefits and a $125 million to $150 million for Hartford Funds.
Yesterday we announced an 8% increase in our common quarterly dividend to $0.35 per
share. In December, we announced a new share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion,
effective January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2022. Although we have not had any
repurchase activity to-date, our expectation is to resume repurchases over the remaining
weeks of this quarter.
To wrap up, our businesses performed strongly in a challenging year. We are pleased to
see the benefit of our initiatives coming through in our results. As we managed the
pandemic and continue to execute across all of our businesses, we will generate further
improvement in our results and enhance value for all of our stakeholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Susan, so we can begin the Q&A session.

Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session.
(Operator Instructions) And our first question today comes from Elyse Greenspan from
Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, thanks, good morning. My first question is on your guidance for 2021, for commercial
P&C. Within that 3 points of underlying margin improvement ex-Covid could we get a
sense of what's embedded in their stemming from a loss versus the expense ratio. And
then also, are you assuming that margins will expand within small, middle, large and also
within specialty in 2021?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Elyse, let me tackle that question. The first point relative to the 3 points, roughly twothirds of that is coming through the loss area. So yes there is Hartford Next benefit in
there, it's about eight-tenths of a point. Second component, is that primarily the loss
improvement is coming from Middle Market and Global Specialty, so our businesses that

Page 11 of 23



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity

have been leveraged by the portfolio reshaping and the heavy pricing are driving
disproportionate amounts of that increase year-over-year.

FINAL

Small Commercial still very, very profitable, but they will feel a challenging workers' comp
environment again in '21, and we balance that as we put the complete plan together.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then if you thought about 2020, are there any like -- it seems like there was
some non-CAT weather, but for the most part it neutralize. So we're just kind of thinking
about the loss ratio improvement, that you mentioned the two-thirds, primarily coming
from the rate exceeding loss trend within the Middle & Specialty Book.

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

That's correct. Yeah, it was a pretty good property, non-CAT year for us. And I would say
that some of the compares had higher levels of that non-CAT weather activity in 2019. So
that drives some of the quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year change Elyse.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then my second question is on the capital side of things. You guys put,
it's a $1.5 billion buyback program in December. Obviously, you said you'll be back in the
market after earnings starting to buy back your stock. But how do we think about that
between the two years, is it market dependent, I know you gave us what [ph] dividend up
from the sub this year, but would you expect that to be even over the two years or is
there something else that we should out when you kind of work towards that buyback
program?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah, Elyse. It's Chris. I'll let Beth to add her point of view. But generally, we've been
proportional pro rata, with a lot of our buyback programs over a multiple-year period of
time. So philosophically, I don't see much different Beth, but what would you add?

A - Beth A. Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Yeah, I would agree with that. I mean we -- I think to -- how do you think about it on being
half and half, between the two years is a reasonable expectation. Again it's dependent on
a lot of factors and market conditions, but kind of going into how we think about
executing a plan like that. How I thought [ph] you think about it.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, thanks. So first question here for Christian, Doug, I'm just curious. As I look at your
guidance for Commercial Lines underlying, what is your assumption with respect to the
headwind from workers' comp margins in 2021. And on that topic, to what do you think is
going to happen with loss cost trends for workers' comp, as the economy reopens?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Well, it's a big question, Brian. First off, on the pricing side, as I mentioned in my script, we
expect the 2021 year to look largely consistent with 2020 from a pricing perspective.
We're seeing a bottoming of the workers' comp curve, but I still expect some downward
pressure, minus pressure in Small Commercial and Middle Market flat to maybe up a point
or two. So that's the pricing side of it. The loss trend piece is very complicated and we're
not going to go through a roll forward for everybody today. But essentially, the 2020-year
look so unlike any year, we've ever had before because of the pandemic.

Bloomberg Transcript

So as we complete 2020, obviously frequency has been very good shape and you're
seeing that come through our adjustments. But the flip side is we're watching carefully
severity. And so, we're watching durations or watching medical treatment, we're watching
the extended impacts of what may or may not happen with COVID victims. So we're
being careful with severity. We've moved our picks up a little bit in the 2020 accident year,
we've kept in there for '21.
But again, when we look through workers' comp, we look through these two years, we're
still on our long-term picks. We think over time this is the line it should run at 5 on the
severity side and flattish for frequency based on everything we see in the next few years.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great, thanks. And then the second question is, I'm just curious on your guidance with
respect to COVID-losses, particularly on the GB side. How should we think about the
timing of that coming through, I would think that first quarter, much higher, particularly for
the GB. And then just anticipating during the course of the year, it's like kind of the way,
we should think about things.

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah, Brian, I tried to say that in my prepared remarks, maybe it wasn't clear. But yeah, of
the $160 million of life COVID losses, I'd say 75% would be a good number for first
quarter.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

And what about with respect to the commercial lines?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah. Heavy first half depends on vaccines and rollouts. But yeah, I think we expect first
quarter to look similar to probably fourth quarter and then our hopes and optimism are

Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead
with your question.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks. I guess just a follow-up on the capital management. I mean, it [ph] seem like
given the fact you didn't manage much capital in 2020 and the dividend capabilities with
businesses over the next couple of years. That you'll be generating, I guess, well in
excess of or you have -- available a lot more than what's in place for the buyback income
and common [ph]. So I guess, if maybe you could comment on -- are you thinking about
doing any M&A or what you might be using other excess capital for.

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Ryan, I'll start and I'll let Beth again her add color. Yeah, it's, we feel very fortunate to be
sitting on excess capital. Obviously, we're planning to return to shareholders, vis-a-vis a
dividend increase that you just saw, and then obviously our buyback program. Our
priorities for capital are really consistent right.
We want to use capital to grow our businesses, and we do see good growth
opportunities going forward and then make sure we have a financially solid balance sheet
with sufficient margins to absorb any future shocks that obviously we're living through
these days. And then if we think about returning excess vis-a-vis share buyback to
shareholders from there.
I think I've said before M&A is a lower priority for us right now. I think, in my language, we
have everything we need to compete in the building these days and it's maturing, and it's
growing, it's working with our distribution partners that to make sure they know all our
capability. So M&A is a low priority right now.
Beth, would you add anything.

A - Beth A. Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

No, I think you covered it very, very well.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Thanks. Then follow-up for Beth, it sounds like lower net investment income captured in
the group Benefits guide, but how are you thinking about the portfolio yield headwind on
the P&C side, in terms of how we should be thinking about NII next year there.

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. So a couple of things. Obviously, one of the things that's included in the group
benefits margin guidance is a more normal or more normal planning assumption for
limited partnerships and obviously this year, we were well above that. If you think about
the portfolio, sort of ex-partnerships and you look at where we were Q4 with the portfolio
yield of about 3.2% overall.
I see about probably 10 points of pressure on that, as we look forward into 2021.

Operator
And our next question comes from in the Jim Bhullar from JPMorgan.. Please go ahead
with your question.

Q - Jamminder Bhullar
Hi, good morning. So First -- just had a question on workers' comp pricing and I think.
Doug, you mentioned you're expecting it to be consistent with last year. Are you seeing
that in the market actually or is that just more of a, as a whole, right now. Some more color
on what you're seeing.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

I would separate the markets as I think about Small Commercial largely a file with little
deviation. And we are seeing flat to negative pricing. I think the final trends across the
Bureau States next year are off four to five points. So I think that environment will continue
to exist as it has in the last couple of years although slightly improved negative. Right. We
were probably eight or nine off, two and three years ago and how we are [ph]. So that's
encouraging.
In the middle market space, we see very competitive marketplace. It's remaining
competitive over the last 12, 15 months. And I think we will continue to battle it out, by
account by account, we're thoughtful about accounts. We think about our tools, we look at
the account straight up and we make decision. So I don't see a lot of change in that
middle market workers' comp environment going forward, at least in the next year.

Q - Jamminder Bhullar
Okay. And what was the impetus for the reserve increase for molestation claims?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah Jimmy, what I would say is, as we've talked about in the past, sexual molestation
claims revival statues, they all go together here. Particularly in this quarter, as Beth
mentioned it related to Boy Scout. They are in bankruptcy going through, trying to
reorganize and the amount of additional claims that were reported to us this past
November far exceeded our initial expectations.

Page 15 of 23



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2021-02-05

So now we're really sympathetic to sort of the real victims here, but there are some
serious questions about the validity of all the claims that were reported. Nevertheless, we
felt it prudent, again just given the magnitude to increase our reserve position, and we
did--.

FINAL

Q - Jamminder Bhullar
Okay and then just lastly on business interruption losses, obviously in the US for the most
part the courts residing with insurers, less so in international market. So is your view on
your exposures consistent then Europe as well or is in the UK market or do you think you
might actually have a little bit more risk there.

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah, I would say in the US. First, you heard my prepared remarks, it's -- we're debating
and finding out in the courts and litigating so, nothing fundamentally has changed our
views on BI exposures. We have not put up any reserves, other than for our policies that
did not have direct physical loss requirement. Our expense reserves remain the same, I
mean we're spending money to defend ourselves which is why we put it up. And then I
would say the UK judgment doesn't affect us at off here in the US as you know, and it
does not impact us in any way in our Lloyd's Syndicate, we just -- we didn't participate in
those types of policies.

And our next question comes from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead
with your question.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. Thanks. Thinking about probably for Beth. We saw the sale of Talcott
was announced. Can you remind us how much capital Hartford has remaining. And also
maybe can you remind us, do you expect -- Hartford expect to get any kind of cash tax
benefits from, I mean remaining DTAs or AMTs?

A - Beth A. Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Yeah. So I'll take it, and obviously in two pieces. So as it relates to the Talcott investment
overall, kind of an ex-AOCI basis, it's about $185 million on our balance sheet. And again,
it's an investment. So, like all of our investments are part of our capital base, it wouldn't,
how do you think about this is creating sort of excess capital capacity. There is obviously
some risk charges that would go away, but it's all part of our capital base.
And then as it relates to DTAs and AMT tax credits, we have monetized all of those
through 2020. So we are really in a position now where it's just not where a normal tax
payer and very pleased to -- have been able to recoup all of those balances.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay, excellent. And one follow-up question. In the prepared remarks, I think there was a
greater [ph] statistic about approximately 25% decline in business interruption related
case counts. I'm just kind of curious, since we get a lot of questions on this -- is kind of tail
risk topic, do you think directionally that's also the trend for the industry and that's kind of
point as far as seeing that the policy wording is strong?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Yeah, I can't speak to 25% for the rest of the industry. Obviously, that's our statistics. But I
think anecdotally, I mean you can tell, many of the judgments coming out of federal and
state court are aligned with the industries position on interpreting the language of direct
physical loss or damage. So I think, as we sit here today, I feel pretty good about where all
the judgments are coming out. So that's what I would share. Mike.

And our next question comes from David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead
with your question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - David Motemaden

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. I had a follow-up question for Beth. Just on the capital side and
remittance guidance that you gave just on the P&C side, it seems that stable with prior
years. But if I look at the earnings power of the P&C business and it looks like it's up 40%
since you last changed it. So I'm wondering why the remittances haven't moved much
since 2018?

A - Beth A. Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Yeah, great question. I mean, again, I think you know our philosophy is to be in a position
where we're taking steady dividends out of the subsidiaries, you're right. If you look at
2018, but if you also look back to 2016 and 2017, the amount of dividends that we were
taking out were far exceeding our statutory earnings.
So on balance I think, where we are $900 million is very comfortable and I think to the
extent that we continue to generate earnings at the level that we're at that there is, that
opportunity for that to increase. But we tend to be pretty steady as we think about our
dividends out of our subsidiaries.

Q - David Motemaden

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Okay, got it. That's helpful. And then a question for Christian and Doug, just on the
outlook. And I'm thinking a bit more from a topline perspective. Just thinking about how

Page 17 of 23



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2021-02-05

you guys are expecting top-line in commercial P&C specifically as we progress throughout
the course of 2021.

FINAL

What you guys are thinking for growth there and maybe Doug, if you can just talk a little
bit more about the spectrum policy, because that seems like that had some really good
new business trends this quarter?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah. David. I'll start and then Doug will provide his color. So I think, the first starting point
is just macro that we're still living in a pandemic. All right. And we've only vaccinated what
10% of our population, so the first half of '21 and the second half of '21 could look, I would
say dramatically different.
Second point is, I think you've always heard us talk that -- we're a fairly employment
centric firm, with our large comp both in our large disability book, so as employment
levels rise and we are encouraged to see the employment numbers this morning
obviously come down. We'll have to digest really what that means from a absolute
number of workers, but again heading in the right direction to sort of rebuild payrolls,
which obviously then provides a lift from there.

Bloomberg Transcript

Third, I would say, again, hopefully you could feel it through Doug and myself that we are
optimistic about what we can achieve in the marketplace with our expanded product
capabilities, our new industry verticals, in a environment, where rates are going to
continue. I think at the pace they are. At least for the next 12 months to 18 months.
So you put all that together and I am refraining from giving you an exact number. So don't
ask for an exact number. But I think it points to an increasing topline Doug [ph] compared
to what we've experienced over prior years.

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Yeah, I would just add that on the spectrum question, we launched a terrific very
contemporary product right at the end of 2019. We're feeling terrific about the prospects
of that and we barely getting market and COVID hits in March. So you really got to take
that five month or six month period out where we know that sales were off quite
substantially in second quarter. So I am deeply encouraged by what happened in the last
four months of the year. I think it's a terrific product, I think the ease of use, the reaction
from CSRs and customers around the country is exactly what we wanted. I think that holds
prospects for growth going forward.
Again, in light of the economic turn back on -- that will be a big condition for us in small,
but I'm confident that we're headed in a really good direction. Lastly relative to Global
Specialty, Middle & Large Commercial, we had some significant activities on the
underwriting side that needed to happen this year to get back where we want to be profit
turnaround, if you will. And I feel really good about those actions that were taken.

Page 18 of 23



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2021-02-05

FINAL

So as I pivot [ph] into '21, I think largely many of those actions are behind us. Not all, but
many of the large block of that. And so I'm encouraged that there is opportunities for
growth. I feel really good about our verticals like a level what the Navigator breadth has
meant to our franchise and we're just beginning to explore, I think the full dynamic of that.
So I'm bullish about what we're going to do heading forward.

And our next question comes from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Please go ahead with
your question.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. If you could unpack a bit your underlying combined ratio
improvement expectations are included in your 2021 outlook, I mean, based on your
commentary and other, the driver of rate increases to get ahead of loss trends, a new
sided social inflation. Could you provide some color of the direction of your current year
loss picks and couple that with the rate increases you're expecting to achieve?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Let's start with what we said in the past which is with the exception of workers'
compensation, all of the rest of our lines in Commercial are exceeding our loss cost
trends. I think that still holds. Right. And as such, the work and the pricing activity on a
written basis that we achieve this year, plus what we expect next year, leads us to believe
on an earned basis, we're going to see earned improvement in our loss ratios across
Commercial for all lines, ex workers' comp.
I expect some margin compression in Small, just as we battled through in 2020, but the
aggregate of what we've been able to achieve in Global Specialty and Middle Market
pricing leads me to feel confident that the driver of loss ratio change in those two
businesses, will carry the incremental improvement that we express in our guidance for
'21.
Personal Lines is a different story. Right. We had a very positive low driving miles year
period, nine months, if you will, and we expect those driving miles to return back more to
normal. So the Personal Lines margin and loss ratio will come back toward a more normal
level. And that's why you see the pick that we've selected here for '21. So if you put
Personal and Commercial together overall, we're still encouraged and feel improvement,
but there are mixed stories inside that just to have to be aware of.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

Okay. I think you've already provided some good color on workers' comp and by
segment. I'm wondering if you could highlight any other business line or you're seeing
more rate increases.

Tracy, the, certainly in our specialty businesses, as demonstrated by the numbers terrific
progress near 20 on the quarter and across certain lines excellent progress. I do think
when I look at property, I'm very pleased o our property. We have been working on our
property book on a by-parallel [ph] pricing basis now for a couple of years. But I'm
encouraged that our E&S property book was in the low '20s, our large property book,
which is not included in the supplement, was in the low '20s.
Our core middle-market, smaller property book, high, high single-digits. So I'm very
encouraged by the progress we're making kind of line by line and feel like that sets up for

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Great, thanks. A question for Doug. I was hoping you could share share within, I guess,
Navigator, your appetite for really, really large accounts, we're hearing, obviously that's
where pricing is most dramatic. I just wanted to get a sense of how much of that you're
interested in or willing to underwrite?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

My, our portfolio appetite now extends across the segments. Right. So we obviously
strong position in small growing strength in Middle with verticals, a really solid national
account franchise, primarily around workers' compensation and assortment of specialty
products that Vince and his team attach [ph] both large accounts, middle market
accounts, et cetera.
Terrific wholesale distribution, that is an added element of the Navigators acquisition. So I
feel like we're coming at the market in all phases, all products, all segments all
geographies and I really like that approach. And as I suggested in my remarks, we've had
some nice early wins. But I think we'll just be the beginning of how we mature this broad
product breadth into our family of what we bring to market.

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

I would say, again, like a lot of things we do around here. I mean we're centered on small,
middle market enterprises. That doesn't mean, we don't service and find opportunities in
the largest segment of the market. But I would -- have you leave with that most of our
Page 20 of 23

property capabilities are geared towards the middle and upper middle market and the
multi-billion dollar property schedules we might have opportunities to participate. But
again, I think in terms of core middle market to upper middle market is where we like to
focus and try to win business.

FINAL

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, that's very helpful. I guess, well -- not a follow up, unrelated question for Beth, when
you got really, really strong limited partnerships results, do you have possibility to say okay
let's -- cash out here or is this sort of proportionate commitments, within the investment
portfolio, something we should think of it being unchanged?

A - Beth A. Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Yeah. So as we invest in these partnerships, we do obviously still have outstanding
commitments that are there and we see this as an asset class that we want to continue to
participate in. So we've been very pleased with the overall returns there and how our
investment team has managed that, so I wouldn't -- how you think about us trying to cash
out in many instances, pretty limited in your ability to do that based on how these
partnerships are structured.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. But it's fair to assume, let me take at the other side that the expected returns were
still buying the higher value at year-end?

A - Beth A. Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

So our expectation over time is that we think that the yields that were -- outlook to is -what one would see -- starts to see outsized returns on some of the more seasoned
portfolios. And then -- and we are investing in new funds those would tend to draw in a
lower yield I -- originally. So you kind of think about the balance of the two. But again, you
can look at our results over time, our partnerships have performed very strongly. But we
typically look at them over the long term, at that sort of 6% level.

And our next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead
with your question.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Hi, good morning everybody. My first question just goes back to the Group Benefits and
the mortality there. I assume [ph] that it's a younger block of -- but -- by an age -- from an
age perspective. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what concentration, you may be
seeing there, either by age cohort, by region, by maybe line of industry from where

Page 21 of 23



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2021-02-05

you're seeing these elevated mortality rates. I guess I was just little surprised to see this
level of mortality from an active employee force?

FINAL

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Yeah, I would share with you, Yaron, that mortality increases is fairly consistent amongst all
age cohorts, obviously the rate of mortality is different by age cohort. But the increase is
fairly consistent. I would also share with you again about 6% or 7% of our insured
population is 60 and older. So we don't have a big concentration in -- I'll call it the mature
segment of the marketplace.
So, I mean the direct and indirect effects the COVID is pretty spread across all cohorts, all
regions. The country, we're not seen any particular trend at this point in time other than
the indirect costs, as we try to analyze it. We just think it's people deferring and not taking
care of themselves during the pandemic, and we see heart disease, stroke and cancer.
That's up, again it's not directly related to COVID but indirectly related.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Got it. Okay, that's helpful color. And then I think we saw very limited utilization of the
Navigators ADC this quarter. So do you think it's time going [ph] reserves there to the
conservative level you want them to be. And you kind of turn the corner, any thoughts on
that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah. I just go back to what we've said before, glad we purchased it. It was part of our
strategy as we thought about financing the overall Navigators transaction. Obviously, it's
slowed down this quarter, but that [ph] you know in this business, you can never predict
with certainty. What's going to happen in the future, with some of these claims, but the
