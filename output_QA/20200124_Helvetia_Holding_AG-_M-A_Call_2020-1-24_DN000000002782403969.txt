Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Analyst Conference Call on the Acquisition of the Spanish
Insurance Company Caser by Helvetia. I am Alessandro the Chorus Call operator. I would like to
remind you that all participants will be in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded.
The presentation will be followed by a Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) The conference must
not be recorded for publication or broadcast.
At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over to Mr. Philipp Gmur, Group CEO. Please go ahead, sir.

Philipp Gmur
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our conference call. We are very pleased to be able
to inform you today that we reached another milestone that perfectly fits with our current strategy.
Helvetia is acquiring a majority stake in the Spanish insurer Caser. This acquisition will considerably
reinforce the European business as a second pillar of the Group. We will be gaining substantial
market share in Spain and together with Caser, we will improve our positioning to a meaningful
number seven in non-life.
Moreover, we will not only be significantly strengthening our core business, but also improve the
business mix for the Group through a higher share of non-life and the more balanced geographical
mix. Helvetia is also significantly improving its distribution channel mix by increasing its presence in
the area of bank distribution.
Caser operates very successfully in Spain. We see Spain as a very promising growth market and
market economics for Spain look positive. We repeatedly emphasized that an acquisition in Spain
would be very interesting. And now, we are seizing the opportunity offered to us.
For our shareholders, the good news is that Caser will also immediately make a significant profit
contribution and the acquisition is EPS accretive. Furthermore, Helvetia will be preserving its strong
capital position. I will provide you with more details of the acquisition on the following chart.
Let's move to Slide 3, as I have already mentioned, the acquisition of Caser is a unique opportunity
to strengthen the European business as a second pillar of the Group. Our business in Spain has
developed very well in recent years and will be additionally reinforced by this transaction. Helvetia



will significantly increase its market share in Spain, which also substantially increases the importance
of our European activities.

FINAL

The acquisition of Caser perfectly fits with Helvetia's strategy. Caser also is strongly focusing on
the attractive non-life business, which made up 68% of Caser's premiums in 2018. Caser has a
balanced product portfolio offering products and services in all retail insurance segments.
Helvetia is also opening up valuable new sales channels in the area of bank distribution. Caser has
had distribution agreements with Ibercaja, Unicaja and Liberbank, and further banks for a long time.
The bank distributors will remain as minority shareholders and distribution agreements will be
continued. Hence Helvetia is gaining important new strategic partners in Spain. Ibercaja, Unicaja
and Liberbank are present across Spain with around 3,100 branches, serving more than 7 million
customers.
Both Caser and Helvetia focus on customer centricity and digitalization. In addition Caser, like
Helvetia, is developing new business models to further diversify the business. With Caser, Helvetia
gains access to attractive ecosystems in the health and old age sector with stable fee income.

Among other things, Caser operates nursing homes and hospitals. Given the demographic
development, this offers further growth opportunities. The two companies complement each
other in a perfect manner, be it business wise, be it culturally. Furthermore, Caser will also
immediately make a significant profit contribution. Finally, we see additional potential to realize
synergies over time.
On the next slide, our CFO, Paul Norton, will provide you with more details on the structure of the
acquisition, the financing structure and the financial implications.

Paul Norton

{BIO 16145125 <GO>}

Thank you, Philipp. Good morning also from my side. Caser is owned by a group of shareholders,
most of whom are banks with distribution agreements with Caser. Helvetia has reached an
agreement with a group of these shareholders on the sale of their share packages. Helvetia would
acquire up to 70% of Caser.
The purchase price for stake of almost 70% in Caser is EUR780 million and is close to the book
value of Caser. Helvetia to intends to finance two-thirds of the acquisition of Caser by using hybrid
bonds and one-third by issuing new shares. This financing mix enables efficient capital
management and contributes to a balanced capital base. The Annual General Meeting on April 24,
2020, will vote on the issuance of new shares.
Until the capital transactions are completed, the acquisition will be financed with existing liquidity.
Helvetia's capital position remains solid after the transaction. The SST ratio will remain within the
target range of 180% to 240%. Helvetia has already had confirmation that the S&P rating of A will
remain unchanged subject to completion of the transaction financing actions.
In addition, as Philipp already mentioned, the acquisition will be EPS accretive. At the moment the
full IFRS numbers remain provisional because Caser reports under local GAAP. We will obviously
give you more details once the acquisition has been completed and as with the Nationale Suisse
acquisition, we will report the impact of acquisition accounting in the future results so you can see
the underlying results.
We expect the transaction will be concluded in the first half of 2020.
With that, I will hand back to Philipp, who will provide you with more details on Caser as a company.



Philipp Gmur

FINAL

Thank you, Paul. Slide 5 shows that together with the Caser, Helvetia will become an important
player in the Spanish non-life market. While Helvetia currently ranks number 20, the combined
companies will advance to a number seven position, an excellent market positioning and basis for
future growth. This premium volume in Spain even exceeds the non-life book we have in
Switzerland. Also, in the life business, Helvetia significantly improves its positioning.
Let us move to Slide 6 that provides you with an overview on Caser's business. Founded back in
1942 in Madrid, Caser is a Spanish composite insurance company that is active in non-life and life.
The company has a strong focus on the non-life business, where it holds the top 10 position
standalone.
In 2018, Caser generated on a local GAAP basis revenues of EUR1.6 billion and a profit of EUR87
million. Non-life business accounts for 62% of the revenues. Alongside the insurance business,
Caser has developed nursing homes, hospitals and real estate services to diversify its operation.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you can see on the right side of the slide, the company has also built up comprehensive bank
distribution networks. Caser has non-life distribution agreements with Ibercaja, Unicaja and
Liberbank and other banks. These co-operations will be continued and Helvetia is gaining
important new strategic partners in Spain.
Let us move on to Slide 7. Slide 7 shows Caser's business mix, with 68% of premiums coming out
of the attractive non-life business. Because Caser reports based on local GAAP, it's figures are only
comparable to Helvetia's numbers to a limited extent. However, Caser contributes significantly to
the top-line figures in Spain and improves the share of the non-life business from a Group's
perspective.
In addition Caser generated EUR141 million of revenues with fee income from the ecosystems in
the health and old age sectors, offering future growth potential.
On Slide 8, we will provide you with further information of the bottom line impact. Also, here I
would like to emphasize that due to the fact that Caser reports based on local GAAP, it's figures
are only comparable to Helvetia numbers to a limited extent. However, they can give a broad
indication of the impact of the acquisition.
Any numbers in this presentation related to the acquisition and its impact on Helvetia Group are
preliminary and will only be finalized after the completion of the conversion of Caser's number to
IFRS and the related acquisition accounting. Nevertheless, it is already apparent today that Caser
will also provide a substantial positive bottom line impact.
With that, I'll move on to Slide 9. Caser will continue to operate in the Spanish market with its
existing well-established brand, as we will Helvetia Seguros in Spain. The management teams and
locations of both companies will also remain in place. Helvetia aims to combine its strengths with
Caser's.
For this particular reason a joint management committee will be set up after the transaction has
been completed, in which members of Helvetia Spain and Caser will be represented. The joint
management committee will coordinate common activities in the market also with the aim of
realizing synergies. Moreover, it ensures the exchange of knowledge and experience.
Let's move on to Slide 10. Helvetia has reached an agreement with the main shareholders on the
sale of their shares in Caser. Other shareholders have the opportunity to sell their shares at the
same conditions to Helvetia. Helvetia expects to acquire a stake of up to 70% in Caser. By last
night, we have a contractual commitment of 67.1%. We expect the remainder within one week's



FINAL

time. The above mentioned three strategic bank distribution partners will each remain invested
with around 10%, underscoring the importance of these strategic co-operations.
On Slide 11, you see that the acquisition of Caser supports Helvetia's growth ambition, without
compromised financial targets. It is very important for me to emphasize that together with Caser,
Helvetia will reach its volume ambition of CHF10 billion by the end of 2020, but without
jeopardizing profitability. To the contrary, the transaction supports our strategy of profitable
growth.
Let's end our presentation with a summary on Slide 12. To sum up, with the acquisition of Caser,
Helvetia is: first, achieving its strategic aim of reinforcing its position in Europe and strengthening
Europe as a second strong pillar of the Group; second, strengthening the core business and
exploring new business models; and third, creating shareholder value by acquiring a successful
insurance company under financially attractive conditions.
Now, Paul Norton and I are ready to answer your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first question
comes from the line of Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. I'll try and limit myself to three questions initially. The first one was on
earnings. I mean, I guess, given your comments, you can't give us a better indication of the
underlying IFRS earnings, but I was wondering if you can give us any idea or quantification of the
synergies you expect, and also, whether you can quantify the one-off in Caser's 2018 numbers?
The second one was on capital structure. I'm just wondering whether you're happy with the
financial leverage as it will be after this deal, or whether you might look so decrease that over time
and whether it leaves you with any capacity for further deals?
And then, the third one was just on the dividend. I'm just wondering whether it has any implications
for the dividend policy given this should increase your earnings? If you cut the dividend policy
unchanged, then I guess your payout ratio would go down a little bit. Just wondering if you can
comment anything over this at this stage? Thank you very much.

A - Philipp Gmur
Okay. Thank you, Peter. Let me answer question number three, and then, hand over to Paul. With
regard to our dividend policy, of course, our dividend payout ratio is slightly changing according to
the number of shares and all that, but we are not planning as of today to have a major change in
our dividend payout ratio, as we used to comment on that during the last years. So instantly, there
is no change in dividend policy. Now, for the other two questions, I would like to hand over to Paul.

A - Paul Norton

{BIO 16145125 <GO>}

Maybe I can just add to the dividend policy. As you know, we have a new strategy period coming
up and we will update our dividend policy as part of the strategy. As you know, we also have
strategic gear increase in dividends and with the Nationale Suisse transaction, we increased
dividends due to synergies. I'll come up to that in a minute, the synergies. But obviously Caser will
bring additional net income to us, which is available for dividend. So it may or may not have an



FINAL

impact on the payout ratio, but I think the most important thing is that, we have a clear strategy
going forward.
In terms of the earnings, you're right, it's very difficult at the moment to give you a guidance on the
underlying earnings under IFRS until we've gone through the details. The one-off was in the low
double-digit millions net impact. As far as synergies are concerned, we have specifically not
mentioned synergies. We've said this is a deal which adds distribution to us. It's not specifically a
synergy deal as the Nationale Suisse deal was. Having said that, we do know of areas where we
will, over the next few years, be able to achieve them, but we're being very conservative and are
not saying anything at the moment. So I hope you can understand that.
In terms of the capital and leverage, we are very happy with that. On a small amount, you probably
saw earlier this year, we repaid EUR150 million of senior, because we just needed and it would help
the structure a little bit. You've seen hopefully today S&P have confirmed our A rating and taken off
the credit watch, including the impact to cost [ph] as we spoke to them last week. So they are
saying, as far as we're concerned, if you succeed with the financing of the transaction as you
propose then we think the capital structure is absolutely fine. So we have no intention at the
moment of decreasing the leverage and we'll look at it as we go along. Obviously, given the size
of Caser, talking about future acquisitions, it's probably a bit too soon.

A - Philipp Gmur
More questions.

Your next question comes from the line of Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Well done for getting this over the line. It
looks like it was quite competitive. I guess, from our perspective, as Peter touched on, it is just
quite difficult to get a feel for the financials. You've helped us with the one-off, but just
conceptually on the local GAAP versus IFRS point, I mean, what should we expect the direction of
that to be? Normally IFRS is higher than local GAAP, so any comments there would be great.
Any broad comments on EPS accretion? I mean we've all did our calculations this morning, which
invariably will be wrong given the accounting differences, but any just roughs there would be really
helpful. But then, just on the funding structure, I mean -- and let's say you could have done this
potentially just from internal resources given where you are in the solvency range, maybe the
difference is from a credit rating perspective, but is the funding structure that you propose to give
you more kind of powder future M&A going forward? Thank you.

A - Philipp Gmur
Okay. Johnny. Thanks. I would like to hand over for answering the two questions to Paul.

A - Paul Norton

{BIO 16145125 <GO>}

I understand your needs to get more direction on the earnings and EPS. I really at this stage, would
not like to give you anything there. I mean the EPS will be very mildly accretive at the moment, it's
not -- we don't foresee a huge EPS accretion. But given the differences, and we're also dealing
here by the way as a small amount of revenue which is not under IFRS for Insurance accounting, it's
under IFRS 15 for revenues at some of the various hospitals and nursing homes, the sort of
ecosystem health business. So at the moment I really wouldn't want to give you any stare on that I
am afraid.



FINAL

In terms of the funding, we've always had a very conservative funding approach and it's not so
much about giving capacity for future M&A deals because this is going to take us some time to
bring it back. Just with the Nationale Suisse we said, look, we're not going to do any major deals
for a couple of years. It's about making us resilient and ensuring that we have a backbone that
enables us to keep growing without any problems while we integrate the company. So that's why
we didn't want to do that out of the existing funding.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

That's great. Thank you.

A - Philipp Gmur
More questions.

Operator
The next question comes from the line of Simon Fossmeier from Bank Vontobel. Please go ahead.

Q - Simon Fossmeier

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I see your EPS accretion. On the other hand, it
looks like, the deal is slightly ROE dilutive. Just directionally, is that correct? The second question is
on the life book, is this a book with guarantees? And third, if you have any estimate on what your
costs will be on the hybrids that you will issue? Thank you.

A - Philipp Gmur
Thank you, Simon. Paul?

A - Paul Norton

{BIO 16145125 <GO>}

Yes. I mean, I have to look at the return on equity ratios. We think it actually will be not much
different. Actually, it will be probably slightly positive given the two thirds funding is on hybrid and
not in equity. So it should be slightly positive on that. The hybrid cost we estimate to be under 3%.
It's pretty good at the moment. And what was your third question, Simon.

Q - Simon Fossmeier
On the life guarantees.

A - Paul Norton

{BIO 16145125 <GO>}

Yes. There are guarantees. It is a traditional book, it is relatively small, we think -- actually due to
the acquisition accounting for it and so on, but we think we can manage that book of business and
make sure that it's more than adequately reserved. So we don't have a problem with that.

Q - Simon Fossmeier
All right. Thanks a lot.

Operator
The next question is a follow up from Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Apologies if I missed this, but I was just wondering if your major shareholder
has said anything about whether it will sort of take its share of the extra shares? That was first
question. I am maybe out of luck with the other two, but you've given the -- you have said you'll



remain within the range of the SST ratio. Are you able to give us any steer on the impact that it will
have on the SST ratio very, very broadly on your calculations?

FINAL

And the final one, again I might be pushing my luck, but in terms of the hybrid, you mentioned
under 2%, but are you thinking Switzerland or euros for that or (inaudible)? Thank you.

A - Philipp Gmur
I start with answering the first question whereas Paul is now or afterwards answering the second
question. With regard to our major shareholder, you probably are inferring to Patria Mutual. Of
course, we want to get in touch with them as soon as possible. We do not know yet their position
on whether they are positive or not and whether they are helping us increasing the capital.
However, so far, they also -- they always we're supporting Helvetia's strategy and we are pretty
confident that they would do so also with this transaction. Paul?

A - Paul Norton

{BIO 16145125 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. On SST, there will be reductions in the SST, but not hugely. It only depends on obviously the
calculations and we're having to take Solvency II numbers and translate them into (inaudible) at the
moment, but there will be, I will say, a reduction. I don't want to give you the exact accounts or our
estimates at the moment, but it won't be going to the bottom end of the range at all. I am
certainly not going to get into what will happen.
In terms of the funding, we probably would use euro loans which may mean we may have slightly
over 2%, but at the moment indications are pretty good. Obviously what the market is, the Swiss
range is well below 2% -- the Swiss franc range and the euro is probably closer to the 2%, and
general feeling is that we'll prefer or my feelings are prefer to raise money in euros. So we have
liabilities backing the assets, but we'll have a look at the exact mix closely and so on.

Q - Simon Fossmeier
Great. Thank you.

Operator
The next question is from Rene Locher from MainFirst. Please go ahead.

Q - Rene Locher

{BIO 1921075 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, everybody. So I am referring to Slide 57, the half year results, where we can
see these net economic dividend capacity and you have explained that it's going to be used for
dividends or growth purposes. So I was wondering why you have not touched a little bit of this
CHF0.6 billion for the funding? So that's my first question.
The second one is on the equities, 33%, which is roughly CHF270 million CHF280 million. I mean
that's more or less a yearly dividend, so looks to me a little bit like left pocket, right pocket, and
what is the thinking behind it? Thank you very much.

A - Philipp Gmur
Thanks Rene. I hand over to Paul.

A - Paul Norton

{BIO 16145125 <GO>}

I'm glad somebody is now reading our NEDC disclosures. That's good. The NEDC is only one part
of the equation, Rene. You're right, it is there partly for dividends and partly for growth, because
you also have to look at the solvency, the SST, and the two are indicative, but not directly. So you
could have a situation where you effectively use up capacity, which affects the solvency, but



doesn't affect the NEDC and vice versa. So that's the first point. So solvency -- and the S&P rating,
obviously, are very, very important things. Let me be clear. So they are not totally connected.

FINAL

The NEDC, we will obviously look at as part of the dividend strategy going forward. I mentioned
earlier, we will have a new strategy period coming in, but then we will explain more about our
dividend policy. So at the moment, we'll leave it as it is and you'll get more information later on
that. So what was the other one?

Q - Rene Locher

{BIO 1921075 <GO>}

The equity financing. The CHF270 million.

A - Paul Norton

{BIO 16145125 <GO>}

Is that the right pocket or left pocket. I'm not quite sure what you meant by that, are you
suggesting that we're taking it out of NEDC to --

Q - Rene Locher

{BIO 1921075 <GO>}

No. I mean, you could out scrap the one year's dividend and with that you could have financed the
equity of the deal.

A - Paul Norton

{BIO 16145125 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. But I mean don't forget that -- I said that's part of the connection between the NEDC and the
solvency and the S&P rating. You can't make that simple connection. Also don't think you'll be too
happy if we scrap the year's dividend.

Q - Rene Locher

{BIO 1921075 <GO>}

That's right.

A - Paul Norton

{BIO 16145125 <GO>}

We can of course pay a dividend and we think the ongoing capital structure is really important to
maintain that balance. Always have to keep the resilience going forward.

Q - Rene Locher

{BIO 1921075 <GO>}

No. That's fine. And can I just on this page or Slide 57, you show a hybrid capital of CHF1.5 billion. So
that means you know everything equal, you just add like CHF500 million to this CHF1.5 billion, so
hybrid is going up to CHF2 billion and you have a leverage of roughly 35%?

A - Paul Norton

{BIO 16145125 <GO>}

Roughly, yeah.

Q - Rene Locher

{BIO 1921075 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Paul Norton

{BIO 16145125 <GO>}

We paid back CHF150 million of senior debt.

Q - Rene Locher

{BIO 1921075 <GO>}

That's right.

A - Paul Norton
