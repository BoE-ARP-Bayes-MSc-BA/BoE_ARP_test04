Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes, good morning everyone and welcome to our conference call to discuss NN Group's
results for the ﬁrst quarter of 2018. I will start today's presentation by talking about the
highlights of the ﬁrst quarter results, as well as our progress on the integration in the past
quarter. Delﬁn Rueda, our Chief Financial Oﬃcer will then take you through the details of
the ﬁnancial results and talk about the capital position and free cash ﬂow. I will conclude
the presentation with a wrap-up, after which, we will open the call for Q&A. Jan-Hendrik
Erasmus, our Chief Risk Oﬃcer is also with us today to answer your questions.

Bloomberg Transcript

So let's move to slide number three. NN Group's operating result of the ongoing business
for the ﬁrst quarter was EUR313 million. As you know, a severe storm hit the Netherlands
in January and this quarter's operating result reﬂects the related total impact of EUR89
million in our non-life and reinsurance businesses. This is more or less in line with our
market share. The ﬁrst quarter operating result also includes the contribution of Delta
Lloyd, while the operating result a year ago beneﬁted from 41 million of private equity
dividends.
The integration is progressing well and we continue to drive the improvements in
eﬃciency. Further cost savings of EUR42 million were achieved this quarter in the business
units in the scope of the integration, bringing total cost reductions to 175 million
compared with a full year 2016 expense base. This represents half of our targeted cost
reduction of 350 million by 2020, so well ahead of the earlier envisaged schedule and I
will talk more about this on a later slide.
Our balance sheet and capital position remained strong. NN Group's solvency position at
the end of the ﬁrst quarter was 213%, up from 199% at the end of 2017, driven by a
combination of positive market impacts and operating capital generation. Free cash ﬂow
to the holding company was EUR198 million, bringing the cash capital at the holding
company to EUR1.6 billion at the end of the ﬁrst quarter. New sales were down by just
under 8% at constant currencies. At Netherlands Life, there was a lower volume of existing
group pension contracts, which came up for renewal this quarter. New sales at Insurance
Europe increased, driven by the contribution of Delta Lloyd Belgium, while new sales in
Japan remained broadly stable, despite increased local competition.
Let's move to slide four. We have already achieved a number of milestones to integrate
Delta Lloyd into NN Group. For example, Delta Lloyd Bank, Delta Lloyd Asset
Management and Delta Lloyd Life in Belgium have been legally merged into the
respective NN businesses and are now operating as combined entities. We are rebranding the Delta Lloyd products and services and re-branding has already been
completed in Belgium and we expect this to be largely ﬁnalized at the other units by the

end of the year. We are also in the process of relocating Delta Lloyd employees to NN
locations.
In terms of IT, the Delta Lloyd Asset Management portfolios have been transferred and
are now running on NNIP's systems. We have started decommissioning some head oﬃce
systems, while other systems at the business units can only be decommissioned, once
policies have been migrated. We are currently working on expanding our internal model
to include the Delta Lloyd Life and non-life entities and we aim to complete the mergers
of the life and non-life companies in 2019. We are well on-track, but obviously still have a
lot of work to do and some of the more complex integration projects are ahead of us.

Bloomberg Transcript

Throughout the integration process, we make sure that we never lose sight of our
customers. This process [ph] was particularly evident following the January storm. We
were there for our customers in their time of need and were able to settle most of the
thousands of storm claims within one month. Our focus is also on maintaining our
commercial momentum by oﬀering our customers innovative solutions and value-added
products, while at the same time, writing proﬁtable new business by focusing on value,
rather than volume. We continue to launch new protection products in Europe and we
have opened a new innovation Sparklab in Spain to develop creative solutions and drive
innovation in that country.
So, let's turn now to slide number ﬁve. At our Capital Markets Day last year, we
announced our target to reduce the administrative expense base for all the business units
in the scope of integration by around 350 million by the end of 2020, of which 50% by
the end of 2018. As I mentioned earlier, the integration is progressing well and we have
already realized a total cost reduction of EUR175 million at the end of the ﬁrst quarter. This
means that we are well ahead of schedule. Now given the strong process so far and
progress so far, we have announced today that we are raising the cost reduction guidance
to EUR400 million by the end of 2020 and expect to achieve at least half of these savings
by the end of this year. The split of the total cost reductions by segments can be seen in
the right-hand graph on slide number ﬁve. We are conﬁdent that we can continue our
track record of cost discipline and achieve the targeted cost reductions.
And with that, I would like to hand you over to our CFO, Delﬁn Rueda.

Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Thank you, Lard and good morning, everyone. Let me start with NN Group's operating
result of the ongoing business, which was EUR313 million for the ﬁrst quarter, down from
406 million in the same quarter last year. This was mainly due to the severe storm in
January, which had a total impact of EUR89 million in our non-life and reinsurance
businesses. The current quarter also reﬂects the contribution of Delta Lloyd, while the
operating result in the ﬁrst quarter of last year beneﬁted from 41 million of private equity
dividends. The net result for the ﬁrst quarter was EUR399 million versus 435 million in the
ﬁrst quarter of 2017. The decrease reﬂects the lower operating results, higher special items
largely relating to restructuring expenses, as well as the amortization of acquisition
intangibles. This was partly oﬀset by higher revaluations on real estate portfolio.

Moving on to slide eight, I will take you through the performance of the individual
segments. The ﬁrst quarter operating result of Netherlands Life was EUR212 million,
reﬂecting the inclusion of Delta Lloyd, while last year's result included 41 million of private
equity dividends. The loss at Netherlands Non-Life was largely due to a 56 million impact
of the January storm. We also saw less favorable underwriting performance in both the
individual disability and group income portfolios. The combined ratio for the segment
Netherlands Non-Life was 106.3% or 98.6%, excluding the impact of the storm. Insurance
Europe reported a higher result this quarter, driven by higher fees and premium based
revenues and a contribution of Delta Lloyd Belgium. At Japan Life, we saw the result
decreased 15% excluding currency eﬀects, primarily due to less favorable mortality and
surrender results compared with a strong quarter last year. This was partly oﬀset by higher
fees and premium based revenues as a result of a larger in-force portfolio.

Bloomberg Transcript

The higher operating result of asset management was driven by the inclusion of the Delta
Lloyd activities as well as expense reductions. And ﬁnally, the loss in the segment Other
was due in part to a 33 million impact of the January storm and a claim from our legacy
portfolio, which are reﬂected in the result of the reinsurance business, while the holding
result includes some non-recurring expenses. On the other hand, the banking business
reported a higher operating result, driven by the inclusion of the Delta Lloyd activities, as
well as lower expenses and favorable risk cost, partly oﬀset by a lower interest margin.
Let's move on to the next slide, which shows our cash capital position. The holding
company cash capital increased to EUR1.6 billion, at the end of the ﬁrst quarter from 1.4
billion at the end of last year. The free cash ﬂow during the ﬁrst quarter was EUR198
million, driven by EUR256 million of dividends, received mainly from the Dutch units.
Details of the dividends upstreamed by segment can be found as usual in the appendix of
this presentation.
On slide 10, I will take you through the development in NN Group Solvency II ratio. Our
Solvency II ratio was 213% at the end of the ﬁrst quarter, up from 199% at the end of 2017.
The operating capital generation for the ﬁrst quarter added four percentage points to the
ratio and includes a negative impact of EUR67 million after-tax related to the January
storm. Excluding this impact, the own funds capital generation would have been EUR0.3
billion, with a contribution of ﬁve percentage points to the Solvency II ratio. Market
variances made a positive contribution of 10 percentage points. This mainly reﬂects
favorable movements in both government and corporate bond spreads, and ﬂattening of
the curve as well as positive revaluations of our real estate investments. The column,
Other includes the negative impact of the reduction of the UFR by 15 basis points in
January this year. Capital ﬂows are zero this quarter as we already deducted the proposed
2017 ﬁnal dividend from the Solvency II ratio in the fourth quarter of 2017.
And with that, I pass you back to Lard for the wrap-up.

Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Delﬁn. We have today presented NN Group's results for the ﬁrst quarter of
2018, which were impacted by the severe storm that hit the Netherlands in January.
Notwithstanding this, the businesses continue to focus on driving performance and

improving eﬃciency in order to achieve their medium term targets. The integration of
Delta Lloyd is progressing very well and cost reductions are ahead of schedule. We have
today announced that we are raising the cost reduction guidance to EUR400 million by
the end of 2020 and we expect to achieve at least half of these savings by the end of this
year. Our balance sheet remains strong, in line with our disciplined capital management
approach. The Solvency II ratio increased to 213% and the cash capital position to EUR1.6
billion at the end of the ﬁrst quarter.
We are committed to delivering on the Delta Lloyd transaction by combining the
strengths of our businesses and cultures and successfully extracting the synergies. We
have seen encouraging commercial momentum and our customer satisfaction scores is
measured by the net promoter score, have increased over the past year. As we progress
with the integration, we will never lose sight of our main objective, which is to provide an
excellent customer service through innovative solutions and value-added products.
I will now open the call for your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Mr. Friese. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now start the question-and-answer
session. (Operator Instructions) The ﬁrst question is from Mr. Arjan van Veen, UBS. Go
ahead please, sir.

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

Thank you. Can I ask a couple of questions please? The ﬁrst one, just on the capital
position, that's surprisingly very strong at 213%. I would assume it gets better once you
implement the partial internal model for Delta Lloyd. So you are getting back to levels
that you were at when you were regularly paying buybacks. So could you maybe discuss a
bit around that, what kind of -- what your criteria are surrounding a decision whether or
not to do any form of capital return or increased dividend or the like?
The second question was around the Netherlands Life results. The numbers remain
somewhat weak and I understand this is obviously lower PE dividends in there et cetera,
but this quarter as well as last quarter, our levels that look like Delta Lloyd is not even in
there. So just curious if you can give a bit more color around your conﬁdence that the
earnings from the Netherlands Life division will bounce back to a level that we would have
expected before the Delta Lloyd acquisition in terms of adding that back in some of the
changes you've done, the asset change de-risking et cetera?

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes, Arjan, thank you for your questions. I will take the ﬁrst one and I will ask Delﬁn to talk
about the Life results. Yeah, so about the capital position, obviously, we're pleased with
our Solvency II position and with the cash capital buﬀer of 1.6 billion and we're
comfortable with our leverage position. It's all about being disciplined and rational and
Page 5 of 26

FINAL

that's what we aim to be in our capital allocation decisions and you know that we have a
policy that if we have capital in excess of our ambition, we will return it to stockholders
unless we can invest it in a value-creating opportunity, including M&A. We aim for an
attractive, growing dividend per share and I would like to remind you of our guidance that
we expect a double-digit increase of our dividend per share over the year 2018. Share
buybacks, which we have done in the past, are an eﬃcient way to return excess capital to
stockholders, but obviously, we'll take such a decision at the appropriate time.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Thank you, Arjan. So on your question on Netherlands Life, I mean may be good just to
remind everyone that the medium-term guidance that we have provided for Netherlands
Life is to be broadly stable to the level of 2017 and the fact that we do however expect a
possibly higher free cash ﬂows than the net operating result of Netherlands Life. In terms
of the evolution in this quarter, you are right, when you mentioned that the main driver for
this apparent weaker situation is the lower private equity dividends that were very strong
in the ﬁrst quarter of last year, that was EUR41 million in the last quarter. And however this
quarter, this is much more limited, only 7 million and these private equity dividends are
volatile, so it might happen in one quarter or another.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of the technical margin, I think is -- the quarter is very much according to the
guidance that we have provided between 40 million and 50 million per quarter. And we
have indicated in the past that there is this pressure on the fees and premium based
revenues due to the runoﬀ of the portfolio. However, I can conﬁrm although we no longer
disclose separately that the Delta Lloyd Life business has contributed positively also to the
segment.

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

And Delﬁn, in the past, you gave guidance around the margin, is it possible to reintroduce that?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

We have seen in -- I think you're referring to the investment margin as --

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

Exactly, yeah.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

As a percentage of the assets under management. And you have seen that it has been
more or less stable, so it was a bit higher in Q4. We are at approximately the same level as
Q3 last year and this margin between 80 and 85 basis points varies, among other things
for example on the contribution of the dividends in the particular quarter. This margin,
just to remind everyone, is calculated as the last 12 months margin.

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

So it's -- 85 is a reasonable range from your point of view?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

FINAL

From 80 to 85 basis points is I think is a reasonable range to estimate. Of course, we have
always indicated that can be a bit volatile from one quarter to another.

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

Okay, thank you.

The next question is from Mr. Cor Kluis, ABN AMRO. Go ahead, please.

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning, Cor Kluis, ABN AMRO. I've got a few questions. First of all about the
warrants that are outstanding on ING. Could you indicate, how you look to that? Is it
possible that you might buy that back in the future or how will -- will you put fully diluted
number of shares in it, if it -- if the share price rises to the exercised price? So could you
give some comments on that one?
And secondly, on the cost cutting, had 50 million extra, that is the second upgrade
basically after the acquisition. And you show on the slide ﬁve, I think on the right side how
the composition of the 400 million is, but could you indicate where most of the 50 million
delta is coming from an extra cost cutting point of view. And last question is about
Solvency, the Solvency II radio, of course, quite good, it's also dependent on macro
factors, which was the big swing factor in the quarter of course, given what's currently
going on in the macro environment, can you give us some indication of how the Solvency
II ratio developed in the second quarter, at least till now? Those were my questions.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes, Cor, thank you for your questions. So what we're going to do is, I'm going to do the
cost question ﬁrst and I'll ask Delﬁn to comment on the warrants and Jan-Hendrik to
comment on the S2 ratio question that you had. So on the expenses, we've raised our
guidance today, not only for the full period from 350 million to 400 million, but also de
facto for the year itself, where we say that for the EUR400 million, we expect at least half
to be done this year as well. We are doing that because we have a raft of programs
running on this and what we're seeing is that those programs, allow us to be better in the
way we can drive eﬃciency across the board. And as a result, it's not a particular area that
we expect the additional 50 million to come. We just believe that the additional 50
million we're able to do on the back of the programs that we have planned for and that's
why we've come out with additional guidance now, because we're ahead of our plan and
our experience so far has given us the conﬁdence that we're doing the right things and
that we're implementing better and also faster than expected and that's the background
of this.

Page 7 of 26



Company Name: NN Group NV

Let me pass it onto Delﬁn on the warrants.

FINAL

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, thanks, Cor for your question. On the warrants, may be just to remind everyone,
these warrants were established before the IPO by ING, gives them the right to exercise
warrants for approximately 35 million shares, new shares and that represents around 10%
of total capital. The warrants can be exercised upto July 2024. If they were -- their strike
price is at EUR40 per share, so if they were to be exercised at any point of time, the
impact that it will have is a capital increase in the equal amount of the exercise price.
Obviously, if they are exercised, it's assumed that the share price will be above with some
dilution eﬀect for the existing shareholders later in the future. So, we have not done any
hedge or anything to protect this dilution, which is potentially in the future and we will
consider options as they come along.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes, Jan-Hendrik?

A - Jan-Hendrik Erasmus

{BIO 19801435 <GO>}

Hello, Cor. Thank you for the question. Yes, since the end of March, we've seen positive
developments in equity markets and a slight increase in rates. On the other hand, we've
seen a slight widening in the high-quality sovereigns that we have on the portfolio as well.
So the net eﬀect of these diﬀerent movements is broadly neutral, I think.

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, thank you. Very clear.

Operator
The next question is from Mr. Ashik Musaddi, JP Morgan. Go ahead please, sir.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Hi, good morning team. Ashik here. Just a couple of questions. First of all, let me ask the
buyback question in another manner. So your cash at the moment is 1.6 billion and I'm
hoping you will generate decent cash by the end of the year. Solvency ratio is 213%,
probably quite high compared to what three, four quarters have been in the recent past.
So you mentioned that you'll give clarity on buyback in the future, but whey we -- can we
get some clarity on M&A? I mean, what sort of M&A would you potentially do, is there
anything in the pipeline that we should think about? That's number one.
Secondly is on deleveraging, is there any need to de-lever at the moment, because if I
understand correctly, you don't have any call dates in the near future. So do you think
you'll be using deleveraging and you'll be doing deleveraging on an accelerated basis,
just to use up cash. So these two -- this is one question. The second one is, I noticed that
you have booked around say, roughly 3 billion of realized cap gains in the assets of
building proﬁt below the line. As an analyst, clearly that's the way we look at it is as oneoﬀ. We don't really care about realized cap gains, but one of your peers in the Dutch

Page 8 of 26

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

market normalizes this realized cap gains in operating proﬁt. So how should we think
about that ? Are we still looking like for like or should we be moving that to operating
proﬁt if it's always positive, I mean 3 billion is a big number over past four years, even if
you normalize over 30 years, it's still like 100 million a year. So these two questions would
be appreciated if you can give some color. Thank you.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks, Ashik. I will take the ﬁrst one and I will then pass onto to Delﬁn for the
question about the gains. On the leverage position, we're comfortable with the leverage
position that we have, there is indeed no maturities coming anytime soon. The ﬁrst one is
in 2020, another 300 million that is up for maturity. So we'll cross that bridge when we
get there at that particular point in time, but we're ﬁne with where and comfortable where
we are with our leverage position.
When it comes to M&A, a couple of things. Let me repeat what I said on that also at the
Capital Markets Day on November 30. We have just acquired a large company, Delta
Lloyd and our focus is on integrating those businesses and extracting the synergies and
we're pacing well on that at the moment. Then on the Netherlands, for instance, we have
a great platform, a thriving franchise with very substantial positions. So there is no need
for large-scale insurance M&A in the Netherlands. And therefore, when we look at M&A
opportunities, we'll obviously judge them at their own merits and with a priority on
existing businesses and existing markets where we are present. But that's what I said
earlier and I'm repeating that now today. So and with respect to your buyback question,
as -- I think I've already answered that question on the ﬁrst when Arjan asked it as well. So
we want to be disciplined and rational in our capital allocation decisions and we're
pleased where we are and we will take any excess capital that we cannot put to work. We
believe we have that -- we'll go back to stockholders in the most eﬃcient form. So with
that, I'll hand back to Delﬁn.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, on your question, Ashik so, how to think about the capital gains is, I mean we could
be discussing and debating for a while. I think that for the purpose of this call, I will keep it
short. We're doing best in our assets for not only the regular income like dividends and
interest coupon, but in certain asset classes like private equity, in equity, there is an
important element of value creation that comes through the capital gains and these are
from time to time recognized below the line. So one has to assess how you want to think
about it, but is obviously a part of expected investment result, is expected over time to
becoming below the line. Another way of looking at it is basically from, leaving aside the
IFRS perspective, looking it from a Solvency II capital generation point of view on which all
investment assets are at market value and that will recognize every period of time the
surplus of these returns versus the regulatory discount rate that we used to discount oﬀ
our liabilities and that is, if you like a more stable and logical and comprehensive point of
view, but I do recognize that we don't have the same granularity in terms of reporting
under Solvency II that we have under IFRS, I hope that answers.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

No, that's deﬁnitely the case that the Solvency II is, I mean based on my understanding, is
really more relevant than IFRS, but the only reason I'm trying to ﬂag this is, it creates a bit
of, not like for like when I compare with your peers because the peers set numbers is
always including cap gains which could be big and given that you have already realized
3.5 billion, I mean, it's a huge number for the past 3.5 years, so that's what I was thinking
like, how should we think about that, but I got your answer and maybe we'll touch base
oﬄine at some point on this one. Thank you.

The next question is from Mr. Johnny Vo, Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please.

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions. I mean, I am quite surprised that how
large your losses were for windstorms. Is this a fact of that there is overlap in exposure
between Delta Lloyd's book and your book? That's the ﬁrst question. And the second
question just relates to Delta Lloyd's solvency increase which increased substantially. I
mean, can you give an impact of what was going on with the Delta Lloyd book? Obviously
rates have gone up quite substantially since the start of the year and how this impacts
Delta Lloyd's capital generation going forward? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks Johnny, indeed the solvency ratio of Delta Lloyd was nearly 170% now, so I'll
pass onto Delﬁn for that. But on the windstorm losses, ﬁrst, but to be honest, it's in line
with our market share right? We're a large player and certainly after the acquisition of
Delta Lloyd, we have a very large ﬁre book with -- and therefore, the loss that we incurred
as a result of this heavy storm is really in line with our market share, and that's something - so to me, not surprising in that sense.
Now we did give an estimate at the Q4 numbers, which was only very shortly, a couple of
weeks after the storm and obviously now, we're a couple of months later and we can give
you the tally now, which is 89 million and that's what we reported today. But I would say,
yeah, heavy storm in line with our market share on ﬁre insurance and therefore, to us, not
a big surprise.
I'll give it to Delﬁn now for the S2 ratio on Delta Lloyd Life.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, thanks. Johnny, on your question on the movement for Delta Lloyd life solvency,
indeed from 153% to 169% is a very positive evolution. The underlying reasons are the
same as for the group. It comes from a strong operating return, the market variance as
you know, the same elements that we have mentioned for the Group, the ﬂattening of the
yield curve, the reduction on the credit spreads for sovereign bonds, particularly those
that we hold in a larger proportion.

Page 10 of 26

FINAL

Also the increase of the credit spreads for corporate bonds that is also positive for us, the
ﬂattening of the yield curve. So we actually have a very good quarter from a market
perspective as most of the changes with the exception of equities has been positive to us.
And even in equities, our portfolio has performed better than the indexes, the Dutch
indexes on that front. In the case of Delta Lloyd, there has been a little bit higher
proportion on the impact of the revaluation of the real estate that for the rest of the Dutch
entities, but apart from that is the same, the same logic.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. Three questions if I may. The ﬁrst one is on the cost savings, where
you raised the target to 400 million. I wondered why you did not change the guidance for
5% to 7% growth in the operating result and for ﬂat earnings in the Netherlands. So is that
just because you expect some negatives elsewhere to -- which will oﬀset these savings?
And then on capital, just a bit more detail would be helpful on the markets variances. Can
you break them down between the diﬀerent components, you mentioned? Just trying to
get an idea of the improvement in the economic capital position, so excluding items like
ﬂattening of the curve, et cetera. And then lastly on the asset mix, there is not that much
going on in terms of re-risk during the quarter. So the mortgage book is rather static. Also
another risky asset that there is not much of a shift out of sovereigns into risk assets. So
can you maybe provide some color on that and also on the outlook for the re-risk?
Thanks.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes, thank you. Matthias. So Delﬁn?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Okay. So let me go one by one on your three questions. The ﬁrst one on the cost savings,
let me remind everyone that our guidance for the growth of our operating result is a
medium-term guidance between 5% and 7%, obviously (inaudible) this is medium term
and therefore, you can always expect positives and negatives. As a matter of fact, this
quarter we have seen some unusual amount of negatives, including the storm. So we see
no reason to change this guidance which is, as I said a medium-term guidance between
5% and 7%.
In terms of the market variances, there has been -- each of them actually are relatively
signiﬁcant. We mentioned, I think that probably -- not probably, the largest impact is
coming from the movement on credit spreads. Then it is the increase in interest rates and
the ﬂattening of the curve that also have a signiﬁcant impact, the real estate revaluations

FINAL

that we mentioned and I think that overall, that explains the 10 percentage points increase
in the Solvency II ratio in the quarter.
In terms of re-risking, I am getting a bit boring on this in the sense that we continue with
our very gradual process of ﬁnding, if possible, more illiquid assets, mortgages being one
of them and basically, we are little-by-little, ﬁnding these opportunities when it happens
during the quarter. There has been 1 billion invested in mortgages and other asset that
provides a bit higher investment yield. But again, every quarter may be higher or lower,
depending on the availability of these assets and is more of a gradual process.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Okay and if I understood you well, there is no major SCR stream to be extracted from the
re-risk -- is that correct?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, Matthias. So in -- of course, we have seen also in the past that some reduction actually
on our equity exposure, that has had an impact on our reduction on the SCR, but in
general and particularly, the mortgages are not very unfavorable on the contract. As you
know, the balance between the expected return and the regulatory capital consumption
of mortgages continue making it a very attractive asset class for us.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay.

A - Jan-Hendrik Erasmus

{BIO 19801435 <GO>}

Yeah, maybe to add to that, I think we do see, but we look at risk and return when we do
this -- move into higher yielding assets and Delﬁn is correct that when you sell something
like equity and invest it in mortgages, then you would see a beneﬁt of course, where you
sell government bonds and invest it in mortgages, you would see a slight increase in the
SCR, but you shouldn't look at one eﬀect, you should always look at the joint eﬀect on the
portfolio and gradually what we try to do is to optimize the return for a given level of SCR.

The next question is from Mr. Robin van den Broek, Mediobanca. Go ahead, please.

Q - Robin van den Broek

{BIO 17002948 <GO>}

Yes, good morning, everybody. I wanted to talk about the quality of capital a little bit,
because it seems that your other bucket is only down 1% and your Solvency II evolution,
where the guided impact from UFR should already be ﬁve percentage points and also the
interest on non-qualifying debt -- or for qualifying, that should also be one percentage
Page 12 of 26

FINAL

point, so it seems that you have a large oﬀsetting factor which presumably is non eligible
funds becoming eligible. So I was just wondering if you could maybe specify the
headroom you now have in your tiering buckets.
And the second question is on UFR drag, I can remember that in -- I think it was in Q1 16,
that rates moved down and you mentioned that your UFR drag would increase by 100
million per annum. I did some numbers myself, and I think your overall UFR drag with
Delta Lloyd is around 400 million at the moment. And I was just wondering if you could
give some interest rate sensitivity to that number if rates were to go up, how much would
your capital generation improve on the back of that? Those are my questions.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yeah, so thank you, Robin. Delﬁn will take your ﬁrst question and then -- sorry and then
I'm going to ask Jan-Hendrik to talk about the UFR drag and interest rate sensitivities et
cetera.

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Thank you, Robin. Indeed today, the segment Other covers many diﬀerent things, the
biggest negative impact as you rightly said is the reduction of the UFR from 4.2% to
4.05% and this has been reﬂected and very much the impact according to the disclosed
sensitivities.
So you also pointed right to one of the element explaining the positive impact, which is
the reduction of non-eligible own funds, which come as a consequence of the increase of
basic own funds. But there are also many other aspects, among other, model and
assumption changes, some positive impact of the legal merger in Belgium, resulting in a
reduction of the SCR. So, quite a few diﬀerent elements, impacting that change in the
negative 1% in the segment Other, not segment, in the bucket other.

Q - Robin van den Broek

{BIO 17002948 <GO>}

Okay and the headroom in your tiering buckets?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

In terms of the tiering, there is approximately 600 million for restricted Tier 1 and
approximately 200 million for Tier 2. So a bit increase from the previous quarter in
restricted Tier 1 and more or less at the same level or slightly down for the Tier 2.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

So, Jan-Hendrik?

A - Jan-Hendrik Erasmus

{BIO 19801435 <GO>}

Yeah, thank you Robin for the question. The ﬁrst thing to say is that when the UFR change
happened, of course it moved exactly in line with the sensitivity we disclosed before. So
you can see from that and we also think by the way that the next 15 basis point change is
also going to be roughly ﬁve percentage points. In terms of getting it back, you're right, it

Page 13 of 26



Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity
Date: 2018-05-17

comes back over time, of course exactly how quickly and how much depends a lot on
where rates are at that point. But we think it will come back roughly, the way to think
about that is roughly seven to eight percentage points oﬀ the reduction that you see is
what you get back in capital generation when you look forward.

FINAL

Q - Robin van den Broek

{BIO 17002948 <GO>}

And if rates go up by 50 bps, say what kind of reduction of the UFR drag would you
expect or is that something you won't disclose?

A - Jan-Hendrik Erasmus

{BIO 19801435 <GO>}

I don't think we should get into the exact details on that, but what I would do is to look at
the sensitivity we have disclosed and extrapolate a bit from that if I were you and then I
would take that eﬀect and see the 7% to 8% per annum of that own funds movement.

Q - Robin van den Broek

The next question is from Mr. Farooq Hanif, Credit Suisse. Go ahead please.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, there. You alluded to some initial capital synergies in Q1 with Belgium. Can I just ask
sort of roughly factually, the phasing of more capital synergies, that sounds like you may
or may not get internal model approval, but you're hoping to get it this year. So there will
be potentially an uplift then. And then, would you also then get capital synergies and in
the solvency model if you can ﬁnd them next year with the merger? So do we basically
have another sort of two main events for the capital synergies and an uplift in the ratio?
Second point is, on your private equity portfolio, can you remind us of the market value of
that right now and what do you expect the return is? What do you hope to get? Those are
my questions. Thank you very much.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Thanks, Farooq. So on the PIM, et cetera, Jan-Hendrik please and on the private equity
portfolio, Delﬁn. So Jan-Hendrik?

A - Jan-Hendrik Erasmus

{BIO 19801435 <GO>}

Hi, Farooq. Thank you for the question. While our PIM, major model change or expansion
of scope is progressing according to schedule is what I can say. We are still hoping for
approval by the end of the year and that is of course subject to DNB approval. With
regards to capital synergies from that, the ﬁrst thing is to remind you of the 350 million
beneﬁt currently in our standard formula SCR in Delta Lloyd, which we also had in our
annual report, which of course we ﬁrst remove when we move to the internal model. So
any additional beneﬁts ﬁrst have to make good that diﬀerence, so we don't expect

Page 14 of 26



Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity
Date: 2018-05-17

substantial beneﬁts beyond that. And on the merges, I think on the PIM at group level, of
course, you get already the full diversiﬁcation beneﬁt. So there could be a beneﬁt, at sort
of Netherlands Life level in terms of fungibility, but perhaps not a substantial beneﬁt,
additional beneﬁt from the legal merger at the group level.

FINAL

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Maybe I can just quickly ask in 1Q, you mentioned the Belgium merger, but what was the
impact in Other?

A - Jan-Hendrik Erasmus

{BIO 19801435 <GO>}

On the SCR, it was --

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

On the -- yeah, yeah.

A - Jan-Hendrik Erasmus

{BIO 19801435 <GO>}

So on the SCR, there's a small, I mean, you can see in their books, Other, it's also
rounding to less than 0.1. So it's not substantial, these are all small beneﬁts coming
through and as Delﬁn said, it's a number of diﬀerent things in that bucket leading to the
overall beneﬁt that you referred to.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay, thank you.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Then on private equity.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, on the private equity, we have approximately EUR1 billion of private equity
investments and well, what to expect in terms of return, I guess your guess is as good as
mine on this. What -- yeah, I think let's leave it on this. And so it's EUR1 billion and we have
seen so far, I mean, the return has been quite good. So when I look back into the last 14,
15 years of private equity, the return has been very good. But as they say, past
performance is only an indication or what could be the future performance.

FINAL

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Yes, good morning all. Yeah, two questions from my end, more on the operational side.
First on Japan Life. You explained why the technical results were weak in the quarter.
Should we then really see is as some kind of a really one-oﬀ or could there be some
follow-on eﬀect into the following quarters as well, especially on the lower surrender
results. And also in Japan, of course, the cost base corrected for FX was up quite a lot. Is
there also a one oﬀ element in there or is this basically a new kind of cost base going
forward as well?
And secondly, a question operationally, on the non-life operations in Holland, on the
disability business, if I recall I think you were guiding more towards let's say normalized
combined ratio there of 90% to 95%, you were at the high end, we all know that reasons
with high claim trends, that are still unfavorable. Yeah, how is this progressing and how
are you dealing with the book? I mean, should we basically expect the high end of that
range to continue for the -- at least the coming quarters or is there anything more you can
share on that, that will be helpful.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yeah, so thank you, Albert. So ﬁrst on the D&A, I will take that question and then I will
hand over to Delﬁn for the Japan discussion. Well, ﬁrst I'd like to mention that the
disability and accident business is reporting a 95% combined ratio this quarter, which we
believe is a very decent ratio for that business. Indeed, over the last half-year, we've seen
some negative claim developments in the individual business. We've seen some group
income people had on average staying sick longer than expected. Obviously, we're
monitoring these things with -- very closely and we're taking continuous action to ensure
that we maintain a good proﬁtability level also moving forward, but I would say the 95% is
a decent combined ratio for this business.
With that, I would like to hand over to you, Delﬁn for the Japan discussion.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, thank you, Albert for your questions. On Japan Life, more than the quarter in terms of
technical margin being very low, I think is more than the ﬁrst quarter of last year it was
extremely positive, extremely high. We highlighted that at that point of time, as we do
expect basically to see a marginal positive, the technical margin on the quarter is coming
from Japan Life. As you can see under IFRS, we basically show the proﬁts coming mainly
from the fees and premium based revenues, with the technical margin being -- and
investment margin being a very low contribution.
In terms of the cost, what we have seen is investments in order to facilitate our
commercial eﬀort, also the joint venture with Sumitomo. That has come very nicely in
terms of increase of sales and in increased value of new business and also some
investments to take care of additional regulatory requirements. But overall, investments in
order to support as you know, the business and the increased value in-force.

The next question is from Mr. Steven Haywood, HSBC. Go ahead please.

Q - Steven Haywood

Good morning, everybody. A couple of quick questions, I hope. With your cost savings
being increased, has your restructuring charges increased as well. I know you gave
guidance of about 1.5 times the actual cost savings. But if they are on the same program
and the programs just appear more eﬃcient, are the restructuring charges at the same
level or have they actually increased? And second question, on the non-life performance,
you gave an underlying combined ratio of 98.6%. How many quarters do you think there
will be before you get to the sort of 97% target? Thank you.

A - Lard Friese

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks, Steven. Let me take the non-life question and then I'm going to ask Delﬁn to
comment on the restructuring charges. So ﬁrst of all, non-life. Indeed, so if you take out
the impact of the storm, here at 98.6% this quarter for the total non-life business, now we
have launched a program and explained that program on the Capital Markets Day on how
we wish to structurally improve the proﬁtability of this segment and to get to the 97% or
below combined ratio over time and we've taken a range -- we're taking a range of
measures, right? It's cost reductions, it's claims management eﬃciencies, it's recalling
non-proﬁtable products, it is price increases, it is assessing risk and making sure that we
re-price risk et cetera.
So we're doing those in a very granular way and we said that the entire program will take
time. It will take, we said 12 to 24 months before that, all these eﬀects emerge and before
these eﬀects are coming through. Now the good news is, we're seeing already in some
pockets, we're seeing these eﬀects already giving encouraging evidence for instance, one
example, on the NN ﬁre book, we've installed the task force to go through the ﬁre
business, risk by risk and what we're seeing now for ﬁve quarters in a row is a positive
contribution in that -- as a result of these measures. So yes, there can be some volatility,
obviously and large ﬁres can always be there, but we see that already improving quite a
bit and we were and are now doing exactly the same practice on the Delta Lloyd ﬁre
book. So these are all kinds of the things that we're doing to improve it over time.
And with that, I'd like to hand over to Delﬁn for the restructuring discussion.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Hi Steven. So as the cost savings increase, yes, you're right, there are some additional
restructuring charges that will be included. So far, the guidance that we have provided for
restructuring expenses being around 1.5 times the savings, I think it's a good guidance.
Up to this point of time, actually we are a bit below. So we are at 1.3 times. However, this is
also related to the nature of some of the savings that we have incurred that did not
Page 17 of 26



Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity
Date: 2018-05-17

require investments themselves and maybe it's a good opportunity to remind everyone
that both the evolution of the expenses quarter per quarter, as well as when do we incur
in these special items restructuring expenses, there will be some volatility from one
quarter to another. So it's not going to be linear.

Q - Bart Jooris

{BIO 3470300 <GO>}

Yes, hi. Most of my questions have been answered, so some follow-ups here. You report
next to the storm damage, some large ﬁre claims also in Netherlands Non-life. Is that
keeping -- is that then something we've seen already in then previous quarters on the
Delta Lloyd portfolio? Could you give us some more information on that? And then again
coming in at the savings, the raising of the estimate of the savings, you said 200 million
for this year. Could you give us an idea of the evolution you expect for 2019 and 2020 on
timing? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks Bart. So I will take both questions. So ﬁrst on the savings, as we said, we are
ahead. We're very happy to report today that we have already reached the initial
guidance that we gave of having half of the 350 million done by the end of this year,
which is 175 million and we're there already this quarter, so that's encouraging. And as a
result of that, we have given new guidance that we're guiding to 400 million, a raise from
350 million to 400 million, of which at least half will be done this year as of the timing and
yeah, the remainder therefore will come through in 2019 and 2020. Then?

Q - Bart Jooris

{BIO 3470300 <GO>}

Is that back-end loaded completely?

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Well, we -- it's not linear obviously, this will -- over quarters, well, it's not a straight line,
right? So it's over the quarters, you will see some, some changes quarter-by-quarter, but
the direction of travel is pretty clear. At least half of that number done by the end of this
year, the 400 million and the remaining in the next two years.
Then on the ﬁre claims, yeah, we reported some large ﬁre claims. Just also pertaining to
the previous answer that I gave, this is in the Delta Lloyd ﬁre book. So we've seen in the
NN ﬁre book in the past also large ﬁre claims and by the way, that's the nature, right. You
will always have some large ﬁre claims coming through now and then as part of it, but the
more structural direction of travel is obviously that we aim to improve the overall
proﬁtability also of that segment. And if you exclude the storm over the last ﬁve quarters,
Page 18 of 26



Company Name: NN Group NV

the NN portfolio has delivered a positive contribution and we're applying the same
measures that we took on the NN portfolio also to Delta Lloyd portfolio. That is the color
that I can give on that.

The next question is from Mr. Jason Kalamboussis, KBC. Go ahead please.

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

Yes, hi there. Three quick questions for me. The one is on the natcats that you had. Would
you consider to change your reinsurance arrangements and if so, in which direction? The
second question was around the cost. You said that the new cost eﬃciency that you
announced are a bit everywhere. But if I was just to look I think at your percentages, there
is -- the majority seems to be in Belgium, and a little bit in Non-life, if you could conﬁrm
that, that would be great. And the third thing is, if I look at the combined ratio, so just the
P&C one, it was 112.4, if we exclude natcats it seems that is around 100.6%. When do you
think that you're going to sustainably move below the 100 mark?Should we expect that in
Q2 or further out in the year?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Jason. So let me talk about the last question on the combined ratio and
then I would like Jan-Hendrik to discuss the reinsurance arrangements and I'd like Delﬁn
to give -- to discuss the pie chart composition of the expenses et cetera. So ﬁrst on the
combined ratio, I think I've said it in an earlier -- I answered an earlier question as well,
that we believe we need 12 -- at the Capital Markets Day on November 30, we said that we
need 12 to 24 months for a range of measures to come through, to get to the -- to
contribute to the 97% or lower combined ratio. And again on the D&A business, we are at
95% at this point. So on the natcats?

A - Jan-Hendrik Erasmus

{BIO 19801435 <GO>}

Yeah, thank you, Lard. Hello Jason. Thank you for your question. We look at reinsurance
very much to optimize risk and returns. You have to look at the cost and the beneﬁt. Of
course, we change our program every year based on market pricing and also our own
claims in natcats claims and things. At the moment, we have a combination of three
diﬀerent types of reinsurance in place. The ﬁrst one is natcat per event cover. We also
have some per risk reinsurance and then we have an aggregate policy in place. The nice
thing about the aggregate cover for this year is that, if we were to have another storm of
the same magnitude, the impact would be a lot lower. So yeah, we are actively managing
that and we will certainly have a look at the pricing in the market next year and our own
risk appetite.

So Delﬁn?

FINAL

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, Jason, on the cost savings, we announced at the capital markets, the cost savings,
and this is a three years program and also is based on the evolution of the absolute
amount of operating results. So that means that apart from the cost savings that we have
to compensate any inﬂation, any investments that we want to, you know or we are
required to do in order to keep growing. I'm saying that in order to say that it is not
possible to do a perfect as you know estimate of how these administrative expenses are
going to evolve over time up to the end of 2020.
But in general, as you see in slide ﬁve of the presentation, what has been the saving so far
with substantial savings already been done at NN Life and Non-life, but also the level of
corporate holding. And going forward with new savings, most -- all of the units will
beneﬁt. The one with a lower extent is the corporate holding and that also relates to some
re-allocation of the expenses, transfer of expenses charges from head oﬃce to the unit,
that was performed this quarter. But in general, we can see, if you like, some more
modest upgrade on the savings for Netherlands Life and Belgium and the more
substantial ones for non-life and asset management.

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

Thank you very much. If I may have just a follow-up, are you -- on the reinsurance side, are
you basically happy with the outcome on how your reinsurance program worked on these
storms?

A - Jan-Hendrik Erasmus

{BIO 19801435 <GO>}

With the reinsurance program worked according to plan, yeah, so there were no surprises
there. Of course, are you asking whether we are happy that we had such a big 89 million
impact from the storm? Of course, we would have preferred not to have the storm, but
part of insurance is that it is a long-term game, so you really have to look at the results
over a much longer period of time to see whether it will in the end be proﬁtable.

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

Yes, good morning guys. Two questions on my side. First one will be on the impact of the
cost reduction on the own funds capital generation. It has been pretty limited so far, so
you have been -- reported ﬁgures around the 300 million every quarter. What can -- do
you expect actually cost cutting to ﬂow a little bit more in the capital generation on the
own fund side going forward? I'm asking because I see still on the asset management and
Page 20 of 26

FINAL

banking unit for example, still relatively limited amount of cost synergies being I guess -well, implemented also on non-life you're still -- be cost cutting in the pipeline. So can we
expect a bit more cost reduction basically ﬂowing into the operating capital generation?
That will be the ﬁrst question.
And then may be just on if you could come back on the share buyback, assuming no
M&As, what will be the main ﬁgure for the decision? What will be the main thing you are
looking at in terms of taking the decision? Will that be holding cash, moving towards a
certain level Solvency II ratio, PIM approval on the Delta Lloyd models or just markets.
Thanks.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes, Benoit. So let me take the second question ﬁrst, and then I'm asking Delﬁn to give
some color on the ﬁrst question. As you know, we have -- we take a holistic view when it
comes to our capital. We look at very many components and dashboards that we have to
assess the capital evolution and to arrive to a view whether the capital that we have is
beyond our ambition and if it's beyond our ambition and we cannot deploy it in a value
accretive way, then it will go back to stockholders and we will take that decision at the
time that we deem that appropriate. And most importantly, you always need to be
disciplined or rational in the way you think about these things. So that's what we aim to
do. With that Delﬁn, the question on the costs.

capital generation comes at the time of realizing the cost savings themselves, so what has
already been saved has improved their capital generation. The operating capital
generation from these units and in the future, as there is further progress, the cost savings
and the additional proﬁts coming from these entities will contribute to the capital
generation. It becomes more complex when we look at how the cost savings and the
restructuring expenses aﬀect the life business, the long tail business, as at any point of
time, we need to do our reassessment of the future expenses including restructuring
expenses, so on the one hand restructuring expenses impact negatively when you incur
them, but also when you anticipate them that is going to be incurred and on that sense, I
would be expecting only a modest impact on the capitalization of these expenses -expense savings going forward.

FINAL

And the next question is from Mr. Ashik Musaddi, JP Morgan. Go ahead please.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Thank you. Just one simple question I have, actually two. So if I look at the Dutch market
basically, most of the insurance, I mean if I look at Vivat, and if I look at ASR, Aegon as well
as you guys, everyone is trying to do asset re-risking and everyone has big plans. I mean, I
think we are talking and like someone is talking about 5 billion asset re-risking, someone
is talking about 3 billion, 2 billion and clearly, you have some plans as well. So how should
I think about the appetite that is -- or the availability in the market of these illiquid assets?
So it would be good if you can get some color, because based on my understanding,
everyone is trying to go towards mortgage market, but obviously mortgage would have a
ﬁnite market, it would not be like easy to do 15 billion in a year. So how should we think
about that, how much time will it take if market wants to do that 15 billion, 20 billion over
say, next how many years will it take? So that would be the ﬁrst question I have.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second one is, I remember that Delta Lloyd used to have some interest rate exposure
because they used to hedge the Solvency II ratio rather than hedging cash ﬂows. Is that
position is still open, i.e. if interest rate actually go up, will there be economic beneﬁts on
Delta Lloyd cash ﬂows or is it you have closed that position? Thank you.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks Ashik. So Jan-Hendrik, over to you.

A - Jan-Hendrik Erasmus

{BIO 19801435 <GO>}

Yeah, thank you, Ashik for these questions. On the ﬁrst one, it's a good observation,
obviously I can't comment on what other companies are doing. But if I look at what we
see in the market, there is certainly more demand for high yielding illiquid assets than
there is supply, which is also why we are doing this in a very rational and disciplined way,
and not putting a timeline or forcing ourselves to stick to a timeline because we don't
want just put money where you're somehow chasing yield and then not getting it at the
right price. We are of course looking broader than mortgages and we still have some
residual appetite for mortgages and you should also remember that we generate a lot of
the mortgage book ourselves, so that ﬂow will continue and that is something we
continue to rely on. When we look beyond mortgages, of course, we look at emerging
market debt, we look at property, some development property, we have quite a variety of
other illiquid assets that we consider, but all of these things take time, and the most
important thing for us is that we invest in a rational and disciplined way after considering
the risk.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah, but how should I think about the supply in the market, is there -- I mean, is there any
particular number like for example, annual mortgage supply, actually 5 billion, clearly, we
Page 22 of 26

don't have any clue about EM debt and all those could be erratic, but at least, we should
have a bit of clarity about how much annual supply of mortgages is there, in assuming the
status quo, which is banks are still away from that and insurance is taking most of it, so.

FINAL

A - Jan-Hendrik Erasmus

{BIO 19801435 <GO>}

Yeah. Again on the annual ﬁgure for the supply of mortgages, it depends a lot on the
property market, right and how that ﬂows into Netherlands and that will vary quarter to
quarter. I think some new statistics came out last week, which will show you the aggregate
supply of mortgages again.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. Last week, it came out.

A - Jan-Hendrik Erasmus

{BIO 19801435 <GO>}

On the second question, may be to cover the Delta Lloyd interest rate exposure, we have
been gradually moving away from pure hedge of the ratio, that is out of line with what we
normally do. We have said in the past that we aim to match asset and liability cash ﬂows,
where markets are deep and liquid and where it makes sense to do that. So we continue
to look at the duration and convexity, we don't force ourselves to mechanically match
every cash ﬂow because we think it doesn't make sense, given the liquidity that we -- or
the lack of liquidity, frankly, at the long end that we see, but we are also not pursuing a
pure solvency II sort of hedge, if I put it like that.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay, but somewhere, it's in the middle. So if rates will actually go up, it will still be a bit
economical beneﬁt as well rather than just a number related beneﬁt.

A - Jan-Hendrik Erasmus

{BIO 19801435 <GO>}

Yes and you can see from our sensitivities then, if rates go up, that we will beneﬁt also in
our Solvency II ratio, that we have disclosed, yeah.

The next question is from Mr. Farooq Hanif, Credit Suisse. Go ahead, please.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thanks and sorry for prolonging this call so much, but I was just wondering why
you're not worried about the massive shrinkage in pension volumes and the renewals in
Q1? Is it because it's temporary, is it because you actually don't want that business, just
wondering what's going on. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

That's very simple, Farooq. This is Lard. The -- we're not worried at all because here's the
situation. This every -- we have a large book of existing pension contracts, a lot of clients,
by the way, that are with us for a very long time already. So the -- basically the vintage if
you will, so these books have -- these contracts have durations, right, so it -- on average
ﬁve years, but some contracts are three years, some contracts are seven years and
therefore, they come up for renewal. And in one year, you may have more existing
contracts that you already have in your books that are up for renewal that particular year
and then as you have been able to renew them, because they can also go to another
provider, but as you have been able to renew them, then you report it, like -- well, like the
market practices in your APE numbers.
Now, it happens to be that, by the way, most of these renewables are taking place as of
the ﬁrst of the calendar year, so that's why you see it mainly in the ﬁrst quarter. Now this
particular year 2018 is a year in which, the nature of the existing stock of group pension
contracts, there are just less pension contracts this vintage up for renewal than there were
last year for instance. So nothing to do with our appetite to want to have pension clients
or stuﬀ like that. To the contrary, if you look at our market share in the pension market
over the last period has actually increased.

Hi, it's actually William at KBW. My main question is for the conference call is about why I
can't ask a question using my phone, but that's probably a technical problem. Trying to
be quick, sorry to dragging the call out. Delﬁn, right at the beginning, you conﬁrmed, I
think that Delta Lloyd had a positive impact on the Dutch Life result. Can you just conﬁrm
that, that is before allowing for any expense savings that were attributable to the
transaction? Would you require the expense savings for that statement to be true?
Secondly, the Non-life business has the large losses this year interfered with the shortterm outlook for paying dividends to the center or are you still able to maintain the
normal 100 million or so, just based on balance sheet strength. And then lastly, your free
cash ﬂow was visibly lower than net operating proﬁts this quarter, particularly if we allow
for the net operating proﬁts were distressed. Again, I know that there's quarterly volatility
and we shouldn't just judge one quarter. But is this sort of fair to assume that to the extent
that there still seems to be quite a structural gap relative to your statements, that, that gap
is going to be ﬁlled by upstreaming the excess capital out of Dutch Life and therefore
presumably it's contingent on your Solvency at legal mergers, that will be occurring next
year. Thank you.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, so William, happy to hear that the technical issues are over for your phone, so you
can ask your questions. So I'm more than happy to take them. So I'm going to handover
to Delﬁn, but please note for the free cash ﬂow statement, that's -- we always said it's the
free cash ﬂow, our guidance has always been that our free cash ﬂow generation is over
time, in a range around the net operating result of the ongoing business. But anyway, so,
Delﬁn, over to you.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, thank you, William. On your ﬁrst question, the answer is yes. I can conﬁrm that it was
a positive contribution before and after the expense savings that applied to Delta Lloyd
life in the quarter. On your last question on the free cash ﬂow building, what Lard has
already said, we have to see also the seasonality of some of the dividends that we pay out
over the year and again, emphasizing that this free cash ﬂow statement is around our midterm target and indeed, we can still conﬁrm that it is valid. So one cannot look at one
single quarter in isolation.
There was a question on --

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

How did the storm interfere?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Well, obviously the quarter has had a very negative impact on the results of the Non-life
business and as a consequence on their, the surplus capital as well. We have the fortune
of accounting with very diﬀerent business units, very well diversiﬁed from one area to
another and sometimes we have more dividends coming from one unit then therefore

Page 25 of 26

another. So it's fair to say that dividend capacity from the Non-life business has reduced
after an 89 million impact of the storm. You're right on that.

There are no further questions. Mr. Friese, back to you please.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yeah, then I would like to -- thank you, operator. Well, thank you all for being on the call
this morning and thank you all for your time and for your questions. Before we end the
call, let me conclude by saying that I'm pleased with the progress that we are making to
integrate Delta Lloyd into NN Group. The cost savings already realized are well ahead of
our envisaged schedule, and we have announced today that we are raising our cost
reduction guidance to EUR400 million by 2020. Our businesses continue to focus on
driving performance and improving eﬃciency in order to achieve their medium term
targets. There's still a lot of work to do, but we are committed to delivering on our
strategic priorities and create long-term value for all our stakeholders. I wish you all a
pleasant day.
