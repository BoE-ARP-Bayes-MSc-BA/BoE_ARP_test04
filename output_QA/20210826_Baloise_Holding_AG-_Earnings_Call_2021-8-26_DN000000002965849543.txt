FINAL

Let me summarize our feeling as follows. We are proud and we are very satisﬁed with our
half year results '21. Proud, because once again we stand by our clients when they need us
most. We have helped and are helping our clients to cope with the actually consequences
of the extraordinary natural catastrophes that have happened in June and July. But
besides being proud, we are also very satisﬁed because despite these exceptional
circumstances we have delivered a very strong half year result.
Our bottom line exceeds CHF300 million which is 70% higher than half year 2020. Our
growth is strong in non-life, over 8%, and in the capital-light investment type life business
over 30%. The underlying quality of our non-life and life portfolio is very strong. The
combined ratio in non-life is despite, as I said, the extreme and the extraordinary storms
life by 92.3%, which is clearly in the bandwidth of our targets 90 to 95. And in life, we
have achieved an EBIT of almost CHF200 million. Our innovation strength and power
remains unchanged and high. We are digitizing and digitalizing our core business
stronger and faster. We have entered with FRIDAY in France. We have concluded
additional partnerships in the ecosystem Home and started many initiatives in the
ecosystem Mobility.

Bloomberg Transcript

Given our strong half year results '21, we are and I am convinced that we will reach all our
strategic goals in the current strategic phase Simply Safe: Season 1 until the end of this
year. We're also very conﬁdent for the outlook of this year and we will start Simply Safe:
Season 2 as of 2022 with tailwind. Again, summarizing, proud and very satisﬁed.
And having said that, I would like to open for the Q&A together with Carsten, Matthias,
the colleagues and Markus. Please go ahead. It's too early to promise a beer for the ﬁrst
question, but anyway we are waiting for the ﬁrst question.

Questions And Answers
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The ﬁrst
question comes from Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. The ﬁrst question was on the nat cats that you've experienced. I
mean, you've guided to CHF40 million for June and high double-digit for July. So I guess
over CHF100 million in total. Could you just remind us how your reinsurance cover works
for these? What your exposure is per event, reinstatement premium, maximum exposure?
That would be very helpful. The second question is, if I look at your EBIT metrics on Slide
39, I guess the other result of minus 38 is a bit higher than usual. And also if I look within
non-life, there is an other of minus 80 million, which is a bit higher than usual. Speaking to
IR, it seems some of that was due to FX and maybe investments in FRIDAY. But I'm just
wondering and I apologize, I've asked this question before, but are you able to give us
any guidance on what you consider a sort of underlying normal level or, I mean, if you are
now positioned, how you would model those two numbers in particular going forward?
And then maybe ﬁnally, on costs, could you just remind us sort of to what extent any
Page 2 of 13

integration costs are aﬀecting these results and if there is any left to come? Thank you
very much.

FINAL

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Thank you, Peter. Let me hand over the question on reinsurance to Carsten and I will try to
pick up the other two questions, of course, I would say, amended by comments of
forecast and then Matthias afterwards. But ﬁrstly, up to you Carsten on reinsurance and cat
nat events.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning, Peter, and thank you for your questions. So it's right, we have
CHF40 million in H1 and we expect a high double digit on top of that for H2 as of today.
So the reinsurance program or the reinsurance coverage is based on excess of loss. Nat
cat coverage, it depends on the lines of business. What it will imply in the end, I think we
need to wait a little bit until we see the structure of the events to be able to quantify this.
But as we speak, we are expecting a high double-digit number on top of the CHF40
million that we already have accounted for in the ﬁrst half. The second question was on
EBIT.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Yeah. So let me ﬁrst handle the others, the group business if you want or the others. I
think that the large part of that number is indeed aﬀected by FRIDAY results. That is clear.
FRIDAY is still prioritizing growth over proﬁtability. So it's still an investment. So that's the
bigger part of the others in EBIT. If you look at non-Life EBIT, couple of things maybe. Of
course, there has been the exceptional storms in June, which account for net CHF40
million approximately, which has an impact. It's also the fact that the half year 2020 has of
course known somewhat -- not somewhat, deeper frequency in claims. So that has, I
would say, normalized in the half year 2021. So that also plays a role. And what is certainly
also the case is that from a capital market size, from a ﬁnancial income point of view, we
have been a bit holding back on non-life, maybe a bit more on life then to compensate,
but that certainly also has its eﬀect.
And then the third question on costs. Belgium is still integrating of course Fidea and the
ex-Generali, so the Athora business, that will last until 2023. So there are indeed some
integration cost going on until 2023. There are -- we are expecting actually CHF40 million
to CHF50 million additional beneﬁt P&L in Belgium, given the integration after 2023. In
the costs in Belgium, especially, there is also one-oﬀ we should take into account, which
was actually the activation of the acquisition costs in Fidea last year. So that's a one-oﬀ we
need to account for. And of course, we have a lot of digitalization, digitization projects
going on. Also, the IFRS 79 project, of course, which is absorbing a lot of capacity and
needs investment. So that projects are inﬂuencing certainly the cost side.
Not -- just, Carsten, anything to add to the questions of Peter? No? Fine? Okay.

Could I -- thank you very much. It's very helpful. Could I perhaps just quickly come back
on the reinsurance in the nat cat and just maybe to help us understand, if we get further
events, how should we think about any likely exposure? Are you able to help us there on
how reinsurance may or may not kick in going forward?

FINAL

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

Well, that's at this stage hypothetical, but if we get further events, that qualify for
reinsurance coverage, then reinsurance will take its fair share according to the contracts
and the limits. But we will -- even with further events, we will stay within our 90% to 95%
net combined ratio bracket. And it doesn't have an impacts on the ambition going into
Simply Safe: Season 2. It always depends...

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So it always depends, Peter. It always depends on what's the nature of the event and
which are the lines of business that are aﬀected. And that's why we would need to know
how this event look like. We had a fair share of event already this year. I'd say this with a
twinkle in my eye, so we had our share and are not unhappy if we don't have further, but if
we have further events, of course, then we are going to cover the clients' needs ﬁrst and
then talk to the reinsurers as we do now.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. Carsten, appreciate it. Thank you very much.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

You are welcome.

The next question comes from Simon Fossmeier from Vontobel. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Simon Fossmeier
Good morning and thank you for taking my question. It's Simon from Vontobel. And I will
take the beer if nobody else claims it. My question is on life insurance. The EBIT is pretty
strong. If I look at the half year result in 2019 and 2020, half year EBIT is less than half of
the full year. So if I just double the 195, you would end up being substantially above your
guidance of having at least CHF200 million. So any special eﬀects in the ﬁrst half year that
inﬂuenced the EBIT in life? Thank you.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Thank you, Simon. Couple of points maybe on the life result. The guidance we are giving
is a minimum of CHF200 million. So it's a ﬂoor, that has always been the case. Even in
Page 4 of 13



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG

Date: 2021-08-26

FINAL

diﬃcult capital markets and interest rate environments, that said, the CHF200 million is
the guidance as a ﬂoor. That's one. Secondly, the strategy in life for years has been hard
work. So on the active side, we are trying of course to optimize the yield on one side. On
the passive side, in life, we have been working with capital-light new business and
balancing our portfolio. We have been lowering guarantees. We have from time to time
also deliberately reserved in order to bring the guaranteed interest rate down. So it's hard
work. That's one point.
Of course, in the ﬁrst half year of '21, what you see with the interest rates rising have
allowed us not to reserve and that's certainly an advantage. And the core capital market
conditions in the ﬁrst half year have been also favorable. So that's why we see -- if interest
rate environment and capital markets are, I would say, favorable, then we get tailwind in
the life business and then indeed we clearly exceed then the CHF200 million ﬂoor
guidance that we have given. Looking forward to the end of the year, it is -- as I said, it's
hard work and we continue the hard work on the active and the passive side, but it also
depends, of course, on the interest rate environment in the capital market.

Q - Simon Fossmeier
Okay. Understood. Thank you.

Next question comes from Thomas Bateman from Berenberg. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Bateman

{BIO 21707516 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just ﬁrst one on innovation
investments. I know that Simply Safe: Season 2 isn't going to begin [ph] until next year.
But it feels like you are already investing here in 2021. So can you give us any indication of
how much was invested thus far and how much you may this year? The second question is
just on the loss ratio in Switzerland. I understand there was COVID in 2020, the hailstorms
in 2021, but this is a slight uptick on sort of underlying trends in Switzerland. So is there
anything that's driving this? And ﬁnal question, just on the improvement in the new
business margin in life, up to 47.6%. How much better can this get as the business mix
improves? Thank you.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Thank you, Thomas. Let me try to start answering the question. Innovation is of course not
new. I think since we started Simply Safe: Season 1 back in 2017, we have been focusing on
innovation and not only on innovation beyond insurance, but also very importantly
innovating within our core business to make it more eﬃcient and more easy for our
partners and clients to work with us. So innovation is certainly not a new event that will
start as of next year with Season 2. We have invested indeed over the last couple of years
in innovation, have also done so in 2021. If you take the innovation, I would say, budget in
the core business, so really investing in IT and so forth. We have -- we are around CHF100
million a year more or less. If you look going forward, we have said, from the cash that we
will generate, we will actually invest 10% to 30% in innovation in the core business and in
initiatives beyond insurance.

If you look at Switzerland and the loss ratio, I will hand over to Carsten.

FINAL

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Thomas, for this question. If we look at Switzerland, the last few years,
there was an alternation of years of normal years, but also years with, in the ﬁrst half, very
benign claims environment or years with high load of claims like, for example, last year.
And bearing this in mind, the underlying book is technically very strong. But there have
been ﬂuctuations, especially from large claims loads and nat cat events over the last few
years. But having said that, we don't see particular trends as we speak.
And if we take the improvement question on the new business in -- new business margin
in life, obviously it depends on the market environment and on what is the business mix
that we are selling to the customers. It beneﬁted in the ﬁrst half of this year again from
products with low or no guarantees on the one hand and of -- from the high pickup in
investment-linked products. So it's -- it depends what the market environment does with
regard to customer behavior and where we put our eﬀorts in -- with regard to new
business mix from a product perspective. But certainly the level, nearly 50%, is very good
and it shows that the focus -- that's the hard work also on the product design side and
distribution side is paying oﬀ.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

And maybe one more element or one more thought on the non-life underlying in
Switzerland. We have said that with the combined ratio on the Group level of 92.3%, there
is a 2.1% impact of the storms and the ﬂoods in June. And of course the large majority of
that part was in Switzerland and Germany has also been hit partially, but the July
ﬂoodings were actually, especially Germany and Belgium. So June and half year is
especially Switzerland and that's why the underlying quality of the non-life book in
Switzerland remains exceptionally strong.

Q - Thomas Bateman

{BIO 21707516 <GO>}

Okay. Good morning, all. So again just quickly on this -- follow-up on Peter's question on
reinsurance. I had a look at, let's put that way, in the Annual Report on Page 176, as you
explained, your life and non-life insurance strategies and it says like the Group's maximum
retention for -- towards these claims is CHF20 million and the retention for individual
clients of CHF16 million for property claims and so on and so on. So I guess what will be
interesting for us analysts is just to explain to us later in the year or then next year how
your reinsurance cover has evolved now with the June, July nat cats we have seen. I
mean, just any idea because when I'm just looking at your strategy, yeah, it's for me hard
to understand how you can end up with a high double-digit net claim.
So, and then on Germany, please, as this Germany, I think, is very interesting and you
have a very strong combined ratio. So, I am on Slide 37 and basically the non-life, I guess,
is the other gross premiums. If I take a 90% retention, if net premiums of some 466, [ph]
then if I calculate on the writing margin of 7.3%, I would end up with, on the writing, proﬁt
of CHF34 million in the non-life. And then when I look at on Slide 39, non-life EBIT is
CHF4.2 million. I mean, is my thinking wrong? Do I miss something here? I guess, it has to
do with the investments in non-life, but perhaps you can shed a bit more light on
Germany non-life.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then question for Mr. Henny. I have seen you have cap increase with the borrowers, this
property fund I guess that was at the end of July. And interestingly, I mean, real estate is
still a very hot topic. I was wondering how you see. Is it for an asset manager to ﬁnd
interesting real estate assets in the current market environment.
Then if I may on Slide 21, I mean, you have touched already on the life result, but I think
this proﬁt by sources is very interesting. Is there -- these high selling result, is it partly
oﬀset by higher policyholder participation, I guess, just as a clariﬁcation? And then it's just
interesting in FRIDAY, I mean, strategy in France. Could you just shed a bit more light here
about investments, products, what are you targeting here? Thank you.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Thank you, Rene. It's very bunch of questions. So let me start with a couple of them and
then hand over to Carsten and Matthias. I'll take care Germany and FRIDAY strategy in
France if you want and then distribute the rest of the questions among Carsten and
Matthias.
Germany, as you have seen over the last couple of years, we've really transformed
Germany. We have -- in life, we are clearly going for only biometric capital-light solutions.
In non-life, we have exited the industry portfolio and focusing and growing in retail lines
and SME and that pays oﬀ, because you see the combined ratio in Germany has come
down and has been at the very good levels and stable since a couple of years. And that is
one. Secondly, there is also of course investments going on -- heavily investments in the
non-life platform in Germany with the Guidewire platform where we are really investing
and part of that investment is not in the combined ratio. That's about almost 1%, I would
say, of combined ratio. Then there is a very technical explanation on reinsurance and
shifting from one segment to the others, but I think that's too technical for me, so I'll leave
that to Carsten afterwards.

On the FRIDAY strategy in France, we have launched FRIDAY in France in -- as of 1st of
July. And actually the product we have launched there is what is called in French multi-risk
(Foreign Language) So it's actually a combination, if you want, of household, home
insurance, and liability insurance, which is a mandatory insurance product in France for
home owners, but also renters. And it combines, as I said, the home liability and to some
extent, legal assistance. This product is easier than car, so that's why we have chosen this
strategy. It's also more proﬁtable than car in France. So that's the reason why we have
launched this multi-risk (Foreign Language) in France. And it also -- as FRIDAY is a multicountry, multi-channel, multi-product strategy and has been designed as such, it allows us
to prepare actually liability launch in Germany. So it's actually -- that is the reason why we
have chosen this path in France. If you look at FRIDAY overall, we have been growing
year-on-year with 100% since the launch in 2017. I've have done so also in 2020 with over
100,000 customers and have also doubled again if you look at half year premium of
FRIDAY in 2021. So overall good on track.
But for other questions on reinsurance on Germany and on the real estate side, so
handing over to Carsten and Matthias.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Thank you, Gert. I'd pick up on your explanation with regard to Germany. One of
the reasons, and you mentioned reinsurance, is the group internal reinsurance
relationships between Germany and the group internal reinsurance carrier which is
accounted for in the segment group business. And that's from a segmental view explains
part of the missing part in your equation.
Then, with regard to your clarifying question on Page 21, it is absolutely true that the
development with regards to the savings result has to be looked at hand-in-hand with the
policyholder participation and there you also -- there you see that the higher results
stemming from the capital market development is mirrored in the policyholder
participation. So that's exactly the way you described it and that's the way it is. With
regard to reinsurance, we'll get back to this later on in the year once things have settled.
And with regard to the Swiss Property Fund, I will hand over to Matthias

A - Matthias Henny

{BIO 17600048 <GO>}

Yes, thank you for the question. So, indeed, we are actually doing a capital increase in the
Baloise Swiss Property Fund. The response has been very good and it will be executed by
the 1st of September. In this capital increase, there is a transfer of real estate from the
balance sheet of Baloise to the Swiss Property Fund and the reason for that is that those
properties do no longer ﬁt into the real estate portfolio from an insurance asset
perspective. So it's actually not that we have purchased those real estate on the market.
It's been a transfer. In general, it's rather diﬃcult to ﬁnd real estate currently at reasonable
prices and we are very selective in acquiring. We always ensure that the yield is ﬁne, so
that we can ensure that each property can contribute to the long-term investment result.

FINAL

Yeah. This is interesting. I mean, I'm always like not wondering, but I have to say, if I am a
policyholder of Baloise Insurance, I shouldn't be so happy to see that part of the real
estate portfolio is then like carved out and shifted to the asset management. You see my
point because, it's still hard to get yield on the bonds and so on and so on. And
interestingly, well, I mean, you are not the only one, but then it's very interesting to see
how this works.

A - Matthias Henny

{BIO 17600048 <GO>}

I mean, to comment on that, it's primarily driven by asset allocation consideration. So, for
example, if individual life we have decreasing asset base due to maturing traditional life
business with the guarantee. This means, over time, just to keep the ratio constant, we
need to dispose of real estate. And of course this disposition, when we transfer it to the
Fund, it's on market values.

Q - Rene Locher

{BIO 1921075 <GO>}

Yeah, I know. That I fully understood. So it's little bit like a warehousing, right? So it's like
on the insurance balance sheet and then you just carve it out and shift it over to the asset
management. It's just okay. Thank you very much.

The next question comes from Farquhar Murray from Autonomous. Please go ahead, sir.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Farquhar Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Morning, all. Two, possibly three questions from me, but I will try and keep it brief. They
are all related to the nat cat numbers. Just starting with the ﬁrst half number of CHF40
million, would you by chance have the gross amount of claims against that net ﬁgure I
presume? I'm sorry if I missed that earlier. Then with regards to the higher double digit
amount in the second half, is most of that Belgium or Germany just in terms of
composition? And then as a subsidiary question, for Belgium, does that include an
estimate for the kind of request from the Walloon government for what we might call a
kind of solidarity contribution? Thanks.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Yeah. So thanks for the questions. On nat cat, the ﬁrst half were mainly the storms and
largely in Switzerland. The second half will contain also the ﬂoodings and the other
jurisdictions like Germany and Belgium. So with regards to your ﬁrst question, obviously
it's a little higher, but it's not that much higher than the CHF40 million that we have
stated.
Then the second half, where does it come from, it's certainly more stemming from other
jurisdictions like Germany, Belgium, but also Luxembourg, which means that overall
looking at the nat cat year 2021, all our business units and geographies will be impacted
by the events so far.

Thank you, Gert. Maybe also a big complement -- an additional remark on the second
question. If you look at the July storms and natural catastrophes and looking at the
numbers, it is true that the majority is coming out. Of course all our markets are hit
including Switzerland and Luxembourg, but Germany and Belgium are indeed hit the
most. If you look at the recent evolutions, Germany was talking about 5.5 billion. I've seen
this morning that it goes direction of 7 billion. So it's indeed -- it's -- the average claims are
probably higher than initially expected. So there is still an evolution there. And also
Belgium is actually moving towards the 2 billion of total claims for the overall market.
What is important for us is to stand by our clients. So that's the ﬁrst priority, to help them
out. Ten thousands of them have been hit also in Belgium and there are discussions going
on and there has been solutions being brought to the table between the Association of
Insurance companies in Belgium and the Walloon government. And we stick to that. So
we are loyal to of course the agreement that has been found and are also discussing and
that is part of the discussion also with reinsurance whether this part of the claims will also
be covered by reinsurance or not. But it's an ongoing discussion. First priority is helping
out our clients

Q - Farquhar Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Just to follow on, are you assuming some coverage for that voluntary contribution from
the reinsurers? I presume your base assumption is zero.

Hi, it's Jimmy Fan here from UBS. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two, please.
My ﬁrst one is on the underlying performance of the non-life business. I guess, if I look at
the underlying loss ratio bits, if I were to carve [ph] the adjustments also considering the
COVID beneﬁt and the real underlying level needs to be kind of back to the pre-COVID
level. Also seeing on the expense side, you mentioned it was a bit elevated (inaudible)
due to the one-oﬀs. Actually could you give me a bit of color in terms of what you are
planning to do or doing in terms of pricing versus claims kind of dynamic in diﬀerent
markets? Also on the expense side, given you are going into a new strategic phase, there
is a lower core target. My second question is about Belgium and the top line. It's really
good there even excluding the deal impact. Is there anything new in terms of business
development there, how should we think about the momentum going forward? Thank
you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Thank you, Jimmy. Let me start with a couple of points in trying to answer your questions.
If you look at the underlying performance quality non-life, what we do not see is claims
inﬂation on one side. It is of course the competitive environment. So the pricing
competition is there, especially in car business and in corporate business, I would say,
corporate lines. Yes, pretty stable, competition is normal. So there is nothing special
going on there, I would say. From an ambition point of view, in Simply Safe: Season 2
starting as of next year, we are actually leaving behind the bandwidth of the combined
ratio of 90 to 95 and, say, we target an area of 90% combined ratio. And we also
expressed the ambition to lower our costs by CHF200 million in Simply Safe: Season 2. So
we are working at all diﬀerent aspects of pricing claims underlying quality costs going
forward. And that also, of course, in these results that we want to see and that we are
working towards in non-life contribute substantially to the cash target of CHF2 billion over
four years, which is 25% plus compared to Season 1.
If you look at the Belgium top line, indeed, we are not only in Belgium satisﬁed with the
top line. If you look at the overall top line of our group, it's over 9% combining non-life,
life, and the investment type of business. In Belgium, of course, there has been also a very
strong growth. It's partially due also to the ex-Generali Athora integration, which was not
fully integrated in the numbers in half year 2020, but also the organic growth in Belgium
is very strong, with almost 8%.
It's due to a couple of factors, I would say. One is our very strong relationship and
reputation with the broker community. Belgium in non-life especially is a very dominated
a broker market. So we have very strong reputations in this and a very strong relationship.
Secondly, we are, of course, number four in Belgium. So we cannot be ignored. So all the
brokers are working with us and we have only recently over the last couple of years
entered into the Walloon area. So the potential for growth is still very strong and valid in
the southern part of Belgium. And as we have focused primarily on the retail markets over
the last couple of years, we are getting a lot of traction in the SME market. And Belgium is
an SME market. So that's where actually the growth factors and elements come from in
Belgium, but not only in Belgium.

We have a follow-up question from Thomas Bateman from Berenberg. Please go ahead,
sir.

Hi, thanks for the opportunity to follow up. Just on FRIDAY, also can you give us some
more details on the capital raise and maybe just an update on premiums and the loss
ratio at half-year? Thank you.

Yeah. Thank you, Thomas. Glad to do so. Since the launch of FRIDAY in 2017, we are
actually pursuing a multi-country expansion and growth strategy. That's clear. That's also
why we entered in France building on the synergies and the capabilities, the assets and
the know-how we have built in Germany. It is indeed our strategy to expand further and
therefore we need of course additional capital. And that's why we have said also a couple
of weeks ago that we are open for additional strategic ﬁnancial investors who would
actually contribute to the strategy of FRIDAY and the growth strategy of FRIDAY
throughout Europe. That's why we have said that and we are exploring all the diﬀerent
alternatives, I would say, or ﬁnancial options that we have, so we are pretty open there for
additional investors, but there are of course other alternatives.
If you look at FRIDAY, as I said before, the year-on-year premium growth has been almost
100% every year. That's also the case half year 2021. So we were up over EUR30 million
premium at the end of 2020 and we have exceeded half year that same amount. And if
you look at the technical proﬁtability of FRIDAY, it is improving year-on-year. So you see
the technical cohorts actually in terms of proﬁtability, in terms of churn, in terms of loss
ratio improving year-on-year. So that's a very good sign towards breakeven in the
midterm.
