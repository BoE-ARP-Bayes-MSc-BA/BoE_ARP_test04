Presentation
Operator
Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited Second Quarter 2012
earnings release call. Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time for opening
remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Beth Farrell.

Beth Farrell

{BIO 19732216 <GO>}

Good morning. Welcome to Everest Re Group Second Quarter 2012 earnings conference
call. On the call with me today are Joe Taranto, the Company's Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer; Dom Addesso, our President; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial
Officer.
Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include
extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note
that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as
statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various
risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or
expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in
connection with such statements.
Now, let me turn the call over to Joe.

FINAL

Thanks, Beth. Good morning. We are pleased with our results through the first six months.
Our comprehensive income for that period is $590 million. During the six months, we
purchased $225 million of our stock, paid $51 million in dividends, and still increased our
surplus $346 million, or 6%. Book value per share adjusted for dividends has increased
10%. Our annualized operating earnings ROE was 16%.
Our reinsurance book has been positioned to capitalize on the best opportunities, which
have generally been on the property risks, as rates, terms and conditions improved in the
last couple of years in response to loss activity. We have done this without meaningfully
increasing our PMLs in any peak zones. We are pleased with our mid-year renewals. Dom
will provide more detail on this shortly.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our insurance book has also been positioned to capitalize on our best opportunities. This
includes our D&O operations, our A&H medical stop loss business, and select property
businesses, which continue to be profitable areas for us, as well as California workers'
comp business and our general liability book, where the market continues to improve, and
our crop book. Again, Dom will provide more detail. Our $16 billion of invested assets
continue to perform well, particularly given the challenges of finding quality investments in
the current market.
As previously announced, I will continue as CEO through the end of 2013, at which point,
Dom will become the CEO. I'm excited about continuing to lead our Company through
this year and next, and thrilled to have such a high quality individual, Dom Addesso, lead
our Company for many years thereafter. I like our team, our portfolio, and our plan. Our
Company has never been stronger, our future has never been brighter. Dom?

Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Thank you, Joe. Good morning. As Joe indicated, we have had an excellent quarter
overall. The year so far is playing out generally as expected, with the attritional combined
ratio improving by 1 point compared to the first six months of 2011. Rate increases and
improving terms are beginning to work through the reinsurance property results.
Total cat premium year-over-year has increased $200 million, with approximately 0.5 of
that being rate increase. These results are also benefiting from the shift of pro rata to
excess. While this has a dampening effect on premium, the positive impact on margin is
flowing through the loss and expense ratios. The combined ratio on our reinsurance
property portfolios, which has not yet been fully reflected through earnings, has improved
by 11 points.
On the treaty casualty side, we are beginning to see modest rate increase work through
the results. It has not yet reached a level where we feel the need to aggressively expand,
but the future opportunities may be more appealing over time. In that regard, we are
beginning to enhance our teams and structure to maximize our resources around the
globe.

FINAL

Overall, reinsurance premiums for the quarter were down, but this was due to foreign
currency, reinstatement premiums, and the one-time effect of a cancelled quota share
contract. After eliminating the effect of these items, premiums were up 17% for the
quarter. This was a result of the previously mentioned rate increases in many of our
businesses.
The Florida market at June 1 saw cat rates move up on average by 5%. Canada property
rate movements were similar. The Asian markets had the largest moves, where rates in
loss-affected regions were up 20%-plus. In Japan, we saw terms improve on proportional
treaties, although we did move some capacity to excess structures. July renewals in
Australia and New Zealand also had upward movement in rates due to losses in those
markets. Increases here were in excess of 10% to 20%. In all other international regions,
property rate changes were relatively flat.

Bloomberg Transcript

As I mentioned, approximately 0.5 of the cat exposed premium increase was rate. But the
balance reflects new business opportunities for us in non-peak zones. Our total cat
exposed premium through six months is $740 million. By year-end this is expected to be
approximately $1 billion, with no material increase in peak PML zones. This expansion
reflects our appetite to expand as markets improve, and most importantly, our ability to
execute due to the capability of our staff and the desire of the market for our well-rated
capacity.
Improving markets and portfolio changes in both property and casualty has resulted in
excess of $100 million of underwriting profit for the quarter, and $218 million year-to-date
for our reinsurance operations. Excluding cats and reinstatement premiums, the
reinsurance segment's combined ratio for the year has trended down to 83.7%. This
should continue to improve with the shift to excess.
On the insurance side, results for the quarter and year-to-date are unfolding as expected.
Our growing primary A&H business, plus double-digit rate increases continuing in both
workers' comp and our general casualty lines, are all contributing to a solid 96.5%
combined ratio for the quarter. Our professional liability portfolio is also performing well,
and the runoff of terminated programs is nearing its end.
Currently, the only headwind in the insurance book is the crop business. We have only 24%
of the crop portfolio in the most severely affected states, yet we have booked
conservatively for the year-to-date at a small underwriting profit. While it's still early to
predict an outcome here, it's less likely to have a material impact on the annual results
since the total (MPCI) writings for the year will approximate $135 million, and we do
purchase stop loss coverage on this book. Overall, the insurance book continues to move
in the right direction, with an underwriting profit for the quarter and year-to-date.
As we move through the Third Quarter, the indications for all segments are still positive.
We are moving into the US hurricane season and that still has to play itself out, but July
property renewals in the US and Australia were strong. The casualty market continues to
move in the right direction. For workers' comp, we are into our third year of rate increases.
Our property portfolio has been expanding into non-peak zones, and rates are at

Page 3 of 17

sustainable levels. We have made some organizational changes and additions in key
management positions in both the US and internationally, which will allow us to move
forward in expanding our footprint in new and different ways.

FINAL

Given our size, credit quality and market positioning, we are a market that brokers and
clients are interested in doing business with. With these changes, I'm confident that we
can effectively execute on the right transactions and in the right way.
I will now ask Craig to take us through the further details on the financials.

Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Thank you, Dom. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report that Everest had
another very strong quarter, with after-tax operating income of $223 million, or $4.25 per
diluted common share. In comparing these results to last year, consideration must be
given to the record catastrophes experienced in 2011. Net income for the Second Quarter
was $214.6 million, or $4.08 per diluted share. Net income includes realized capital losses
for the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

On a year-to-date basis, operating income was $462.9 million, or $8.72 per share. This
represents an annualized operating return on equity of 16.1%. Net income year-to-date is
$519.3 million, or $9.79 per share. This net income includes realized capital gains for the
year. These results are reflective of the year-to-date overall attritional combined ratio
improving 1 point, from 87.8% down to 86.6%. This measure excludes the impact of
catastrophes and reinstatement premiums.
The total reinsurance attritional combined ratio was 83.7%, compared to 84.7% in the prior
year. The reinsurance segments would have improved even more if not for the $30 million
charge in the marine line for the Costa Concordia cruise ship, $10 million of which was
booked this quarter. This includes the estimated $200 million of additional cost to remove
the wreck.
The insurance segment attritional combined ratio was 98.7%, compared to 99.3% in the
prior year. This ratio was much better than the 105.8% ratio for the full year of 2011. These
improvements should continue as rate increases continue to earn in over time. Also
providing better margins is the shift in our portfolio from quota share to excess of loss.
Gross written premiums of $909 million for the quarter were down 8% compared to the
Second Quarter of 2011. This decline is primarily driven by the non-renewal of one large
Florida quota share reinsurance contract in the quarter. More on this later. On a year-todate basis, gross written premiums were $1.96 billion. This represents a decline of 2%
after adjusting for reinstatement premiums and the effects of foreign currency
movements.
Earned premiums of $1.04 billion for the quarter were flat compared to the same quarter
last year. Earned premiums of $2 billion on a year-to-date basis have not changed
significantly year-over-year. We have achieved strong rate increases on portions of our
Page 4 of 17

FINAL

book, especially on catastrophe exposed risks. However, the shift in capacity away from
proportional risk, does mask this effect, as excess of loss business carries lower premium.
The reinsurance segments reported year-to-date earned premiums of $1.6 billion, up 1%
over 2011. Reinsurance written premiums of $1.5 billion were down 3% over the same
period. However, written premiums were flat year-over-year after adjusting for
reinstatement premiums and foreign exchange. For the quarter, written premiums of
$654 million were down 10%, after adjusting for reinstatement premium and foreign
exchange. The decline in the reinsurance written premium this quarter is primarily driven
by the non-renewal of a large Florida quota share contract. The reinsurance segment
written premium would have been up 14% for the quarter, excluding the impact of the
return premium on this transaction. The written premium would have been up 17%,
excluding the impact of reinstatement premiums and foreign exchange.

Bloomberg Transcript

The non-renewal of this contract allowed us to deploy our capital elsewhere, and write
other excess of loss covers in Florida. In fact, we remain a significant writer of excess loss
business in Florida. This fits our strategy of shifting our portfolio toward excess of loss
business where we feel underwriting margins have seen the most improvement. We
expect to see continued improvement in the expected margins to earn in over time,
assuming normal catastrophe year in Florida.
The insurance segment reported $212 million of earned premium for the quarter, which
was flat compared to the Second Quarter of 2011. On a year-to-date basis, insurance
earned premiums of $392 million were down 8% year-over-year. This is primarily due to
the runoff of certain program business, and lower crop premium in the current year. Last
year, the crop premium earned evenly throughout the year as reinsurance premiums.
The insurance segment reflects $35 million of seasonal earned premium from crop
business in the Second Quarter, with $39 million now earned year-to-date. We expect fullyear net premium from this book to total about $150 million. We are currently booking the
crop business at a 95% combined ratio, but it's still too early to tell the overall impact that
the record drought conditions in the US will have on this book. However, as Dom
mentioned, the Company does purchase stop loss reinsurance coverage for its crop
portfolio, and the MPCI cover attaches at a 110% loss ratio.
Our reported combined ratio is 89.0%. This is for both the quarter and year-to-date. All
segments reported underwriting gains for both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis.
The overall underwriting gain was $114.5 million for the quarter, and $224 million for the
year so far. Total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $107 million for the quarter,
and a $218.7 million gain year-to-date. The insurance segment reported a $7.4 million
underwriting gain for the quarter, and a $5.3 million gain year-to-date.
The commission ratio for the quarter is up 2.8 points compared to the prior-year quarter.
This increase relates to a number of one-time adjustments and settlements, and the
change in accounting for deferred acquisition costs. We expect this ratio to return to a
normal run rate of 22% to 23% over the next several quarters. For the quarter, we
recorded $30 million of losses for current year catastrophes. These losses are primarily

Page 5 of 17

FINAL

related to a number of tornadoes and other severe weather in the US this quarter. This
brings our year-to-date gross catastrophe losses to $60 million for 2012, or 2.9% of
earned premiums.
Regarding 2011 catastrophe losses, we have reallocated a portion of the $50 million cat
IBNR established at the end of last year to cover higher estimates on certain events, in
particular the 2011 New Zealand earthquake. We still have $30 million of this catastrophe
IBNR remaining. As for other loss reserves, we released our 2011 global loss development
triangles in June. There were really no major changes since the 2010 release. In fact, our
quarterly internal reserving analysis continues to develop favorably.
For investments, pretax investment income was $149.3 million for the quarter, and $301.8
million year-to-date on our $16 billion investment portfolio. Year-to-date, investment
income declined $35.6 million from one year ago. This decrease is primarily driven by
lower limited partnership income, which was down $22 million this year, and by declining
reinvestment rates.

Bloomberg Transcript

The quarter reflected $16.6 million of pretax realized capital losses, and $8.5 million of
losses after tax. But we had $82.1 million of pretax realized capital gains on a year-to-date
basis, and $56.3 million of gains after tax. On income taxes, the 12.9% effective tax rate on
operating income for the quarter reflects, one, the impact of the realized capital losses in
this quarter on the annualized effective tax rate calculation. And two, other one-time tax
adjustments. 7.4% year-to-date effective tax rate on operating income is within our
expected range for the year.
Turning to other miscellaneous items, the $16.3 million derivative loss for the quarter
relates to the decline in the equity markets and interest rates during the quarter. On a
year-to-date basis, we reported a derivative loss of $10.1 million, compared to a derivative
gain of $4.2 million in the prior year. Other income for both the quarter and the year
largely reflects foreign exchange gains in the periods, as compared to foreign exchange
losses a year ago. This is primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar against other
world currencies.
Operating cash flows were $139 million for the quarter, compared to $151 million in the
Second Quarter of 2011. As expected, catastrophe loss payouts and income tax payments
contributed to this decline. We earned $188.5 million of comprehensive income this
quarter. This primarily reflects $215 million of net income for the quarter, plus foreign
currency translation adjustments of $25 million. We now have $590.4 million of
comprehensive income year-to-date.
Turning now to capital management, in addition to the dividend payments to shareholders
of $25 million, we repurchased almost 1 million shares this quarter at a total cost of $100
million. For the year, we have repurchased 2.4 million shares at a total cost of $225 million.
Since 2006, we have repurchased over 15 million shares, at a total cost of $1.3 billion,
representing over 23% of the outstanding shares at December 31, 2006. The Company
has 4.9 million shares remaining under a share repurchase authorization from the Board of
Directors.

Shareholders' equity increased to $6.4 billion this quarter, up 6% from $6.1 billion at yearend 2011. This is after taking into account the $225 million of stock repurchases, and the
$51 million of dividends paid so far this year. Book value per share increased 9.5% to
$123.75 from $112.99 at year-end 2011. Our strong capital position leaves us with capacity
to maximize our business opportunities, as well as continue our share repurchases.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks, and congrats on a very strong quarter. I had a few clarification-type questions on
the crop insurance book. The color was very helpful, which you gave in the opening
remarks. First of all, can you refresh us -- what is the crop distribution in the heartland
book? It's not corn, it's not predominant just based on where it is, but can you refresh us
on what is the distribution?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

You mean the distribution by crop?

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

It's normal distribution -- corn and soybean are the main products.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

And do you have the percentages?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Give me a second, Amit. The information I have in front of me will not let me give you a
precise answer, so I'll have to follow up on that question.

It attaches at a 110, I think it's 95% of -- we have a 5% participation --

It's similar in structure to what most companies purchase.

Q - Amit Kumar

Bloomberg Transcript

The only other question I have for now is, obviously your overall book has evolved, and
you are talking about your cat premiums being $1 billion -- cat exposed premiums being at
$1 billion versus right now at $700 million. I'm curious, how should we think about the cat
load discussion? I know we have discussed a number in the past, but as the book
changes, how do you think about the cat load internally?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

That has not changed significantly. As we mentioned, there have been no major shifts in
our peak zones, and we have pushed out some additional aggregate into some non-peak
zones. But that's not changing materially our annual expected load.

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

And a lot of the change comes from rate increases.

Operator
Josh Shanker, Deutsche Bank.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

I want to walk through the Florida quota share arrangement a little bit. I wanted to know
what impact there was on the expense ratio to loss ratio in terms of give back of
premiums that might be one-time in nature. Did the program dissolve, or does it go to a
competitor? And talk a little about the philosophy of letting that program leave, and what
changed in the economics over the last few years.

FINAL

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

I will start with the latter part of that question, with regard to what happened; and then I
will turn it over to Craig to take you through some of the numbers. Basically, we would
have supported the deal that was in place with us last year, but a competitor offered
terms that we could not support. We, in fact, had a contractual right on the deal that was
put forth to do more than 50%, but we chose not to do anything. Instead we redeployed
our capital into Florida XOL deals, which we think offer better returns. So that's the long
and short of it in terms of that specific deal, but Craig will give you the particulars,
numbers wise.

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Josh, one of the things -- we don't typically discuss any one transaction on a call like this.
However, what I can tell you is, what we did was, we portfolioed out the unearned
premium. That unearned premium was $194 million. We have to reverse the
corresponding commission and then we have to remove any deferred acquisition costs
associated with that unearned premium. But this was a one-time transaction and a onetime event, so you're right that it was an impact as part of our combined ratio for the
quarter, but there were a number of other adjustments and impacts in that combined
ratio as well.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, no problem. But arguably, we could be comfortable saying that the expense ratio in
US reinsurance is inflated in 2Q?

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Correct.

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

(multiple speakers) Inflation on the expense ratio -- that is on a worldwide basis. There is a
blip in the quarter that drove up the expense ratio that should go away.

Operator
Greg Locraft, Morgan Stanley.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Good morning, and congrats on the quarter. I wanted to get your appetite for buybacks at
today's levels, given that the valuation hasn't moved much year-to-date, because you've
had so much book value growth.

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

Our appetite remains strong. We think it's one the best ways to use the profits, the
earnings that we are making. Now, we are moving into hurricane season and we will be a

Page 9 of 17



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2012-07-26

bit more cautious in this quarter than perhaps otherwise. But we intend to continue to buy
nonetheless.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay, and if you could remind me -- historically, have you ever bought in the wind season,
and would that strategy change?

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

Again, we have bought less than we have in other quarters, but at this point we have a lot
of excess capital, profits are good, we like the portfolio, and the only hesitation is the fact
that it is hurricane season. But we like the price and it's really one of the ways of
continuing to move the football down the field. We like buying our stock at these levels.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Shifting gears back to crop -- it's actually pretty amazing. You are not the only carrier, but
the industry is sitting, staring at what seems would be the largest loss in crop in history;
and yet, you guys are booking at 95 and will obviously, therefore, make money in the line
if your projections prove out. What I am trying to understand is, what is going into that
expectation of a 95? What gives you confidence that what appears to be the worst
industry loss ever is not going to result in you losing money in that particular line?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

It is still very early to be predicting what the outcome is, but also recognizing that the
limited amount of premium that was earned in the Second Quarter from crop; the fact
that we booked a very small underwriting gain, which I think is consistent with what many
of the other markets have done. It's not inconceivable, given that, as I mentioned in my
script, we could eke out a small profit, because at this point only 24% of the states are
severely affected. That could change in the months ahead in either direction. We have
ranges around where the result could end up, which include both the strong profit and a
modest loss. It was much too early to predict how to book this, and, frankly, given the
level of earned premium that we had in the quarter, it wasn't that material, at least as the
impact for this quarter.
Ultimately, as I said, even as the year plays out on the insurance side, our annualized
premium for crop is $150 million. Of that, $135 million is MPCI-related. The remainder is
crop hail.

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

That really means that this is 3% of our worldwide premium and it has a stop loss on it. As
Dom noted, only 25% of the business now is in the states that are performing quite
poorly. Having said that, as Dom noted, it remains to play out. It certainly could get worse
and we could lose money on this. We will see. But in the grand scheme of things, it's not a
real big deal for us.

Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td

Last, is on the top line decline, the loss of the contract which you called out in the quarter.
Are there any lingering impacts to that as we think about premiums and our models going
forward on the top line and the bottom-line -- how we should handle that?

FINAL

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

I don't think there are any adverse issues in terms of margins, or profits, or attritionals
going forward. Premiums may be down a bit -- they were down this quarter -- and we
won't have that treaty on an ongoing basis, but our focus is on margins and profits and
attritional; and we don't see any issues on that front.

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

In fact, margins should be going up -- again, as I indicated, moving more of our cat PML
from proportional to excess. We are benefiting, not only on the attritional loss ratio, but
also on the commission ratio.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

The profitability is strong, but what you are saying, though, is there will be top line
pressure that plays through for the next three quarters. We have taken one quarter of the
decline and it should continue, but profits are up because of all the reasons you have
stated.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Offsetting that, is, if you think about the rate increases we've had not only in Florida but
around the globe, a lot of that rate increase is offsetting to a very large degree this one
particular transaction.

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

You don't have one quarter in this quarter, you have the whole unearned premium
reserve portfolioed out. Everything that was put in the books has been written but has not
earned at this point has been reversed. So this is a very unusual quarter in that regard.

Operator
Cliff Gallant, KBW.

Q - Cliff Gallant

{BIO 1854853 <GO>}

Good quarter.
On the switch from quota share to XOL -- is that simply a reflection of current market
terms? Or is it something more intrinsic about the business that you prefer in XOL? And
my second question was on investment income -- we continue to see low yields and the
outlook doesn't look good there. Is there any sense that you should change your strategy,
try to get more yield?

FINAL

What we have found, I think, looking around the world in the last year or so is, XOL rates
have been going up, where in many cases pro rata rates have not. More and more that is
pushing us into the XOL cat. Having said that, we still see pro rata deals that we like
doing, and we have put them through our models and decide how those returns compare
to other potential deals. We are talking about cat deals now and, again, it is a portfolio
optimization model that we are using.
We want to do the best deals. We have a certain aggregate that we are willing to apply
and we want only the best deals to go into that aggregate. And what shakes out of that,
shakes out of that. As it turns out, given the trends, that's more and more XOL as
opposed to pro rata.

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

From an investment standpoint, Cliff, I don't see a dramatic change in our portfolio here.
First of all, there has been a lot of changes in the portfolio over the past couple of years,
but right now it's very conservative. It's a diversified portfolio, it's very high credit quality.
We don't have control over the low interest rate environment, but we have to live with it.
We have to make it up on the underwriting side. There's been a lot of discussion about
underwriting benefits here and a decline in our attritional ratio, and that will make up for it
to get to the bottom line ROE.

Let me also give you a statistic that might help keep this in perspective relative to the pro
rata versus excess. It's not as if, as Joe indicated, that we have stopped writing pro rata;
it's just reducing the proportion. In terms of a proportion of pro rata to excess business, in
2010 -- I'm going back to 2010 because that's a reflection of how it earns through the
portfolio -- pro rata was 68%, XOL obviously 32%. In 2011, 61%/39%; and in 2012 through
June, it's 57%/43%. That gives you the trend line of the pro rata. Pro rata is also
benefiting, by the way, from underlying increases in primary rates, but it's not as if pro rata
is falling off a cliff here, either.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Could you clarify again for me on the universal contract -- I think you said $194 million of
unearned premium? Over what time period, if you had kept the contract -- over what time
period would that have earned out? By the end of the year, does it go into next year?

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

That would have been one year and you are correct, the number was $194 million that
was portfolioed out of unearned premium.

Basically that is Q3 of this year through Q2 of next year, that it would have earned out?

FINAL

Correct.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Given the portfolio changes you made in cat -- I don't know if you can give us a Floridaonly PML? Or talk about how you've structured the portfolio into XOL? Are you exposed
more to the Florida-only and nationals? Are you playing high layers, low layers? Some sort
of sense of what types of events or companies you might be exposed to?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Our portfolio hasn't changed much in that regard, frankly, and it's pretty well ventilated.
We support both regional, local, and national clients. It's a wide array of a client list.

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

And no meaningful change to the PML.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Even though I would have thought -- quota share, obviously, implies that you play at dollar
one, where XOL means you play higher. It would seem you would be less exposed to
lower events this year at a minimum. Is that right?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Slightly, that is true. But there are cat covers that do attach low. And then, of course, you
can deploy more limit up high, but it has similar PML.

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

And our design was to not increase the PML, so we worked backwards from that.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

As you were trying to reallocate onto XOL-type programs, some of your competitors
have discussed it being difficult to stay on programs that they liked in the past because of
these non-traditional competitors coming in. I'm just wondering how much of a concern
was that as you were repositioning? Or are you playing on contracts that doesn't tend to
attract that kind of capital?

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

There's always competition in our business, there always will be. It comes in from the
normal competitors and, yes, you do see it come in, in unconventional ways here and
there, be it sidecars or other things. Yes, there was a little bit more of that recently. Having

said that, as Dom noted, in Florida, as an example, rates still went up. I'm sure it had a
dampening effect, but rates still went up. I found that overall this June and July to be a
very sensible market where we were still able to achieve what we were looking to
achieve.
To a certain degree, more competition coming in still keeps it a sensible market. It is not a
bad thing. We don't want so much coming in that it makes it a market that doesn't rate
very well, but a lot of the competition that is coming in, in an unconventional way, only
wants to come in if it is a reasonable market and, frankly, will go away if it is not. Put it all
together -- I don't think it changed the world all that much, and we were happy with what
we achieved.

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

You also have increased demand coming out of model drift, as well as companies seeking
to buy more protection. Those are some offsetting factors to what you described.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Do you have any emerging thoughts as far as willingness to engage with some of these
new forms of capital?

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We are open. We talked to some of these potential new ventures, and if it makes sense
for us, we could engage. We are open-minded about it.

Operator
Michael Nannizzi, Goldman Sachs.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

One question I had -- you mentioned capital deployment before and you mentioned the
non-renewal of this Florida contract. Thinking about capital deployment through wind
season -- is the fact that you have less exposure now, would appear to wind season -allow you to get more comfortable with deployment through wind season?
Joe, you mentioned up front that you are deploying capital relative to the capital you are
generating. My question would be, why stop there? Why not deploy more if you have
enough capital and you feel comfortable that there is enough there to continue?

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

I think we will be buying back. In terms of going even more aggressively, let's put
everything into perspective. Craig noted we bought back 23% of the stock in recent years.
Frankly, we have added to that, that we plan on continuing to buy in a meaningful way.
Beyond that, we like having excess capital. We like having capital for business
opportunities. It didn't hurt having capital last year when there was a ton of losses out
there and some others got downgraded because they didn't have enough capital. We

FINAL

want to balance everything. We want to keep having high-quality earnings that we can buy
back, and we would just continue to buy back. I think we have pitched it at it very
reasonable level, all things considered.
I think you said something up front about our -- something that suggested our exposure
was down. I think we have said we've kept the PML the same, but we didn't say that we
have taken them down. Our exposure, if you will, looking from a PML point of view to
hurricane is still approximately the same in peak zones.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Even after adjusting for the non-renewal of that one large contract?

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

Yes, because we redeployed that capital to do some other excess of loss contracts.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay, and one follow-up on the home and crop stuff -- I assume that the reason that your
losses, even in a worst-case scenario are limited or relatively bracketable, is because of
the reinsurance program that you have? Is that all private market reinsurance? Some of
that back to the government?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

What I was referring to is the stop loss program, and Craig referenced it as well in his
opening comments. That is private reinsurance. That's not (concessions) to the federal
government.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Is there a quota share as well, or is it purely just a stop loss?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Stop loss. (multiple speakers) We do have quota share with XOL.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

The growth -- and it looks like a lot of premium growth came out of international
reinsurance -- and I just want to understand, where are you focusing your attention, and
do you expect that, that will continue to be the engine for premium growth for the
remainder of the year?

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

On the international side, what you are seeing -- some of that is rate increase coming out
of Australia, coming out of Japan. A little bit continuing in Latin America. But we have been
very strong on the international front for years. Again, I think much of what you are seeing
there most recently is rate increase on the XOL side.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

First question is on the crop insurance. You mentioned that you are writing at a 95
combined ratio. What is your loss ratio for the business that you are looking at right now?

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

I think the combined is the 95. The way we book it, it's 95 combined.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

So the loss ratio would be similar to the combined ratio, correct?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

You have got the commission piece in there. We will get you that number in a second.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

The reason I ask is, the stop loss is at a 110 loss ratio, so I was just wanted to find out the
apples to apples.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

The stop loss ratio works off of the entire combined. Excluding our internal expenses,
which are small. The loss ratio is 75%.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

All right, but looking at this apples to apples, it's 110% loss ratio versus say 90% to 95%
that you are booking at right now, correct? That's the potential upside of loss that you
might have?

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

Well 95 could go up another 15 points before the stop loss would begin.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

The second question was on rate increases. You have had very strong rate increases and
that's flattening out right now. Where do you see rate increases going out next year,
should we have a benign cat season?

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

I think they are going to level off if you have little to no cats. If they stay where they are at,
I think they would be leveling off at a very reasonable place where there will still be some

very good opportunities. I would not expect them to continue up way beyond what they
have done in the last couple of years if there was little in the way of catastrophes.

FINAL

There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Joseph
Taranto for any additional or closing remarks.

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

I will make one comment. We didn't talk much about the casualty market, and Dom
certainly noted that, whereas we are seeing rate increases there and it is getting more
promising, it's still not exciting enough for us to make some bigger bets there. I would
remind everyone that we certainly have the fire power, distribution, and people to do so
should that end of the market, begin to get more interesting. We have the fire power,
both on the insurance side and the reinsurance side.
We are hoping that many who are predicting that, that end of the world will continue
upward and will continue to improve, we certainly hope that, that is the case. If that is the
case, we will be able to do more there. I thought I would comment on that since we really
hadn't addressed it whatsoever. Other than that, thank you for joining us today.
