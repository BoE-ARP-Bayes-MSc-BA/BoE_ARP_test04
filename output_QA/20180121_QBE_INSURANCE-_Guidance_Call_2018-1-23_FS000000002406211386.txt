MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Thank you for standing by and welcome to the QBE Market Update Conference Call. All
participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a presentation followed by a questionand-answer session.
I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Pat Regan, Group CEO. Please go
ahead.

Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. I've also got with me our Group CFO, Michael Ford; and our
Head of Investor Relations, Tony Jackson. I just wanted to give you some additional color
on today's market announcement. Obviously, I should note that we're still going through
our full year – year-end processes and close processes. And therefore, the Q&A today will
be really limited to the matters we've got in the announcement.
And there's really – there are two buckets of things I wanted to talk about. One is an
update on weather activity and the second is the financial results of the review I've been
doing over the last two or three months. The first update is on the combined ratio, where
the group now expects a full year combined ratio of around 104%, up from the previous
100% to 102% target. And there's really two main items impacting our combined ratio.

FINAL

Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td
Company Ticker: QBE AU Equity
Date: 2018-01-21

Firstly, obviously, everybody in the industry saw substantial cat activity in Q4, obviously on
top of the substantial cat activities for Q3. And in our case, obviously above our early
(00:01:40) allowances for the fourth quarter and, in our case, that was largely due to the
California wildfires, the significant late December storms we saw in Australia. And we've
also seen some small net increase in our estimate for Maria, which as you'll remember,
was easily the most difficult ones of the hurricanes to estimate at the time because of the
difficulty getting access to Puerto Rico. Those three items together have added around
$130 million to the group's net cost of large risk cat claims, which is now for the full year
around $1.85 billion or around 15% of NEP. And what that means is all of that adds about 1%
to the group's full year combined ratio expectations.

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, we've been – we just completed a detailed review of our year-end claims
reserves. And as you would expect me to, we pay particular attention to North America
and Asia Pacific to make sure we're really properly set up for the future. And following
completion of that review, we decided to strengthen claims for regions by just over $100
million. That's really in a couple of places, primarily in North America in our casualty lines
within the Assumed Re business, and then some additional reserves in our Hong Kong
workers' comp portfolio. And that (00:03:06) has also added just over 1 point to the full
year combined ratio expectations.
We've also increased the group's PoA, which is expected to be now 90% at 31 December
2012 (sic) [2017] (00:03:20), up from 89.5% previously. And there were some other small
movements in the combined. We've had some additional non-cat small weather claims in
North America, hailstorms, that kind of stuff; [ph] a little bit higher coverage combined
ratio for (00:03:35) Hong Kong workers' comp; and some other bits and pieces [ph] that
have added about 0.5 a point (00:03:41) to the group's full year combined expectation.
Turning then to the noncash items in today's announcement. And firstly on goodwill, we've
decided to revise the long-term combined ratio we use in the carrying value of the North
American goodwill test, which results in a one-off noncash impairment of around $700
million. So, we've discussed sometime that the headroom calculation is very tight and very
sensitive to changes in those assumptions.
And the changes we made today reflect an increase in that combined ratio assumption,
which is consistent with the updated business plan for North America and uses a longterm combined of – in the high 95% combined so 95 points. And bring (00:04:32) that
long term combined, we're using closer to the current underlying performance of the
North American business. And that's certainly not to say that I don't think we can improve
our North American result from here. I think we can and we'll give you more detail on
those improvement plans on the 26th of February.
And second noncash item, which we flagged previously, was obviously the U.S.
government revised the corporate tax rate down to 21% and that gives a $230 million
again one-off noncash write-down of the deferred tax asset for North America. And worth
noting that both of those, obviously, both of those noncash items don't have any impact
on the group's capital decision.

FINAL

One additional factor just to notice on the cat of the year, they primarily impacted the
results of Equator Re and North America where we don't get tax relief. And then all that
has a distorting effect on this year's, 2017's group effective tax rate resulting a tax
expense notwithstanding the fact we have that pre-tax loss.
I'll just give you a few brief comments on each of the division's results. So, starting with
North America, the full year combined for North America is likely (00:05:56) to be around
109%. And obviously, that was significantly impacted by the second half cats, HIM [Harvey,
Irma and Maria] as well as those fourth quarter wildfires, all of which added about 7 points
to the North American combined ratio. So, I mentioned in the second half, we did
strengthen reserves in North America. That was about $100 million, just over. And so, if
you think about the North American results, without those items – if you do think about it
without those items, the combined for 2017 is in that 97% to 98% range.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think it's also important to note that effective the 31st of December, we executed
another loss portfolio transfer where we reinsured at this time the commercial auto
reserves. Last year, you remember, we did a reinsurance transfer to the old program
reserves. This time for the commercial auto reserves and I think that together with that
second half reserve strengthening sets us up much better for the future in terms of
reserve inputs (00:07:00).
On Europe, our combined ratio of European Operations is expected to be around 95%.
So, it's higher than last year, obviously, partly due to the cat losses from HIM and lower
positive prior year development. On Australia and New Zealand, I'm pleased to say that
the remediation activities we started some 18 months or so ago continued to deliver
improved performance. And the division is expecting a combined ratio of around 92%.
And we've seen a further improvement in the ANZO attritional claims ratio
notwithstanding the fact that we've seen an ongoing normalization in the LMI combined
ratio. So (00:07:46) despite the LMI combined ratio getting a bit higher, we're still seeing
a decent improvement in the ANZO attritional loss ratio.
In Asia Pacific, we expected the combined ratio to be around 115%, which really reflects
that extra reserving in Hong Kong workers' comp portfolio. Lastly, America's expected to
be around 114%. And as I mentioned earlier, we're well on with a strategic review of our
Latin American business. And lastly, obviously, the Equator Re result's heavily impacted by
the extreme cat activity in 2017.
A preliminary assessment of our reg capital position shows that while our capital position's
obviously a bit lower because of the impact of the cats, at 1.6 times PCA, it's still pretty
strong. And I guess current standing back (00:08:45) from all of that, 2017 has been a
challenging year for QBE, both from the cat activity, which has been pretty much
unprecedented in the insurance industry, but also from the underperformance of some of
our businesses.
I'll let each of you do the maths of what you think our, if you like, adjusted performance
looks like. We've, obviously, got the 104% combined. That includes about 6 points of
excess cat claims. And you've probably got some other one-off type items, some of that

Page 3 of 19

FINAL

extra weather-related smaller attritional claims in North America, Hong Kong workers'
comp, et cetera, et cetera, which probably adds up to another point also on the
combined.
But even if you were to allow for that, our results clearly need to improve in 2018 and
beyond. Over the last few months, I've been conducting a detailed review of our
businesses. We do have some businesses with strong market positions that are
performing well, but we also have some businesses that need to improve. And on the
back of this, we're implementing a comprehensive plan to improve the underwriting
performance, simplify the group's operations and reduce risk, and somewhat similar to
the program that I put in place in ANZO 18 months ago.
February 26 is going to be about giving you much more detail on that performance
improvement program. But just to give you a flavor of it, it'll all be backed up by the sale
(00:10:15) review process we put in place in ANZO. I described that quite a bit to you
before about how we went about that in ANZO. We're not putting that in place fully right
across QBE. We'll be implementing a program of, what I call, brilliant basics. That's the
brilliant basics in underwriting and risk selection, pricing and claims, and making sure we
do those consistently well everywhere across QBE.

Bloomberg Transcript

We certainly do have some areas of expertise and strength in there that we can build on,
but we need to make sure they are consistently high standard right across QBE. Improving
efficiency and reducing cost, simplifying our portfolio and reducing risk, and as I
mentioned, one component of this is completing that strategic review of the Latin
American business.
It's also worth noting that, as a start on that, we've now sold our Thailand business.
Although we (00:11:10) continued to drive improvements in North America where lots of
good work has already been completed here, we've exited a number of underperforming
portfolios, we've completed those loss portfolio transfers on some of the more difficult
reserves and made other underwriting improvements, more work needs to be done and
will be done. And lastly, executing the comprehensive profit improvement program in Asia
Pacific. And as I mentioned, we'll give you more detail on all of this on February 26.
Finally, with respect to the group's 2018 outlook, we're anticipating a target combined
ratio range of 95% to 97.5%, which is obviously a wider range than QBE has used before.
But I think, as with everything else I've talked about today, this is all about setting us up
better for the future to deliver against our expectations.
With that, I will hand the call over to Q&A.

Q&A

Q - Daniel P. Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning, Pat, just in light of the write-downs to goodwill and the like, the
sort of close to $1 billion I guess, the gearing and S&P rating, is there any impact?

FINAL

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Thanks, Dan. Gearing, yes, I mean that will just be kind of (00:12:59) of – our gearing will
be closer to 40% and those really don't, as I say, affect (00:13:09) our good capital
position or S&P position. So, there's not an issue from an S&P perspective and that our
gearing will be higher (00:13:19). But we think we can over time reduce that again but
partly through earnings accretion and perhaps through some of the portfolio moves that I
just mentioned.

Q - Daniel P. Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

Okay. And then just on the overall reserving, so you talked about the 1% top-up. When you
take into consideration Europe, was the FY 2017 result an overall net – strengthening your
reserves or flat or?

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. It actually was a small positive, Dan, so I think the exact number's around $40 million
for the full year 2017. So we had a release in the first half on the strengthening of just over
$100 million in the second half, giving a net for the full year of a positive of around – a
release of around $40 million.

Q - Daniel P. Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

And are you surprised to still be sort of strengthening casualty lines in the U.S.?

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

So I think, as you think about our U.S. business, obviously we've done a couple of things
over time, and including right price (00:14:27) at the end of 2017. Just as important as
reserve strengthening has been these loss portfolio transfers. We stopped writing a lot of
this – things like commercial auto, Deep South, the program business. And stopping
writing it was an important move for us.
But actually also during the loss portfolio transfers, it's also been really important to
increase, if you like, reserving confidence. And I just wanted to make sure we were really
well set up leaving 2017 and going into 2018. So, having done those loss portfolio
transfers, we just wanted to make sure that whatever other longer-tail business we've got
that we were really well reserved on.

Q - Daniel P. Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

Okay. And then just finally, if we go back to February 2017, I think we had 93.5% to 95% set
as the COR. We then had the EM downgrade. We went to 94.5% to 96%. Then at the
August result, it went to closer to 96% and, obviously, the cats rolled through with the
downgrade in October. But is it sort of the 94.5% to 96% we should be looking at sort of
Page 5 of 19



Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td
Company Ticker: QBE AU Equity
Date: 2018-01-21

FINAL

how that rolls through to, I guess, the 2018 of 95% to 97.5%, and if that's the case, where
are the points of softness? I mean you do talk to Asia continuing to have higher attritional
losses. But just across the group, the sort of transition from that sort of I guess 94.5% to
96% which might be more of a like-for-like with the 95% to 97.5%, where are the areas
where you're seeing sort of deterioration?

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

So, I think I mean, obviously, the biggest move we have had in the second half kind of
accounts for almost all the burden (00:16:23) is the cat stuff. The second topic really is –
what's kind of new is the Emerging Markets businesses, both Latin America and Asia. And
I think they're sort of two different topics. On Asia, as I say, the – we're putting in place a
comprehensive improvement program. We left 2017 with combined ratio 115%, which is
clearly completely unacceptable.
Now, some of that was caused by probably almost half the underwriting loss comes from
that Hong Kong workers' comp portfolio. And again, we wanted to make sure that we'd
left that really well reserved. And actually, some of the – we've had to improve our claims
– are having to improve our claims handling on that to make sure we get better claims
outcomes.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, Asia's a big part of that. We need to improve Asia very significantly from 115% going
forward. That will take a little bit of time to do. Latam, I sort of kind of hinted to you that
there might be a different solution to that going forward as well. But simply that (00:17:26)
we can't afford to be posting results in either Latin America or in Asia that is in the 100
and teens going forward.

Q - Daniel P. Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from James Coghill from UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - James Coghill

{BIO 14006200 <GO>}

Good morning, guys. A couple of questions. Just starting on debt reserving change, could
you – Pat, could you provide some more color over what actually happened in Europe and
Australia and New Zealand to ultimately lead to $110 million and strengthening?

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

So, we did have some small amounts of positive in Europe, just a little bit less than we've
had in the first half. And we had a little bit of positive in ANZO in the second half. So, it did
have both have (00:18:24) positives. And then, obviously, we booked up a little bit more
than $100 million in North America, that amount in Asia and some cats and dogs around
the rest of the group as well.

Q - James Coghill

{BIO 14006200 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. I mean that seems to be relatively small numbers for both Europe and Australia and
New Zealand relative to what you recognized in the first half, particularly for Europe. And
could you provide some color on the outlook for how you'd be thinking about reserve
releases in those regions into next year?

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yeah. Yeah. I mean good question, Jim. So I think – so do we feel like we're well-reserved
in Europe and in Australia? Yes. I think what we've said before on Europe is, is it
reasonable to expect some level of reserve releases going forward? Yes. Is it going to be
quite at the level we've seen over the last two or three years? Probably not. And we've
seen very – 6%, 7%, 8% reserve releases in Europe. So, we're probably not going to see
that level of reserve releases, but we still think we're well-reserved there and be better.
(00:19:31)

Q - James Coghill

{BIO 14006200 <GO>}

Okay. A question on capital, a couple on capital, and so your coverage of PCA is 1.7 times
at the first half. So I haven't actually worked through all the numbers, but I presume it is
only the retained loss that actually led to the PCA coverage dropping to 1.6. And is it
possible to just comment on whether there are any key changes in the actual charges,
making up their calculation and not any other unusual items that have washed through to
lead to a 1.6 times coverage there?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

No, not really, James. It's really I mean essentially those cat losses washing (00:20:17)
through, as I mentioned to you there because there in Equator and North America, they're
largely pre- and post-tax, so the impact on book is almost entirely flat. (00:20:24)

Q - James Coghill

{BIO 14006200 <GO>}

And that is no comment on the buyback in the release. Are you happy to make a
comment on that now?

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

No, I think what we said in the release is the board will – so exact phrase we used. We said
the board's going to consider the quantum of the final year dividend and buyback
expectations in the February meeting. I think the only thing I'd say on that, James, is
obviously the board recognizes the importance of that going forward. So we'll come back
more definitively on that on February 22.

Q - James Coghill

{BIO 14006200 <GO>}

Okay. And one last one for me just on your sort of broad outline of this plan to fix QBE yet
again, and could you just comment on how significant cost-out is going to be? And that I
presume all your previous targets on cost-out are now largely redundant, or should we be
anticipating a one-off charge for that? And obviously, it can't be a part of the February

Page 7 of 19



Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td
Company Ticker: QBE AU Equity
Date: 2018-01-21

result because you would have had to disclose it now. And how do you intend going about
this cost-out? Is it just generating synergies with and cost savings? If you could just
comment on that as well please.

FINAL

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean kind of improving efficiency and reducing cost is an important thing for us.
We did some small restructuring (00:21:46) costs that are included in the numbers
(00:21:50) included in the combined ratio I've just got today. So, we've reduced our
regional costs as you would expect in both Latin America and in Asia. So, we've included
that in the numbers today, James.
And I think our (00:22:03) – there's two or three things, we need to reduce our costs in
Emerging Markets. That's our highest expense ratio. We've talked about before and it
remains true today, we need to continue to reduce costs in North America both in dollar
terms and just the ratio. And I think more broadly across the group, maybe you're talking
about Europe or Australia that there were lots of opportunities to improve our process
efficiency, use technology better. QBE's not unique on that, so some of that will. I don't
see that as a big kind of one-off charge time item. That's a continual improvement of a
focus on process quality, focusing on, therefore, cost outcomes and reducing costs over
time. So, we'll talk to you a bit more about that in February.

Q - James Coghill

{BIO 14006200 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Andrew Buncombe from Macquarie Group.
Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew Buncombe

{BIO 19921333 <GO>}

Hi, guys. Just two questions from me, please. The first one, just a question, has a
business-wide review of goodwill been completed or is it just for North America?

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

We do got (00:23:07) business-wide reviews of all the goodwill when we go through our
year-end close processes and there's lots of headroom on the other goodwill amount.

Q - Andrew Buncombe

{BIO 19921333 <GO>}

Okay. Sure. Thanks. And then the second question, with more strengthening to reserves in
North America, does this change the view on further growth in that market?

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Look, I said that's an interesting question. I think kind of more broadly so can we grow in
North America? Can we grow elsewhere in QBE over time? Yes. Do I want to give huge
Page 8 of 19



Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td

Date: 2018-01-21

FINAL

growth targets? Probably not right now. What I really want to do is, it's what I've said, is
improve the underwriting performance of the business and improve our consistency of
delivery.
Now, when we went through that at ANZO, we ended up actually being able to grow a
little bit, which surprised me slightly, but that was sort of a secondary outcome rather than
the primary outcome, which was to improve the attritional loss ratio, the underwriting
performance and the consistency. So, I think, over time, we do think we can grow in North
America, but the first and foremost is to improve underwriting performance and
consistency there and elsewhere.

Q - Andrew Buncombe

{BIO 19921333 <GO>}

Yeah. That makes sense. And then the last one, everybody's obviously seen the
announcement out of AIG for Validus overnight. Does that – how do you guys think of
acquisitions and maybe some of the U.S. tax changes playing into acquisitions in the
Bermudan market and the consolidation that could come off the back of that?

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. I mean it's – I haven't had the time to really look at – in any detail, at the AIG
announcement other than to see it's happened. What I will always say about those so I
can't comment on them is we've got a really full suite of good work to do that could
improve QBE. I feel that we've got good line of sight of what that work should be. I feel
confident that work can make a meaningful difference to our underwriting performance
and our consistency of delivery, and we're much better on focusing on that full (00:25:12).

Q - Andrew Buncombe

{BIO 19921333 <GO>}

Excellent. Okay. Thanks. That's it from me.

Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from David Humphreys from JCP Investment
Partners. Please go ahead.

Q - David Humphreys

{BIO 18797143 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning. A couple of questions, if I may. You haven't provided a GWP target
in your outlook. Can you just comment on what you see as nominal growth, or should we
just use the current years of both (00:25:43)?

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

I think probably the latter, David. I mean I think we did end up growing 1% or 2% in 2017.
Look, the good news is everybody's read the pricing environment commentary from
October expectations we're going to see a big increase to a little bit more mooted now. I
think what you could say is it's the better pricing environment than it was 12 months ago
whether it's quite as good as people expected in October, probably not. But it's a better
pricing environment.
Page 9 of 19

FINAL

I'm probably not going to give a GWP guidance going forward because I really don't want
our teams to be focused on that any more than they need to be. What they really need to
be focused on is making sure we're doing – improving underwriting performance and
improving the consistency of our delivery. I would hope that we can keep our retention
somewhat stable and benefit from at least kind of more flat to moderately positive
pricing environment.

Q - David Humphreys

{BIO 18797143 <GO>}

Okay. Second question. In your commentary, you've talked about simplifying and reducing
risk. If you look at the cat outcome this year, you need to lower your retentions in your
program and did you get away the final component of your 2018 program that you
haven't done back in October?

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. So, we have completed that. Yes. That's all been successfully placed now. I think it's
an interesting question on the cat. So, what the industry all experienced was a series of
medium-sized events – obviously, Harvey, Irma, Maria, wildfires – and that tends to be
more impactful than kind of one extremely large event which hits directly at your cat
towers (00:27:33). So we've got the plant (00:27:36), we've got both our cat program,
our large risk program and the aggregate treaty in place for 2018.
What that means is it buys us a little bit of time to have a look at things afresh. So, I kind of
want to do that, just to see what the right protection is coming forward other (00:27:51)
than that. We'll include both the reinsurance protections and whether – (00:27:57) whether
we should be in all of the places where you get much higher cat exposure to the premium
pool you collected (00:28:04).

Q - David Humphreys

{BIO 18797143 <GO>}

Okay. And my last question is on your, I guess, your objective in improving efficiency and
reducing costs. Is your experience in Australia was that the efforts that had been
implemented required you to reverse them? And the number was 200 claims people had
to be reemployed in Australia and New Zealand. Are you concerned that once you start to
apply the same lenses (00:28:30) elsewhere, you don't need to put cost back in
(00:28:32) in the first place?

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

It's an interesting question. I'd candidly tell you that in terms of the last 18 months, did I do
a lot of stuff to improve the efficiency in Australia? Probably not, no. To your point, our
focus was really elsewhere. It was all about the really basic stuff, the performance
improvement stuff. The example you are using just for everybody else, (00:28:55) we're
bringing about 200 claims roles back from the Philippines to Australia. These were the
more complex property claims.
That example doesn't exist elsewhere. That was particular to Australia. I do think there's
lots of opportunity to be more efficient in Australia and everywhere else? We definitely
need to reduce cost in Asia. And as I say, we've taken some steps to do that. We need to
Page 10 of 19



Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td
Company Ticker: QBE AU Equity
Date: 2018-01-21

reduce costs in Latin America and in North America. Will we need to invest in some stuff
as we go through that? Yeah, I'm sure we will as well. So there's no direct equivalent
example, I don't think, to the 200 roles in Australia.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Nigel Pittaway from Citigroup. Please go

Q - Nigel Pittaway

{BIO 3406058 <GO>}

Morning, Pat. So, just wondering with such a wide range now for combined ratio guidance
in FY 2018, can you give us a feel for sort of the kind of key factors you think are
important, I mean whether or not you swing towards the bottom or top of that combined
ratio target range?

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Thanks for the question, Nigel. And obviously, we're using a wider range than
before and part of that is just me kind of giving us a better opportunity to make sure we
deliver against our expectations and to deliver, I guess, what we say we'd do, which is
kind of vital for us going forward. I mean there's all the usual kind of swing factors.
So obviously, kind of normally, that wouldn't really be cat for us. 2017 was an extremely
unusual year and then we went through the top of the aggregate treaty. So normally, we
wouldn't expect that to be a swing factor. So, it's how well we can deliver on our attritional
and how much kind of positive prior year we'd get would be the two biggest factors, I
think. And probably the kind of linked to first of those, just kind of how much the pricing
environment helps or just help.

Q - Nigel Pittaway

{BIO 3406058 <GO>}

All right. Okay. So, the guidance will include any sort of anticipation of prior year releases
in effect?

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

I mean it will, yes. I'm not going to be any more specific even when we get to February
about what that is, but it will include anything for prior year, yes.

Thank you. Your next question comes from David Spotswood from Airlie Funds
Management. Please go ahead.

Q - David Spotswood

{BIO 17576616 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks. David Spotswood. Just a few questions. I mean obviously QBE (00:31:26) the
big complex business scattered throughout the globe. I mean how comfortable do you
feel in terms of your review or kind of rebasing the business going forward? First
question. Second question, did you say that you're anticipating rates to be flat to up a
little bit sort of globally in 2018? Not sure if I got that. And these investment returns of
2.5% to 3%, what have you assumed in there in terms of what markets are doing in cash
rates (00:32:00)? Thank you.

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Great. Thanks, David. So, from the complex point, I sort of agree with you. I mean I think
we need to simplify the group somewhat and reduce risk, whether that be in substance
and in form. I think part of the program of what we're doing now is exactly aimed to
(00:32:23) doing that. We've exited Thailand but it's only tiny. Clearly, we've flagged that
Latin America is under review as part of that. So, I think you should expect that the kind of
the QBE going forward is smaller, a little bit more focused and less complex than the QBE
today.
Just on rates, obviously, you got three main blocks of rates in Europe, North America, and
ANZO. The rate environment here actually continues to have good momentum here in
Australia. So, that carries a kind of positive into 2018. The rate environment in Europe and
North America started kind of moderately positive but I think whether you're QBE or
anybody else, you just wait and see how that plays out during the year. So, for North
America and Europe, it is a kind of a flat to moderately positive, and then we're seeing
how that develops post (00:33:24) as we get later in the year.
On the investment income, so obviously in (00:33:33) 3.2% investment return in 2017. And
that (00:33:40) from the principal thing as well as good equity markets was a narrowing
of credit spreads going forward. So, what we've assumed going into 2017 is really no
movement on credit spreads going forward. These (00:33:58) started well (00:33:58)
equity markets (00:34:02). We've not really assumed any incremental gain on that.
On interest rates, we kind of gain and lose. Obviously, we pick up our running yield gets
higher but you get a mark-to-market impact as well in those. So, as and when rate
increases go through, you do make that (00:34:20) helps the ongoing yield going
forward. Obviously, that's a big positive but you get a small mark-to-market impact in the
same year as well. So, it ends up not being a huge positive to the annual investment
income, if that makes sense.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Toby Langley from Merrill Lynch. Please go
ahead.

Q - Toby Langley

{BIO 15924432 <GO>}

Good morning. Thanks for having my question. Pat, I was hoping to get your comments on
when will we be able to see a cleaner representation of what the group can do from a
combined ratio perspective. It feels like we've spent five, six, seven years with a company
in something of a transition. The 95% to 97.5% it's seemingly the sort of overhang there
from a restorative action, corrective action following this year. How should we think about
the sort of larger moving parts to the trajectory of the combined ratio beyond 2018 and
even in 2018?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yeah. So, 2018 versus 2017, I meant (00:35:34) 2019 versus 2018, they've been making it
overly simplistic. At a high level, we need to improve 2018 versus 2017 on our
performance and we need to improve 2019 versus 2018. What are our big levers to do
that? I mean you've got ANZO and Europe performing reasonably well. It'll help Europe
(00:35:58) slightly better pricing environment. They've also been fighting pricing
headwinds in the last two or three years, more than two or three years. So, actually, even
getting to a small positive is kind of good for them.
As ever, the trick for us is to improve North America and to significantly improve Emerging
Markets. So, what we're setting out to achieve in 2018 is to make 2018 better than 2017.
And then, obviously, we want to continue that, and I think we can continue that improving
2019 versus 2018. By geography, obviously, that's – we can't afford to be posting
something in the 100 and teens in either Latam or Asia, and we really ought to be able to
improve that, and the team feel good about our ability to continue to improve in North
America.

Q - Toby Langley

{BIO 15924432 <GO>}

Okay. Cool. If I can ask another question about the goodwill write-down and the sensitivity,
in the year-end notes last year, the sensitivity I think was about $240 million impairment
charge for 1% increase in the combined ratio.

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Toby Langley

Page 13 of 19



Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td
Company Ticker: QBE AU Equity
Date: 2018-01-21

And you're attributing $700 million predominantly to combined ratio movements, but it
doesn't like it's as big as perhaps that sensitivity would imply it needed to be. So, is there
not something else that's at play there?

FINAL

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

No, I'm glad you asked that, Toby. So you start with headroom of around slightly a bit over
100%. So, 1% movement giving a impairment of 230-odd means a movement of 330-odd
(00:37:31), if that makes sense. So, a 2% movement gives a movement of double that.
Flat is the main bulk of it.
The second bit is the loss portfolio transfer transaction we did on December 31 was being
good for us on reserving certainty for sure, and therefore, kind of confidence around
future combined ratio, also reduces your investment income going forward. So, that
knocks a bit off as well. That would be the other piece of it.

Q - Toby Langley

{BIO 15924432 <GO>}

Okay. So, the headline COR movement (00:38:05) is about 2%?

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yeah. It's ramping slightly a bit about that, yeah.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Siddharth Parameswaran from JPMorgan.
Please go ahead.

Q - Siddharth Parameswaran

{BIO 15037291 <GO>}

Hi, Patrick. A few questions if I could. The first just on your guidance for 2018, the 95% to
97.5% combined ratio, what have you assumed in terms of any benefit from the cycle?
Are you basically assuming that there's no benefit in those numbers?

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

No. We've – obviously, we did our business plan, so one of the things we had to do was as
we (00:38:44) came into the start of 2018, just look at one more (00:38:49), look at the
pricing environment. So, the three big blocks, as I mentioned, in ANZO, there is a bit of
positive momentum from rate so whether (00:39:01) we'd have assumed that and then
we'd have assumed a cautious amount in Europe and North America.

Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td

Okay. Okay. So, I'll take – obviously, just a very modest impact then across the group, it
sounds like.

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

FINAL

That's correct. Yeah.

Q - Siddharth Parameswaran

{BIO 15037291 <GO>}

Okay. Fair enough. Okay. And then if I could ask a question just on your reserves versus – I
mean the reserve increases you took in this result. Is there anything that you're actually
seeing on the claims front or is it basically that you're just trying to make sure that you
have enough to – I suppose allow for any unwanted deterioration, which may occur in the
future? So, I suppose it's just a question around what's really happening with claims and
what led to those reserve increases.

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

A different answer to the two bits I talked about, Sid. On the North American one, the
Assumed Re, that's just having a bit of extra IBNR (00:39:52) that's more kind of certainly
kind of put away. So, not no new kind of claims activity per se.
To give an answer on Hong Kong, we – in the second half of the year, we saw more
adverse claims outcomes. Partly that was actually kind of operational issues. We didn't
literally have enough people handling those claims. We've dealt with that now. So, some
of that reserve charge – some of the reserve charge actually generally in the Hong Kong
workers' comp environment, the average claims costs are going up for all the insurance
companies. So, it's a bit of that and a bit of it was our own claims handling. So, a slightly
different answer for the two.

Q - Siddharth Parameswaran

{BIO 15037291 <GO>}

Yeah. And was there any change in how you reserve the latest accident year? So, in terms
of just what we think for 2017, did you choose to be a little bit more conservative given the
initiatives that we've seen in the past?

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

So, yes, in Hong Kong workers' comp, that was one of the factors in Asia's performance.
We did increase current accident year, Hong Kong workers' comp.

Q - Siddharth Parameswaran

{BIO 15037291 <GO>}

But nowhere else in the world?

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

We're on to that (00:41:00) elsewhere in the world. So I mean, let's say, you get from the
attritionals when we're doing separate (00:41:03) a bit of an improvement in Australia, as
I mentioned. And in North America, the biggest movement in North America (00:41:12) is

Page 15 of 19

crop actually which obviously had a super good result last year and a more normal result
this year.

FINAL

Q - Siddharth Parameswaran

{BIO 15037291 <GO>}

Okay. Fair enough. Just one last question. I was just trying to square off a couple of
comments that you made around volumes going forward and what we should be
assuming. I think into David Spotswood's question you've mentioned that in terms of how
we should think about the future of QBE, we should be thinking about a smaller QBE,
more disciplined and focused on getting its underwriting right.
But I think to David Humphrey's question, you suggested that we should be assuming a
flat trajectory in terms of premium. So, just – I mean I suppose that all these initiatives that
you're looking at in terms of looking at where you can improve performance, should we
be thinking flat or should we be thinking down in terms of GWP?

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yeah. I think I was trying to avoid answering the questions here actually.

Q - Siddharth Parameswaran

{BIO 15037291 <GO>}

Okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

I'd rather not give a top line guidance going forward. It's actually two things. On our
organic trading, the most important thing now is to improve our underwriting performance
and improve our consistency of delivery. It's slightly helpful having a positive rate
environment as we do that. On the portfolio, we'll come back to you in February but I do
expect a slightly smaller, more focused QBE going forward, but I'll give you a bit more
detail on that in February.

Q - Siddharth Parameswaran

Q - Brett Le Mesurier

{BIO 5909278 <GO>}

Thanks. A couple of questions. As you talked about a relatively flat premium outlook,
presumably that means your commission and expense ratio is going to be difficult to
make that smaller than the current level of 32-odd percent.

FINAL

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

It's an interesting question, Brett. I mean, obviously, you follow this world for a few years.
As QBE has reduced cost, it's only partially helped our expense ratio because, obviously,
we've had a reducing top line. I'd just say I'm going to try and steer away from giving top
line guidance. It is important though going forward that, over time, we take out cost to
improve efficiency and we can do that. So, I think we said it was 32.5% expense ratio for
2017. I do think over time that we both need to and can improve that.

Q - Brett Le Mesurier

{BIO 5909278 <GO>}

On the European business, it looks like the combined operating ratio in the second half
was greater than 100%, which would imply some deterioration in the performance of that
business. Is that a fair comment?

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

It was around 100%, Brett. Yeah, you mentioned about rate. That's obviously impacted in
the second half by their share of the HIM – Harvey, Irma, Maria activity. They write quite a
bit of business as most lender market businesses do in North America, et cetera. So, it
was impacted a bit by that.

Q - Brett Le Mesurier

{BIO 5909278 <GO>}

So, you're saying that the underlying performance hasn't changed?

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Well, we had less – the second features are, as I mentioned, was we had less positive
prior-year releases in the second half.

Q - Brett Le Mesurier

{BIO 5909278 <GO>}

Okay. And, lastly, I had a small increase to the probability of adequacy on your outstanding
claims reserves fee. The increase that you've put through there, how much did that cost?

A - Patrick Charles Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Well, the maths is if you'd left it at 89.5%, our combined ratio would have been 40 basis
points better. But it's not all increasing dollars of risk margin. It's a lot of risk reduction
activity so things like that loss portfolio transfer helped that, things like the aggregate
reinsurance treaty helped that. So, if we were 89.5%, combined ratio would've been
about 40 basis points better, but it wasn't all about putting dollars of risk margin in, if that
makes sense.

Hi, Pat. It's just a very quick one. Your combined ratio for 2017, it doesn't include the
