Thank you. Hi there, good afternoon. Two from me please. So ﬁrstly, I noticed the
underlying claims ratio adjusted for run-oﬀ whether large losses improved by around 2
percentage points year-on-year. I wondered if you could provide some detail around that
improvement, which is a little surprising -- surprisingly good that is, given that the more
adverse trends we've seen at this [ph]?
And secondly, please, could you walk us through the thinking behind the new dividend
policy, I mean given limited capital requirements for growth and a strong starting point for
Solvency II, I guess you could have gone higher than the 70% minimum payouts. I
wondered if you're just building in some ﬂexibility here. Thank you.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

I think that you should be very careful with judging the claims ratio in one quarter. It is too
sarcastic to some extent and if you do it just one quarter, there will be that by accident we
have somewhat better claims ratio than our peers, but yeah, and we have done a lot to
improve our claims ratio during the last couple of years. And we think that this is a trend
of a better risk selection that we may see now.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Regarding the dividend policy, it has now been stated and I think it's important to say that
the Board out of Denmark has maintained the disciplined approach to capital
consumption, so that unnecessary buildup of capital should be avoided. When this is
supplied with a statement of a payout ratio of 70%, you can say that it's a (inaudible) at
least 70% that is, may be regarded as cautious, but we still are only one quarter ahead,
but I think you should focus on the ﬁrst statement rather than the last.
I think that it could end up being higher, but basically you can say if we don't have
anything else other requirements in terms of increased solvency capital or increased need
for other purposes, we don't want to accumulate the capital. So in that sense, you might
say conservative.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you for that. Just a quick follow-up on the ﬁrst question. Do you think that the
prices you're putting through are enough to sort of oﬀset claims inﬂation from it, so the
better risk selection trends that you're mentioning should result in a sustained some sort
of improvement in that underlying combined ratio?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

This question is something that some of our competitors has related to motor business,
not the least and we are seeing some diﬀerent movements in motor. We do see an
increased claims in comprehensive where it seems as if the cars tend to be more
expensive to repair, because of technological gadgets and things like that. On the other
hand, TPL has -- we've seen a drop in the risk premium of TPL. So, and since most
customers have both TPL and comprehensive, that means that on average, we don't see a
Page 2 of 9

Date: 2017-05-23

need for increasing prices more than the price development. So we think that altogether
claims inﬂation will be in line with the price index. We don't see it any higher than that. So
that should be -- we should be able to cope with that.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

FINAL

Great, thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Paul De'Ath from RBC. Your line
is open.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Hi, there. Thanks. And couple of questions as well for me, please. And ﬁrstly, just looking
at the motor business again and obviously the average premium for cars, motor will come
down a bit further. Is that simply due to smaller cars and paying insurance or -- and
something on those lines rather than any change to the underlying claims inﬂation going
back to Jonny's point?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then the second question was just on the run-oﬀ. And the fact that you have got a
small run-oﬀ north in the SME business and any additional color on that as to whether
that's, and what's caused that and if it's a new trend and what we should expect going
forward? That would be great. Thanks.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

I think that the small run-oﬀ loss in SME, it is not a change in trend. It's just this quarter.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Regarding the motor?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Regarding the motor premium, I don't think that we did smaller cars anymore. We have
seen ﬂatting out of this trend and now we see a slight increase is size of cars that people
buy in Denmark. But the changes in prices we have made early on, they have run through
the portfolio during the couple of years and that means that when we changed our prices
two years ago, then we've seen decreasing premiums until we increase premiums again.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Okay, thanks. And on the run-oﬀ loss in SME, what speciﬁcally was causing that this
quarter?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

I don't recall. Seeing what was, it was, yes, it was liability.

FINAL

Operator
Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Vinit Malhotra from
Mediobanca.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Thank you. Some of my topics have been addressed, but I still try to ask again just to get
more clarity, please.
Just on the SME segment, the commentary in the report was very favorable and from your
peers at least we are seeing that they are facing problems in commercial in Denmark. Is
this an outcome of just what you mentioned as the risk selection being better or is it just
you think that completely diﬀerent kind of customer base that's driving this? So that's the
ﬁrst question.

Bloomberg Transcript

And second question is, if I can ask on -- apologies on the motor. When we say that the
comprehensive insurance costs are going up, is it just because those cars have more
expensive technology or is it also some distracted driving frequency related phenomenon
please? Thank you.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

SME, I didn't get the question. (Multiple Speakers)

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

If we are looking on this ﬁrst quarter and then looking on the SME, I must say that we are
seeing a very positive outcome of sarcastic [ph] process. So I don't see that this makes a
lot of diﬀerence compared to our competitors, it may change next quarter. We have
noted that some of our competitors have stated that they probably, they have been hurt
harder than we have on the commercial side in Q1. So to some extent you can say that
we've been luckier than them.
When it comes to motor comprehensive, I mean whether an accident is caused, I mean
we have seen it ﬂattening out. We don't see any more decrease in the frequencies in
motor, so that the -- and we do see or someone is trying to explain the ﬂattening out of
these frequencies that people tend to be more distracted during driving, but it is a fact
that once the claim occurs, it seems as if we have some increase in the average claim,
because of this higher technology, so it's a little bit of both.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

All right. Thank you.

Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Steven Haywood from HSBC.
Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Thank you. You stated very clearly about, obviously maintaining a disciplined approach to
capital consumption, avoiding accumulation of any unnecessary capital, which is very
explicit here, but obviously, you're going to be seeing an increase in the size of -- should
we say capital over the course of the year as you aren't paying out a share buyback. So I
think we've already started seeing this in your investments, your money markets
investment assets have gone up considerably to about 4 billion.
Now I'm assuming this large increase is because you're not doing the share buyback and
because you're seeing continued earnings and large premiums coming in the ﬁrst
quarter. Is there any particular plan that you, because your investment asset base is going
to be larger. Are you going to invest these money market and funds in actual assets that
yield higher returns or will it be a drag because it's only a negative yield on these money
market assets at the moment? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

The main reason for having a lot of money market right now is that we have -- major part
of the premiums are paid around 1st of January. On top of this, we think that some of the
investments we might have chosen to have on the (inaudible) is that they are then on the
expensive side and that means that we have little more on money markets and we usually
would, the buyback of course that decreases (inaudible) previously we have, but it is not
an important part of the -- not an important part in additions with the investment portfolio
we have. But it's, of course you are perfectly right that the, I think we will accumulate
liquidity during the year and that means that the solvency ratio will increase to maybe
200, above 200 for the year-end.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

We are not getting more risky on our investment side, just because we can't keep more
money this year. There should be a hand for the payout.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Okay. I understand. Thanks very much.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jakob Brink from ABG. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

FINAL

Thank you. I just have one more question, sorry, coming back to the motor. If I look at the
risk premium as you mentioned on page four in the report, it actually looks like the
improvement is somewhat larger than 30 basis points, you said 2.176, down from 2.22 last
year. So I guess that's due to reserve leases being lower this year. Is that correct? And is
that actually the underlying improvement in the motor segment closer to 2% rather than
30 or something else impacting?
And then also just on the dividends, you're mentioning that we should focus on the ﬁrst
bullet that you will not have unnecessary capital. I'm not quite sure I understand what
exactly you mean then. So should we actually just like always put in sort of a Topdanmark
capital model where you pay out basically net proﬁt for the year, adjusted for just growth
and issuance of employee shares or what exactly do you mean by that? Thank you.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

To answer ﬁrst one, you are completely correct that the risk premium is down by 2%, but
the premium is down by close to 2%.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay. Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Well Jakob, distribution policy, the policy as I said -- is as I said, a disciplined approach to
capital consumption. What I'm saying is that if you were, if someone were to state that we
would only pay out 70% going forward, that would mean that we accumulated 30%
capital over the years. And if I don't know what I should use it for, I'm not going to do that.
So I can't tell you exactly year-by-year how this is going to fold-out, but I can deﬁnitely tell
you that if we don't have any purpose for this capital, we will pay it out.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

And just to add, there is nothing that points in this direction of increasing this year.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Does not, sorry that points in what?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Points in the direction of increase in this year going forward.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Our model is same in ﬁve years, as it is now.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

So basically the reason why you put 70% and not 90 or something, is that you don't want
to see too big a drop in the dividend in case of a bad year or how should we interpret
that?

FINAL

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

You can interpret it as a conservative approach to the fact that at some point in time you
might risk facing some other option, some other possibilities that you could then pursue
without changing your dividend.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Per Gronborg from SEB. Your line is
open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Yes, thank you. I have two questions. I hope it's okay if you take them one at a time. If I
look at your quite big combined ratio guidance improvement, 2 to 3 percentage point.
That seems to be more than can be justiﬁed by Q1. Does this also reﬂect that you are
seeing maybe some improvements out on the marketplace could be on the commercial
side, where you have wrote this quarter where you probably are seeing Protecta trying to
restructure their business (inaudible) clearly having to look for proﬁtability. Any signs of
that or is the sales guidance solely related to the Q1 outcome?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

It is mainly related to the Q1 outcome, but there is a slight improvement in our forecast as
well. We have further [ph] usual Internet problem.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. Then my second question is related to an issue that's been touched on a number of
times on capital. You state that the payout will be minimum 70%. You state that you want
to remain disciplined on capital. On your new board, with the new composition of the
Board, how have the discussions been on capital? Are they solely been based on the
Solvency II ratio or have they also been based on other measures?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

I mean, the dividend policy has been approved by a uni -- a totally agreed board, so the
discussion has not been very long.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Page 7 of 9



Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity
Date: 2017-05-23

And would you have also only promised to payout 70%, that's not a big promise for a
company that over the last four years and obviously have paid out clearly more than
100%?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

FINAL

That's why I emphasized the word, minimum or at least.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. Any chance that, maybe at the next conference call the Chairman of the Board
would be willing to participate and give us some more insight to where the Board is. I
think one of the key concerns out of the marketplace is that the Board and the
management of Topdanmark might not fully agree on future payout?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

I'm pretty sure Per that you will not receive any answers diﬀerent from what we are stating
here. I think that there is a full alignment in the Board of Managers and Board of Directors
on the policy and the understanding of the two points, meaning disciplined approach to
capital consumption minimum 70%.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay, thank you.
