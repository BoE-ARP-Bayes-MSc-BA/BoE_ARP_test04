Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much for attending the Telecom
Conference by Sompo Holdings tonight. From this point onwards, we would like to invite
Mr. Shinji Tsuji, the Group's CFO, to come and give us a presentation for about the first 15
minutes, and then we will hold a Q&A session afterwards in Japanese. This telecom
conference is planned to last 60 minutes.
Before we begin the telecom conference, we would like to give you a word of remarks
for what we're about to explain. We might be talking about some forecast based on the
assumptions at this point in time, and those forecasts will include some risk as well as
uncertainties. To all of the investors, may we inform you that our forecast may differ from
the actual results.
Now, Mr. Tsuji, please begin your presentation.

Shinji Tsuji

{BIO 16148256 <GO>}

Yes. I am Shinji Tsuji, Group CFO of Sompo Holdings. Thank you for taking your time to
participate in our conference call despite the short notice. Before starting, I'd like to
mention the fact that we've changed our company name to Sompo Holdings from this
month. We ask you for your continued support.

Now, I would like to talk about the acquisition of Endurance by Sompo Holdings. And then,
following my presentation, we would like to take your questions. Please note that the
presentation material has been uploaded onto our website.
So, allow me to start from page two. Today, we agreed with Endurance Specialty Holdings
that we will commence procedures on the acquisition of Endurance, a Bermuda-based
specialty provider of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance. The total
transaction value was ¥637.5 billion, which represents 1.36 times book value per share.
Going forward, we expect to complete the transaction by around February 2017, after
obtaining approvals from Endurance's shareholders and regulators as required. Endurance
is a specialty insurance group who have both insurance and reinsurance capabilities
providing risk coverage from their offices in the U.S., Bermuda, and other locations.
Endurance has achieved strong premiums growth and profitability led by the senior
management team including British CEO, John Charman, who all have many years of
experience and established track records.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, by welcoming Endurance into the Sompo Group, it would be possible for us to expand
our overseas business including the United States, the world's largest insurance market.
We also plan to develop our group management by leveraging Endurance's sophisticated
ERM expertise.
Please move on to page three. We have been explaining to the investor community about
our strategy to increase the weight of the overseas insurance business within our
business portfolio, and this transaction is a step towards the realization of this strategy.
Obviously, this transaction would boost the group's profit and EPS, and it will also lead to
the increase of ROE or capital efficiency, one of our most important management
indicators, which would enhance the probability of achieving our Mid-Term Management
Plan.
We expect that the transaction would contribute around ¥40 billion to our consolidated
adjusted profit for FY 2018. Endurance has been expanding the U.S. insurance business,
an area where we could not expand meaningfully alone. We believe this is a great
opportunity for our group to strengthen our business in the developed markets. And as
CFO, I would like to mention that this transaction would not have any adverse impact on
our financial strength.
Although we estimate a reduction on our internal solvency ratio by 25 percentage points,
this does not raise any issues on our capital or funding position, given our capital strength,
including the issuance of ¥200 billion of hybrid bonds this August. And we intend to
maintain our policy around shareholder returns too. We described our policies to enhance
shareholder returns in our Mid-Term Management Plan, and this still stands. Particularly
after Endurance's profit become consolidated within our group, we estimate an increase
of EPS by around ¥100, uplifting the base for a distributable earnings stand initially
describe.

FINAL

Let us move on to page four. This page shows the transaction summary. As I mentioned
previously, valuation is 1.36 times book value, a level that is not expensive compared to
precedent transactions in the United States. And we have been pursuing disciplined M&A
opportunities and we believe this transaction is consistent with our policies.
Furthermore, goodwill generated from the transaction is expected to be less than ¥223
billion. The duration of amortization has not been decided yet, but assuming an
amortization of goodwill in 10 years hypothetically, the annual cost would be ¥20 billion for
accounting purposes.
Please turn to page six. This page is showing the overview of Endurance. Allow me to
touch upon some key points here. So, first of all, Endurance has strength in U.S.
geographically. And as for balance between insurance and reinsurance, the company has
strength in insurance underwriting.

Bloomberg Transcript

Within the reinsurance business, Endurance has stable profitability with a reorganized
portfolio by managing CAT risk. Further, John Charman, the CEO of Endurance, is a
remarkable insurance executive, with deep knowledge in the insurance industry and the
high quality of the management team, including the CFO and the underwriting talent, was
an essential part to our decision for this transaction.
Please see page seven – slide seven please. Endurance has a well-balanced business
portfolio with an insurance business focused on the U.S. as well as reinsurance. And this is
the breakdown. Specialty is the main business line, and the sum of specialty in insurance
and reinsurance comprises 66% of gross insurance premium. And agriculture or crop
insurance produces stable profits and contributes 25% of the total gross premiums,
where Endurance ranks number five in the U.S. market. CAT reinsurance contributes only
9% of the total limited risk exposure.
Please turn to page eight. On this page, you can see the historical trends of gross
premium and combined ratio. As you can see, Endurance has a strong and proven track
record. Going forward, we plan to further expand its insurance business, centering around
primary underwriting while maintaining profitability.
Please move on to page nine. This slide illustrates the asset management of Endurance.
While taking into account stability and liquidity, Endurance's asset management policy is to
invest mainly in deposits and high-grade fixed income securities. Average credit ratings
for fixed income investments are maintained at the AA-minus level. While taking into
account the market environment, Endurance wants to maintain its prudent investment
strategy going forward.
Please turn to slide 10. These are the track record of their profit and ROE. Based on past
performance, Endurance has continuously achieved consolidated net income of roughly
¥35 billion and ROE of approximately 10%. Although detailed estimate figures cannot be
disclosed at this point in time, we expect an expansion in the profit levels along with
growth of the business, especially for primary underwriting business.

FINAL

Please turn to page 12. We would like to talk about the positive impact this acquisition
would bring to Sompo Holding's management plans. We have plan to achieve overseas
insurance profits of over ¥23 billion in fiscal 2018 according to our Medium-Term
Management Plan through organic growth. Endurance's profit contribution will increase our
profit level by ¥40 billion.
As a result, the contribution from overseas insurance business is expected to increase to
around 30% in 2018 from 12% in 2018. In the Medium-Term Management Plan, we have
set the target-adjusted consolidated ROE of 8% or higher. As I explained at the
beginning, contribution from this transaction will help achieve this target ROE of 8% or
higher.
Please turn to slide 13. We have achieved an addition of a meaningful U.S. insurance
business platform through this transaction. This significantly expands the gross written
premium contribution from the U.S. market and also helps to achieve global diversification.
Please turn to page 14. Going forward, in addition to the closing procedures, we will
devote all our group resources to a successful post-merger integration. At this point, we
expect positive impact through mutual utilization of strength in underwriting as well as
improved efficiency of resources and others.

Bloomberg Transcript

For example, we will be able to provide Endurance's high-quality specialty products to our
commercial customers. On the other hand, Endurance will be able to expand its business
through Sompo's network in geographies where they didn't have access before.
With regard to the business in the U.S. and Europe, we expect to effectively utilize existing
business and resources of Endurance. As a result, we would like to realize business
efficiency improvement.
In addition to the above, Endurance is rated highly with a strong evaluation from S&P with
regards to ERM ratings. We will be able to sophisticate our group-based ERM by
leveraging risk management expertise from Endurance.
Please turn to page 15. Lastly, let us touch upon our achievement in global expansion pro
forma for this transaction. By welcoming Endurance to our group, we will be able to
enhance our business platform in the U.S. and other developed countries and pursue
various possibilities.
Specific actions to achieve this acceleration of global expansion will be taken into
consideration over the post-merger integration phase. We believe this transaction is a
huge step towards our global expansion goals and would like you to understand that we
are taking steps towards our management goal to become a top 10 global publicly-listed
insurance company.
This is the end of my presentation. Thank you for your patience. And now, we would like
to start Q&A.

Thank you, Mr. Tsuji. Now, we'd like to take your questions in Japanese. So, if you have a
question, we'd like to have the Japanese audience submit.
Now, we'd like to start the Q&A session.

Q&A
A - Operator
We'd like to hear from Mr. Muraki of Deutsche Securities.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. I'd like to submit my first question. In terms of this transaction, when was it that
you started this negotiation? When did you start considering this transaction, this
acquisition and how did you reach today? I'd like you to explain the processes, the
considerations that you've made, not just Endurance, but other companies that you must
have had in your candidate shortlist, why did you choose Endurance ultimately? This is my
first question.

A - Shinji Tsuji

{BIO 16148256 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Mr. Muraki for your question. I am Tsuji. I would like to answer your
question. Since when did we start these negotiations? Since when did we start
considering this transaction? Well, in terms of overseas M&A transactions, ever since the
year 2010, in the first midterm plan, we have been working on this theme ever since. So
from this year, we put together a new midterm plan, which started from this fiscal year.
And in this, we have incorporated various visions as a group, as a whole, to become one
of the top 10 members in the global companies, achieve ¥300 billion in profit, ROE 10%.
These were some of the visions that we have clarified.
And it all started from Nigel Frudd, Mr. Nigel Frudd, we had as a member of the executive
officer in our company, who we welcomed to be in charge of the M&A. And at the latter
half of 2015, he started putting together the long list, and then narrowed it down to the
shorter list. We started from a list as long as 46 companies, candidates for our target,
then have narrowed down the targets ever since.
Now, in looking at the target of our acquisition, we have some points to consider. One
was, we wanted to increase the insurance business in America, so we had to have a
foothold for the primary business. And then also reinsurance weight, CAT weight, we
didn't want so much of a high weight in these two. Also, the goodwill amount was one of
our considerations. We didn't want to leave a big burden of amortization for the

Page 5 of 15

FINAL

generations going forward, so we had to take these points into consideration, and we
found Endurance at the top of the shortlist. And we decided to start negotiations with
them.
Now, in terms of timing of this negotiation, it was – well, this year in August, we did the
issuance of the hybrid and then decided to do a buyback. We started buying back – we
completed the buyback of the shares at the end of August. After this was finished, we
started the negotiation with the Endurance management members and ultimately
welcomed this day of agreement.
Why did we choose Endurance? Well, we narrowed it down from the 46-something list
and we had Endurance at the very end.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

Thank you. Here is my second question. You have some – if you complete the integration
in February, when are you going to start reflecting the result – the actual result on to your
financials? Does it impact the shareholder returns? You said there's no impact at all, but
for a payout, what would you say? This fiscal year, next fiscal year, will there be a
difference, because I would say that this year, there is no contribution. Next year, there is
contribution. Do you think 50% for each fiscal year?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Shinji Tsuji

{BIO 16148256 <GO>}

Thank you for your questions. This also will be answered by myself. In terms of
Endurance's performance, the first quarter in next fiscal year, FY 2017, first quarter, is the
first quarter we will consolidate Endurance's members onto our fiscal reporting. March
end next year will be a consolidation just on the balance sheet.
In terms of your question regarding shareholder returns, there's this original mid-term
plan, which is 50% of the total return to shareholders. This is the policy and it still stands.
With this transaction that we've just announced today for the FY 2015, it was ¥65.8 billion
at that time. Now based on this actual track record, with the capital level and the ratings
level in consideration, we'd like to make sure that we choose an optimum level in the
shareholder returns going forward.
As a result of the calculation, even if the total return is in the 40%s of the percentages,
there is a possibility that it would reach this level of number. But after all, the FY 2015 total
return, which is ¥65.8 billion, in absolute numbers, we will never go below this number;
would make sure that we don't go below this number.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

That's very clear. Thank you.

Thank you. Next question will be from Mr. Tsujino of JPMorgan. Please ask your questions.

FINAL

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

Thank you for this opportunity. First, Endurance, in this industry, is a company that relatively
has a short premium and Mr. Charman has done some acquisitions and he has led this
company to grow so far. So, our managing agent by Lloyd's is a little bit different, because
its history is relatively short, because Lloyd's companies are longer in history. This
company is little bit different. But under a strong leadership of the CEO, I believe it has
grown significantly in a relatively short time, and such a company to join the Sompo Group
and so considering the growth potential, the capability and the growth momentum, do
you think you will be able to keep all those, even if it becomes part of Sompo Holdings?
And the current CEO, who is Mr. John Charman, what have you discussed and what have
you agreed with him in order for them to keep their momentum of growth?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Takashi Kurumisawa

{BIO 21025219 <GO>}

This is Kurumisawa speaking. I'd like to answer your questions. So, first of all, the company,
Endurance, how do we view Endurance? What you have just said is very correct. And it was
founded in 2001. So, it is a young company. However, just in the history of over a decade,
they have had three major waves. So, first it focused as a reinsurance company and they
were underwriting a lot of capturing insurance in order to grow the business. And then,
they were down to ARMtech business, which is agricultural insurance business, from the
latter half of the 2000, and they have been diversifying their business in order to enter
into the next phase of growth.
In 2013, Mr. John Charman also acquired a primary underwriting business in U.S., and they
have become more international. They bought the company called Montpelier, which we
ignited the growth in the third phase. So, those are the three phases which Endurance has
gone through in order to expand its business.
Though it is a young company and also, prior to John Charman joining Endurance, and
also after John Charman joining Endurance, the characteristic of the company had
changed. That's how we see this company, Endurance, not in a bad way, but in a very
positive way. The company have changed.
So, how do we view a young company? Mr. John Charman, as you might know, he has a
career of over 40 years. He worked in the Lloyd's Syndicate. He started the Lloyd's
Syndicate, sold it to ACE and then started Axis, and then grew Axis to be as big as who
they are today. And so this is a career that's behind Mr. John Charman. So, he is a wellexperienced, seasoned player in the insurance sector, especially in the reinsurance
market where it is so cyclical. It is a matter of his caliber to go over many cycles and still
grow the business. And in that aspect, we have our full trust in him, and this is not
something that's easy to obtain as a career. So, it is a dynamic company, and such a
dynamic company be coming together with Sompo Holdings. Would they be able to still
continue to grow in the past phase?

Page 7 of 15



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2016-10-05

FINAL

I would say that they will be able to grow even more so than they have in the past. The
reason why we think that is because they believe that they can still grow the business
organically and they were actually a buyer in the market rather than a seller. And we
wanted to globalize our business, including business platform in U.S., but we couldn't
really do this alone.
However, we did have the capital to be able to do so. So those two companies facing the
same direction and coming together and getting integrated, holding hands, walking
together along the same path, what we can do together, is the topic that was discussed
in between the two CEOs and had come to – reached a conclusion that we're announcing
today.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

So, you said that you'll be able to still grow this business even if it becomes part of
Sompo Holdings, but I don't think it's just because you're willing to inject the capital. I don't
think it is a matter of capital. Therefore, when it's within the Sompo Holdings, what is the
reason? Is it because you believe that you'll be able bring their products to be introduced
in Japanese market, et cetera?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Operator
Yes. Exactly. (27:03) we have a lot of potent or inherent asset which we are under-using
right now. For example, we have a license network, and as we have been a global
business for over 50 years in Asia and other parts of the world that we have expanded
into, we have a license. And then, Endurance is a new company, so they want to be able
to sell, but they have to have the underwriting license in many markets to be able to sell
insurance. And so, we can help them in that regard. Or what they do in U.S., for example,
for a global conglomerate, combined corporate underwriting business, that requires
global license for many different markets. And they will be able to use that, which we
have, so that they can offer businesses to multi-national conglomerates. So, these are just
some examples of what we can potentially do together.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

Okay. Then, my next question is about the total payout. So, over the medium- to longerterm, you said the total payout ratio is 50%, and for fiscal 2015, ¥68.5 billion and you will
not go below that. That means 2015, the adjusted net profit was ¥164.3 billion and it was
the payout of 40.1%. 2016, I believe, the adjusted profit will be ¥160 million and the
payments per share is going to be ¥80. Is it 50% total payout? Then, that means you'll be
able to do a lot of share buybacks.
But you have you just mentioned earlier, does that mean that for fiscal 2016, the total
payout, which is supposed to be 50% over the medium- to longer-term and where it was
40% last year, are you still assuming 40%-ish payout ratio for 2016? And based on that,
for 2017, the adjusted consolidated profit is going to expand. But still, in terms of the
payout ratio, it is still going to be below 50%, in the 40% mark. So, is that the forecast that
I should have (29:44)?

{BIO 16148256 <GO>}

FINAL

This is Tsuji speaking. Thank you for your question. So, about the total payout ratio, I said
that for 2016, ¥65.8 billion, the total profits, then we will not go below that. But the
Medium-Term Management Plan, which we originally (30:10) announced, we will be
targeting the 50%. However, in case we do some large-scale M&A, then considering ESR
and other factors, it might go down to be as low as 30%. However, it will – we will not let it
go below 30%. By doing this, what we have explained is part of the mid-term plan.
And right now, considering the ESR situation, for this particular transaction, it's just being
decided recently. So, we are doing a lot of the estimation work right now. And so far, the
impact of ESR is I have explained, and therefore, according to our company forecast, if we
achieve the financial target, as we have announced, then, obviously, the total payout ratio
could still be 50%.
And I believe, still, there is a possibility of that. But the point is that we will not go below
30% even if we do M&A, that's what we have been explaining to the investors. Therefore,
the 30% total payout, is not the point, but I have said that we will not let the source of the
payment go below ¥65.8 billion.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

So, that means this time, we shouldn't really expect the payout ratio to be in the 30%
mark?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Shinji Tsuji

{BIO 16148256 <GO>}

That would be the correct understanding, yes.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

Thank you. We'd like to take the next question which is from Mr. Niwa, SMBC Nikko
Securities.

Q - Koichi Niwa

{BIO 5032649 <GO>}

Thank you. I have two questions, but I should submit the first one. Going forward, with you,
Sompo, and also Endurance as well, what is your acquisition strategies going forward? I
understand that you've been saying that you have now a platform, a foundation. So, in
that sense, I guess, you still have potential for further expansion and development into
other countries and markets, I think that's how I interpreted it, but I'd like to confirm your
directions. I think it's mid- to long-term kind of a direction, but if you can give color on your
directions, it would be great.

A - Takashi Kurumisawa

FINAL

Sure. This is Kurumisawa and I'd like to answer your question. Acquisition strategy going
forward, yes, to this point, of course, we have goals in our midterm plans and the
numbers that we will acquire with Endurance will not take us to the achievement of the
midterm plan goals yet. And we're trying to, beyond this, become one of the top 10 in the
global enterprises. And to do that, we still have a gap and we need to fill it in. The
transaction of Endurance is not enough to fill this gap.
In terms of midterm perspective, yes, we do not deny possibilities of further acquisitions.
But in terms of short-term perspective, after having acquired such a large-scale company,
and furthermore, for us an integrated insurance global platform is really the ideal that we
like to pursue, which is a very easy thing to say but difficult to execute. I'm sure that we're
going to be facing various challenges that we pursue this integration, and we will be
having to make more efforts. So, it's really challenges that we need to focus on PMI and to
realign this platform that we'd like to establish completely.

Q - Koichi Niwa

{BIO 5032649 <GO>}

Understood. Follow-up question on this one. Now, conventionally, you've said that you had
enough physical strength to invest of about ¥1 trillion. So, I guess that leaves more room
for further investment?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Shinji Tsuji

{BIO 16148256 <GO>}

Oh, thank you for your question, Mr. Niwa. This is Tsuji. In terms of further capability for
investments, yes, we do have more leeway. Now, having said that, I have a few remarks.
This acquisition of Endurance for Sompo Japan is one of the unprecedented large-scale
acquisitions that we have ever made in the history of our company. That's why Mr.
Kurumisawa mentioned that we'd like our best efforts for the both post-merger
integrations. And then after having settled that, we'd like to go on with our pursuit to
further acquisitions. We'll have to hold looking for further targets until we complete this.
And it's not just about the – it's not about our investment strength, it's really about the
priorities.

Q - Koichi Niwa

{BIO 5032649 <GO>}

And thank you. And here is my second question. For this management members of
Endurance, I understand that this Mr. Charman, you have very high hopes for him. And I do
understand that there is a lot more that we can expect from this management group. But
in Sompo's Group, how are you going to position the company, Endurance, and how are
you going to adopt the talent from Endurance? Is it just for the U.S. business that you're
going to have them active or are you going to deploy them elsewhere for them to be
active in other areas of your business?

A - Shinji Tsuji

{BIO 16148256 <GO>}

Yes. I am Tsuji. I'd like to answer this question. Now, as a company, in terms of your
question, there is no resolutions or decisions that we have made officially as a company.
But as we have been mentioning, we are creating this platform so that it will allow us to
grow further, and at the same time, rationalize and streamline our business. We need to

Page 10 of 15



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc

do both of these. So, to think about the role of Mr. Charman going forward, this is
something that we will consider during the PMI process.

Understood. Thank you very much.

The next question will be from Mr. Sasaki of Merrill Lynch.

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

This is Sasaki speaking. Thank you for this opportunity. Just some numbers to confirm. So,
the amount of the goodwill, you have announced some estimated number. So you said
that at maximum, it might be ¥323 billion of goodwill, and can you tell us the assumptions
behind this calculation that made you derive this goodwill number of ¥323 billion? And
also, (37:34) and this amount of ¥637.5 billion, and this amount, you'd have 100% stake
over the company, what will be the profit that will allow you to have the 100% stake?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Operator
This is Murata (37:54) speaking. I'd like to answer your question. So, the total transaction
value, as you can see, is on page four, and so it's ¥637.5 billion. And down below, on the
second bulletized point, as a consolidated net asset, it is going to be ¥666.7 billion, plus,
on top of this, (38:19) goodwill, there are still about ¥50 billion of that. And so, when you
combine the three numbers, then that comes to be about ¥223 billion of goodwill for this
transaction.

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

I got it. As for the transaction value, what do you think about it?

A - Shinji Tsuji

{BIO 16148256 <GO>}

This is Tsuji speaking. Thank you for your questions. About the total consideration, this will
be about $93 per share and that's what we agreed on. This is a listed company, and we
have the – we will have the control over Endurance, and therefore, we have to pay some
premium on top of the share price. And as for the level of the premium, through various
calculation methods, we have done the estimations that we negotiated and we came to
an agreement of $93 per share.

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

So, was it between Sompo Holdings and Endurance that's agreed on the $93 and then
that will allow you to have 100% stake over Endurance?

No. No. I believe you're asking about the M&A profits in the United States. We have to
make an offer to their BoD and BoD reviews the offer and they consider whether it will be
valuable to the shareholder value and they approve if it does contribute to the
shareholder value.
In a longer process, the BoD reviewed our proposal and to the existing shareholders, the
BoD decided that the price was fair enough for it to be agreed by the shareholders. And
so, BoD backed us up in proposing our proposal to the existing shareholders and made a
resolution in the BoD.

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

So, if the shareholders came back and said this is not enough – I'm sorry, this is such a
primitive question, but what if they say this is not enough?

A - Operator
The shareholders, if they say no, well, the BoD members have fiduciary duty and they
have to – they can only propose something that would be beneficial to the shareholder
return. In the U.S., this point is very clear. And so, we are not really expecting such a no
answer from the shareholders. However, if there is another buyer and if another buyer
comes out and proposes a higher price, that could technically happen.

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

In this scheme, this time, to John Charman, is there a binding contract? So, I wonder if you
can tell at this point, if such a binding contract included in the deal.

A - Operator
Mr. John Charman and other management team members are there and basically after
the acquisition, they need to continue working at Endurance for at least five years and that
was also agreed on.

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

Then next I'd like to talk about the business aspect. Agricultural insurance, I believe, is one
of their key product. For example, there is a agricultural cooperative reform taking in place
in Japan, and going forward, in the Japanese agricultural industry, if the reform pursues,
then do you think there is going to be some strategy with the products offering by
Endurance for the next five years?

A - Operator
That's a very interesting area of business. And for agricultural insurance data is vital
(42:30) the agricultural insurance. So, what area or what crop do we underwrite? That has
to be decided on abundance of data and make the underwriting decisions accordingly.
And therefore, if it's a country where we have that data, the know-how can't be applied to
different markets. Of course, we don't have 100% understanding of all the details of the

business. So, we still need to learn from them. But as a profitability, we believe this is
going to become an interesting area.

Thank you. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. We'd like to take the next question. This is from Mr. Otsuka, Nomura Securities.

Q - Wataru Otsuka

{BIO 16340098 <GO>}

Yes. I'm Otsuka from Nomura. I have my first question, it's regarding Endurance and their
bottom profit. I'd like to understand the structure for their profit, so please help me
understand.
On slide eight, there is the gross premium, which is going up in a very linear manner. I do
understand this part. But according to the disclosures by Endurance, the original net profit
seem to have been a little bit different or wavering. Is this – which section? Is it the
reinsurance business or is it because of their history of starting from reinsurance and
expanding to agriculture insurance? Is that why the profit seems to be fluctuating a little
bit? Please explain the structure?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Operator
Yes. Morito (44:19) would like to answer that one.
Thank you for the question. In terms of the fluctuation in the bottom, it's due to CAT,
natural catastrophe, especially in 2011, 2012, these two were the years where there was
the Great East Japan Earthquake and tide flood in 2012. And we also have the Sandy in
the United States as well. So these were some of the impact that have been reflected to
a certain level to the bottom line.
And having said that, after the year 2013, that is when Mr. Charman became the leader
and started to conduct the business. Relatively speaking, it is not reinsurance, not CAT, it's
about the insurance and also casualty that the company has been weighing more
importance on. So, we believe that it will continue to be an area that will expand and
provide stable contribution to the overall business.

Q - Wataru Otsuka

{BIO 16340098 <GO>}

I see. So, is it from 2013, I see the bottom profit is becoming more stable growing at a
linear manner. I do see that. Should I just watch this trend here?

A - Operator
Yes. Yes. That is the way we would perceive it.

FINAL

Thank you. I'd like to submit my second question which is quite similar to the first. Looking
at today's deck, I think slide six, where you have the current bottom profit of Endurance,
¥34.8 billion, and on another page, you have FY 2018 ¥40 billion, give or take, which
seems to be a little bit of a band in the way you described it.
I guess you're seeing there is – will be a little bit of increase in profit. Is it because you've
extended the linear growth from 2013? Is that how you forecasted it? Or is it because of
your disclosure on slide eight, 7% CAGR growth in gross premiums for the insurance
business overall? Are you just calculating based on these numbers plus delta? Just trying
to hear what you can disclose. What is the driver of the growth going forward?

A - Operator
I see. In terms of the growth in premiums, I've heard from the management of Endurance
that it will continue to grow. But this is a relatively conservative number. So, in terms of the
growth of the bottom line as well, based on the top line growth, we may have more CAT,
various elements that have been considerably reflected. Usually, we would have set like
¥40 billion to ¥50 billion. We've heard that from the management, but we have said in a
very conservative manner that it will be around ¥40 billion.

How about the growth of premiums? CAGR of 7% seems to be the average in the tax?
Where are we going to see synergy.

A - Operator
Thinking – considering synergy, I guess you're still being conservative against past the
track records?

Q - Wataru Otsuka

{BIO 16340098 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Operator
From FY 2013 to 2015, where Mr. Charman was leading, the growth has been over 10%.
So, if you ask us if this 10% level will continue, we would have to say with stability that 7% is
more realistic. That's why we mentioned 7%, excluding synergy.

Q - Wataru Otsuka

{BIO 16340098 <GO>}

I see. Understood very well.

A - Operator
We are approaching the time to conclude the telephone conference. So, I would just like
to take one more question before we conclude. If you have a question. The operator is
asking for questions from the Japanese audience.
